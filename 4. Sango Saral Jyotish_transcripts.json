    "title": "07 Objections Against Astrology Addressed ｜ Sango Saral Jyotish [Ge6_-z21nZA].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, listen to this video completely, if you are on this channel then that means you have curiosity, want to learn about astrology or just curiosity, I am preparing a very strong base for you, six to seven objections which are made whenever a person is interested in astrology.  One of your closest relatives or friends within the family is learning these things. These things should be discussed on social media or somewhere else because there are many astrology channels, all of them are in technical teas.  Let's go and teach, my teaching will also start, but right now I am preparing the land before sowing the crop like a farmer, so some of my initial videos will prepare that land so that you can get very excited and learn well, so what are the objections?  -What are the problems in doing astrology initially because there is a dog behind it? Dog is an English word. Okay, about astrology, the biggest problem in our astrology is this.  Unlike all other professions and professions, you know that there are thousands of likes and professions, here the profession and the professional have got mixed in such a way, that is, there are two things in astrology, one is an astrologer, astrology is a human being and one is whatever study it is.  Whatever study is done, if these two are mixed, then here if the astrologer is useless, he is a robber, he is coming, it is nonsense, of which there are many, then it has been spoiled by that.  An example of this is like there is a doctor who did not know how to put a needle, committed negligence and not out of complacency, did something wrong, then we keep that doctor separate from medical science, we say that medical science is its own thing, it is a very good thing.  Doctors are very good, there are good ones, there are average ones and some are bad too, so when we see bad doctors, we do not call them bad. Yes, this incidence is more in astrology, but I am telling you here.  I want that every person deserves the astrologer and she gets, this is also one but that word has come in it, now science, now we will say this is science, will you be told like this and there is a lot of argument on this, that report has come, one more hello friends, this is Dhruv.  Rathi he keeps making Sir Namaskar friends, this report has come, anyone can do this and post the report. It has said that our planets do not have any effect there and these people are saying like this, you too will be told a lot, so today I am telling you in the simplest way.  From  One who teaches, because when I teach, that Shahrukh's Jawan type dialogue, I feel like killing when I become an astrologer because I become many things, then it is okay, then the good ones will not be able to stand ahead, this is the only observation of this.  It is a simple thing, whenever you are told like this, this is science then know that the planet affects gm1 m2 up r s r is so high m1 is there you are, you should say yes, this is not science, yes this is  It is not science, yes, what is it? Then he said, it is the story of grandparents, it is the story of grandparents, it is like a game, in it they say elephant, they say camel, they say horse, so is it elephant, camel, horse, is there anything symbolic there?  He makes two and a half moves, which horse makes two and a half moves, the queen goes like this, which queen goes like this, in which game where the king makes only so many moves and the queen is playing the game, isn't it symbolic, all of you planet?  Consider it symbolic too. If you want to put some other name in place of these, I say call this Elephant, call this this, call this this, call this, this is a game, you have to play, so go today, when you will join me on this journey and  You will be connected for many days and watch all the videos, then you will understand what it is, but in the beginning, we get into this debate and this is such a huge knowledge that we have to even try to start learning it.  No, I am speaking knowledge, now tell this knowledge, tell it a story, tell it chess, tell it a game, say whatever you want to say, now there will be so much discussion and energy on this, learn it, no, you tell me one thing, if you do not know what glucose is.  You don't know what calories are, what joules are, you do n't know how that food is digested and where it goes, where it stores energy, but if you are doing exercise and your weight is getting better.  it is visible No, you are getting benefit, you don't know anything about what happens behind it. If you are hitting the setup then which app is made, how is the muscle made, what is this, what is that, do n't you know, no problem, not everyone knows.  So what will you do when you come to know, only when your headache is very severe then you take whatever medicine is related to it or do you first say that I will do research on this, how does science work, science is that.  There is some medicine prepared, someone told me  If you do this then you are the one who is facing problems in his life or is facing real problems and when there are no answers anywhere outside, people come to the astrologer last, no one comes first and like lawyers and doctors.  No one goes near with joy that the doctor has come today just like that to ask about your well-being. Similarly, no one comes to an astrologer. Here, you have become relaxed, now you don't have to argue with anyone, now no one will say anything.  You prove it, you prove it, tell me, this is my consultation fee, for proving it, you tell me, I will take some money for free, I will not tell you, but if you turn out to be wrong, then I will turn out to be wrong, even if I turn out to be wrong, the money is gone, I will not return it because this is deceit and curiosity.  So, what is happening inside you is to prove astrology wrong, to understand this thing, I do n't understand why this is actually happening to the people, what is the problem of the middle class people, especially the poor and the poor.  Amir, I will tell you in separate videos in the future, this is going to be a deep video, understand that these kind of things will come upon you and I am also telling you what answer you have to give, this is the answer that you have to calm down, you have to tell me.  I will take the money of people, I will prove that he is a human being or someone like this in Maharashtra, some astrologer will come and show his magic game, I will give this much one lakh one lakh in reward, 3 Hajj and brother whose ability to show the same earns in crores.  They are yours, they will not come in lakhs and there is no need to show anything. If everyone knows about something, then what will be the power? If everyone has that van, then it is a race among people. This is an enemy country. You are here, he has acquired some weapons, he has acquired a ship, he has acquired F16, he has taken Rafale, now brother, now this is here, now this is above, now if he takes something, then this one will not have its value, then if you want to take something else, then you  Do you know something? No one else knows about it. This is the power. So, not this. You tell me, you tell me, you tell me. Has any person heard you? You are a very good cook. We can cook food and tell you, it will not cost money, no, you can show yourself.  Tell me why but if your food doesn't taste good then tell me your money has been lost, that's why people come and say like this, you show me, prove it, why are you getting emotional, do you know anything, yes, say no, it is grandparents' food, yes.  all of you are [ __ ]  You make fools. Yes, yes, they make fools. Even grandparents used to make fools. They used to make fools by listening to stories about what fairies are. Some have seen ghosts. Some have seen those stories, but the child could fall asleep after listening to them. Nowadays. No one tells about the grandparents, but there was a time when someone might have heard it or someone might have heard that this is how those stories are told, were they in actual form, but that child used to fall asleep happily after listening to it, so that's it.  This is life, what is life, life is also a story, your story is your story, if someone takes it away then you are here, do you have a name, do you have a name, are your parents' names, is your family, are you born somewhere like this, tell your story in 100 words.  Even if one lives for 100 years, all stories are stories. You understand that these stories only make us sad, some stories make us happy. If you want happiness then come and learn to tell stories, learn to read, learn patterns, in the midst of science and wine.  Get involved in science. Those who want science, in which 12th class have you done arts? You are passing BA with difficulty, then you are doing science and after doing science, which one did you send to Chandrayaan and which one did Chandrayaan go there?  Look at what they have here, here, here, here, here and here. Go and see the real scientists who sent you, in whose name you are creating trouble on astrology, they are real scientists because they are real.  The definition of a scientist is that he is always curious and he is not ready to learn. This is science. Science progressed only when man did not accept that thing and kept curiosity and curiosity. When you stop that curiosity or not, this is what happens.  Can't be nonsense then you are not a scientist brother a good scientist will always be open lot of doctors are doing very nice in medical astrology when  If we go ahead, we will learn and what exactly is the benefit of astrology, I will tell in the end and you all have to answer the same. Next topic will come that people will trap you by telling you that there is destiny, isn't it destiny, everything is destiny, everything is destiny.  If there is some destiny then there is no need to work and if you do not work then nothing will happen then how can it be like this, if there is no need to do anything then destiny is destiny and freewill in itself is very wonderful and big.  This is a topic, this question is always asked. Separately, the preparation that I am doing for you, I was telling you that I am preparing the crop and preparing the land before sowing, so a video will be made on Freewill and Destiny, beyond that.  The answer will be given separately but this will also be asked to you, it is very common that if it is like this then it will happen like this, then some person should do something, it has to happen like this brother, we believe in ourselves, our hard work is due to human destiny.  fate and  There are many such dialogues, there will be clarity on that, that will be the next topic, many such things have started on the fourth day, tell me, this is not astrology, this is astrology, when will this war between Ukraine and Russia end, this when will Israel and Hamas end?  World Cup is about to be held, tell me who will win the World Cup and last time I saw they called so many people on TV, hey, I told you, these astrologers are playing the games of drunkards, astrologers are ill-mannered astrologers, so with this you have defamed astrology. Because they are like this, this is astrology, will India win the World Cup or not? They are telling the future of India, how are they telling the future of India? They gave birth to India on 15th August 1947. Was India there on 15th August? Born on 47th, he is a human being and a living entity. He was born before that and India did not exist. Then you are 15000 20 thousand years old, Sanatan Dharma, threatening so and so. What story do you tell?  Brother, there are a lot of astrologers, unfortunately there are a lot of them and this is because quite silently it is being taken advantage of and those people who say, brother, this is a dish, learn to make it, the kheer will be made like this, then do a taste and if it is tasty.  Even after learning a little, the teacher was an idiot, this dish was also useless, the recipe was also useless and all this is nonsense, do it in a minute, you are putting so much effort in discussing it. Put a little effort in learning and there will be a smile on your face and you will enjoy it, then you will not feel like getting into an argument with anyone. Yes, it doesn't work, friend, just leave it, why don't you do it, why do you keep coming again and again because from inside you feel that  There is something, he took advantage of it, he took advantage of it, why would you convince me, why do you have to do convention, why do you have to prove me by proving me, live your life, live your life, take consultation, but if there is no benefit, then if it does not work, then the money is lost, watch the picture. Aamir Khan 's last picture Lal Singh Chaddha was not a hit, people did not enjoy it, so the money was lost, now who will give? You went to eat somewhere.  You ordered a pizza somewhere, you ordered a mocktail somewhere, you drank juice, the money was wasted, who will guarantee that it will taste and someone takes away the taste from it, if someone doesn't like it, it is like this, only like the services.  You went somewhere and said, give me a haircut, he did not give a good haircut, next time don't go to him, go to a good one, then you have to relax, you are not getting anything, someone is saying that this is how any lawyer speaks or not.  I will win the case. The doctor tells you, no, your operation will definitely be successful. Brother, it may not happen, it may not happen, it may not happen, nothing can happen, then why would he give such a guarantee? The guarantee is only for one thing, everyone else will go away from this world.  someone is taking guarantee  So the one who is fooling you can be anyone and do astrologers fool? Yes, but doctors also fool, lawyers also fool, teachers also fool, professors also fool everyone, there are fools in every profession and so on.  You husband makes your wife, wife makes your husband, mother-in-law makes your daughter-in-law, your parents make your children, some make their girlfriend, some make their girlfriend's boyfriend. So all this is going on in the system, so let's go ahead, what is the biggest thing about the astrologer, one more thing is said by the astrologer that brother, if you know so much then why don't you become rich, you can predict the stock market yourself.  Make a match, you do that, make a prediction like this, why do n't you become rich, why don't you become rich, friend, tell me, why don't the professors who teach in IIT become rich, their students also become rich? Let's go, he became the CEO of Jaja, so and so became the package of 50 lakh 1.5 crores, this one got a package of this much from IT Kanpur, this one got a package of this much from some professor, have you read the package from the same professor, why is there no package from him?  The answer is brother, it is not that these things are predicted, these stock market are non-living things that are happening and what is the biggest problem in this, which is my sixth point which is the biggest problem and you have to make it a game of prediction.  It is said that if your future is predicted very well then you are living a very bad life. I am telling this also because if someone is a drunkard, it is okay, what is the point in predicting his life, brother, it does not work.  He keeps on drinking alcohol and destroys money in the house. If he will be destroyed then you can easily predict it. You do n't even need to become an astrologer. You don't need to look at any chart. His actions are visible. That is, the one whose life is very easy.  This is going to be predicted, then let me explain about free will and destiny. You will understand it in the best way. You have already told me about the past. Oh, then there is the future. Neither has God given you anything nor has God given you anything in your hands.  If you have given it to me, then he will explain the thing in the best way, then what is the benefit of it, brother, then you have told me so much story, then why should I learn, why should I, you have subscribed the channel, why have you come in life to learn further in the videos.  Two things are limited, your time and energy, if someone can save you that brother, this job is not for the government, it is not your job, it is like this of yours, you don't want to be attached to the government and even if you have got it, even if there is opposition, then you have done it 10 times. And happiness is not so little, now you will say that it is nonsense, hypocrisy, then apply for three rupees, give the exam three times, give four, give six, if you give five, then you will stop at six, otherwise these UPSC people are giving it.  12 12 12 12 Giving it 12 times Giving it 14 times No Prelims were cleared No I was cleared Take a little help I am not saying go to real space and hang on to it, keep doing this to leave immediately Yoga: People ask about going abroad. People ask about going abroad. Hey, anyone who wants to go abroad will go. It's like, keep going, Munna Bhai, keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going.  The question will be: Will you be able to go there and be happy immediately? Will it suit you? So it is something like that and another thing also. How will my daughter's marriage be, my dear Guruji, how will my daughter's marriage be? There is no need to show the horoscope, just tell me.  I will not give it, if you had seen it, I would have felt a little better. I said, tell me how old is your daughter. Yes, she has studied very well for 24 years. Yes, how is she looking, she is straight, very beautiful, is it normal or not?  A little below normal. These mothers love all the children but these mothers are a little realistic when they talk about all these things like marriage and marriage, yes it is normal, okay normal or a little below that, it doesn't matter much, she does a job like this.  She does n't care what time she sleeps and wakes up. You know about today's children, sometimes they stay up all night, do n't know what mobile and all this, at 8:30, sometimes at 9:30, like this and she is very big like this.  By acting like this, I am telling you that I am real, just like I said, I know how to cook well. O ji, you know these days, I said study, you are not studying, you must be studying, and you are not even doing a job, and so. I don't even wake up and don't even know how to cook. Now am I being sexist in saying this or am I not a male shamanist? If you don't wake up after sleeping then what will you do next? Perform aarti. How will the marriage go well if it continues like this? Now there is a need to look at the horoscope.  you tell me your horoscope  You need to see one month of someone's own or your child's or someone's day and month. Note down what is going to happen to them after six months and what is going to happen in two years. You can tell without even looking at the horoscope.  Whatever his date of birth, he wakes up late, does nothing, wastes his time, what is his future and people come and ask about his future, why am I telling this, then I am telling this because astrology is For the Intelligent Donkeys  It is not for Visakh Nandan, it is not for you in life because it has great knowledge and it was never made for the common man, it was only for the special man and even today I want to tell this for the special man.  I am and you will learn it yourself, only then you will be satisfied that yes, because it is not like that, like doctors, that everyone should have medical treatment and a poor man cannot afford it, then brother, then the doctors will form the government and the government will  There will be hospitals and that too is a basic right in India, but there is nothing like that in astrology that brother of astrology is right, that is why they are in trouble because now that poor person would be the good one, who would know everything, think for yourself.  Look in astrology or among doctors, the one whose hands are very accurate, performs good operations, has good knowledge, he is earning big money in a good hospital, he is not engaged and still there is compulsion that  Is there any check and balance of the government that you have to do so much and it is so strict and there is no limit, there is no one above you, there is nothing in astrology, even the government does not say whether one should go to an astrologer or everybody has a right.  For if someone is accused then he should get a lawyer then whether it is good or bad he should get someone then it is not so in astrology then why every buddy  If someone wants an astrologer, then a good astrologer will come for cheap. Sometimes, for the sake of charity, he does free classes, does webinars, does workshops. It is his wish, and all that astrologers do is good and that too has to be done.  Took ₹ fee ₹ Took notional fee 00 Took notional fee Took other wise brother only rich people afford this and when a rich person does that  Advertisement doesn't work or doesn't work. Have you ever seen those who have it in their hands and the big politicians and even the politicians who are running the country have it? Have you ever seen it? It is not just a religion, brother.  Many times people think that they are showing religion, they are doing vote bank politics, there is something else, the politician never comes and says that the successful one, the good one, that all this is useless, only the middle class speaks, even the poor do not speak.  Jaak keeps coming to get his papers cut, in which place, in this place, please cut our papers, please do this, what is right, beyond that, I will teach you what that is too, I will give you complete clarity because it is simple astrology for me.  It has to be made popular and it can become popular only when there are answers to every question and all the misconceptions that are being raised and what is being said, then the biggest answer I heard today itself is science, no, yes, no, brother, we did not fight.  Absolutely  This is not science, it is a completely useless thing. What is the need of coming? What does it mean that someone is sharing his knowledge and telling a story? When someone is telling the fairy tale of a king and queen, someone comes to him and says, what are you teaching?  Hey, the listener is having fun, the listener is having fun, the atmosphere is good, there is relaxation, there is happiness, there is joy, so you don't say anything to those who drink alcohol, if you go to a bar then why are you drinking, the government bar takes tax.  are lying open  There are open contracts, you don't let him do astrology with him in every exam, friend, some big politician had once said that even when a dog dies, it still hurts, then he said, well, you have done it with a dog.  The world is like this in everything, so if your level is like this then you do not need to watch the next video, you will not be able to learn this thing, only the one who wants to come and be happy will learn it. Yes, tell me, it was a lot of fun today.  Who watched the video completely? Write this video in the comment section. The complete meaning is going to be around 22 minutes. Watched it completely for 22 minutes because when you watch it completely, you will understand and only then you will learn. There is no entertainment here, it is not like TikTok.  Brother, was the video of 10 minutes or four, although I will post only short videos, I also know that I have to take this knowledge forward, so I also know that people like to do a little or a little quickly.  Let me tell you, I will post the videos in small format but on the basis of what I am making, the initial videos will be a little long because if you cross these things then you will become idol committed and say yes, these things are right.  As for me, I am curious for the next one, I am curious to know the destiny versus free will, because when I learn this, someone will be learning, someone will come to put me down, no wife, I have to learn.  So the husband will say something, the husband is learning, the children will say something, the parents will say, the friend will say, the colleague will say, you have downloaded and watched something, you are watching something, you are doing it, so there is no one to tell you something, everyone is like this.  Let there be 12 zodiac signs, there are 820 crore people, then how many 70 crore people come inside each zodiac sign, then will everyone's future be the same? Those two twins were born, brother, there were two twins, this is how they are, there were two brothers, they were like this.  If everyone is being born at one place, then everyone's life should be the same, time is also the same, I will tell you, my friend, I will tell you because if I tell them all in one place, then this will be a 100 minute video, so then  Even if you watch 100 minutes, I don't know anyone who knows that it comes out in 23-24 minutes, but till now whoever has watched 23-24 minutes has seen it completely and is very excited to learn, first I will clear everything where  If you also have it, then for now it is a story, what is the problem in listening to the story, teaching and narrating, it is a song, whatever it is, you take it accordingly, there is no problem, so I hope you all enjoy. Please share this video and my request is to you because we are one, I want astrology to become popular, it has been made very technical, there is a lot of respect for him on many channels, I do not want to say that I am a great astrologer and he is not weak.  B. I am weak and he is great but sometimes a weak person teaches a thing very well and easily, that is why its name is Sango. You people will not get much confusion in the simple astrology technicality, so stay connected, this time you will learn it, ok for sure.  You will learn and I will teach you method wise, what happens many times, I posted this video, I posted that video, you don't know this, people don't know the difference not only between moon ascendant and horoscope, they don't know the difference of ascendant, they don't know that this is ascendant and this moon sign.  Is  And if there is confusion in that, then gradually all the videos will be uploaded, you will understand very well, continue on this journey, thank you very much."

    "title": "09 Planets In Jyotish [fQN-TdUjcKA].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today we will discuss about our nine planets within the Vedic Astrology. Westerners have taken Uranus and Pluto and all these also. What I will say at this stage is not required. They reinforce a little bit but we forget Neptune Uranus Pluto.  We can hold on to our nine and move on. Many people who make fun of astrology say that the planets are few, the sun is not the planet, the moon is there and that is me first.  I have already made it clear to you in the introductory video. Now I will tell you again. Chess pieces are there. Just understand that a horse takes three steps. Does it take two and a half steps in real life? An elephant moves like this. Conceptualize it and understand it. Don't get confused. Do not indulge in debate.  We will tell you about the nine planets and I will cover their individual energies later. This is the first thing about the planets, so first of all we will make it very easy to remember the planets.  If we catch Monday from Saturday or from Monday to Sunday, it is better than late, so Monday's we are Monday, M O N D A Y Monday, Monday has become Moon, Moon will be called Chandra in Hindi, so wherever it is in your horoscope, MO.  It is written that it is Moon and where Ch is written above it is Chandra because Pandit ji made it or the software removed it, then it will be written like this, M O O N will not be found written anywhere normally because if four  If the planets come together then there will be a lot of crowd, so I am teaching you from code to code level P easily, so MO is Moon and Ch is written, that moon is yours, it is fine wherever it is, it is fine to remember the second, it is Tuesday.  We speak in Hindi as Tuesday, Tuesday i.e. Mangal, Mangal i.e. Mars, where dot is written above M, it is Mars and if MA is written, then Mars is MO, O Moon is MA, I am teaching it in such a simple and easy way.  Me too  It seems that friend, I have thought a lot to make a channel, I could have started from late middle school, I am starting from A for Apple, only then you people will enjoy, share, subscribe, increase subscribers, okay, so first of all We have learned Moon from Monday, we have learned Mars from Tuesday, now comes the third Wednesday, Wednesday i.e. Mercury, Mercury i.e. Mercury, if Mercury is in English, you will find it written as M, where as Amy is written, that. Understand Mercury and in Hindi, it is written by B and its quantity, Mercury is also written, you will get it written in full, if you are okay, then this is your Mercury, okay, after that comes your Jupiter i.e. Thursday, Guru Guru, so its planet now.  Which one will be JU Jupiter? The complete English of Jupiter is Jupiter, where JU is written, in English it is Jupiter and in Hindi, 'ग' would be written as the quantity of small 'u'. Okay, so you can understand it like that. Next comes Friday.  Which is Friday? Friday means Venus, Venus means Venus, so where V and E are written, that is your Venus and in Hindi, Sh is the quantity of small U, so that is yours, Venus is okay, then let's move ahead, Shani Shani Shani, which is  That is Saturn, wherever SA is written, it becomes your Saturn. Wherever SA is written, it is Shani. In Hindi, it will be written only with 'sha' and if below 'sha' it becomes small 'u' then it will become 'Shankar' but it is 'sha'.  so saturn is there ok Shani can also be written in full. Sometimes Mercury and Saturn are written in Hindi. I have seen in many versions that they also come in different versions. So Shani is ours. It is okay. Surya has become sixth and seventh. Surya will also be found written here or Sun.  It will be written that S U N will not be visible. You will see S U in the sort. If everyone's initials are in English then initial two alphabets have been taken. Initials have been taken and there is no confusion anywhere. It is very easy, MO is the moon, your auspicious.  MA is Mercury, ME is your Jupiter, Jay is Venus, Saturn is SA and Sun is SU. Now come the seventh, eighth and ninth. These are called the nodes of the Moon. These are the notional points. The North Node is called Rahu. South Node is called our Ketu. Now, this is the back story behind it. Amrit Manthan was taking place. I will tell it in the next video, but today we are only calling it a planet, so Rahu and Ketu are also called this.  They are not physical entities. They are called shadow planets but they are entities. They have a lot of impact on the mind. They have a lot of impact on the mind more than the physical entities. So, Rahu and Ketu are Rahu and Ketu. Rahu will be shown as a Hindi. Wherever Ke is written, it will be Ketu and Ka will be the quantity of A. You can see Rahu Ketu anytime in any horoscope, it is a basic thing.  I will finish by telling you that they are always face to face, so if Rahu is in the second house then Ketu will be in the eighth house. If Rahu is in the first then Ketu will be in the seventh house. They will be opposite to each other. Always remember this basic thing. Take, these are our nine planets, we will run all the work from them and we will learn a lot from them, I will cover them individually, okay brother, how is it, the planets and me with the characters.  I will associate him and explain it very easily. Please subscribe the channel and share like. You guys are on a very good journey. You people will learn a lot when you learn then you will know how it works. He will only say, oh no, do something, learn, learn, learn.  With simplicity you will be able to understand easily and with ease you will be able to explain it to someone else and with ease your life will change. Thank you very much."

    "title": "A Moon Snapshot Technique [bmutWOBqIEg].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today we will talk about the Moon, some snapshot techniques of the Moon are very interesting, okay, it will be fun, if the Moon comes in your ascendant, then do not trust the person whose Moon comes in his ascendant, not that because he is a deceitful person, because of that.  The mind itself is flickering, if he says he wants to go watch a movie, then the time for the movie will come, if he doesn't say it is okay to go watch, then his meaning will be like this and Moon in Lagan, consultation several times, if afflicted Moon.  If something happens, it becomes difficult to give consultation to such a client. First of all, it is very important to make him stable. Okay, it is very important to make him stable. Whatever will happen with Moon in Moon in Ninth House, it is very difficult for astrologers to see.  Will go near one, will not stay near the moon, wherever there is moon's technique, wherever the moon is, its desire increases, check, now with these, understand what will happen, okay with these, you understand.  It's ok and there is only one thing to stabilize it. Whoever does this more than the Moon, brother, give him more water to drink. Intake of water should be less. If the Moon is in ascendant then please drink more water or the mind remains distracted.  Or if you are more fickle about anything, then drink more water. The more water you drink, the more stability you will get, so this was a very small snapshot technique, it works beautifully. See Moon in Ninth House.  Take it, he will not be able to rely on one astrologer, he has to go here again and again and show more and give knowledge and give some more and tell and do like this and how do they do, I will not talk much about Moon in Seventh, okay be a little playful.  He goes, \"Do you know what is going on in Seventh but he is doing it jokingly? There is no need to worry so much. Okay, I feel like eating Rasgulla and there is a difference between whether I will eat Rasgulla or not. Okay, but what to do with the mind, please keep your mind.\"  Didn't you go Pushpa, mind is fickle, mind is fickle, wherever there is moon, fickleness will increase, so see where each one is and cold, also told the way to cure it, give water to drink, if you give water to drink, then fickleness is water, everyone has to drink.  It is because the moon is sitting with everyone, so wherever there is flickering, there is a little more, like this, it will calm down. You understood that there is a cure for everything, so there is no need to worry. Okay, there is a lot of knowledge going on in these short videos very simply, so you guys please like, share, subscribe to the channel, you will find a group inside the comment section, you will find Jyotish Simple Jyotish Webinar Info Group, if you are not already there then go to my group.

    "title": "A Secret About Food , Mann And Control [-A2aura_AgA].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, this is going to be a very interesting topic of astrology. You have to watch it completely. If you like it, then like it. If you have not subscribed to the channel, then subscribe it. If you enjoy it a lot, then share it with your friend circle and family. Mummy ji.  If papa and mummy are listening to papa ji, then there is a need to create awareness among children and in society, there are small warnings in it too, so listen carefully, your mind is its factor, moon, we know this is basic astrology, I have explained it in earlier videos  I also taught you that moon and mind are one thing and moon is also a factor of food which we eat, so if you can control someone's food then you can also control his mind, now that food is bad or junk  In the way of food or in the Satvik way, as they say, as the food is, so is the mind; that is absolutely correct; we become like what we consume. So, if you want to make someone something, there are both positive and negative connotations for it.  This has to be used very responsibly, just like you would keep eating readymade food instead of eating it in the dust and dirt.  You will keep eating food which is made for profit, you will keep eating food made by the hands of such people who are themselves unhappy, okay, if you are unhappy in life and not happy, then that sadness will spread in your life as well, there is a hostel there  He is an employee who earns Rs 12,000 and has to cook food three times a day, his shifts are long, he has no relaxation, he is unhappy, he will make so many people unhappy that there is no cure for him, so the most good thing that I want is for this video  First through the medium because I am telling it according to astrology but in practice there is no substitute to eating food prepared by your own hands because these hands are mine, whether they are washed or not, they are clean, how do I know their status, I eat this food with my own hands  I am cooking for them only, I have bought the food myself, the vegetables, flour and all this, and I am cooking this, this is very significant, this mummy's kitchen, aunty's food, tiffin service, this so and so threat, hey brother, the food of the lady of the house Its value is decreasing in the market and many people say that it should not be done  yes, we do not, we believe in this thing and we do not do it. mostly because of the income, you are not near, mother is not near, wife is not near, many times women have stopped making it in the houses, okay, so that is a big fact that you should control that  Look at the mental state, look at the mental state, the person who is cooking the food, a troubled man, a sad man, a sick man, a little sad mentally, physically ill, if you eat food cooked by such a person, you can never be happy, all our food, all that energy goes into it.  And it can also be seen, how is the texture of the roti, how quickly it is prepared, how is the tadka applied, how is the salt, how is the water left like this, all this becomes known, from the big utensil to the smaller utensil, then to the smaller utensil and then to the tiffin, then to your house, then to your house  When I take the food from that tiffin to your utensils, after changing five to six utensils, till the time you put it in, what was it first, the food that was being cooked, in the old times it was put in from there and put in such a way that it was just here  You prepare it and eat it directly, it does not go through six vessels, so this is also a great technique, consumption pattern  By making changes, the British made us addicted to tea. Here in India no one used to drink tea, there was no concept of tea at all. Now see, in India, tea would be so important that even the son of a tea seller would know that tea would be so important to you.  Just look at the tea, it is okay, tea is in our life, India cannot function without tea, there is cutting tea everywhere, this is tea, there is the tea seller, this is readymade tea, it is in the office, brother, you will have tea, you will have tea and coffee, tea and coffee, like this Work isn't done without it, they gave it to me, now I can't leave it, but what did we drink before this, think about it 400-500 years ago, when the British had not come, 300-400-500, even when they had not come, they would have done something  must be so, what we used to do, I mean what we used to do was that whatever we felt like getting some energy from, we controlled it, so this packaged food from outside is fine, this old juice, I don't know when it got out of the box.  It is put inside, I don't know when that processed food was put inside, now like in a foreign country  You are already eating the old idli, everything is made fresh in India, otherwise you made the batter for idli in the morning and ate it, you took out fresh dosa dough, it is dirty and the roti is absolutely fresh, this much freshness is definitely available somewhere no this bread brute for four days, five days, six days even now in villages or some places in Haryana the milk is taken out or poured like this and so this food is very important you see if your mind is not under your control then you should see that your food is also under your control  It is not in control, people who don't or can't control their food, then the mind will never control it, so when you say that this rich man is eating with great tantrums, I will have this or kado with this and art bread and this juice, this is how we feel  He is choosing, brother. Whatever tantrums he is throwing, you feel that he is eating what he feels like eating, and whoever feels like eating what, he is getting it and eating it, so his mind is not in his control.  You have to understand it like this, how deep and simple astrology it is  I am telling you simply, you should adopt this thing, if your mind is not good, your mind is not good, when the mind is not good, you have seen in families, earlier they used to say that the way to a man's heart goes through the stomach, heart, i.e. one can control the heart as well Women, when they don't see, whenever we are there, we have been invited for dinner, the prime minister is meeting, dinner is being had, the king is meeting, dinner is being had, that meeting of the minds, eating food is very important, you tell this to someone, right?  Invite for dinner, you want promotion, invite boss for dinner, so why invite boss for dinner for promotion, I mean why not work, work more, work a lot, why for dinner, by inviting him for dinner you can turn his mind towards you, did you understand what I am saying  And you will have to feed them good food, then it becomes a part of their mind, food has a huge link with the women who know how to cook good food, look at the present time in 2024, you will see that they knew how to cook well in 1980, they knew how to cook well in the 90s, they knew how to cook well in 2000  You did n't get any benefit from his claping, in my opinion  It has happened, it is not that it did not happen, but in 2024, those who know how to cook, whether they are men or women, their life will be very good, their mind will be under control and they can turn others towards themselves whenever they want, because just  Imagine someone who feeds you very good food, prepared by his own hands, can you ever become hostile towards him? Think for yourself what is wrong, I mean something good, let's say it is potato paratha or any of your favourite vegetables, dal, or anything else.  She made some very tasty Rajma Chawal, you will become exactly like her, you will respect her from within, very good, so when we know this, then why don't we learn it ourselves, why don't we teach it to the children, why do we consider this a lowly job, this is very easy Cooking is a high level job. Cooking is going to be a very high level job. You will not depend on any such thing as Zomato. You will cook and eat food at your home with your own hands. Teach your children, share the video and this is such a Although it is an art and technical channel of astrology, you get to learn everything. You know, I have four more channels, but I put the data in this one only. Think for yourself, 25 years ago, the population of India was 100 crores. I am giving these figures orbital, these are not calculated figures because no one has done a survey, but I am giving you an example to explain that if there were 100 crore Indians 25 years ago, then the people who used to feed them were 25 crore, that is, 25 crore people used to cook food and the remaining 100 crore  They used to eat food, it could be mummy, it could be the cook, it could be Raj ji, it could be the ones from the hostel mess, it could be the readymade garments guy, it could be the hotel guy, it could be any person's kids who used to make food in it for profit.  Is it being sold or is it available at home or is it available for free or someone is making it himself and eating it, what I am trying to say, now we have become 140 crores, from 100 to 140 crores and I believe this That the number of people who cook food has reduced these days, so suppose 25 years ago if 100 people used to cook food in India, then their total job was cooking food, I am not saying that it was their profession  It was there but they used to cook food whether they were housewives, bachelors, divorcees, elderly people, kids, mess staff, hotel staff, any human being, child who is Indian, if 100 people used to cook food 25 years ago then even now brothers  Sisters, I am saying that only 80 or 70 are being made, then if the number will be 140 crores, then earlier one person used to feed four people, suppose today one person is feeding six people, let's say I am trying because  If food from that hotel is going to so many houses, then he is feeding one, two, three, four, five staff, you understand what I am saying, so this is automatically becoming a in-demand skill, that is what I am trying to do This video from Clarity for Truth is also available  I was going to like it because this content is going like that but still I am launching it on astrology only, that's why I am saying subscribe to all my channels like Life Sutra, Clarity for Youth, Real Estate Guruji from Gurugram and  This simple astrology which is being consumed by everyone, its dots are getting more clear that what we have to do, how easily through astrology and with the help of some logic and numbers I told you that brother if your child is sad then cook food yourself  Start doing it or start eating hand-made food of such a person who is a little happy, whose mothers are unhappy, their mothers have to come and say that also listen, it is like this, you cannot be happy for what ever reasons, many times women are not happy  If they have issues then the husband will have to learn to deal with them himself, the kids will have to learn or someone will have to be brought who is a little happy because then there is no use in getting sick because many times we cannot make someone happy, he makes many things happy by crying  There are people who cook it after crying, that is why the food gets spoiled, which you Why do people remain unhappy in normal hostels or places like these? Because one man cannot make many men anyway and the biggest reason, I told you, is that when your food is as many utensils as you want  It changes the layers, the taste of the food gets spoiled, its soul gets destroyed, the less you can keep it, earlier it used to be just like a phulka, from there like this and directly in the plate and in the food it is not like this, in six places in the casserole, then there then  It's not like this, it's going to six places, the question is, here whistles are being blown, then it's coming down, tadka is being applied there, then it's going in the big one, from the big to the small, like this, then in the small bowl, he puts this thing  Understand that this is a very important thing, you people have to share this thing and please like it and in the comment section you will find the Jyotish Webinar Info Group, if you are not already connected to that webinar group because we keep conducting a lot of webinars, so please join it.  Please join, thank you very much"

Those who are engaged, and those who are not engaged, their struggle is still going on, basically you this  You will see that the effort will increase to achieve the same result for everybody, I mean whatever you want to do, be it earning money, earning fame, earning numbers, or being peaceful, whatever you want to do, the effort will increase, it is a unique year, I will also be launching my new channels on other channels.  Videos of the year are being made, it will be a very unique year in which elections are being held in 40 countries at the same time after many years, including India, US and which other countries are there in GK  The question is, you write down which are the big ones, those cycles come sometimes in 5 years, in some country it comes in 4 years, there might be a 6 year one, somewhere the government might have broken down somewhere, the cycle might have become like this for everyone Now it is going inside in 2024, so this is a new thing, what will happen from it, I will make it on other channels, otherwise I will make astrological videos and keep it for the elders, this is to send everyone in the family as well with the help of a daily routine now Their life will not be spent waking up in the morning  I did pranayam, went for a walk, ha ha ha ha, I ate breakfast, slept, woke up, life will not pass, a lot of effort will be required from them too, now they will say what to do, what to do now, you have to figure out this, whichever caste you may be, don't hang on to astrology, these days I am not with you.  In many comment sections, hey you are such a good astrologer, tell me how many seats will this party get, this is not the work of astrologer, don't use astrology for these works, say how many seats will a party get or anything, there are 1.5 crore astrologers.  Say from one seat to 545 or 43 seats for any party, it will definitely be true. Say from zero to 543 and then someone will come who will tell the exact seat count. And if you want to say something roughly, then you know that if you say something roughly, it will be above 300 or so.  Why are you asking such things about astrology in it, in this way astrology shows the right path of God, every year has its own energy, 2022 was different, 2023 was different, now it is 2024 that you will have to work hard and those who work hard will wear out their body.  have to do physical Those who were mental people as well, what is called, the element of froth will go away, the boasting will reduce. What I want to say is that a lot of things which are froth will come out of the system, those who used to get by by boasting, just boasting by talking big. You must be watching that as well, if I come on youtube0, I want to say that you must have seen that two YouTube channels are running smoothly, there are big videos, I also made a video on that, Clarity video, on Clarity on channel, of big bee.  I felt like I have thrown a stone at the hive, but it's okay, sometimes it is fun to do that, you hit the honeycomb and run away, then the honeycomb runs after you, there is a different thrill in that too, so you got that thrill, but what  I am trying to, if you look at those YouTubers, no one is getting any views now, because of the effort, this activity that I am telling you about will start 5 days, 10 days, 15 days before the new year as we enter  The year, that energy, that comes, then everyone has to work hard  You will have to work hard, the result will not be that much but you are not alone, such program is happening with everyone for Disha, you should see it, if you want to learn from one person, brothers and sisters, if you want to learn hard work and this passion, then learn from that person only from India.  He is a very popular and great person who will work hard, you know his question paper is going to get full marks, who is that person, recently his half yearly exam was held, he got very good marks in December and now the final exam will be held in April and brothers and sisters  He will try with all his might, learn something from him, irrespective of party idol ji liking, disliking, not liking, not liking and liking too much, learn that if a person who is a topper student sits quietly, he will still get marks, why are you sitting quietly  Is there any rival who is not visible anywhere, meaning he is not in the race at all, but still he will have to do this and whatever he does, it is applicable for everyone, it is applicable for the king as well, it is applicable for the subjects as well, this thing  I am telling you that the more effort you put in, the lesser will be the result  You will have to try hard but you will definitely get it, just that the effort will increase and it is applicable to everybody. So instead of telling you that for Leo sign, apart from the other signs that you were born with, your flavour will change in relationships with anyone.  One will have to put in an effort, someone will have to put in an effort for money, someone will have to put in an effort for health, someone will have to put in an effort for numbers, someone will have to put in an effort in job, someone will have to put in an effort to do well in investments, someone will have to put in an effort to keep their mental health in good shape.  What you will have to do for it depends on your individual charts and zodiac signs and other things. So you have to focus a lot on this thing that this is how it will be. So don't think that if the new year comes like this then it will be a lot of fun.  Effort will be required gradually, now through this video, those who will come to know in their back mind, then by January-February month, you will get used to doing that extra hard work for 20-25 days, you will get used to it also and you will say  So share this video with your friend circle first  It used to happen smoothly, now when effort is being put into it, then a bit of irritability comes, so brother, this kind of energy will be there, for the first seven, eight to ten months, there will be more noise outside, they say that the one who attracts your attention will also be there a lot, sometimes someone  There will be an event, then a picture will come, then there will be a narrative, then there will be elections, then there will be the result of the elections, you have to concentrate a little on yourself, never ever you should find yourself protecting anybody else else fighting for someone, can be a leader, only can be an actor  Be a cricketer, only you can be a guru, iconic personality and so do clarity, this is this channel. They made a video of the conflict between Sandeep Maheshwari and Vivek Bindra, that friend, it is happening like this, that video is so good, quite long, many appreciations  People who have seen it completely and who do not have the patience to see it completely, well you are doing this, you are doing this, he gave me money, he gave money to that person, so that is you in life  You did not make any effort, nor do you have to make any effort, if you want to totally understand something, then it cannot be understood through shorts and reels, if you are a youth, you are a child and you are watching short reels, you cannot reach anywhere through them, you should remember the end  In the coming year, there will be a lot of such distractions. Please try to avoid them and focus on real things. Rahu's element will not be anything. Now Saturn is solid and real and is not sexy. So, only such work will be done.  You just have to do those things that do n't look great or sound great but are real and take you somewhere. This is the year that has understood this energy and subtle messaging because what people want is to hear something good.  I want something good to happen for me, this will happen, I have told everyone, be careful, just do the real things, don't get attracted by Rahu, so this energy which will be there will attract you but will not take you anywhere, this year you have to stay at the lower level at home.  I am telling you all your horoscopes for everyone, do the cleaning yourself in the house, someone will do the maid  It's no big deal, remove the bed and do it yourself, not everyday but do it as much as you can, organize your house well this year, doing all these things will require physical effort, if you do all this then the effort you will have to put in at other places will be reduced.  It is possible that he may be saved, I am telling you this by giving a hint also that if you put in physical effort somewhere, otherwise the work which could have been done in 7 efforts, you will have to give 95 for it, the percentage is out of 100, so for this thing  For this, get mentally ready and tell me how many people have already felt like this in the last two, four, five days and I feel that this video can go on for a long time, so whatever feeling you are having, do write in the comment section. Dena, yes it seemed exactly like that, you were telling it like this, it seems like this is going to happen, so please do this, in the top comment of my comment section, one of my astrology webinar info, we keep doing something or the other regularly once or twice a month  You can do that four or five times for that  You can join and your questions and queries may also be answered there, you people will definitely get to learn something very good and very soon I am going to bring a membership in this channel, it has different perks and how many people will be members  You would be interested in becoming one, of course it would be a matter of money, that's fine, but still how many would be interested because a new year is coming with new learning, so please write M in the comment section or write members, write membership, write M, if there are a few  I will open that yes, I also want to understand how to associate separately, otherwise that"

    "title": "An Amazing Scorpio Snapshot Technique [Pcyk8YaEEr4].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, welcome back to Simple Astrology, the simpler a thing is done through an amazing technique, the more amazing it is, that knowledge is actually more expensive in life. The thing which will be told by more hyping may not be that expensive, so I will give a lot here.  I am taking it from him, if a 12 year old child, who knows only house and zodiac sign, can also do amazing things, then let's start today, today 's topic will be unique, where will there be drama in your life?  Will drama come from in your life? Okay, drama means, you know, you can't call it pain and sorrow because it is drama, yes, it is called drama, it can also give pain because it is drama, but it is drama, okay, so let's start.  There is a zodiac sign which is called Scorpio in English and the number eight is written wherever the sign of the zodiac is in your horoscope. Today I will tell you two things about this zodiac sign. It is very amazing. Okay.  Wherever he is, there will definitely be drama in your life. Okay, I will also give you the second technique, so stay connected, the second technique will also be amazing and you will enjoy it a lot. Brother, let's try the first technique only with dedication.  It's okay if the fire comes within someone's passion, then whose passion will it come from? Those who are sitting with the passion of Scorpio sign, brothers and sisters, no congratulations, your whole life is drama, drama is drama, something or the other will happen.  Everywhere someone calls it 'klesh' but I will not call it 'klesh' because 'klesh' is like only sadness and pain, comedy will also be there and if you understand something or the other, it will be like this and if your second house is in the second house, I will also give three techniques, I will tell you three things in this, it will be long.  If it happens then it is okay to listen. I have remembered the third one too. I am serving you completely. I am serving you carefully. It is an interesting video. Now if you have Taurus Eighth in the second house then for whom will it come or will it come for Libra if Libra?  If you have a passion for the second one, then you have an eight, then brother, you or sisters, in your original family, there was drama there, there may have been a little tragedy, a little happiness, a little sadness, but that element must have been more like it is not said that friend, turmoil.  -There is turmoil in childhood. Was there turmoil in the original family or at the time of buying assets, there is drama in your life. Something or the other definitely happens, it was not taken from you without drama.  Moving assets, similarly, there will be drama in significant places or there will be drama in short travels or your communication or the communication you do at work through email documents or this will also lead to drama. So who is this for? Ascendant of squares which is in the fourth house is Taurus  You have Taurus in the fourth house, so brothers and sisters, you are sitting with Leo ascendant in your house i.e. the house where you live, there is some drama and  It may be chilly, it may be love, it may be excitement, that is the condition of life, time will tell you everything, it will come to you according to everything, similarly, if 8th goes to the fifth house, then the fifth house is significant in your life in romance.  It can be like this, see six, I have to tell the significant, it will be a long video, so put everything, the sixth house is your work place, okay, the seventh house can be your spouse, life.  There is a partnership, the 8th house of the in- laws is in the 8th house, it is okay, only Aries's house will come in the 8th house, it is good, mother-in-law, father-in-law and all those who are from the in-laws' side or at the time of inheritance, if there is a nearby lagna, then it is placed in the ninth house of father.  If it is there then it will be seen like this, then all this can be seen like this. The second amazing technique is you see this, it is amazing, apply this also on the opposite side of the circle where Taurus is. Whatever thing you have, you will get it automatically easily, very comfortably, Amul Macho, look very comfortably, every person is sitting with Scorpio somewhere or the other, the thing which is in the opposite house will come easily, so if Scorpio is there.  If there is passion, then what is its opposite? It will always be the Taurus of Taurus. Ok, but which house is the seventh, then the spouse will come in the seventh house. How will it be easy, will it be different?  The thing is, I am not talking about that, but you will get it. You can get the spouse of Scorpio people as easily as you wish. Okay, if a Scorpio like you is in your fourth house, then what will be the house opposite to it? What is the 10th house?  Your father's money is also there. It may also be father's money because it is second from the ninth house. Papa's money. Papa's money. Papa will give you the money. Check it easily. Leo guys, please check it. Papa. All the identifications are available to you brothers and sisters. Now whatever you have to do, there are expenses like if someone's Eth is there, where is the 12th house, if Eth is in the 6th house, then whatever is there in the 12th house, then bed pleasure.  Which one will it be, it will not be theirs, it will not be theirs, it is okay, then try that thing or expense or going to a foreign country, you will get it automatically, wherever Scorpio is yours, put it opposite to it. Apply the formula anywhere, formula it will work. If Scorpio is in your second house, then what is its opposite to the eighth house, then from there you will get inheritance easily or astrology will also come to you well. You will come to any knowledge, Alt science also well.  Whatever is the significance of that house, wherever your number eight is, that relative of yours is very stubborn. You will say that it is mine only because of your passion, so in your passion, you only become my relative.  You are of a stubborn nature, you are stubborn, you are a stunner, you can also be cute but you are stubborn, it is okay, if you are a Leo, then where will be the 8th zodiac sign of a Leo person, the 4th house in the 4th house means mommy, mommy, you are stubborn, please check yours. Check it out: Taurus is ascendant, Scorpio is sitting in the seventh house, your wife or husband is stubborn, your Pisces is ascendant, number eight is in your father's ninth house, father is stubborn, your Cancer is ascendant, children are  Why are you stubborn? Because the eighth zodiac sign is in your fifth house. What is there in the fifth house? Children of stubborn nature, it works beautifully, please identification, let them grow up a little, they will be stubborn with you, you say many times, isn't it, all these relationships which are there, maybe mummy.  Very or wife is very understanding, but if you are carrying the horoscope, then she will be stubborn towards you, so don't say like this, yes, the relationship is with you, you are carrying the horoscope. If the energy is with you then it will be with you then today I have told you three very simple techniques, I have told you all these techniques earlier also like where will the pain come from and it is a very good hit, I am fine and like this you will see it on 50 charts.  You have to apply these small simple techniques, then you develop faith in astrology and you come to know that many times people come and visit their friends, children do not listen to many people, it is not that only children with cancer.  They will be stubborn and that is okay and being stubborn does not mean that there is a bad relationship or something is bad, it is just that, it is okay, so you have to observe what the relationship dynamics are, you have to observe them.  It reminded me that after Diwali, this year my relationship course is starting, I have put all my knowledge into it, it's great, it's not an astrology course, it's not just an astrology course, it's a normal course.  If there is knowledge, then you know that knowledge comes from everywhere. Okay, so those who do not want to join it, those who want to join the relationship course and others."

    "content": "Hello friends, today is astrology and how to know your relatives. Which relatives are known from the houses from the horoscope, it is a very simple technique, I will teach you something, you should note it down and memorize it. It is going to be a very interesting video. There are 12 houses. You have seen the first video.  I have seen that the first house in it will tell you about yourself, which relative of yours will tell you about yourself. Self is fine. The second house is your original family. Original means the one who was yours before marriage.  It is a clan, it reflects the entire clan, tells about it, how was the age and total, like the one who sits with Rahu in the second house, you have to check it many times, what is the drama of the original family, what is the childish drama.  If yes, then the first house was your own. Second, the relatives from this house will come to know about the original Punwa, which will include all the extended family also. Your entire clan will come. Third, the house which is yours will be younger.  Siblings denote siblings, younger brothers and sisters, fourth house denotes your mother, mother, mother, it is okay to tell the relatives, fifth house denotes your child, normally children say, but the elder child is okay.  Sixth House denotes your maternal uncle and its technique, now I will start telling everyone the technique here so that you can remove any number of relatives, now I will teach you very easily from the Sixth House.  How did uncle come out because he is third from the fourth house, so if we keep fourth house first, fourth fifth sixth then he becomes third, then third belongs to the younger sibling, then who will be mother's sibling, uncle, this way we can see the rest.  Is the seventh house of your spouse okay? Is the seventh house of the husband or wife okay in the husband's horoscope? Is the seventh house of the wife and husband okay in the wife's horoscope? Is the husband okay in the husband's horoscope?  The eighth house which is called the triple house and they all say that the kinship is visible in the eighth house. Whose in-laws side is it? Now they will say that the eighth house is in-laws. How did the eighth house become in-laws? I explain it in a very easy way. Normally, no one explains it, that is why people are not able to remember. I am telling the technique first.  House is yours, first house, I told in the beginning, first to second house, who is your clan, then the seventh house is your spouse, then the second house from the seventh house of the spouse, if you count seconds because always remember in astrology.  Keep in mind that whenever houses are counted, the first house has to be counted from there, then the first house becomes the seventh and from the seventh the second becomes the eighth. If you understand the simple technique, then the eighth house will be your in-laws's, the ninth house is father's, the ninth house is father's, that's it. People and places and astrology make the mistake of saying that 10th is the father's day, I will clarify that too here in astrology and will also tell the reason why it is not 10th and with this logic.  According to the logic I will tell, many people think it is 10th but many people say astrology but it is ninth, Guru's is also ninth and father's is also ninth. Well, if we see kinship in the 10th house, then father's family should be father's original family. Now if we look at it logically then it is the mother and the seventh house from the mother, the tenth house which is the seventh house, then it should be the father's, right because from you  If the seventh house was your wife's then how can it be your father's ninth house because if I told mummy and uncle the third house then with that logic people would have called it father but the fact of life is that it is your mummy's husband, how should it not be said but someone's.  Your mother's husband may be different from your father, you are understanding and despite being similar, he may be different in nature, your father may be different and your mother's husband may be a similar person by nature, so we are in the ninth house.  Let's see from this, beyond this, I put my mind a lot in astrology, there is a little bit of that, some say this, some say this, which one did you find more logical, tell me, is a person who is someone's husband and someone's father the same human being?  Can his nature be different? As a father is different and as a husband is different. You know, from the ninth house you will see the father and from the tenth house you will see the father's family. What else can you see from the tenth house?  Will look at his mother-in-law too, now will call him mother-in-law  How did it happen from 10th house, 7th to 4th 10th, now I will go on later and we will find out all the relatives. It's ok like this, first I told you the broad details and then we will find all the relatives in the same way. Okay, so the elder brother from the 11th house is in the 11th house.  From the house there was elder sister, elder brother, elder sibling, younger sibling, from the third house and from the 11th house, we should know this, like this will also be in the report, this will be ok, now which relative is from the 12th house? Grandmother will be from 12th house, why because it is 4th from 9th, there is logic, otherwise people tell it directly like this, from Parve house, now let me discuss the combinations of all the other relatives. Okay, 5th house, I told you whose is the child's.  But grandfather is also seen from the fifth house. Now why would grandfather be seen from the fifth house? Grandfather will be seen from the fifth house because he is the ninth from the ninth. When you count from the ninth house, the ninth is considered as a first.  If we consider house then it is 10 11 12 to 3 four fifth house then it becomes ninth house. Ninth from ninth is fifth house so in this way you can see if you want to see the daughter in law, if you want to see the elder sister then in five.  Which house will be the 7th from the 11th house? If it is opposite to the 11th house, then how will be the elder sister of your elder daughter-in-law? Or the spouse of the elder child, if it is a girl, then your elder son-in-law. If he is seen in this way, then it will  What other combinations can you find out? If you tell me, then someone will say in this, who is Nana? If Nana is seen from where, then who is Nana to Nana? Mother's father is mother's house from which house is she seen from the fourth, so make the fourth first.  If we have to count from fourth to ninth, we have to count fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, 10th, 11th and 12th. So grandmother and grandfather are giving the same from home. Okay, so this  Like, you always make your kinship and all this very important, especially spouse, siblings, parents and children, this is the core group of your people, remember, I teach astrology very well in this simple way, this January, when you are watching this on the sixth and  We are organizing a workshop on 2nd January from 5 to 7 pm for Ultra Beginners.

    "title": "Astrological Link Between Rondumal Behaviour & Decision Making ｜Why You Need To Break This Pattern ？ [pzpk3kXJiQc].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, decision making and crying is a very good topic of astrology. It is simple astrology. I will tell you very simply. You must have seen many people who face problems in life. Everyone has them. You know that every type of person has a habit. Crying is inevitable in everything, this is not right for me, this is not right for me, then try to link them and see that their decision making will also be poor because by crying unnecessarily, you spoil your Ketu.  The one whose Ketu is bad will not be able to make decisions and this is according to the horoscope, which I am not even telling you. General, without opening the horoscope, you can see this. In practice, the one whose Ketu is bad will want to take the sympathy of the world and it will be a lot of fun if you get the sympathy of the world.  If you get sympathy and you feel bad that why am I in this situation that people are pitying me and giving me sympathy, I don't want sympathy, that means yours.  Ketu is good, this is also a big sign and the one whose Ketu is good, his decision making is quick and good because whatever you see in life, see the link, see it in your family, try this test on your father, mother, yourself, wife, children.  Spouse or any of your friends or yourself should look at it and see the pattern. If you have accidentally got this kind of nature then please improve it. Please write in the comment section if it is working in your chart.  And in this your identification Ketu gets disturbed wherever it is sitting and an immediate result will come from you whenever something comes up for decision making, not for a big decision but a normal decision which you should take, then you will procrastinate and wait for that.  If you won't be able to take it, you will keep turning while fighting and life will pass like this, then first of all stop crying in life, useless nobody is coming there. To help you, even the decision making in your life will not be yours and those who enjoy it a lot would be able to cry, some people like it, they enjoy complaining, they start falling in love even with the problems, many people are like this. They are very fond of talking about the problems in their life, that is why they do not get rid of them and they always keep talking to them too. See, there will be no decision making, neither about buying a house, nor about buying a stock, nor about their job.  Whether any decision will be taken about the children, they just keep asking, they keep crying and keep asking, the combination of both works in life, this has come to my observation because of simple astrology.  One of the objectives that I have taken for my channel is to teach astrology based on observation of what is happening to you in real life, I do not make it very technical, there are webinars and other things too, you can share your views in the comment section. Subscribers will see the Info Webinar Group. If you have not yet joined that group and are watching it as a forward, then you can go beyond that also.

    "content": "Hello friends, today we will discuss Chandra Kundli and Lagan Kundli, Lagan or Moon sign, this is a big confusion for people, it is a very basic and simple thing, it is simple astrology, I am teaching it with simplicity, just like I am teaching with A for Apple, B for Boy, the journey continues. Primary school will remain, middle class will emerge, high school will take me to college, please share, enjoy, subscribe to the channel if you have not done so yet, watching S.A. Forward whenever you  If you look at your horoscope, the first normal one that comes out is the Lagan Kundli, where Lagan Kundli will be written on the top or d1 will be written in the software. There may or may not be a moon here. Chances of moon being there are 1/1. That is, it is at 8.5 where your ascendant is also the same and there is moon in the ascendant, then in this case the ascendant horoscope will be the same as the moon horoscope and the other wise, whatever is your block, the first one in it.  Which house is that house, I have explained to you people, in the first house, Lagan is written as Ascendant, ASC or L is written, that Lagan is Lagan, that point is on the horizon, 90 degrees to the East when you were born.  Don't get into its technical tricks. Astrology is simple. The big thing is that your passion shows your physicality. Moon horoscope shows your physical space. D1 has great importance in Vedic Astrology.  If yes, then you have to look at the ascendant horoscope, it is very important, the moon sign is there, where the moon is, if the moon is written as your MO, then look, I will use this language, I will definitely not teach it in that kind of astrology, I will show it practically.  According to MO, what is Moon? Dot above Ch is Moon. Where it is written, that is your Moon sign. If it is written in Four, then you are sitting with Moon in Cancer. Now you have understood this basic thing.  It is important, it is seen in cases of transit. Sade Sati is seen from Moon sign only. When you do consultation of women, Moon sign also becomes important. It can also be seen from their emotions. Moon sign is important but still I am ascendant.  I will give more importance to the horoscope, to understand the predictions, to see the physicality of your life, to see it only from the Moon Lagan horoscope, so I hope this confusion once ends.  No for all, I have settled it and given it to you. Now the third thing which is known to the English Westerners is the sun sign with Sun, forget it, I will not discuss it in simple astrology, in our Vedic astrology it is not that much, but not more than 5.  In that, we will not even discuss that brother, if you are on 1st of July, then you are not cancer, no, you see here, which zodiac sign you can be, your Libra is coming out, your passion is coming out, it is towards sunshine. forget western  Forget the astrology that you see in newspapers and it comes like so and so and so and so and this will happen, forget that, I am telling you in a simple way, you will have to forget something, you will have to learn something new. Forget the sunshine, when you this Vedic astrology and this of yours.  If you are moving ahead to learn the ancient knowledge of our country, then please forget it, your Moon is very important, that is the Moon sign and your dedication when you are asked because anytime you will learn.  If you are learning it yourself or someone is teaching it from somewhere, then it is important to know which is my ascendant. Okay, whatever ascendant number is written inside it is the number of the zodiac sign. I have told you earlier also, so remember that. You should know and remember your ascendant sign. Thank you very much."

    "title": "Classification Of Houses In Kundali [jPY4s_poEns].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today a small topic, not very long but this is what creates confusion many times. We will learn the classification of houses and learn the word because what happens is that when you make a rent agreement, someone writes 'Leasey Lizard' in it, now that lawyer is responsible for all of them.  The language is such that the common man cannot understand it quickly, this is the trend of every profession, whether you catch doctors, you catch finance people, you catch anything you want, there will be some jargon or the other. To impress, the lord is inside the center house, this is Upachaya, it is in your triangle, the lord has gone there, triangle house, such additional houses, this and this, you tell me which house is it, friend Guruji, you had told me first house, second house, third house, fourth house.  After 5th, 12 were mentioned, now what is this, so let me tell you their classification in a simple way so that you do not get overwhelmed because it is applicable in every business, be it Chartered Accountant, Lawyer or Doctor.  Be it a professional astrologer or something else, I am not criticizing these professions for killing the style but that person uses some other level of deliberation to sound professional, it can be done easily, my astrology is simple, I am teaching it simply.  You can even forget it a little by remembering it, but what will it be, yes, it was like this, but friend, yes, this is this, otherwise what is that, Na Sa Theta Ka Theta Gamma is like that, once again math becomes like this. You must have been in 11th and 12th that English is visible, numbers are not visible and something else is visible, then the person becomes overloaded, he seems to be the stick of integration, he is differentiating and he gets overloaded, he leaves only Maths or so in 11th and 12th.  I am not able to understand Maths, I left it in 10th class, so I am going to teach it very easily, only the one who knows it very well can teach it easily.  Because in teaching that, my aim here is not to impress you that I have so much knowledge, I am already saying that I am very good and I am teaching it very easily and I am also telling you that you can learn it a little less.  You should know about taking it and it is a useful thing, the real teacher makes you pass like this, it is okay and teaches like this, otherwise if you go to learn any new thing, you will get excessively muddled, so today by making this role, I am telling you very simply that  Kendra Bhav Kendra Houses Kaun  These are your first house, fourth house, seventh house and 10th house. It is here, it is here, it is here and it is here. How are the first, seventh, fourth and 10th house facing each other? These are called Kendra Bhavas. The lords of the Kendra are very important. They are the pillars of life and they support each other. You will see that they are at 90 degrees to each other. Okay, so they are called centers. This is fixed. This is your life.  If you become like this, then you cannot do much with them, they are just like this, okay, then the second class classification is called Upachay House Upachay, you will also hear this is Yes, third, sixth, 10th and 11th, you can say free.  Your will moves only here, rest of the horoscope doesn't move anywhere else, Third House, I had taught you earlier, if you do n't understand then watch that video again or check your notes, Third House is yours.  Hobbies are in your hands, what are your talents, is in your hands or just the sixth house of diseases is in your hands, what will you eat, how will you get sick, will you take a loan, who will you make your enemy, do not join hands or  Fighting 10th house Karma, which one will you do? 11th house, which is the upachaya house, where will the money come from, you can choose, the rest is in your hands, a lot of things are fixed for you, there are many others.  Sometimes people do astrology and basically one thing is asked about free will and destiny, what kind of shape you will be born in, intelligence, you have no control beyond this, you have no control beyond this, it happened as if parents were there, they had face, color was that. So your fix is ​​done but remember this third, sixth, 10th and 11th is in your hands, rest brings your destiny and with these only you can change a lot, brother, what will be your hobbies?  How much courage will you have? How much will you eat? Will you get into trouble? Will you take a loan? Will you get sick from the food you eat or will you save yourself? What job will you do? What money will you earn? Life is largely in your hands. What is there to be so nervous about? Triangle House: This is also very important.  159 is called one 5 na first house fifth house ninth house and whenever we say that this house is in the center from that house it is in the center it means 90 degrees.  90 Counting of Houses I have already told you that if it is 90 degrees then anything is fourth house from someone else then it is called Kendra, so if I say who is the Kendra from the third house then the sixth house will come out and the last classification is Trik House Trik.  The triple houses are also called wicked or evil places. This is the one which belongs to everyone. It is not that it belongs to no one. In the horoscope, there are 12 houses occupying all the 6th and 8th houses.  This is the 12th house. These are a bit troublesome type. From the sixth house you will get illness, enemies will come from the eighth house, you have accidents, any troubles, sorrows. Okay, the eighth house is also related to in-laws. I will teach that later too. If you want to give significance to more relatives, then I will tell you but the 8th house is again a problem house and the 12th house is again the place of age and loss so they were clubbed 6.  8 12 were clubbed in such a way that if 6 8 12 becomes one, then the lord of Tirik Bhava has gone there, it has gone there, you will read some text, you will read books, okay, so whatever I teach you, you do the basics, many books for you too.  There will be no need to read, at least if you watch 4050 videos from me, then when you open the book of astrology, you will understand. Before that I am telling you, you will not understand at all, what do you say?  What is this, friend, which method has become part of the method, Swami, because from what is written in it, it is assumed that a lot is known, it is like just picking up some long thing without knowing the basics, so what can I tell you in simple astrology?  Have to listen, what is happening, what is happening, it will happen, otherwise if you pick up any classical text, you will still get nervous. Okay, so understand that, I am teaching it easily. Enjoy and channel. Subscribe and write in comments if you have any doubts, like, share and request which I will request every time in the end, please increase subscribers in the last 15 seconds because it is a duty that a person is teaching easily, please come new.

    "title": "Classification Of Rashis [-gDGyZrY90U].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, in today's video we will see the classification of zodiac signs. There are two types of classifications and it confuses the common student who is initially learning astrology as to which zodiac sign is it, is it a movable sign or is it of the earth element?  There is confusion as to which is earth element or fire element, so today I am telling you clearly, I am telling you calmly, listen comfortably, make notes of it, it is a 5 minute video, you will understand it well, take a long breath and listen.  First we will tell the zodiac signs in three ways: Variable zodiac, Fixed zodiac, Bi nature zodiac, Variable zodiac will be called in English as Movable char, meaning the variable is moving, Movable, stable i.e. standing, fixed and dual nature i.e. both of them are simple. Now which one are they, okay?  The variable sign is 147 10. Where it is written, it is the variable sign. 147 10 is written in the horoscope because by now you must have come to know that in the horoscope of the horoscope.  Which is your horoscope, what is written inside are the zodiac signs, those are not houses, houses are not written ok and those are the zodiac signs, so the one which is your first zodiac sign, one is Aries in English, is ok in Hindi, four is Aries, which is Cancer in English, in Hindi.  Cancer Seven where it is written Libra in Hindi and 10 Capricorn in English and Capricorn in Hindi This is the nature of all four zodiac signs, so you are sitting with such dedication, you are sitting with such Moon, there is little activity inside it.  It is variable, it is moving around, in this way you can understand very easily, there is more, but for now, this is all you have to understand, we have put the foot of the stable and fixed part, we have committed the types, that is brother, where two five come and  If it is written 11 then the two which is Taurus is fine and the five is your Leo, Leo i.e. Leo, eight i.e. Scorpio i.e. Scorpio, 11 i.e. Aquarius i.e. Aquarius, so these are the zodiac signs whose  If your passion is good, then brother, your nature is a bit stable. Now no one will ask which is good, which is good and not bad. Whatever is as it is, it is the same. Many people in astrology or even in life wonder which one is good. Hey every person.  It is good for me when you match for marriage, Gundi, I will take you to the match, then these will come, hey, which zodiac sign, husband says wife has to go for a tour, she has to go every day, husband says no, she says she has to go to relatives, there is a party today.  Today is my wedding.  Aunt's daughter's friend's mother has some birthday, then you will understand things like this. Now just understand that you are sitting with this, which is this classification, which is the dual nature, which you can say is flexible in a way.  If both are there then they are 369 and 12. Now many people will say that both are better. Many will say that fixed is good. Some will say that it is variable. Depending on brother, according to me, I will take the recommendation. It is the  Situation There are some situations in which 14710 Will perform well You can't say that this is good, that is good, this is good but you have to understand your nature.  As we will come to know gradually in the future and gradually we will learn as we move ahead, but today I am just teaching the terminology, what does it mean, it is like this, so what is the meaning of this term, first tell the term, not what is the interest, the principle.  What is the amount, what is p * r * t / 100, we will do it later, then 1 p r to the power of n will also be the pawn interest, but first let us know what r is, then r. If rate rate is interest then percentage so I am teaching like that then two nature of your zodiac sign will be G three where gemina is virgo j where six is ​​virgo nine which is sagittarius virgo your virgo zodiac sign and pias 12 what will be the hindi of your pias.  At once Pisces is fine, no matter how it happens, it is said that you are a big astrologer, if you forget Pisces then Payas's Pisces is fine, then this is a dual natured zodiac sign.  This will be this category, now there is another category, this category will be one that this is such a category, now there is another category where we bring the elements, now we know what the elements are, whether we speak in English brother or in Hindi.  First of all, I will tell you okay, Hindi and English are one and the same, but I am not able to understand the meaning. Do it in Hindi but I will tell in English because the audience of South is also quite connected. Okay, so you understand these four things: Fire, Earth, Air, Water, okay. Fire, Earth, Air, Water, there are zodiac signs on its basis, so let us first understand that your category of zodiac signs is Fiery, Fiery, not Fiery, FIERY, Fire, so which is the fire sign, Aries, one is F, Leo and nine is Sagittarius, their fire is Aries. Also, the fire of Eris is different, that means the fire of Eris is impulsive, that of Leo is that of King and that of Sagittarius is that of Jupiter, so the flavor is different but we will classify them in the same way today.  For this, remember that it is also a ferry, the ferrymen come to science, if it looks like this in your passion then brother, understand what is the fire, the fire is ok, Pushpa the fire, this is all Pushpa, this is 159 ok, so this is a little knowledge.  There are different flavors in this also but it will not be all in one video, further you will understand easily, today just understand that fire is a basic thing, it is known in basic nature, second is fire, which is called Ardi Science in Hindi which will be called earth element.  of  These zodiac signs are your two, six and 10, two i.e. Torus, six, i.e. your square, Virgo and Capricorn, i.e. these two, I don't have to think while doing English and Hindi, okay if I go with one, it is easy, okay because mind can you know. Think in one language only because it has to translate. Okay, so 10 is Capricorn. Capricorn is Capricorn. I am explaining it very simply and with enjoyment.  You guys, don't take stress, everything is remembered on its own. If you do n't remember once more, then notes are made, then you remember after looking at the notes, then you remember by asking, then with time, everything becomes very easy.  What I am telling you is Ardhi, it is Ardhi. Now what does Ardhi mean from practical? These people will seem like they are flying in the air. 6 and 10 are okay, that is Pushpa Fire. 159, these ones have become practical, okay.  Ardi means connected to the ground, how easily it is explained, Ardi is earth element, it is known to be connected to the ground, it is correct, next comes Vayu, okay, so the one with air force, Vayu is okay, this is Eri, air, the one with air is okay, this is from 3 and Jamana.  Libra Aquarius, this is Airy Science is fine, after this come Watery sign or water or water element is fine, those signs are 4 8 12 i.e. Cancer Scorpio and Pisces are fine then Cancer Scorpio.  And Pisces people, it is okay, now this is water, water also has to be understood, as I told you, the flavor of fire is different, further I will tell you about different types, so this water is also of different types, which is water with four, that is, it is a little  Shallow water is clean water, Cancer's eight means deep water, Scorpio's dirty water, F is water, but that water also has different flavors, it does not mean that Scorpio people, these symbols are good for teaching about yourself.  O!  I have become dirty water, my water is clean, take it literally like this, these are symbols, I told you earlier also that if you follow the logic of first order thinking like this, you will play chess, a horse moves like this, an elephant moves like this, a rule has been made that its  The name of the elephant is Ha Haath, we can also name it as Gajendra, it is okay, we can also name the horse as Dhanno, that too will still work, Dhanno will work like this and Gajendra will work like this, it is okay, those are all symbols, the same.  There is symbolism in astrology but there is meaning behind it, no one understands the symbols, it becomes my dirty water, my good water, O my horse, I am rich, this is what the people of astrology have finished and I am telling here in such a simple way that  Brother, if you are Cancer then the water is clear, those of eight are Taurus, theirs is deep, it is dirty and the emulsion of Pisces is very Mariana Trench, Mariana Trench, do you know how deep the sea water is, eighth.  So whether it is drain water, dirty water, swamp or the like, it is deep, it is okay and that is more, this is an emotional science, so this is the depth of emotions. Cancer people will be very emotional but they will be seen with shallow emotions and like this, Scorpio people.  They are very emotional but they have depth and clarity, they are not visible, they are not understood, so when I go to science, I will tell the zodiac signs, I will explain, I will tell them their stories, they are good, good.  So that you remember and the way Astrologer Ji will teach me, no one will be able to teach it with such ease, there are many experts, there are many experts, I am not saying this but I cannot teach it, I know there is a lot, if you cannot tell, or if you cannot explain, then  Unable to spread, spread will happen. Once everyone learns, if everyone learns, the country will improve. I will improve the happiness index of our country India by 25 points in the next phase.  Years, whatever the government has to do, I will do it alone, I am talking about such a big thing for our country, Jasba is at 126th place, otherwise I will increase it by 25 places, the rest, whatever you want to increase, you do it, okay, I will increase the happiness. This infrastructure or hospitals alone, these jobs, this money, there is a lot of government work, worldly work, business work, but there is a lot in happiness, I alone will raise India by 25 places, this is my mission from within.  If there is a statement, then note them down slowly, please spread it in your friend circle, subscribe, it is okay because if you do n't do this, then the price will not increase by 25 notches, okay, it will increase by 25 notches only if I reach out to people, I go and hold rallies.

It can be okay, I want to say that no matter what happens and no matter what happens to me, we have to enjoy life. Okay, whatever happens, we will tell a story.

    "title": "Destiny Vs Freewill ｜ नियती और कर्म [NVUgI8631nM].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, Destiny vs Freewill, both are English words. People take destiny towards luck and take free will towards karma. So, whenever there is a discussion on this thing in astrology, then people say that if destiny is  After hearing this, people feel that if everything is destiny, then why study, why work hard, whatever is meant to happen will happen. This remains an approach question. Secondly, people say that no, everything is free will, do your work, work hard, then you don't need anyone else, then there is discussion beyond this, I will tell you the astrological technique because if destiny is everything, then don't work, work has to be done. Then brother, what is this astrology husband and what is the meaning in it? Then there is no need, do your hard work, do your work, then I am going to tell you a very interesting technique, you listen carefully and see in which family you were born, it is destiny or this is destiny, that's all. same destiny Whatever happened to you, what do you do after that, your destiny is shaped by your free will, let us understand again in which family you were born, whether you had no hand in your hand or whether you were poor or rich, in which country you were born.  Where is the person who was born in America, now there are more chances of becoming Elon Musk, of becoming Jeff Buzzus, if some Chutku Muttu is born in an African country or if you are born in Syria, then how will you become from there, then it is all destiny. You can understand destiny in a better way in this way that when you were born, you got a canvas. Those who do painting are called canvas, which is paper, canvas is whose color it was, that is destiny, for some it is absolutely cream and white.  If you get it then it is the best, you can paint it in any color, the worst one is for the one who got black color, black color can be painted only with white or golden color paint, but what is not the best paint?  It can be done brothers  Sisters, whoever knows it, now let us understand it further. To understand it further, it is seen according to the horoscope. There is a percentage in every life of every person. The percentage is the percentage of destiny plus free will. Both of them added together will be 100%.  It is possible that whatever is going on in your life in your chart, at 50 you are following destiny, you are getting something due to luck and at 50, you are getting it due to your karma.  Those who are sitting with 50-50 are very strong personalities, it is a very good planet, it is a good ecosystem in a very good time, everything is good for them, then that karma becomes theirs at 70 when your life is going according to the destiny. At 70, you are following destiny, karma is 30%, so this is a very kind of life, this is not a great life because now you are dependent on destiny in everything, this is a weak personality.  Those who have a weak personality will depend on luck. Those who have a strong personality will depend on karma, but there is no 100% karma. You can cap it at 70 till 75. At 70, assume that if you are at 70, your luck is zero.  Even then you are 70 but you did such good work that you got 70 marks out of 100, which is a good life and if you are lucky.  We are running at 70 and very few are doing 30, so brother, we are sure of 30, now we are hanging in 70, your people understanding you like this will not explain us like this, now it will be like saying, do I want to tell you as an example in the country? One of our best examples will say that everything is possible through hard work, even a poor child can become a Prime Minister, you will say that even a tea vendor can become a Prime Minister, one should work hard, then I would have explained that also.  Yes, many people work hard, they also worked very hard, okay, but there was a lot of hard work, my age had also crossed 50 years, okay, but no one knew much, a lot of hard work was going on, but there is a better place in Bhuj.  Earthquake came, many people went in it and there was a situation of change of Chief Minister. Keshu Bhai Patel was there, so this Earthquake coming and Earthquake coming is destiny, hard work was going on but if this Earthquake does not come and this Chief Minister is in between.  Had the minister not had to be changed, then perhaps it was not due to hard work that the work was accomplished, or this is destiny, it was written in someone's destiny, this is luck, this is Yoga, this is Rajyoga, whatever you call it, you can take it somewhere or the other, so understand it yourself, it is hard work.  Should have but this also happened, what happened after that is rest is history, Chief Minister changed because party high command was not satisfied with how that Chief Minister was going.  About rehabilitation and whatever it was, it could be a political decision of the party, but this event happened, didn't this event evolve? Did someone's hard work evolve? It doesn't mean that any hard work in me evolves. Earth Coke has come, destiny was from that destiny.  If something happens to someone, this is a great example, you have to understand and these percentages are also found out, then you will know whose it is, there is no person who does not eat luck. Everyone eats, some eat less, some eat more and I can only eat if I work hard, 100% hard work is in your hands, it is the controllable labels, destiny is not controllable, but one more thing, explain it in the best way. I would like to tell everyone that what hard work you do today, your destiny decides after six years, 5 years and 4 years. You are not working hard, you are not studying, you are not adding value in your life. And  You don't have the capability to add value to the lives of others. You are wasting your time. You are stuck in wrong habits. You don't have any routine of getting up, sitting or sleeping. You do n't have any proper eating habits. So, this is what you are doing. Now.  This karma is in your hands, but these karmas become your destiny, the real destiny was that which you were born in childhood, you did not know where you were born, but whatever you did after that is also becoming your destiny, so yes.  With your free will you can control in some way your destiny this is also a tricky thing so I hope through these videos I am creating a base of you guys very good excellent and from that base you will get to learn a lot.  Base is very important because then I will start when I will tell about the houses, Moon sign, Lagan sign and then when I will start teaching astrology, then these things will not be discussed much, so through the initial videos, I will tell you this thing.  It is very important to explain because otherwise what is this one about astrology which I have posted in the previous video along with the one about objection, in which I had discussed it a little but here I have explained it in details in the example, so I hope you will understand this thing.  Understand it well and after understanding this thing, then you will watch the further learning with equal attention, but these six to seven videos of mine will be there in such a way that they will be making your base, these are the tips that I will give on sowing the seeds before sowing the crop.  I am preparing the ground before this so that you people get interested. Thank you very much for this."

    "title": "Did You Fight With Anyone Today ？ ｜ An Interesting Jyotish Topic [vPLGyNaZQvM].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, the topic of astrology is Did you fight any one today, so when this video is being shot, today is the day, we will know from the comment section, did you fight, I am saying something or the other to someone or the other.  It must have happened to many people today. What is Dwadashi Tithi today? Take this knowledge from me today on Dwadashi Tithi. On the day of Dwadashi Tithi, the chances of some or the other banter generally increase. People have that emotional baggage.  It turns out that there will be a meme from someone or the other, whether it is in the parking lot or when you reach the office, whether it is with your wife in the morning breakfast or with your mother-in-law and daughter-in-law. Now you people will say, these fights keep happening, what is this, yes, they keep happening.  It always happens but on this date there are more chances, so what should you do, first mark it in the calendar, it comes twice a month, okay if it is today, it will last the whole day till night, okay, then this video which is available today people will see initially  It is okay for you to write this in the comment section and now you will see this pattern many times. Oh no no, this is a superstition, the fight happens every day, it is 30 days, everyone, I agree, but what is astrology, it is such a thing, brother, this and that.  You will have to observe, you will have to work equally hard every time, next time you can see, everyone has a patience test and on the day when there is more patience test, due to any reason, there are more fights on that day, then on this date you only have to  You have to do your work and show patience. People will definitely get irritated on you. You don't have to get counter irritated, it's just that the irritation levels will be high. With which people you have seen this thing in identification observation for so many years and also in the knowledge of astrology. And everything is there but we come and tell that thing openly and also do the trial because you can write in the comment section whether it will be for 100% people, there will be a fight for everyone, but not for everyone.  But from inside what is said is like it is very hot today, now someone deniers it, now someone is sitting in AC the whole day, then sitting in AC is like it is cold, today it is very cold, then as if the weather is said then it is very cold.  So, I am telling you that on the day of Dwadashi Tithi, people who are born on this day, if they do it a little, then the pattern in their life is also like this. Yes, you see for yourself, which Tithi is yours?  is the day you are actually born  He too will explain it well some time. This is a little advanced astrology, but I have only one useful thing to teach in my simple astrology, let me tell the people who want to watch it in a little three to four to five minute video.  You should immediately realize that yes friend, today is Dwadashi, it is with us, be careful again next time and when you will mark and on that day when you will see with you that friend, this is happening, this is being felt from inside.  there is traffic  Jam is irritating or wife is irritating or children are irritating or some junior in the office is talking or something or the other. How to tell such a feelingless maid has not come to someone's house on the same day. If there is more irritation then what?  If I try to become someone's maid, I give very good examples of housewives. You all know that if some day the maid is not available for work then she is a housewife.  Irritated is a default setting thing and especially when she comes after leaving without telling, then maybe she is mentally preferred. If she doesn't come anyway then there is irritation. What am I trying to say with this Dwadashi thing that if it is Dwadashi?  If the day she doesn't come then the irritation levels will be higher I hope now I have managed to explain on this example that suppose she dozen turn up  On four days unannounced then the woman will be irritated all the four days but if it is Dwadashi day and on that day she came unannounced then there was irritation here also but if this irritation was 40 out of 100 then it will be 80 out of 100, I just want to tell this.  I am sure that on this day there will be such an energy and such a system that whatever is the reason for the irritation, it will all be magnified. Lo, you mean it will be more then now that threshold is basically the threshold of your tolerance level which will be crossed soon on this day. Take this information and mark two days on the calendar, then the benefit from it is that do not bite more on this day.  You can have too many meetings on this day, too many of your own selfish desires, don't keep too many programs. This is the knowledge of astrology that on that day, life will throw something extra which I will be.  If I am not able to handle, then I should not commit too much from my side to anyone that I will come there, I will do this, I will do that also, because on that day when my own work is not going to be done, if that irritation happens then that.  If I remain light during the day, my day will be better. Please note it down in your diary. All these things are practical tips and spread them in your groups through this video. This real happiness and real productivity is being spread.  So please do spread it and first comment and then follow up that when was the last time, what was the date on that day, so there is no illusion, there is no fear, work has to be done, one has to get up, take bath, eat breakfast.  You have to go to office, all this but what do you have to do on that day, you know it is Dwadash Tithi, that day is coming tomorrow, day after tomorrow, I should sleep on time so that I am not running behind because that is due to irritation.  These are waking up late, not being able to reach office on time, getting entangled in unnecessary conversation with someone, getting entangled with someone over parking issues. I am only talking about these small daily issues, but I am not talking about the serious ones.  If the patterns remain like this then you have to be a little careful, a little not too much and I don't understand it easily. Please spread this thing. Please definitely spread it. Subscribe to the channel. A very good thing.  I want to tell you that recently we have done a very good workshop for the basic ultra beginners of Simple Astrology, you can take membership of the channel and you will see the workshop. If you do not want to take membership, you want to buy it only after cutting it. In the comment section, you will get only a small fee for a very small pizza. There was a 4-hour workshop in which we have explained everything in a well-structured way. There are also end slides etc. If you want to take it then definitely.  Definitely take it, what is it, in a structured way, you will have some access, there will be a framework, rest, even if you don't want to do it, then I am explaining things very well through simple astrology. Which are the doubts related to your astrology, which seem like misconceptions to you, people get scared, cat has crossed the path, nails should not be cut, not to be cut on Tuesday or hair to be cut, when to be cut, not to be cut, whatever such things are there, which were mommyor or  Whatever doesn't relate to you or you do n't understand, you must write it in the comment section because I will explain those things to you in a very logical, simple and very loving manner.

I will teach you my entire Moon and Saturn in a different way, I will tell you all about the planets, I will tell you about the zodiac signs and slowly I will take people directly to the eight classes and constellations here and they want to jump to that level.  No, this is simple astrology. Yes, this is a primary school, but after leaving primary school, you will understand it well. Here I will not take any PhD level topic right now, but I will tell you in a very simple way such things which are much advanced.  Those people do n't know, like if I ask a simple question and end it, why do these houses run anti-clockwise, why don't they run clockwise? Write in the comment section, this is how the clock runs, isn't it 12:00 at 1 o'clock?  2 o'clock 3:00 o'clock So in astrology, the first house is this, the second house is from here, why is the second, third, fourth, why is it like this? Could someone have done it like this? Is there any logic to why you did it like this? Is there any logic that you can think of? There is not much in the books anywhere.  It is written that many times you have to think why this happened, it is very important, thank you very much."

    "title": "Do  Not Get Into Such Discussion If You Want To Learn Astrology [vrioQFZ0rCA].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, do not get into this true discussion if you want to learn astrology and you want to improve your life. I learned it myself and improved my life. Many people enter this discussion. How is this discussion, listen carefully as an example. I will tell many people who want to learn astrology and they say all these things and what not to say, I will tell them that there is a moon, right? Yes, it affects us like this, you know that tidal waves come and that effect happens like this, so if that effect happens, then there is water inside us too, there is water in our brain also, so that effect happens like this. Yes, we are Astrology.  This is how you get trapped in these cycles. I will tell you one simple thing. Fill a vessel with water, fill it completely and keep it on the slab of your kitchen. Some moon may come as per your wish, some may try it with you.  Amavasya Purnima, if even a drop of this or that spills, tell me, even a little bit, keep it full, that even if you blow like this, the water will come out. If you are using so much force, then you are getting caught up in all this.  You are deprived of learning big things, I am telling you again and again, whoever speaks like this is not scientific, you prove the fact, speak science, brother, don't come to learn science, it is not science, tell me, this is the story of grandparents, why should you learn it?  If you do n't have any science, you want to learn it, then join Bachelor of Science, go B.Tech, become a scientist, join ISRO, join DRDO, join NASA, go wherever you want, go and learn everything, if you want to learn it, otherwise you will keep yourself so busy in your mind.  You will get confused because when you learn a whole thing then there will be stagnation, there will be stagnation then there will not be much anger from inside. Okay, this is because of doing too many questions in that way. So I am doing that to teach you and on its basis I am making a common sense argument. As soon as the word science comes, run away and say it is not science. When a person is openly saying whether it is science or not, why argument now?  Now, there is no argument at all, this argument is there till the time the word science is being used, after that it is not there, say this is a pseudo science, say, there is no pseudo science, brother, nothing.  Does this have anything to do with science? Yes, there will be peace, then you will win, Armant will win, when 630 Sati will run, Negi will roam, you will ask my brother, please tell me, then the time is for the needy, not the greedy. Astrology for the needy, only those who are supposed to come will come.  The one who wants to take his benefit will take it away. You find that these debates are energy sucking discussions. You started reading one thing well and understood a little thing.  Your life started getting a little better, then someone came, a scientist and you know who that scientist is, he has not made me do anything in science because I say again and again that the real scientist is the one of real science, he is always the one. He remains curious, he does not remain in denial, he is never fearful, he never says never, he sees like this and tries to do something, okay, the rest of the scientists are roaming around like this.  You do n't need to do anything to them, tell me brother, nothing, it's all like this, time is passed, all this is an illusion, yes, it is exactly like that, don't worry, if you want to learn genuinely, I am telling you this basic class in simple astrology.  There will be six to seven to eight classes, three-four of my videos have come, three-four more of mine will come, these will clear your mind before you are ready to learn astrology now I am yes I know what I have to learn. After that I will teach you easily, the journey is very good, you have already walked on this journey, very good comments are coming, I know you all are also feeling very good, please subscribe if you are watching Edge A Forward and  There is one more request, learn with your family, it will be a lot of fun, if the husband is listening, then get the wife to subscribe, get the children to subscribe, yes, children can be scientists, it is okay, they should be, okay, okay  Tell them things, then listen to them, take as much passion as you can understand. There is a simple logic that brother, after one and a half to two months, life starts becoming stable and fun, then continue watching and it seems that no, I am not understanding anything, something should happen.  If there is nothing left, then don't look, there is no expense or water in it, sister, free suits are being shown, okay, so come comfortably, watch and enjoy, it will make no difference, then what is there when the man himself is not convinced of that thing.  You What will you do to convince someone and whoever wants to be convinced, come and put effort in convincing, because that is the question, you do not have to answer the questions, when you say something, it is the proof of the pudding, these are some times in eating it.  Let's see how this is, conserve energy for those who want to learn and whenever something comes up say something, it is not science, it is not pseudo science, it is stories of grandparents, stories of fairies.  Stories are enough, then there will be no conversation after this, don't get involved in this discussion, the moon does not work like this, but you tell me brother, things have been written at a very conceptual level, we go there, you do your work right now.  The real moon is working, the fake one is working, your inner self is doing something. How does it make a difference? I have said it again and again, like an elephant in a chase is not an elephant, a horse is not a horse.  Is that a horse? Its nomination is that it will look like this, we will call it a horse or it will walk like this, this elephant will walk straight like this and this one will walk like this and this camel will walk like this and this queen will walk like this and the born will walk like this, that's it, we have made a rule.  If you add logic then tell me that the king will act like a curtain, a king is a king, a king should act like everyone else, here you have made a queen, it is a game, it is a game, so this is also a game, it is made up. Otherwise you will say that Sun is not a planet at all. In the future you will say that Sun has nine planets, what planet is Sun, what planet is Moon, what planet is Moon, satellite, Sun, oh brother, again you have entered into too much debate, then you have to tell, the Sun also rotates and who did it?  I had told that people have just come to know about this, these are the things that we have written, so it has been known for a long time that the sun also rotates, brother, like the sun, all the planets rotate around it, the sun is also rotating, the thing that is rotating is someone else's.  he has his Loose noun can be given, Moon is a satellite but it is rotating, so it is rotating only on this meaning of Moon, everyone is rotating on everything, whenever a person gets too engrossed in this roaming around and this explanation.  You get away from whatever is happening on your chart and in your life, then you go to become a scientist, then you become a Universe Frequency Big Bang Theory Astro Physics Scientist, Quantum Physics and  If you want to go there then go there, otherwise go there then see if you find peace there, we are talking about peace, sometimes people find peace in eating food, some people find peace in eating pizza, some people find peace in potatoes.  If you find peace in eating beyond, then come wherever you find it, there is no need to take stress on this, you will also find Astrology Group inside a comment section where we keep doing different webinars, like we have to do some webinar on Friday also.  which now  If it is happening then the notification keeps coming, sometimes there is a fee of ₹, sometimes there is a fee of ₹, sometimes there is a token fee, sometimes it is 51, sometimes it is 101, sometimes it is 151, there are just such nominal fees, you can join them.

    "content": "Hello friends, let me tell you an interesting thing and if you are making this mistake, then do not make this mistake. Teach them what they are doing. It is a matter of astrology. You must have seen many people eating food on the bed in the room. Okay, so if you have understood the significance of astrology.  Have you understood? Otherwise I will tell you right now. It is not like that but those who have some knowledge of astrology will know it and if you don't know then I am telling you two things, bed and food. If you have seen, what we eat is what we eat. Second house is called second house, food is like that.  And the bed is your 12th house. The bed is seen from the 12th house. The bed is called the 12th house, so you know the 12th house and consider it bad. The second house is of our assets and also of money, so when you eat on the bed.  If you eat then you have made a profit of 2nd and 12th in your life. So as soon as you have made a profit of 2nd and 12th in your life, your money will not last, it will be spent on useless things. How many people will you get from this thing? Don't eat identification, don't eat food while sitting on the bed and please tell this video to the people in your house and with this it is not that there is some superstition or how will it be done like this, you can identify yourself in many videos like this which you What do you combine things with? If you know how to do these combinations, you can live in the significative way of these basic houses and that is the basic which are my classes. If you have not attended the things which I have given in the beginning.  What does the house show, which house is related to which thing and in the future also I will keep telling about the things in Signify, like I told you today that the bed is a bed, it is the 12th house, food is our second, if both of them  If you do something then you have done it to them, then you have to avoid doing this work. Whatever you do, please avoid it and write that ji Guruji will definitely avoid it. I have made someone's athlete list and also see the pattern and whoever eats it also does it. Remember, if you ever used to eat, then also remember that when I used to eat, then my expenses used to be reduced to water, so please you can also spread this thing, not subscribe to the channel.  If you have done this, you can do it, if you go to the video section, you will get videos where these basic things have been explained, your zodiac signs, your houses, planets and basic things have also been explained, go and watch them, then you will start understanding these things.

    "title": "Do You Believe In Astrology ？ ｜ A Fresh Perspective Given [IsfN2t0vJ8E].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, this is for all my brothers who say that we do not believe in astrology, the topic is Do you believe in astrology, so normally you will get two answers whenever you ask this question to yourself or ask someone, brother, you do you. Believe in Astrology, the next one will say yes or someone will say no, then today we will focus on Believe only and will see if there can be a third answer as well. Brothers and sisters, this is going to be a very interesting video.  I am preparing a base for all of you to learn astrology, so whenever a question is asked to you or you ask someone, then understand it. Are you okay? Do you believe in astrology? Yes brother, we do believe brother.  Sir, we do not have any faith, we do not get involved in these cycles, we have to listen to both of them, one is also a popular YouTube, Dhruv Rathi is fine and there are two-four others like him, who by doing this, these astrologers are betraying the faith of the innocent public.  If you earn money by doing then the word is Vishwas, there too Vishwas is again called Belief, Believe, Believe in English, this is what we say, Trust is like this, yes, it is absolutely right, wherever there is trust, there is trust which is broken, then there is no need to have trust.  Now you say, what are you saying now, higher order videos remain, yes, my astrology, anyway, low IQ people cannot learn this, at least a little, IQ above low IQ is required, I am not saying that very high IQ is required, but one  You need more than average IQ. Those who are not able to do so much reasoning, even second order thinking on subtle things will be difficult. If you listen with an open mind, now you will understand. Let's try again, I believe in God. Now from Astrology, God can be understood.  Okay ahead, believe in such a God, whenever you remember, whenever this word is used in life, faith and believe, it means that it is not true, now you will say how do you believe that Modi ji is.  Prime Minister of India Do you believe No no I don't believe Is it a fact Delhi is the capital of India or Chandigarh Capital of Haryana in Punjab Do you believe this fact No you don't believe it is a fact You know it  Do you believe that you have two hands? The two you are sitting with are visible, so now this will I say I believe I have got two hands, I am not.  I will say I know I have got two hands so in life now we have to learn astrology then it will be taught then after that you will not say I believe in astrology you will say I know how astrology works I will take you on that journey when you don't  You will say to someone that I believe in this, as long as you believe, you will find people to break your belief, but when you know something, how will anyone break it? Now Delhi  This is the capital of India, how can anyone break it, how can anyone take advantage of it, you already know that when you invest on Borrowed Convenience, Arjun will come to the airport, it will become a jewel, it is like this.  So beyond that, there can be deception because everything is based on belief. Wherever there is belief, there is trust, there can be a mistake, so beyond that, we should not invest, neither emotions nor time in life, we have to learn the thing, either we learn the thing.  If you will not be able to learn it or you will not be able to learn it, then you should use such terms in life with this kind of astrology, I know astrology, I know how astrology works, you can say this or you can say this, I do n't know how astrology works or you can say this.  You can also say, I don't want to know how astrology works, I don't want to learn, I don't feel like learning, where believing in this is the mess, you understand the deep thing, I am teaching you, you are learning, you you  When this is my channel, when you will follow the channel of astrology on one side and why this channel on one side, because in the coming time you will see that I will not come and say like this, for the people of this zodiac sign, it will be like this in transit, this will be like this, I will tell you this. Why will this happen, I will tell you these rules only now, because what is there for me right now, as I will teach them, they will keep coming in two, four, six or 10 months, my small videos will keep coming and will keep teaching you, but the transit in between.  This is also happening so I will have to make it, now Rahu Ketu is transiting so I will have to make I can't wait to teach you astrology for 6 months and that means on time and if this thing comes then it will come. Presuming that those people who are already interested in Astrology and know something else already and they are sitting above A for Apple, if they come to make sentences then that video will come only on time because  Many things, events cannot be waited for, but when I tell them and I explain to them, I will tell them in such a simple way because the name of the channel is Sango Simple Astrology, then you will start understanding that this is the formula Guruji has told me.  Well, this is how it happens in this house, if it goes here, this is our yearning, this is our obsession, this is this, Rahu will do this, then in that you will not go to those channels because you have to go to them again and again.  What will happen to me now? What will happen to me now? You will learn. When you learn then you will not say that we believe in this. You will say that I know it. I know it. Whoever knows it, beyond that, then the word 'belief' will be removed.  And the one who doesn't want to learn will say, I don't want to learn, I don't want to know, but he has no right to say that I don't believe, what is faith, what is the system of belief, 400 years ago there was no electricity.  It comes and this light is visible. If such a recording were made then I do n't know what people would understand, so what is there to believe in it? And something works and something dozen works and you find out how it works and it works for you and  You Find Out That It Dozen Work If It Dozen Work Then You Leave It You Say Mere Ko Nahi Karni Work I Found Out That Why Trust Is Evolved Trust Is Evolved Because People People are lazy, it is very easy to believe, brother, we have a lot of faith in you. Why are you believing brother? Brother, I make these investments, you know, there is real estate and the rest is investment and there are 25,000 other things also in it.  If someone hangs your trust on ours, don't trust us. Use your wisdom because it will be beneficial in life. If you trust me then you wish before that if nothing happens then you have broken the trust, this is lazy thinking.  If we believe in lazy people who are roaming around, then whoever has faith will be betrayed. If you go by the rules, first go by the rules, then if you say no, there is no betrayal, apply your mind, what is the disease, who is the doctor, what is the qualification.  What is medical science and what else do we need so much, so much, don't trust, don't, don't, when you drive things, on what basis do you drive that I know how to drive, I have faith that nothing will happen in my car, there will be no accident.  when the road crosses  If you do it, do you do it only on faith that I have faith that the other driver will see me and will not hit me and brother, I have faith, today do you drive or cross the road with your eyes and ears open because if you have faith then people will remain scared. Why are so many people scared in life because they do n't know how to live life, they don't know what to do, they are walking on faith, everyone will believe, they will have to believe, we have to believe in many things, that too me.  I know, but if you believe in everything then  Stress will increase, many things are under your control, many things are not under your control, there you will have to believe, you cannot do anything, but those things which you can know about, recognize, understand, then you can do it.  There is no need, if you know how milk is tested, what is lactometer, then you do not need to believe in milk, he gave the milk, you put it in it, you know that water is put in it, what is this put in?  But you should have that much knowledge and not something like this  It happens that you will keep believing that I have faith in you, even if you give me good milk, he will betray the trust, this is also a message, so whenever something is taught or explained, then you have to judge whether I understand it.  It is working for me, I am benefiting from it and when the benefits start coming, you start understanding, you start liking it, and you know how it works then you will not talk that I believe then you  This much is  I will make it within two months to three months that which is good astrology, which is bad, which is nonsense, which is looting money, which is genuine, how does it work, how is it beneficial, you will understand this much and whatever channel.  Will remain a subscriber after two-three- four months, he will not say ' I have faith' because those who have faith in me, I have to call those who do not have faith, if you do not have faith then come, work hard, learn a little.  And then you don't understand after learning  Whether I come or not, do the workout or if it is beneficial to you, then tell me that now I have come, you will not say that I do not believe in astrology, then you will say that astrology does not work, then you will not say the word believe, I want to remove this believe word, I want you with astrology.  There is a campaign to remove the word 'Know It Works' and 'You Know It Dozen Work' and 'Believe Word' and I have to succeed. If you guys support me in this, I will do it a little faster and  If you don't give then brother, I will exert my force. It is bound to happen because this quality knowledge of our country has not been told to the people in this simple manner and when many people do not join then there are always dogs and that is also a deliberate attempt because otherwise all  Everyone will take advantage, everyone has started believing, trust again word, everyone has started knowing, then how is the advantage, this is also there, so stay connected, to bring peace in your life, to bring happiness, you will have to work a little, subscribe this channel. You might not have eaten such dishes anywhere else as you will get here. You might have visited many channels of astrology. The real thirst of Ketu is your thirst, this is your quencher. Okay, I am telling this as a creator, I will tell it in a simple way, I will not get too technical, I am also telling this. If a child of 12 to 14 years of age joins then he can also understand it and can understand it very easily, so please share the video, I have a request to increase the subscribers because like  Subscriber base increases and your whole heart chakra from inside, which is called the heart chakra, opens, the heart chakra should be open, it opens, but if the good one opens, then the man does not stop him, that is, I told you this.  Gave that, told more, told less than this, all will be told well, like, comment, good, bad, I never speak like this, normally I have many other channels, I don't speak like this, but I will speak here, don't make any bad comments.  do it because you want to learn  Don't make bad comments. If you don't understand then this one is called 'Don't come to eat food at a dhaba' but do n't write bad because I do n't want to waste my energy on other channels. Whatever you want to write, go and write it, my nephew.  There are many channels, four more channels are running, my youtube0, ask, I will satisfy all curiosities, because if knowledge cannot satisfy curiosity, knowledge cannot give you immediate pleasure, it cannot give you joy.  If it cannot give immediate pleasure, if it cannot lead to immediate liberation, then that knowledge is useless. This is a test, this is a very big test. If you are getting a good feeling from somewhere after listening to my words, then only it is useful. Other wise, then it is useful.  If it's not your thing, then if you are enjoying then stay connected, you will get to learn a lot of good things in future and I will make this base for you with seven-eight videos, after that you will start your 12 house zodiac sign and planet and by knocking.  We will go on and it will go smoothly, there will be no confusion and if there is a little too much, I will remove that too, so it is a journey, it is a very good journey, our Navratri is going on, good time is going on, good winters are coming ahead, good hot milk with turmeric in it.  Drink together, sit comfortably with your wife or husband and learn a little, then you will start understanding what is happening in your life. When you start understanding, then everyone is wise, so you can live your life in a very good way.  we will live well So please share this video with everybody thank you very much"

    "title": "Do You Face Any Issues In Celeberation [2GE56cB3inI].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, Celebrations and Astrology, I will tell you a very unique thing which will impact many people and you will get to know many things better, you will enjoy it more, note it down. Do you understand that celebration can be of birthday, can be of promotion, can be of home.  It is okay to have a wedding, it is okay to have celebrations in our human life, which people should not celebrate, should they keep it high or low key because if they do this celebration every time, it will give them a bitter taste in their mouth.  There will be tribulations in their life, they will not be able to do anything or they will cry or they will feel like money has been wasted. This happens to many people, to whom it happens, I am going to tell through this video that this video will help you a lot.  People have to share it, the pain of many people will go away, this video is some commemoration which I am going to disclose through this video, please note it down somewhere and first of all tell me, does it ever happen that if you celebrate someone, then someone  made a face or  That act was for your happiness and you did not get that much happiness and the raita got spread in it and the same raita got into trouble and you keep wondering friend why did I do this and there is a pattern in the life of these people and this is never the case  You can observe, starting from a small tea party, there should be a meaningful celebration, be it of anything, it will have to be kept as Loki, I cannot say that do not do it at all and live in the court and I am not saying that either, but very  gorgeous  They will have to remove that thought from their mind about love and some celebration will give them happiness. They will have to remove this thing. Sometimes what happens is they just do it for the sake of doing it. When we do not expect much then sadness does not come. So who are these people? What is this?  The combination is Saturn, which is Saturn. If the planet is in your fifth house or Saturn is in your Leo sign, then this is your combination. You cannot do this. Now how many people are there who  How many are sitting with communion, whose father's is in it, mother's is in it, why is it in wife's, then if anyone in the family has it, then he should not be the main one, why would he do that, then there will be these issues, how many people will now take identification with this?  You sit or sit with Saturn in the fifth house, there are only two things: Saturn is in the fifth house of the horoscope, Saturn is in the fifth house of the horoscope or Saturn is in your Leo sign and Leo sign can be anywhere. If these two are present then  There will be more in the fifth house and there will be a little less in Leo too but the story will definitely play out, so if you sit with it then there will be one more thing in it, the third thing which I told, you will not even feel like celebrating this too.  There is a fact that other people will tell you 'Pati de pati de paati', it is not about miserliness. It is not about miserliness. What is the problem at times? If a man does not give you a party for anything, then it is considered that he is stingy. No, no.  This will happen to you, you generally wo n't feel like it, this is also a fact, so if you don't feel like proposing, then it is right, check yourself, you are sitting with Saturn in the fifth house, you are sitting with Saturn in Leo, look at it, this is simple astrology, yes this astrology which  I think one of the channels is mine, others are also doing good work, I am not saying that I am the one who will enhance astrology, I am with every astrologer, the astrologer community is very good.  And there is no competition here, every person is pushing through his own means, Sanatan is our old knowledge of Vedas, astrology is fine, this is a very good thing for our country and the easier it is to do, the more it will become famous and practical when it works.  He will do it, then you will not need to watch Dhruv Rathi's videos that this is all nonsense, astrologers loot everything, everyone loots like that, and astrologers alone loot a little.  Everyone loots and everyone loots, so it is not like that, okay, you cannot associate profession with that thing that it is professional and this is one thing, you cannot do like this, I am telling you today, do it, see it, work it.  How many unique things have I told brother and how many special things have I told, specific things have been told, Saturn is in the fifth house, Saturn is Leo celebration is Loki, keep it, don't jump too much because every time you will try to.  Do Big Se Brash You Will End Up With Bitter Taste That bitter taste can happen due to any reason, there was no fun in the function, there was distress in the function or some of the things we were celebrating backfired or many people celebrated first. Many people do that, it is not as much fun as it was supposed to give, there is something wrong in the story, it will look like this, you have to observe and if it is not happening, then write that also so that I have included it in it. Off course, this is old knowledge, reasoning is everything, but the number of people who observe and how many out of 100 it is working out is that in someone's case maybe one half may not do it due to reason or Jupiter only.  I sat with you there or there is something that reduces it a little bit, then it will have less impact but the general feeling will definitely be like this one from extreme feeling of not wanting to do and feeling.  Of Not Enjoying While Doing It And Not Being Able To Do Many times what will happen, let me tell you one more thing, I feel like doing it but am not able to do it, sometimes it also happens that I am not getting time, I have to have a party.  If you want to celebrate something, it's your anniversary, brother, if it's your anniversary, then go out to eat with your wife, take your wife shopping, like many people do, 25th wedding anniversary.  20 Those invitations were given to 150 people, 500 people, don't do those things, if you are sitting with this advice, no one is saying anywhere that do n't celebrate at all, don't enjoy life, don't enjoy life at all, but tell them the difference between high key and low key.  I am wondering how big a scale I have to take it, I have to sit with my family members, cut the cake, eat halwa puri, do puja, buy some clothes, it has to be done, life is one thing, it has to be done, no one can stop it at all.  I am definitely doing it, I have to enjoy it, I have to do it with the family members, but 800 people, 100 people, 200 people, there would be an issue there and Guruji would say about marriage, what to do in the marriage, now that too is a tricky situation, now whoever is sitting with it, then whatever.  He is sitting with the thought that he may not be a front runner, just push him and do the rest, don't jump in first and be a little detached because there will be marriages and  If 100-200 people come, they will come, we cannot stop them, but if we know that it is so, then we have to be a little careful that there is a little something here, just this much, it kind of arouses desires, not many people that  If there is a celebration, then I do n't know what mood will be great and what fun and enjoyment will be had. There are many people, it is a lot of fun, many people sit with such a commotion, we will discuss beyond that sometime, those who are  There is fun in parties, there is joy in attending as well as in attending, I have heard a lot, oh man, yesterday there was a party, it was fun, now it was like I was also in the party and I was like man, how mean is he speaking loudly.  It was fun, where did you enjoy it, what was the meaning, but I am not judgmental, I am a Guruji, I think, what kind of a combination is he sitting with, that it extracts the juice, extracting the juice is also an art of its own in life, a normal one.  In a Mandan party where people come and eat and drink, say hello and do a little dance and enjoy it, that too is a blessing, to have fun and enjoy and it is not within everyone's power to enjoy this, so this is one of those things.  There are different things and one thing is that brother, you have not come, if you make too much noise, you will do it quietly, then it is okay, then this is yours, then this was the message, you will definitely find it in the comment section of Astrology Webinar Info Group. Join, membership has been opened on the channel. You can take this membership. We had done a basic workshop of at least 10 to 12 webinars. You will also get the recording of that for four hours. You will enjoy it. Take the membership and see, there are 10, 12 more.  In the future, the programs will continue to be held every month, you will get access to it, it has its own video, you will enjoy watching it, you will get membership once, I will request those who want to know astrology a little better and bigger.  If you want to learn more in a structured way, then take membership. You will get access to two videos, watch it comfortably, make notes and enjoy, but for now simple astrology will continue. Normal subscribers will also get a lot, will get it at slow pace, will get it at easy pace, will get it at digestible pace.  You will get it only then if you reach somewhere in astrology, come here on HiFi and start talking, whatever goes from above, which you cannot check in your life, whether the truth spoken is a lie, if it is working, then it is not fun.  This is the technique that I told you today, look at your charts, everyone has 10-12 charts in the family, look at them and then ask that person, ' Friend, this is what is happening with you, this is what happens to you, only when you do this, only then will your conveyance happen.' Jaggi ki yaar all this is working thank you very much"

    "content": "Hello friends, I will teach you these things very easily, today we will talk about how a horoscope of houses is generated in your software, then it has houses in it, you will see the boxes like this and they move anti-clockwise, so the first house is  Here there are 12 o clock and then it moves anti-clockwise. The numbers written inside them are the numbers of the zodiac signs. Many people are related to me in the same way. In astrology right now A is for Apple and B is for Boy. So then the sentence.  If you start making it then I am teaching it from scratch. If a 14 year old child or even a 13 year old child wants to learn, he will easily learn some maths and there is no need for it. There is a simple thing about your horoscope, there is a complete horoscope of 360 degrees.  There are 12 houses in it, 12 houses are also called 12 houses, so many times people get confused, I will keep clearing the terminology in every video. If you pick up something in English then it will be called Houses. Hindi of Houses becomes House and hold the third thing Bhava, that is the same thing, first house i.e. Ascendant and then that two, second house, third house, fourth house, so this will be Hindi, okay after that English.  If it is first house, second house, third house, fourth house, if any sentiment is expressed, then there is no need for you to get confused in this, what is seen from each house of the houses, it will work in the best way as a sub-class, there will be no long videos, only short videos.  will be one  The same thing will happen, just hold on to that thing, open a diary of yours, write it on the diary page and there is no need to write more than two or three lines in that entire video, these are small videos, just that, if that is yours then from this video.  We learned that there are 12 houses, there are 12 zodiac signs and every house has a zodiac sign and the number you see in whatever horoscope is generated, you see the number, there is a number in those houses, that is not the number of the house.  Many people say that I have four houses.  Yes Guruji, I have four houses visible, they are not four houses and the one which is visible above in the beginning, you start from here, those zodiac signs are four, when I will cover those zodiac signs separately, then I will tell you that also in a very good way. People, you should do that, first start from home, I am going to tell you this thing in a basic simple astrology, even a good astrologer does not know it, sometimes ask someone from whom you go to know this thing and start in simple astrology.  I am teaching the beginning class  I have a mind that you all have like a clock. In our clock it is 12 o'clock, which means it is here and then it moves anti-clockwise from tooth 4, 5, 6. So, why are these houses moving like this in astrology?  Counting your wires also: This is the first house, this is the second house, third house, fourth house, fourth house, fifth house, sixth house, seventh house, eighth house, ninth house, 10th house, 11th house, 12th house. Why like this?  Why does it move anti-clockwise? Ever ask anyone that it moves anti-clockwise because it liberates you in life, opens you up, astrology takes you towards salvation and opens you up, so whenever something has to be opened, it is like this.  They rotate it anytime, see it, they take it down like this, after applying chillies, they also remove it anti-clockwise, if you want to tie anything, then it is tied clockwise like this, see it anytime, if anyone has any interest in it. If there is any thing like this, I have to tie it, then I will tie it like this, clockwise and the time to open it will be like this, if any thing should be known, then it gets opened, hence it is anti-clockwise.  A little more math, we will not do that much math, everyone knows 360 degrees. If it is all ours and there are 360 ​​degrees in it, like there are 12 slices of pizza, then if there are 360 ​​degrees and there are 12, then there are 12 slices in one.  How many degrees will come 360 ​​diva 12 means how much is 30 degrees, that is why the first house here is 30 degrees, this is a total of 30 degrees, after that we go to the second house, 60 degrees, the third house is 90 degrees, see like this, it starts from here, 30 like this, 30 degrees will continue for you.  Here your fourth house will start at 90 degrees. It will come like this. It will come like this. Okay, so do n't get too confused about the degrees. Later you will know the whole story.  What kind of house is it? Every house is of 30 degrees. It should be known why it is so because there are 12 houses and the total everything that is around is 360 degrees. If it is right then 360 degree diva ba 12 one is 12 houses.  Just remember that they move anti-clockwise and the houses are not written in the horoscope, they are counted automatically, this is the most important thing, do not forget that if you propose.  Like when I look at the clock, even if 1 2 3 4 5 6 is not written on the clock, even if there are more dots on the clock, I still tell the time because I know that three will strike here, four will strike here, this is the same system anti  It is clockwise, nothing else and what is written inside are the zodiac signs, the numbers are of the zodiac signs, you should know this, ok thank you."

    "title": "How And Where To Make Your Kundali ？ [VlQsZ56crNM].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, this is an important topic for astrology, what should you use, software etc. I talk about it, there is a free software which comes for free, which is quite good, you can use it as you progress in astrology.  If you know how then you can also take the paid one, there is a difference of accuracy in that, the paid ones are used when you want to become an astrologer yourself and consult others but when you want to learn. So AstroSage also has an app, I am not promoting anyone, I am taking some half- names, I am fine, so you can take one of these, that too will fix the d1 chart, now what is happening in d60 or many times?  What happens if your Lagan is of 29 degrees, then in one house, the Lagan will show here, in another one, it will show there, it can also be exactly that degree in minutes, if you go that one house is of 30 degrees, then consider the Lagan as yours.  20 29 degree point is of something, then it can be here and there in the point, it can be here also, here also there can be a half planet which is on the cusp, absolutely here and here too, this happens but you give me this.  Please tell me, you can use this, which is even better one, it is ok, you can download it in laptop etc., if you want to use it in phone etc., then there are many names, there are many names, it is very free, adopt it.  Then they also have a paid feature, okay they can do that is one second thing is that this 0 minute ₹ 50 ₹ minute astrologers should not even go to the astrologers, you people do not get any clarity in this and this is by the  Dozen is normal now, it is not ethical on our fraternity. Tell me more about this. I will also tell you that neither am I trying to do any social service by coming here, nor am I trying to say that this is me, my fees are very high, so that  According to the account of the ethical and if you go into it, then I am robbing if you want to use Word, then it is fine but it is not help, it will be mine, it will be mine and it will be so yes, it will be so soon  Can tell it takes time for people to go through your horoscope and chart, hour, two, three hours, how much you want, as much expert as you want, he will go in depth, then he will study it, then he will be prepared, then he will give you consultation, then  And he will answer you on the go, yes, tell me, yes, yes, I want to put it, yes, this is it, then he went and told the thing at a superficial superficial level, what would be called, 'If you cry expensive once, if you cry cheap again and again,' then this is also a fact.  This is also a fact that unless we talk to each other comfortably for an hour and a half, the heart does not accept it from within. It takes that much time for someone to tell you. It takes that much time to understand slowly and here, many things are happening on the phone. Hey every human being.  He is sitting with a horoscope on his face. You can tell by his forehead where his hair is. You can tell by looking at his sun. Khan is sitting in Lagan. Where is he sitting by looking at his facial structure. You can tell by looking at his lips. You can tell by looking at his neck. Shoulders. How wide are the horoscopes? The real ones do not mean appearance, intelligence or no intelligence. You get to know a lot by looking at the face. Yay, if we are talking on the phone then it means it is happening at the superficial level.  How can you talk to someone? You need to see who the person is and how he is. Without him, all the things that will be told will be very superficial, so I have told you this software, you can do any of these.  Whenever you watch the videos, those who were ahead of me and are watching even now, please make your chart and always keep the book open because look, I am teaching this and many people here want to jump a lot, Jump the Gunny, this is so.  If I know it, then tell me, just tell me brother, if you don't have patience then astrology will not come to the one who knows this much, you are sitting with this much, we will cross his level after 50 episodes in four, five, six, 10 minute videos.  Can't make it long because I want to give the same amount of information, I am giving only a little information through each video, every day or alternate day video will come, 15 to 25 videos will come in a month, there is only that much information. Watch easily, don't jump and in the comment section I am also giving the link of an Astro Webinar subscriber group, I will also explain it to you in the live class, now I will do it in 10 days, I will do the free class in 15, ok, free class, come this. If you have associated with me the doubts of all that I have told till now, that as a student teacher, this is a journey, it is not a patience, even without patience, nothing will come in life, right. What happens to people is that many times just tell me the Navamsha. Start with Ashtavargam. It's okay, start with that. Do you want to test my knowledge here or do you want to jump on your own?  Do this also, do that also, how it happens like this, how it happens, you can learn it under one procedure because I have seen that there is a lot of need for channels like mine, there are 10000 channels open on astrology, but that one.  There are 8000 channels out of 10000, today let us discuss how will be this month, how will be that month, know every moment, you have come to know about your life again, is it deeper than that, is it deeper than that, your 10 day 15 day month Meena  I told you it is not good, then what will you do, you will still have to live, the month is very good, you will still have to work, whether the time is good or bad, you will have to work, so what difference does it make, so I am  I will teach at the level, that is not being taught, only then the need is very high, method wise etc. and why do those things happen, how do they happen, this will be like this, your time will be like this, hey, once I will teach you, no, that time, what he is telling, how to tell.  Whatever is transit or any other thing, we will tell you the same rules and the same formula so that you do not have to go to the same place every time. The content of those channels is that every month we will tell how the next month is for the 12 zodiac signs.  So 12 videos have been made and these have happened, then you are roaming in the same again and again but if you reach there, then you yourself have not become an astrologer. My aim here is to make you an astrologer, you have to take it to that level that you can understand things.  You can understand and explain it and can apply it in life. There is nothing applied from that knowledge. Your 22nd will be good and 28th will be bad. Then on 28th, you will not wake up in the morning, you will not take bath, you will not go to office. Tell me, after knowing a little bit. came  Also, there is some benefit but then you forget it, then that life comes, sometimes it becomes something of the time, I told you 28, it happened due to 27, which caused 27 to happen and 28 was also not good, so then many Once I explain things very well on energy level and on different levels, please explain it in the best possible way. Please note that the horoscopes of everyone in your family should be in your register.  Gradually you should remember who belongs to where, what is the dedication and what is there. Thank you very much."

    "title": "How To Count Houses, Ghar  Or Bhav Correctly In A Kundali ？ [s_vSuym_gR4].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today I will tell you a very small aspect of simple astrology, but it is also very important to learn this aspect. This aspect is counting the houses, counting houses from houses. I have already told you that your house starts from the first house, second house and third house. You have seen fourth house, fifth house, sixth seventh eighth ninth 10th 11th 12th like this but if I tell you which house is third from second house, which is the third house from the second house because this will be discussed a lot in astrology, sixth from that, eighth from that, fifth house is sixth  The eighth house, the house of one, five, nine, in this way a lot of things will be explained to you and people get confused in these basics itself, so we always have to see that from whichever house we have to count, whether it is the third or fourth or fifth house, we have to count that house  You have to start from here, I will tell you with some examples, stay connected with me, this is very basic and this basic thing always becomes weak for the people and then they do not understand further and then they say that this does not work, so if it is the second house or the first house house is second house is third house is fourth  It is fifth, so if someone asks me which is the third house from the second house, I will say that this is the first house, I will count from here the third house from the second, third, one two three, this is it, now which house is this, this is the fourth house, understood?  What mistake do you people make from the second that which is the third from the second so you start from here that this is 2 3 this is the biggest mistake this is the biggest mistake if I tell you which is the third house from the fourth house  so you will not do it with 5 6, you will do it with 456 this is a very basic thing I will take two more minutes and keep explaining you with five to six examples, okay which is the fourth house from the ninth house, I will say fourth from the ninth house because this is very far ahead  It will be used and it is used a lot in astrology, so basically when this count has to be done, when you will be explained, then which will be the fourth house from the ninth house, so first we will count nine, Nath 10th, 11th, 12th, so it becomes the 12th house.  We will never tell which is the second house from the 12th house, which is the first house, it will always be called second house because it itself is the first, so you will never hear which is the first house from the 12th house.  Which is the second house? So, from the 12th house, second i before first i 12th second i first because it is revolving like this, everything of yours, so now I am telling you again as an example, stay connected with me with simplicity, do n't get confused  This is your 11th house. Which house will be the fifth from the 11th house? Which will be the fifth house? It is very simple. If you want to count the fifth house like this, then count the first 11th. If you want to count from 11, then first 11th, second 12th, third first, fourth, second and third.  is fifth from 11th so I hope you guys have understood it well under this example, this is very important, this is basic counting, you should always keep this thing in mind  You have to understand it from this and along with this I will teach one more thing, okay instead of that, it is a separate thing, that too is a very small thing, whenever we talk about why its essence comes in astrology, that is why I am telling because counting always starts like this  It happens according to years, if I show you, when a child is born, his first year begins, that is the first year. If the child is one day old, then you cannot call him zero, if he is one day old, it means first year.  If this is going on then whenever you have completed 25 years of your life then we will say 26 years of life because it is important to understand that when there is activation of ages of planets or zodiac signs, then when you reach the advance stage then  These years will be very important that brother, which planet is getting activated in the 24th year, where is it sitting, the event there will be like this, which one is happening in your 34 years, which one of the Sun, I will not get confused a bit, I will tell you according to the years, 4 seconds  year 48 year life ka  Why is it important? If it is important then how will you calculate 48 years, that when you are 47 then it is 48 or start, if you are 48 then it becomes 49, so you have to understand this basic thing that whenever we say that you are in your 32 years  What happened, that means when did you turn 31, you have to count one year from that, you became 32 after turning 32, so when 32 is being said that this happened in the 3rd year, then 33 will start if  If you celebrate your 32nd birthday, then when 31 happened it was 31 and when 32 did not happen it was 32, so in between this you are in the 3rd second year of life, this is a very basic thing but teaching the basics in the beginning is important, thank you.  you very much"

    "title": "How To Easily  Remove Depression Or Unhappiness From Life ？ [hKpB3rgkER4].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, in today's video you will get to know a very good thing, you will get something to remove depression, those who are sad, they are going to benefit a lot from this, it is going to be benefited for free only, but I ask Guruji for the fee in advance. You have to share this video with at least 10 to 15 people and there is a request to all of them and you too, if you are watching this video for the first time then subscribe to the channel. Simple astrology explains things very well from basic level.  be taught  Here are the videos, go and see the list of yours, you come to watch the videos, watch the rest of the videos of the channel that have come till now, today's video will be about if you are sad in life or someone else is sad, depression, someone is facing problem.  If it is, then I am telling you a very simple solution to get out of it, I am telling you a practical solution, I am telling it through astrology and you have to do this, see it, understand it and spread this thing, it is your moral right from within that brother.  You  Tell 102 people, now they see it, understand it, take advantage of it, it is their karma, but you have done one of your karma, just like I am doing one of mine, telling many things extremely freely is not allowed in any profession but some things are told. And without keeping that thing completely free, I am repeatedly requesting before I tell because that energy exchange happens with Guruji only when something is given to you to subscribe or  Try to get it done and send this video to 510 people. By sending that much, it will be beneficial for someone. Let's start it. You see in your horoscope where is your Sun, where is the Sun, in which house, what are houses, I have made the video.  I have made it and explained it in the significances of every house. You will also find it in the comment section. You will find it in my old videos. If you watch my old videos, then wherever your sun is, it is your soul. Regarding that, you will find it.  If you have to do activities, you will get out of depression. Sun is light, it is the light of life, so in whichever house your Sun is sitting, like in the ninth house, then brother, if you travel, it will get you out of depression. If you cannot travel, then evolve with your father.  This way the depression will go away. You cannot evolve even with your father. The father is not there or does not feel like evolving or there are some issues with the father himself. If you cannot even travel then it is also related to religion. The new house should become a little religious. Do religious things, do rituals, let it evolve into religion, now even that is not happening. Suppose, how many scopes are being given, if this is also not happening, then the ninth house is also of your higher education or learning, then learn something new.  If you start doing this then you will benefit from it. If your Sun comes in the third house then it is for short travels. Sun is in the third house. If the third house is for short travel then you should do short travel in it. Travel a little, the third house is also related to hobbies, so develop any such hobby of yours, then you will get out of depression and sadness. Wherever the Sun is in the 11th house, if the Sun is in the 11th house, then one of your  Network is there, you can increase your network, increase the network of friends or become a little dependent on that network, interact with that network or it is also there for cash flows, it is also there for gain, so in your real life  Even if you go after money and gains, you will get away from that too. Sun is in the fourth house. You know that the fourth house belongs to the mother. There is a feeling of happiness in the mother's life. You evolve with the mother and talk to her.  That will make it easier for you to get out of depression. Mother is not there, you can't talk or you are getting sad from mother. Believe it, this can also happen, it also happens to the car, do n't buy the car, you are fine, change the car at home.  It also happens to change the house and renovate the house.  If you can't buy a new house then buy some property then it will be like this. If Sun is in the fifth house of someone then pay attention to the children. Just like every relative comes out of every house, now the children are  No, there is depression, there is fifth house, then fifth house is also of some romance, so try to find a romantic relationship, it will take you out, even romantic relationship is not coming, there are no children, then again it is also of an art, learn some art, hobby third.  I told you but here there is an art like singing painting or some such old knowledge which is prevalent which means you cannot learn such a thing by reading a book, if such a thing is okay then you should concentrate on that thing, it is okay.  Now let's see where the Sun is. We have to find out the second house significator. I am not reading from any script, I am giving the rule a + b s = a s + b s + 2ab. Put your a and b and ask the question.  Videos uploaded first  There are significant activities to be done in each of the houses. Now Sun is in the 8th house, so the 8th house is of astrology, it is also of Alt, yes, the 8th house is of inlaws, so if you show interest in inlaws, then many a times depression is giving in these laws. In the cases of women, brother, learn astrology. Take any of the four, five or six significant easy ones from each house. It is a buffet. If you do all four, it will be even better.  But it happens that I won't be able to do this in four or five, this one won't happen, so do this, learn astrology, the eighth house is of astrology, the old man is of knowledge, it is called science, it belongs to him, so you do that there, tenth house, tenth house.  Sun has set in yours, your tenth house is also father's house, father's original house is father's family, so you can pay attention towards them, father's assets are there, father 's money accounts, start keeping an SA Munshi for him.  If two will come out in the 10th house, otherwise it is the environment of your work place. If you start focusing on your job, then you will come out. Whatever Sun is in the 10th house, I want to tell you this technique and secret through this video.  Start doing activities related to the place where the Sun is placed. If the Sun is in the 12th house, then bed is also of pleasures, then do such things. Now you are not getting it, there is depression, there is apathy, it is possible that you are not getting it.  That's why there is indifference, even if the twelfth house is about spending your money, then spend the money. Even Times People, they say, Retail Therapy. Retail Therapy. Surya Bar. You went to the house, spent it, bought a shirt, bought pants, bought some thing and age.  If there is a house, it is the house of expenditure. If someone talks about loss, then it is the house of expenditure, then spend it. If it is in the 12th house, then spend it. Sun is in the sixth house, yours is the sixth house, so fight, quarrel and enemy are the enemies of all of them.  So this does not mean that you have to make an enemy to be happy, but there is one more thing, when you have to look at it in this way, do not make an enemy by force, but when you fight with someone, then you make all your servants depressed.  It may be at work place and sixth house is also of service. Vargo sign is also of service. Okay, house and sign are also interchangeable. I hope you guys know. So if your Sun is like that then it is inside the sixth house.  you guys You can do service to anyone, you can do service to anyone, that is, people who are below you, people who are poorer than you and those who do not have resources, then you can do that and that to such people.  Now the Sun is sitting in the ascendant, now it has come in the first house. Yes, Guruji, it is mine and I am very normal. People with the Sun ascendant are less depressed. This is also a fact. If you can identify it then wear good clothes.  lago royal type  You should wear clothes and shine your shoes. You should apply cream on your face. Take care of your body. Take care of your face. Take care of your head. Take care of your hair. And the best thing is that you have to get a massage somewhere. You have to get a good haircut. You have to correct your personality. Watch.  If you want to wear a good one or whatever, it means you pay attention to yourself, on your body, then you will automatically come out of it, there is something for everyone, it means there is no such empty thing for everyone inside the seventh house, if your  Sun is inside the seventh house. If the Sun is inside the seventh house, then what will you do? Now, the Sun is inside the seventh house. Anyway, it is considered to be a low house, because it is in the seventh house. I will explain this in future videos. Okay, so here I am trying to explain it simply. So, if Sun is inside the seventh house, then your soul is in your partner, activate it with your partner, do not fight with him because you have to get peace from there, all the depressed people are there and the Sun is sitting in the seventh house. You can afford to fight with your partner.  Can't do this, maybe this is the biggest reason for your depression with your partner, whatever is the equation, correct your tuning because that sadness is coming to you, wherever the sun is, that is your soul, if the soul is the soul, then that is.  If I want to get Food for the Soul from there then I told everyone Food for the Soul, I don't think so I got it done at some house but I did not plan to go in a way so that people know everything and in my family.  You should see this by looking at your horoscope.  If it is your son, daughter, daughter-in-law, mother, mother-in-law, sister, relative, someone who is sad, pick up his horoscope and see where his Sun is and start telling him whatever I have told you, he is in this house.  Now in the second house, whatever Surya is sitting with, probably the second is left in the second house, there may be food for you, eat good food, if you cannot eat good food, then it is the original family with father, which may be your father, mother, you may be married and  wife  There are no children, not this one, father, mother, pay some attention in the family, take care of your assets, that, that, you will also take care of your assets, make them your net worth, write accounts, how much is my loan, how much is demat, how much is my mutual fund, you will keep all these.  Still, you will not get rid of depression but will get rid of apathy, you have to use this knowledge like medicine which I told you and it is a very panacea knowledge, now I have shared this knowledge.

    "title": "How To Get Real Sukoon  In Life ？ ｜ Ketu Activation Importance [FVEFrnbN3gs].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, normally I do not make videos by watching them directly but today I have to read something for you people and I am connecting it to astrology, I am connecting it to Ketu song, it is the song of Ketu, if you understand it then you can also listen to it. I will tell you its lyrics. By activating End Ketu, something good happens in life. It is very important to do this. Even big people who have reached very high positions and big leaders also activate them.  We have to do this in our daily life to say that brothers and sisters, we are fakirs, we will carry the bag, it is not that this person is telling you, that person is telling himself, this is to activate our Ketu. Okay, so today one  There is a song by Joust karke uski chor relix karke hai aap aya mere ghar ek chor lyrics, I am telling you the lyrics, come and say, give me whatever is yours, the thief came to him, he said, chor ne Give me whatever is yours, I said, take my name also, take my work also, take my Ram also, take my Shyam also, it means that you are ready to leave the religious identity as well, you have to leave the work and the name too. Ready, take my name too, take my work too, after that I am jumping because he lives like that, take my victories too, take my defeats too, take my fears too, take my home too, take my dreams too. take my secrets too  Because all these are restrictions, dreams and fears, it's okay, take my sorrows too, take my wounds too, again sorrows also hold us, wounds also hold us, take my caste too, take my status too, take away that of my caste.  Meaning you rent from the community, I am here, I am here, I am here, the one here is also unhappy, the one here is also unhappy, you all know, some have reservation, some don't, take it, come take it, okay.  Take my wounds too, take my caste too, take my words too, take my circumstances too, whatever you see of mine, take me, whatever you see is the best line, take me whatever you see and whatever is not visible, take me Ketu is again something which is not there  It is also visible, take me to the end, what that person says is, make me free, make me free, make me free, this is what we are, if I connect it with Sanatan or connect it with astrology, it is okay.  Because in Sanatan there is the concept of salvation to oneself and Ketu is the planet that gives salvation, so if I add it beautifully then this is Ketu so hai Ketu song, okay you listen to it once or twice a week and it will give you relief not that you are doing all that  I am leaving but you are like that I can leave, when the moment comes in your life that it is okay friend, I will leave, what is there will be seen, it will be seen if you see the essence of Geeta ji.  Neither Geeta ji is in Haryana nor the essence of Geeta ji, we people of Haryana have squeezed it in two words because this is what was preached, so yes, there are one or two words of Haryanvi, it will be seen by us, now those people should do the same, do not wish for the deeds, then that. All the verses and chapters should be read, but we Haryana have a little profession, maybe less and it is a little martial area, this is our fight and quarrel and all the wars, Kurukshetra happened here, knowledge was given, Panipat happened here, even if all the shoes ring here,  If shells are fired then you know this area is fine then the people here have taken out its essence and will be seen this Geeta Ji Geeta Ji is also of Ketu if you see it is the giver of salvation then Ketu Geeta Ji Haryana will be seen and this song  You internalize these four things and I am telling you a very simple thing in life, if you can do this too, whatever is coming in your life, whatever good or bad, let it come and whatever is going, let it go.  A in politics  You see, he is coming, he is leaving us, concentrate on what is left, don't stop the one who is going, don't stop the one who is coming, something is coming, anything is coming, wealth is coming and going, there is glory.  Respect is coming, some of this is going, become a little detached, Sara, this is sorrow, isn't it, this is Rahu, I have to catch it, Ketu is free, this is Ketu, what should I leave, only then I say, Ketu, you have done a lot of ding in your house.  He has kept me in the family of big people, not in the family of Ketu, hey friend, you will create a fight in our house, this one is getting things taken out, it is coming out like this, so Ketu, why do you have to leave when your work of leaving is done, right?  Take me, I had made a video of Ketu earlier also, ask a small child and he will give a toy and he will do it like this, Ketu is great who can do like this, now you cannot do anything about them, most of the children are born by nature but at some stage,  As soon as we gain knowledge  Isn't it true that one day one has to leave life? You have seen how many people leave life. Many people live as if they never have to die. Many people live life as if they never have to die. Their actions are like this.  That's it, man, they feel like they never have to die and when the time comes for these people to die, when the time comes for these people to die, they behave as if they have never lived, okay so you have to live a life.  that when  Whenever someone's time will come, you can go, he will not be spared, creatures are not spared, many people also have this problem, okay, so we have to keep the element of Ketu high, this song strike me and its lyrics strike and these songs and lyrics should be kept high. Whatever you heard, write in the comment section and let the comments come that yes, how did you feel about this and how did I link because this is simple astrology, my M is.  Through the channel, you have to easily attract people towards astrology, you have to connect them and not show it in complexity that yes man, how is it not even close to identification, even then all of you check where is your Ketu and in which house is it sitting, Astrologer  Whatever kar elements of that house are there should be significant i.e. my brothers and sisters who are sitting with Ketu in ascendant, it is better if they remain detached in their life because otherwise they will become restless if they are not detached.  You will be rested. You are sitting in the 11th house with Ketu in the 11th house. Brother, the more you remain detached from money, the more will come. The more you remain detached, the more will come. You are sitting with Ketu in the second house. You will not run much after assets. You will not run much after food.  The food and dishes will be as good as you will get, just as it happens with many people that what has to be made in food, make what is good in food, if you eat what is made, you will get good and  As soon as Ketu sits in the second house and says, 'Farmaishi program, this is not right, that is not right, I will never be satisfied again, this is a simple technique which I have taught you, look anywhere, now Ketu is yours, somewhere, there, wherever, detached.  You will have Ketu sitting in the 10th house, you will have to leave the job, you will have to leave this job and take another job, the more you try to concentrate, the more you will run after promotion, Ketu.  The more you try to get your things done in the 10th house, the more you will be dissatisfied. Brother, you have to do that in a detached way only. There you have to become a servant, wherever Ketu is, you have to bow your head there too. Ketu is sitting in the fifth house in front of his children.  Say like this, what can I do for you? Good morning son, hello daughter, it means we have to live like this, what can we do for you, if you do this then there will be no dissatisfaction, the relationship will be good.  Otherwise, wherever Ketu goes, it will spoil your relationship. Ketu in the fourth house does not get along with the mother. Mother is always angry because you should be her servant. You are not able to please the mother because wherever Ketu sits, she feels bad.  You want that, he wants this, if you don't do this, then it is over and what is the problem of the one whose Ketu is sitting there, this is also the problem of the one whose Ketu is sitting there, he doesn't have it, no, I will not do it in front of them, okay in front of us children. We are inclined towards children, yes, you are sitting in the 5th house, it is possible that it will work in the 5th sign also, it is fine, but in the 5th house, it will work 100% in the 50th sign, but this is a simple rule of astrology, I told you that what  Whatever house is told will be given correspondingly, it is fine, but right now I hold on to the houses. If Ketu is sitting in the fifth house, then brother, you will have to bow down before the children and as much as you can.  The more you bend, the more you will get the love of children. The more children will listen to you, the more you bend, the more you will listen, the more love you will give, the more respect you will give, and the more you bow down, the more you will not be, this is the problem with you, the biggest one is okay, so I told you in a simple way, how did you like the Ketu song and listen to it. Spread it is very important. Okay, I will keep bringing such simple topics. For you all, do watch and subscribe the channel. You will find a simple astrology group in the comment section. If you are looking for something beyond that.  There are information webinars. If you have not joined it already and have interest in astrology then you can join.

    "title": "How To Know Your Ketu Is Good ？ ｜ How To Improve It [QI1KyGDtMbU].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today there is a very different topic but you all will enjoy it. How to judge Ketu by looking at a child, whether his Ketu is good or bad without seeing the horoscope and the same thing, if you can extrapolate it in any elder, then talk.  So you will know, you can see on a small child, you can try it today itself in your relatives, with great love and easily, any let's say, there is a small child of one year, one and a half years, two years, four years old who is playing.  He is playing a toy or eating some toffee or if you go to him like this and say, Hey Rohit, give it to me, whatever you look like in his relation, you look like a father, you look like a mother, you look like an uncle, aunt, whatever, say it with love.  Hey, give it to me, as soon as you hold your hands like this and speak with love like this, give it to me without even thinking, like someone sitting with a pen, give it like this, give it just like that, and others give like this, and many children do not even give, they give like this.  That Ketu is good, this is a small interesting test, now if it does not give, then do not be sad beyond that that brother, yours is bad, so it is good, do not put bad words in it, nothing happens, I said, Ketu is good, if Ketu is good then  It's okay but they can do a test, now this test is done in older people also, if it is given extra time in a child then it is easier, what is there in an elder, a little bit comes in it, a filter comes which lasts for one, two or three years.  it belongs to  He is thinking a little, he is a genuine Zen soul, as you said, he has not applied much theta, he has not used his brain, he is natural from inside, it becomes a little difficult in elders, but still if you see that even an elder person will think, I  Should I give it to him or not, will it be beneficial or not? Well, he is asking for a big party, give it, it is an investment, so it becomes a little difficult, but if the feeling of giving comes easily, then Ketu is good, you understand this and you things.  If you can leave it, you can throw away old clothes, you can throw away old shoes, you can give away any thing that you do not need, you tend towards minimalistic living, I am not at all saying here that you do not want things.  Then let me explain that separately, but you want less, do not want useless things, do not want more in show off, that is, you are correcting your Ketu, which is not okay, then brother, correct it. You have kept those old bags, old leather goods. I am keeping old electronic items.  I will fit in this clothes. You are the one who will never get thin. We all have this misconception. No, this is not good. No, if you have not worn it for six months to a year and are not able to fit into it, then leave it brother. You will become fit and then get a new one. Reward yourself. If you lose 10 kg or 12 kg weight and your body changes from a bad body to a shapely body, then what shapely body did you work so hard for?  Deserve this thing price and something that my friend will come and buy something new. You have to fit in the one who has to fit in and you can never fit in. The second one is not free from that and the third Ketu is bad, so try these things practically and try to leave a little.  There should be a feeling that the athlete should leave those things which you do not want, you can also leave those things which you want, then they have gone to a much higher level, I am not asking you to go to that higher level, I am saying that Brother, without whom you should not use, I am people's Vaastu or some such thing, I go to the rooftop, you open your rooftop or two, now you are watching the video, then you see what is the situation, go to your kitchen. I tell women these days that many times they have so much stock in the kitchen, no one is cooking the dishes, the women who cook these days sit on the bed, don't want to work, or don't feel like it, or they have to eat on their own.  Does n't feel like someone who has that talent  Of using all the embroidery and those of today's friends, I sometimes get nervous. Nowadays women, old women, because I can really sound very sexist, not a feminist, not a male shawist, because whenever I talk about anything, I am more like this.  I don't think, I hope you guys wo n't misunderstand me, I am trying to tell you that ladies, if you don't know much cooking then it is not necessary, Swiggy Jametto also works well or you can make egg bread.  You make Maggi and make some sandwiches and if it is the same as yours or if it is a little more than this, then take out the pan which you have kept, you should never use it, otherwise you will not be able to make that dish, otherwise you have used that 1 liter 2 You have a pressure cooker worth 3 litres, 4 pa, that much, you have put that asafoetida and cumin tadka in the dal at night, so brother, he is going to play from house to house, keep only the stuff, why are you keeping your fruit unnecessarily, because you are not able to leave it. Ketu is sitting there spoiling everything, leave it all, leave it to your husband, this is yours, why have you kept it, your mother-in-law will come and will be very happy, Gabbar and Gabbar will come and cook your food, this is not going to happen.  Gabbar, nothing is ever going to happen to you, if you are so right, then she will not come, she will not make it like this, yes, it is true that when she will not be there, then you will have to make her, so keep a habit of her name also, so that it does not happen that you get separated completely and silently. Two  Just throw everything out, but if you have done something too much that your mother had given something and your mother-in-law had also come and you yourself had taken something that you do n't know what I will do, what will I do, then that.  Don't do it and I also want to tell the men who are in their mid 30s and 40s, I don't know what things they have kept to improve their health, some of them are not becoming Vedas, I do n't know, there is so much dust going on that I  it  Bull worker, by doing like this, I will do it like this, it looks very good to me, I said, friend, there is dust in it, why can't I do it, one day, I am like this and like this, there is a machine, abs are made in it, it is fine, that  We are not using it at all. Well, we have kept it like this that once upon a time people told me that I used to get that belt at the age of 11, that I was very fat earlier, then I got this belt and the belt helped me.  12 kg weight  You have reduced that, I don't know which time it is at 11 o'clock, nowadays maybe you don't even come but earlier you used to come, had you ever bought that belt, that belt will move like this, it will heat you and all your fat will melt, that fat never melted.  No, it has been made by someone else but that belt is still lying with you. Okay, I see people that electronic items, you know, become dated over a period of time, especially those made 10 years ago, so nothing works, that CD player. player  These days, everything has come on mobile, they are kept, that is, will the technology go back again or will this technology stop, so you have kept it that who knows, you may get to see it again brother, you are sitting with that CD, put it in. Nowadays, they have so much storage space on cloud cloud or server or anywhere else, I see people having phones etc. which do not have these chargers or these, 25 types of these are lying around, hey brother, you use them.  are not doing  Duplication is coming with these and everything else, its wire is broken, it doesn't even charge, so why is it kept for whom, you tell me, you have not kept all these things, brothers and sisters, it is okay, clothes, unnecessary utensils, unnecessary shoes, unnecessary electronic items.  You again say nonsense that now this is an astrology channel, watch the videos of astrology only, there is real estate also and you will have to buy a big house, you will have to spend Rs 1.5 crore extra on it and this is not a waste of Rs 5 lakh from you.  Garbage worth Rs 3 lakhs is not thrown away. A thing bought worth Rs 3 lakhs which is not even worth Rs 25,000 is not thrown away, it will be useful someday. It is okay, sweet winter, thick winter, this winter, that winter is okay. Now sometimes I also use the air conditioner.  In winter, I can make such videos. Okay, when they are not available, I have to make them wearing a jacket when I forget to turn it on. Okay, then spend a little money, otherwise you will need more space. These foreigners live in so much poverty that I do n't know how many clothes they should have. They have a thick quilt and a sweet quilt. They say nonsense and then a bedsheet and then why do you all go? These days, those who are listening to me, everyone's bed is empty.  They are lying with those clothes which you don't know when you will use or not, everything is just a matter of where will the energy circulate from and then they say it is not fun and then they say yes, do a consultation, do Vastu, oh what am I?  You need consultation, I am telling you in a simple way, subscribe to Saral Astrology channel, throw away the useless things, pick up and throw away the things that you have not used in 6 months, okay do n't confuse your brain, your brain probably uses it every day. Yes, it's okay, many people use things which are kept and don't use them, then throw them out, they will be useful to someone else, they will do good to someone else, give them to anyone, okay, don't keep unnecessary things in the house. Keep only those in the house which are functional and beautiful. Don't keep anything in the home which is not beautiful and which is not functional. Just being beautiful is not enough. There should be some fun in it too. Something should look good on the eyes at least.  She is also a functionalist, there is such a lovely painting, looking at it makes my day, so it is important to keep that painting, keep flowers, keep flowers that smell good, keep such things.  You are right but do not keep anything which is neither visible nor used, it is lying on the roof, children's old bags are not thrown away, children's old report cards are kept by heart, people have memorized them, they had got so many numbers, those memories are not lost.  Digitize them all, okay no no, they don't get discarded, no old dolls are discarded, then they say that friend, if you are not getting rid of them, then something new and good will come to you, you will have to free up something in your life, only then something new will come in your life.  empty i won't Meaning, then it cannot be just like this, so we will have to do something, something has to go for something new and good to come in life, so do that I am not saying that make this world a waste dump yard, increase your Kanjan, speak for minimalistic.  I hope you will understand this essence. Subscribe to the channel. Like it. If you have any question in the comment section, you can ask any practical question. Thank you very much."

    "title": "How To Make Kundali If Your Birth Time Is Unknown ？ [_LuhjekXwkc].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, I have been doing a lot of research in astrology. I am getting very good feedback through this channel. If you have not subscribed to the channel, then subscribe now and share these simple questions with your friends and family because it may be someone's  If you are facing the issue that I still do n't know the time, what should I do now, then if you do n't know the time, then we assume that you know the date, you know the year, you know the month, but you don't know the time, whether it is 5:00 in the morning  It was 5:30 in the morning or it was 2:30 in the night, it was around 2:30, it means there is a doubt in it, then one basic thing about it is birth time rectification which is done by an astrologer, but before that I want to tell you people  That any lagna which happens is of 2 hours and 120 minutes and is of 30° so 1 degree is covered in 4 minutes, so if your 29° is 29.5 28° or  If the ascendant is of 0° 1° 2 degrees, then the value of time increases a lot in it because the ascendant will change in just 2-4 minutes. If 1 degree is changing in 4 minutes, then one has to be very careful in it, otherwise if your  It is 15 degrees, 16°, 18, 20°, so we have a lot of questions, however knowing the exact time is always beneficial, the exact time because that also forms your conditions and when you have to take predictions in the future, you have to see that this event of mine  When will it happen, if there is a little variation in the time then even a variation of 2-4 or 10 minutes comes in the prediction of that event in every two-three months, but still by doing reverse engineering which is called birth time rectification, by checking that  Your event didn't happen, but after asking you, after asking you, after asking you, like they say, adjusting the needle, that too, well this one happened to you at the age of 31, I did n't get to know about it.  So if it happened in 30 or at this time, then he will note it down, then when did this happen, when did this happen, from that he will set your time exactly, many times, like someone's lagna is a simple thing, cancer is cancer lagna and  There is a Leo ascendant, suppose someone has Leo ascendant according to the time but actually he is Cancer, then just by looking at his face for 5 minutes you will know whether he is a Leo ascendant or he has a fiery nature  So brother, then the Leo ascendant seems fine, he is an emotional person, a cold person, a cold person, an emotional person cannot become a Leo so quickly, but it takes a lot of time and effort of the astrologer and of course the fees are also high.  It is because you do n't know the time. It is something like your report is not correct and you want to generate the correct one. It is possible but if you have n't even taken the date and you don't even know the date, then you have increased the degree of difficulty a lot. Yet there is some account I am not telling that here in simple astrology, but normally, if it is for many hours or even one and a half hours and there is no idea at all, then it becomes very hard, then we try to do it with the moon sign because the moon  The date of moon is based on the date and the date is like two days plus two dates and one day, so the time of the date is more, the date constellation is correct and the moon remains in one zodiac sign for two days plus two days.  If it remains then an attempt is made to do it but yes, that much detail is there in the chart reading and that thing definitely makes a difference in your accuracy but it does happen, it is not the case that another half an hour, 15 minutes or 10 minutes If you know the date and time then it becomes easy for him because he knows that this was the engagement so the next one cannot happen because it is near this side because in the next one he will have to wait for two hours.  If it has to be done then he will take this one, then it becomes easy for the astrologer because as you explained to him that one  There are 12 lagnas in 24 hours, so one lagna is of approximately two hours, so the lagna of two hours is of 30 degrees and 1 degree is covered in 4 minutes, so you can think of the whole game as  Those who are sitting with the lagna between 27 degrees and 3 degrees, they have to be very careful because that 3 degree variation is of 12 minutes, so if the time changes by 12 minutes here or there then the lagna can change and the one which is at 29 and exactly on the other side,  0 punt something then they have to be very careful so this is something now in this they will ask what time of birth is taken when the child cries because this has been seen in many hospitals also practically I am telling you guys that you have to  Be very careful in this also because if the old people do not know the time then it is okay, now the new people should know the time, now there is a clock, earlier the country was so poor, so many years ago there were no clocks, there was time  Where will we do it, the midwife used to be in someone's house many years ago, now it is in the hospital, so there was n't even a clock at that time, so what about now, when the child cries, it is the time, many times uncle cots him, then  And the hospital people write the time then or it could be that their watch is running a little late, the one who is supposed to write the time, the time is mentioned in the birth certificate, so brother, in foreign countries, which are developed countries, it is shown that the father is standing during the delivery.  So you will note down the time, this is not a culture in India yet, so whenever you need to check the time once because you can be correct even upto seconds and if someone is correct upto seconds then it is great, then it is not necessary to make that much effort.  You will have to put in an effort, there is so much technology today, that child's first birth time is the time when it happens, okay now that is your birth time, so put in a little effort, try to note down these stems  The more you take care of your cells, the more valuable they are, and you'll realize that over time, like stem cells help  You can do it and keep all those frills and such things, nowadays technology has come so you can find out the time, I am very surprised, there is no birth date of 1960, 50, you took the time of 70 also, okay, you did not take it at that time, but friend  It is happening in the year 2000 and right now you are still not able to get the time, so it is like that take the time, the country will be seen, you have the knowledge, you believe it or not, that is the time, so take the time of birth and our birth certificates  In the hospital it is kept in the records as a country tension but I feel it is quite loose, it depends on the mood of the nurse or the doctor or the assistant who writes it, yes I had this much idea that yes in this  Maybe this baby was born on time, otherwise by doing this it should be made fool proof, whether it is a boy or a girl, the father and mother of the child being born would not know about it, there she is delivering the child so there is some relative Put in a little effort, not much; put in a little effort, it will take you time  You will get to know that there is no problem in that, whichever nurse is going in there or that person, ask them that how do you people write this time because practically most of the people are taking their own time and the time of many is several minutes out.  If it is there then things get a bit out of place and then they say hey you did not tell me the right thing, you did not tell me on time, now he will say that he will tell me on time, now you bring the reports from up and down then the doctor will tell you according to that report only, you will have to wait for the birth  People don't know the time, so just put in a little effort to find out the birth time of those who don't know it, then it will be told after looking at the horoscope of the children, if you know the time of the children, then this was it, thank you very much, subscribe to the channel Like it if you haven't done it yet, thank you very much"

    "content": "Good evening to all of you, we are going to start and tell a very good technique of Raj Yoga today, it will be a simple technique, everyone will enjoy it, first of all welcome my guest astrologer Any sir are you there sir yes sir good evening sir  Welcome and thank you sir for sparing your time sir, 7:30 is the peak time for the audience and your classes have to start after that, so today's is sir.  We have chosen our topic, how to find Rajyoga in your chart, so first of all, which planet are we going to take today sir and you sir, we had done a poll before this, many people are interested in astrology and of late before we start. With today's topic, I will make an observation. Sir, tell me how are you feeling? Sir, after Covid, I do n't know what is the reason in the last two-three years, there is a huge interest in it, which means that maybe.  2017 18 This was not there in 1920 because of what people are teaching, they are learning and the general disappointment is coming. The number of people giving misinformation is also large. No doubt, but the trend towards astrology has increased, even if we see it on the link of the apps.  Even if we look at the blue ocean opportunity, many people have started discussing its financial scope, even its S-industry, which they did not do earlier because now it is  In a way, the industry started getting the status that it is fine in itself, although it has its own share of criticism. Many people in the main stream also say that it is not fine, it is not like that, it is not like that, so it is yours.  What is my observation? My observation is that the people who are directly connected with me and my own interest in all this, is there any reason for this? Astrology can also be a reason for this. Time is psychological. What is the reason for this, Sir? Till 203, it will keep increasing continuously, till 33 there was no second, now we are in 204, its speed will increase now and this past 2000, I will tell you one act, July 200, I will tell you one, I have come from behind, we are the people with figures.  People July 2017 and July 204 Market Size 10 Times Be Already Ready I said not 10 but 10 times 10 times and I am saying  9 years later and this has become so big in size that you can't imagine that even now all the people who have come, many people who know very little but have started working and still you Suppose, sir, a simple logic was used to cater to the huge population, if there are 140 crore people in our country and out of them only 20 crores, I am taking a 20 times very small figure. I should talk about it.  No lesson 60 7 crore people correct but if the number of exposures should not be same for 20 percent people or even 20 crore people then yes sir absolutely if you do the ratio then eat it but unfortunately there is mismatch in it then it is like demand supply miss in doctors.  If there is a match, quacks come and say that many times in this state they are doing it in a backward village of some backward district of Bihar. Gaya, who was once a compounder, his performance was quite good, but once he made a big section, he got stuck, it is okay, it happens in every line, sir, so I am my campaign, sir, through your help, this is the way with the people that we can teach astrology.  If you spread the awareness of this then two, two, four will definitely happen in your life. I am sure that now people know their own horoscope and when we tell our students that five or six horoscopes are close to them.  Dear, you should have memories of your acquaintances. Even if you don't have memories, it should be in a register somewhere, not on the app. Open the page directly in the register itself and you are seeing six horoscopes. So you will apply in that way sir, today again.  What are you going to teach sir? Let's go straight to that technique. We have close to 400 people listening sir. Now see what you have caught. Sir, the name itself is Rajyoga. Sir, we will have to start from the king. Okay sir, now Rajyoga is from Sun.  If we take it, then people think that in the name of Rajyoga, I will go into politics, I will become a minister or I will become the Prime Minister or I will become a Sarpanch, this is also Rajyoga, it is a small and big Rajyoga, sir, don't talk, I am saying this, the meaning of Rajyoga is this.  Whatever line you are in, you are at the top of that line. Okay sir, it is Raj, not every person can go into politics. If he brought the Rajyoga of business, then he is Ambani ji, Tata ji, Bala ji, he is of this level, he is the king, sir, he is the king.  c It may be the secrets of business c If someone has brought Rajyoga in the teacher, then it may be that he is a very promoted personality in teaching skills, by whose name people know that he has got the President's Award for teaching or someone like him has become famous, there is a celebrity in Bollywood.  In Hollywood, he has done his work at the top. Amitabh Bachchan ji is there, so NDA, are you on top in whatever work you do? If you understand such things, then Rajyoga is very Rajyoga miss on the top, you are in top people, something.  If you are among the selected people or not, then first of all, this is the meaning of Rajyoga. Secondly, the important thing is that Rajyoga is in everyone's mind. How can we execute it? It is very important to understand where Rajyoga is, let's say your Rajyoga was in business.  And if you keep working throughout your life, then Rajyoga will be acute. It is not possible that you are at a busy place, so where should you go and when will that Rajyoga be acute, that is, when will you get success, Rajyoga can be done by me or can.  We must understand when we will get this success and which planet will give it at what time. Just tell me Rajji, we will take it from Surya. Sir, tell us whatever you say, we will take the topic from Surya. We have taken the topic from Rajo Planet.  Naam Liya Sun, you tell me which point you hold which is related to Raj Sir meaning like normally it is of high level in Aries, people automatically say that it is Rajyoga but something different which people  Normally it may not seem that friend, can this also be Rajyoga because he is sitting with Eris, first of all he accepts Rajyoga, if it is of his own sign like in Leo and if it is in anything else too, then sir tell me a little about it and what is normal.  of people and what will be the result of it, how will they analyze it, it is a big thing, what are you trying to do, you are doing such work in the spell, what is it like today? Take two, tell me, yes, Venus is the enemy of the rising Sun. Okay sir, Sha's sa is number two. Now let's do one thing. We select one zodiac sign of Venus and number two is Rasa. If someone's Sun is in Rasa zodiac, it is fine, but this is  People will say that it is not useful for us because when the Sun is in Taurus, approximately between 15th May to 15th June, the session is not useful for people, so I work either in Taurus or in the second house of the horoscope.  ho second house second  House and Torus, it is okay sir, either it is in the torus, sir, or it is in the second house, okay, how will you rule, both are very different things, but we address both of them in the same way and now we apply this rule and everything.  If you do P test then you first tell everyone, yes everyone is talking about Lagan Kundli, someone is writing Lagan Kundli, took the same horoscope, sir, if there is Rajyoga in Taurus, then what is it?  If there is a Rajyoga of what will I get, then I do one thing, I show a slide, show me two slides, I will get it, okay, this is a gift, everyone will also say thank you, whoever takes the screenshot, okay sir please, okay, then I share the slide.  Yes sir, this is my slide on Raj, what a lovely slide it is, I don't know how much it takes to make a slide, these days I am getting thumbnails made, sir, I am realizing that earlier I used to make mine like this, nowadays people said get it made professionally, oh sir such an expensive deal  It feels like this, it is mesmerizing after seeing the slide, it is a very nice Sur, I am taking a screenshot, okay sir, the aura of Sur is visible in this photo, Sir, it is like this, it is a very nice Prasa, see its beauty all around. And the rider on the chariot and the chariot moves at full speed, the sun never stops, as if the sun keeps everything, everything will end, Rati, everything is moving, energy is there, everything is energy, nothing is moving, sun in juice and good, understand carefully if the sun is torus.  Be it in 1st or 2nd house and preferably in the second house, the condition is that it should be good, it is okay, it is okay to get support from seniors or the government. I have often seen that someone in their family works in government related work or may be in a government job. Yes, yes, very much, your favorite topic is government, sir, job. I have often heard you talking about this, it is also TED, so sir, you can also see in it that someone from the original family should also be in the government. can yes  The government may be your father, may be your uncle, may be your uncle, may be your grandfather, may be your wife, may be your husband, may be your entire family, may be your aunt, aunt may be in government job, now people will say that what you are talking about is ours.  Those of the previous generation are behind in the government jobs and even the children of today's generation who were born today, you and your husband, open your head, wife's, open your husband's competition, if you are any kind of  Are you facing competition or like you go to give paper or exam, there are less types of competitions in sports, there are many types of competitions in career too, apart from this, there are many types of competitions, it has become sport for that to win in the court or court. These people have a lot of support in the court, they get the support of family members, the family supports them, whether their Sun is in Rasa or in the second house of the horoscope, they always get help and support from the family, I have seen that from the family.  Good money is available, financial help is absolutely great for money, good, they have leadership skills within themselves, they are very talented, I would say their followers are very good and don't think, if these people run a channel then they will have good followers.  They will also follow the rule of financial independence. This is your favorite topic. Sir, Amit ji, there are so many of your videos in the middle class on the rule of financial independence. Sun will be in Torus and he will say that I should not be dependent on anyone, I should be independent, I should have multiple sources of income, it would be good to get big money, if the Sun is in Torus or in the second house then it will be special. If the Sun is in Taurus and Rahu is in Sagittarius then the zodiac sign is Sun in Taurus and Rahu in Sagittarius is one then Ru becomes Sun in second house and understand what these people are, there are eight lovers. And I have seen many times that these people are professional artists, they are great artists, some may be singers, some may be painting, some may be making things with their hands, some are artists of national level, some are playing musical instruments, some are playing dholak, some are playing tabla, some are playing piano.  Guitarists are very good artists, they have a very good understanding of good art and even if they are not professional, they are art lovers and they like it very much. If there is Ketu in place of Rahu i.e. Sun in Taurus, Ketu in Sagittarius or  Sun in second house and Ketu in ninth house, this is a strong combination of engineering. Now what is technical profession in engineering, civil engineering also comes, mechanical engineering also comes, chemical engineering also comes, any kind of engineering or the one who is a doctor.  Medicine is a technical subject, it is not taught like history, it is learned by doing practical. These people are very expert in the technical line. I can give you this apple. I told you that it is related to the same NDA that Surya Torus.  If you are in I and Rahu is in Sagittarius, brother, go towards eight, you will get success there, Sun is in Taurus, Ketu is in Sagittarius, brother, go towards engineering, you will get success there, you will reach the top, if you talk about good terms in technical profession, then we will write above.  Support from family member is written below that brother will definitely fight with the family, family will support you but if he starts fighting with them then brother will punish him.  Avoid quarrels. As soon as you quarrel with your family members, if you quarrel with your relatives, mother, sister, brother in law, then there will be challenge in your career. Note this point is the most important point or as soon as you quarrel, there will be problem in your career.  I quarrel with family members. Secondly, anyway, I believe that whether it is Sun and Taurus or second house, it also gives challenge in relationship, because Sun is everything, it is the zodiac sign of Venus, it will burn wherever it sits.  If the heat burns more, then that heat definitely burns some or the other things of the zodiac sign in which it is located. Burn it and if access fire is in the juice, then the relationship will be fine. There will be ongoing quarrels with the wife and husband, that grace.  It will not happen, it will not be fun, a little more than normal people, what is the recommendation, keep donating something or the other in the temple and maintain good relations with the people, do not quarrel too much with the inlaws, this is it  The biggest caution, Sir, today you have done a wonderful job, you have also explained the below section completely, Sir, one thing I wanted to ask in this is that what is the meaning of the English word 'Financial Independence' written above, that if the crop itself becomes independent from the government,  There will be multiple sources of income, if there is minor or final independence, then suppose I am in one place, if there is no one in my body tomorrow, if I keep working, then what can I do, then do one work, one rental.  Generate income, do one thing, earn some commission, do one thing, keep doing it continuously, within 10 years you will get fat, do one thing on the side, and if I am in a government job, then do something in the name of your wife or child. Keep doing something or the other so that the money keeps coming from somewhere else, I will talk about it sir, there is a saying in English that one should not be in one basket. The meaning of this proverb is that all your money is in one place. everything should not come from one place  One should store and eat, if there is a shock then it will end, then there should be multiple sources of income. There is a thing going on in the mind of Sun Taurus people that their mind goes towards money, now if their mind goes towards money, what will they do? There should be some money from this also.  It came little by little, these people generate multiple sources of income or do they think, friend, do one thing, 25 rupees of income keep coming, do one thing, from here I put some money in the stock market from here for a month.  I have been earning Rs. 20. One is my job. One is running. One is in the name of my child. Do something else like this. Sir, you can also teach astrology to all of them. Do anything from astrology. Yes, it is in the second house. Wake up comfortably. Sir, this technique was very good, Sir, now on Sunday, on very popular demand, we are doing a special four-hour workshop, we will tell you everything about Sun and Moon, we will tell you all the yogas, we will tease a little transit.  Houses started that registration for that workshop, I will tell people about it and what thick cover will be given to my head, these things, if you look at the details of which month is good for us from the Sun, the Sun stays in one zodiac sign for one month.  Which is the best month of the year for me? Why does the Sun go to 12 zodiac signs in a year? That's why there is a year of 12 months. From Ba to 12 zodiac signs, the Sun goes to Ta zodiac in a month, so around 14 April. And before that March goes in Ta and Six between the month of April, which month will be good, which month will be the month of trouble, if you talk about this from the Moon, which two or three days will be good, when will the money come and connect with the Sun?  Will your boss help you? When will there be a fight with your daughter-in-law? If you have a boss in your job and there is a vendor in the business and there is an overall government, then when can a government letter come? When can someone's GST ST inquiry come? Brother, bring four documents and submit.  Get someone done, when will the income tax chi come? Okay, when will this time support us? When will such a time come in the year and this happens every year with everyone that this month of mine goes well, if you know those two, three, four months of the year. This will work well for three-four-five months, if you do your load i.e. that important task in those months, then your success rate will increase. Okay, sir, I will give you an answer as if you are about to get an interview call. Sun changes its zodiac sign around 15th. Sometimes he does it at 15, sometimes at 16, sometimes even at 17 in the early morning, you may come to know about it, but look, when will the sun change, when will I go, will I give you a date, 14, 15, 16 days, okay, you know, you are sitting on the 12th.  When I go, I will take advantage of you and said, do one thing this week, Friday 17th will come, sir, it has come in my favor, now this one month, now this one month. His quick interview shed round and round, and the one who is in the job can also take some advantage by making Prajal go back and forth. Bakul sir, that will be the month when he will listen to you, when he will listen to you, get the work done for you.  Three-four months of the year are good for everyone, no chart should be too strange provided, three-four months of the year, four-five months of the year are good for everyone and two-three months are good for everyone, now there is no planet, there is no condition.  By giving special support, it is normal for some people to be worse or someone else to be better and it is a special case. If you can know which months will be good for you, then you can do your important work in those months and adjust yourself according to those months. Get it aligned with Give an apple Someone works in sales Let's say he works in sales And he knows that when the sun will go to Torus Sorry when the sun will go to Capricorn The number sign will go to number 11 The sign will go to number 12  So will he support for three months or will he support in the sign of Saturn on 10th and 11th, then what will he do with his financial condition? If the sale is from 1st April to 31st March, then in January, February, March, when he gets target allocation, then in April. He can keep his target bigger in the last quarter of January, February and March. Is it okay or does he come to know that my July, August and September, suppose these three months are good, then I will put the major part of my target in these three months. Plan it and execute it from here so that I can be comfortable in the remaining months or six months of the year. Okay, apart from this, many other things can happen. Suppose someone has to buy a property, someone has to buy a car, someone  Someone has to go on a trip, someone has to travel abroad, when should I go, which month should I go, then it will tell you when not to go, whether if I go, there will be some harm or the other, it will tell you, should I take the moon like this? Now Amit ji, your  Favorite topic is money, how is the final independence? Now if someone is investing a lot of money, if you come to know about it, because if we talk about the day, then the lord of the day is Moon, who stays in Moon sign for two and a quarter to two and a half days.  If the Moon is in this zodiac sign then it will give me benefit. I will hold on to the day of the month, these 10 days or two days or seven days will be good for me. I will trade on the same day. I will sign on the same day. I will sign property deals on that day. I will block the house on that day.  day train  I will buy, I have got all my important days, just like this, if I know which days are bad, then I will not do such work on those days, so sir, we will learn this technique, this technique, sir in that workshop. It comes from the Moon, Sir, okay Sir, from the Moon, just as the month comes from the Sun, a period of two and a half to two and a half days comes from the Moon, and the time between those two and two and a half days is the Moon in one zodiac sign, the Moon and the Sun in one day.  moves one degree Approximately, the Sun will change its sign by one degree in 30 days in 30 days. The speed of the Moon is fast. The Moon moves 30 degrees in a day. If I talk about mathematics, it will take 30 degrees to move. It takes two and a half days. How do I decide which two and a half days are good for me? I said, suppose the Moon is in this house, in this zodiac sign, in this zodiac sign, in four zodiac signs, good, if any, individual four. That is the zodiac sign of the Moon and if you have found that then you will know that these four days, six days, seven days and 10 days of my month, whatever days are coming, are absolutely tremendous, whatever work I do on this day will be more work.  Will get means you have lent money to someone. Let me give you a small example. You lent it to someone. He said, \"I will return the money to you. When will he return?\" He said, \" You did not even ask for it on Monday, I asked for it, I will give it to you and you will give the rest.\"  I will not give it later  You said, on Tuesday or Wednesday, I pray to him that my moon will be cured, now you go, the money will return to you only because it is your destiny to get more money at that time, okay sir, you will get more money, understood sir, okay.

    "title": "How You Can Improve Your Relationships With People？ ｜ Saral Jyotish Technique [HGFyKe6ilHs].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, I am going to tell you a very good technique of simple astrology, relationships will also be better, especially with mother, there is one technique, it will not be applicable for everyone but it will be applicable for many people and it can be applicable for many people in your friend circle along with your sibling. Maybe it is one of your clients, customers or anyone around. I am going to tell you a very good technique of astrology. This relationship is to be done with mother. So the technique in this is this.  If a person's Sun is in the Cancer sign, in which sign the Sun is in the Cancer sign, if it is in the ninth house, or if it is in any other place, then it will be applicable, this thing will be applicable and tell me that at least Test in 10 horoscopes and tell that it works. Don't tell before that. It is not fun to work on two horoscopes. Will it work in 10? What will happen in Sun in Cancer? What will happen in Sun in Cancer, that the mother of this person will always feel that he is his father and he is one of his children.  He is not of any use and he has to work and this creates a lot of bitterness. You are not able to help your mother even if you want to. Such a situation will be created and if you are able to do so then she is not satisfied and what should she do? Neither do I have to do anything, neither your father does anything nor you do everything, I do everything, I do everything, everything will remain like this, so first of all you have to accept this thing that brother, it will be like this, after that you have to try to mother.  What has to be done is to provide indirect help. If someone is having pain in any part of his body, if he is having pain in his bones, then get a masseuse, help in the house, help in driving, you will never be able to help directly, that is, yourself.  You will not be able to go and press your feet, there will be such a situation that you are posted or your wife does not get along with your mother, you are unable to come to the house or your father will be like this, the situation will be like this for your mother.  It is not that there will be no reason behind being angry, there will be a reason too, but if the reason is suggested to be 40 out of 100, then the mother will consider it to be 80 out of 100 but it will be 40 out of 100 and this is the remedy and the advantage is that if you do this thing.  Understanding this, if you do a little something to your mother, then your welfare will be immense and your life will become very good. After that, if you suddenly release it, then at one place there is this conflict of pleasing the mother.  Trying to blame them, they will never be happy, blaming you, blaming dad, this will work in girls' chart also, check it, it means father is also getting blamed, child is also getting blamed and mom is just walking around and  Many times you exchange notes like father, child and father, hey, your mother never stays engaged, she never sits peacefully, neither does she sit herself, nor does she let us sit, and keeps saying ppp ppp, she will do this but do n't do it too much because her  Who  When you were born, you sat with them, that's why this is happening with them, now this is happening with them, so beyond that, now you don't make them that way, you try as much as you can indirectly, you will not be able to do it directly or they will.  If you do n't agree, this is also a fact, then the same problem. First of all, what is this? Many times, how will this fix the relationship? Will a smile come on your face? First of all, this is how astrology works. There is no prediction in this. There is no absolute truth in this. Couldn't change but at least realized why it is happening. First realize that it is happening and reduce it little by little. Sometimes what happens is pain. If it is 95 out of 100 then reduce it a little to 70 75. Even if you bring it, there is pain, but at 95 p.m., the thing which was so ingrained in your mind that your life was not going on properly, then at 70 p.m., you get relief and you carry on, plus this.  Realization comes that man, this has to be played out like this, once something happens and I am doing about it and I am not going to tell you no, feel extremely sad and bad about it, your life moves ahead as easily as I teach in astrology. I don't know how much will be allowed to me, after this you come and tell me like this in astrology community, there is no money in everything brother, there is no money, come to me.  No one else is earning and in this anyway we should tell people, what is there in this, give me a visa, get me married to my girlfriend, get my money, get me this Tantalus, I am liking the content a lot.  It feels good to be loved by our community, it feels good to get respect, otherwise we also fight a lot among ourselves. Okay, okay, everywhere, doctors also get jealous at times, lawyers also get burnt, I am good, you are good, he is good, okay.  Okay, that's fine, and we have to tell everyone because many times, too many people like that come into the public, then what happens is that the name of astrology gets tarnished. Look, if the name of the astrologer gets tarnished, then it's okay, okay?  Astrology should not go bad. Unfortunately, astrology goes bad. It is okay here that the difference between the profession and the profession has ended. If the professional is bad then the profession also gets spoiled. Normally this does not happen in medical science.  In We Are Very Forgiving Doctor, if someone is bad, if someone has done negligence or someone has turned out to be a fraud, then we do not say that medical science is bad, we catch that doctor, he is not here, it is like this here, it is okay, so I hope you liked it.  You will definitely write in the comment section, there are small videos like this, there are small techniques you have to follow, this will work a little in the fourth house also, or try it on Sun in Cancer. Sun in Cancer in a Ninth House will work beautifully. It will work very beautifully as if there is intensity or anything has intensity, then Sun in Cancer in the Ninth House. For whom will it work? If it will be for Taurus people then it will be for Taurus people. If you check the playout a lot then you are sitting with the other wise Sun in Cancer mostly for everyone. For how many, check it in 10 horoscopes.  Variation will be more or less, will depend on other position, also will do a lot at some places, but will do it everywhere, it is not like that or not, it is not there at all in me, it is not there in me at all, then see your passion, time, two to four minutes of birth. Your passion is not changing because such things are snapshot techniques, they work, they have been tried and tested on 1000 charts, okay, 1000 plus charts and then they give less, not like this.  If it is fine, then the technique is made on thousands of charts, so it works beautifully. You people have to test this thing. I will tell you one more good thing before finishing the video, collect 10 to 15 charts with yourself. You people, whose life story you know, you don't have to go and ask whether he has got a job here, is he getting married, is it good or bad, how is his life going, how is his nature, then you check his face to see if yes, do this match. Because every time you may not be able to ask, there should be 10, 12, 15 known charts. You may have close friends, you may have relations, you may have your family, you may have parents, you may have siblings, you may have children.  You can keep at least 10 charts and you should remember at least 10 charts in your mind because if I also get a technique, we discuss it among ourselves. Whenever we have any workshops etc., we get to learn some technique, then we immediately focus on 10 charts. I remember those 10 charts in my mind and that's why immediately we come to the realization that hey, you are saying the right thing.  Satan Fifth House, friend, there is some problem in the stomach or digestion issue, it is okay, tell me, okay, this technique is very simple, I will keep telling it like this and if it happens to them a little now then  I will also tell you what to do, so it is not that I just left it like that, if there is something wrong, then I said, if you want to help indirectly, then do it indirectly. If you want to take membership of the channel, then take membership also, then started watching a lot of content. Thank you very much"

    "title": "Jyotish And Love Marriage [lkcb-IReMBI].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, astrology and love marriage, let's discuss whether you will get love marriage or not, what are the indications, there are some rules, I will tell it in a very simple way, those who have already got love marriage, see if they apply and write in the comment section, love marriage.  If you understand what love marriage is, then look at your chart, look at your horoscope, and in your horoscope, if there is any relation between your fifth house and the seventh house, if there is any relation between the fifth house and the seventh house, then your  Chances of having a love marriage increase. If the chances of love increase then we will talk about love. Today, if we talk about all the things related to love, then what is the meaning of the relationship whether your fifth lord goes to your seventh house or the seventh lord.  For example, if we take the horoscope of which zodiac sign, let's take the horoscope of Cancer, then it means that if four is written in the first house, then 4 5 6 7. 8 i.e. Scorpio Ascendant is the one, I have taken this dangerous one, Scorpio Ascendant is in the 5th house and Mars is its lord, if it goes to the 7th house, then it means love marriage will be fine or its Saturn is again, then this example is wrong.  No problem, I will tell about this also separately and because this, this, this, sorry, sorry, this, this will know why there is a problem, I will also tell about this, if I will tell about Saturn also, then there will be some other zodiac sign.  I will take it once, stop immediately, the one which should not have been taken, maybe out of 12, I chose the same one to tell, let's wait again, okay, then let's take it from late, we take the zodiac sign, we take Vargo, we take Virgo zodiac sign.  Where six is ​​written then 12 is written in the opposite of six. It is okay and its tenth sign is the fifth sign which is Saturn, then Lord Saturn goes to the seventh house or if Jupiter which is the Lord comes to the fifth house then this one.  This one will be applied, after that I will tell you the conjunctions of the lords of both the houses together. This is a little above the simple one. This is also simple. Even if their lord goes into the constellation of the other one, that is, even if the fifth lord goes into the constellation of the seventh house, then there is the link.  It's done, Nana, there has to be a link in some way, if both of them sit together, if they come inside each other, then any kind of link between F and Seventh will define that it will be a love marriage, now that will happen, how will it work?  How okay, where do they go, it will be a little advanced but still I will tell because some people are also advanced, if the fifth and seventh lord are sitting in the sixth, eighth and twelfth house, then there is a little matter, a little bit, that is okay, it is entertaining in a different way.  I never say anything wrong or bad in astrology, it does not even happen, it is okay, it is entertaining, it is a challenge, it is okay, if the seventh lord goes like fifth.  In the house, he will take some of your fame, if your partner will share it, he will also take away your virtue, that is, he will take a little bit of the seventh house, if it goes to the fifth house, then a little bit of love. I tell here about love that if Saturn comes in the fifth house.  That's why I said that example, it was if Saturn comes in the fifth house, then it is okay, then Saturn coming in the fifth house means that there will be no love marriage, anyone you know, tell me Saturn is in the fifth house.  Now the program of love has got a little spoiled, it is okay, if the Moon comes or Rahu comes, then there will be a different program, okay, then the program is different, it will work from Mercury also, love will not work from Mars, it will not work from the fifth house, it is okay.  It is okay if Mars comes in the fifth house or if Saturn comes in the fifth house then the matter will not be solved with these two planets. Even Sun of love also comes, call it cruel depth or call it a planet of people. Even Sun also comes.  Even if there is Sun in the fifth house, the situation is such that the love angle will be less. I am telling you about the three things. Okay, there are a lot of possibilities in the rest, somewhere there are multiple possibilities. It is okay to tell that Venus in the third house will help in getting attracted to the opposite gender later on. Your looks and intelligence: Have you ever wondered whether a boy is strange or even, whether a girl or a boy respects gender, that brother, check Venus third house or Jamna's or  If you are sitting with the third house especially, then write in the comment section. Today this video is on love. Love's co-youngsters also have to be added. Subscribe to the channel. I am telling things very simply. Check all this at least in the horoscopes.  You will check in 1015 and you will be seen working out everywhere, only then learn it. This is such a very simple link because it is a very common question whether I will have a love marriage or not.  Already if love is going on then it will convert into love marriage, if not then check, check how your fifth and seventh lord appears to you, is the fifth lord, seventh lord okay, is there any connection between fifth and seventh is okay, if Saturn is there.  Then that matter will happen, if it is okay then it will not be possible, this is one, Saturn will cool down wherever it goes, otherwise it will not be possible, okay, there are no simple questions like this in astrology.  I would like you all to write in the comment section the simple words which come to your mind and I will answer them in astrology way which are your real life questions which are telling you like this that we have this doubt because youngsters have a lot of  It's okay, dating and waiting person, look what's happening these days, now you guys, no, no, many people are doing love, so brother, there is talk of love marriage, so do love with someone, who can stop you from doing love?  Tax  The problem is that a lot of love is happening but it is not converting into marriage and this is a cause of great concern for many people and a cause of pain for many that if there is a love marriage then it will be a love marriage.  Is it possible that love has happened since six but marriage with the one who got it has not resulted in love marriage, this can also happen then understand otherwise many a times people leave like this and go away, love is happening to everyone, it is everyone's fifth house.  Is the Seventh House connected? Are so many people in love? No matter how many people are in love, but if the Fifth and Seventh House is connected, it will transform into marriage, then see this program will have to be done by one person and will actually work out for both of them, even if both are married.  Is it okay? If both of them are getting married then it will be a big thing. Well, look at this. If you take hold of this knowledge and learn this, then how much consultation fee can you earn from this youngster because this is the same.  So it is true that there is talk among girls that she will marry me like this or boys too, friend, see this marriage, first see the yoga, it is also possible that there is love marriage in her horoscope and you too have love marriage.  There is a combination of love in both of you but still you don't love each other because you can love anyone with any number of people, then cholery is not true but if it is not in yours then brother it is not in yours otherwise keep loving how many people.  from and  How many people still live together even after marriage? Nowadays, a little bit of love is still going on in the society. If it is still going on after marriage, then whether there is love in marriage or not, it will become a different topic or it will become a little complicated.

    "title": "Jyotish Significance Of Your Posture ｜ What You Can Learn From Faujis ？ [Sb30Yzs7MUM].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, the topic is 'What can we learn from Fauji', 'Astro' is the topic, you will speak, friend, how are you linking 'Fauji Astro', then I am going to tell you one thing very clearly, if you have seen 'Fauji' normally or if you know it or watch it on TV.  Or in movies, one of their most important thing is that normally soldiers are supposed to be healthy and fit, so even they cannot be 100% but they are there at 99%.  The general public is struggling at the age of 40, so posture is very important. Your spine is your back, it is Saturn. You look at old gurus, you look at old yoga practitioners or old people. If you are a general posture, you will keep yourself well.  Your Saturn will be fine, your spine will be fine, it is not easy these days, you are doing mobile phone like this all the time, sometimes here and there you lie down like this, I look at you, you are doing mobile on one side, it is okay, you are doing laptop.  Yes, the shoulders become like this, they become hunched, then due to all this, there are some issues in the back and spine. Of course, they appear with age, so there are issues with the spine. I also consider this with your health. Now I am linking it to the seven energy chakras and this and the heart chakra, I will not confuse them, this is simple astrology, but in general you must have seen that in olden times, sages and sages used to meditate on this and that or as many as you see in our photographs.  Gods and they will see, everything is like this, it is like I am sitting, this is not natural, I am also sharing knowledge here but it is not easy to sit like this, to sit like this for a long time, to keep the poacher like this requires an effort but people are happy in life.  To be healthy, to be successful, to reach somewhere, not to be bitter, not to be frustrated, effort is required. Effort has to be made if there is effort, then become an athlete in this video. Through this medium, you people take care of this thing and take care of your pooch, keep mobile consciously, if you have to use it, then like I tell you to use mobile only, now you have to use mobile, although I could have made this on other channels also but I will do it here again.  Also, I am having lunch on astrology only, meaning that you people should understand that if you have to use the mobile also, then there is a table lying there, your table is like this, so keep your hands on the table like this, keep the mobile in front of you like this, your head should not be below the lab like this.  I shouldn't be in this  The name laptop has definitely been coined but don't work in the lab. Keep it on the table. Now, as I am making a video, I have to keep it on the eye side of my shooting lens, otherwise the glans will remain below and almost above that.  Keep it according to your height. Whatever your screen is, keep it. When your neck is not like this, just your Saturn is fine, everything is fine for you because the power to do that work comes from within, only Saturn provides it, so keep your screen.  rear right  Learn it from the Arm Forces. In the Arm Forces, there is some training that goes beyond what they are taught. It is always said in it that keep your posture straight, keep your chest behind like this, do all the deliberation behind like this. Do it a little like this, the haunch comes forward, move it towards the back and I am telling you one thing which is very good for the neck too. By the way, it is okay that you can lie down in the corner of the bed like this anytime, lower your head a little like this and neck like this.  On the contrary, there is a corner of such a bed, there is no head rest, so you will not be able to turn your back. There is a head rest, but on the side where you land, sit on the side and try to turn your head back like this. It gives a lot of relief because this one is ours all the time.  I am not able to do what I am doing like this, this is not possible, I remain down like this all the time, try it, focus a lot on this, focus a lot on correcting your back, there is a lot of balancing in your life. balance in place  You will go to many places, if you get balance then improve this and keep it as a priority. Do share this video. I have tried to tell you according to astrology, I am fine but strength is your core, it is the inner core and it is also a source of pain. Shani, if you know this then the pain will also reduce if he gets cured, you have fixed it, you have fixed the spine and poster, you have fixed your Shani, it takes effort, right now I am sitting like this, it feels like effort to hunch like this.  It is very easy to sit, you see all the sick people who go to the hospital, those who are already sick, they are like this, that is, now they are like this because they cannot be like this because they are sick, now the person with cholera, he has become like this, so he is sick.  If you are sick, then you became like this or is there any link with being sick, because I have not made it for the scientific research and proof anywhere else and I am saying only then after making it in astrology, brother, try it on your doctor for 21 days. pay attention please  Don't watch your TV lying down like this. Don't watch the screen in bed. Don't look straight like this. Do n't study like this. This one is studying like this. He is talking on the phone like this. Many people have this habit like this.  On the phone, you are doing this on your own, I am showing you why you were doing something else like this, okay, you should not talk on the phone even after doing this because somewhere, it becomes like this, like this.  Use that system with earphones, isn't it Bluetooth or is it the best?  Put your efforts and work in it and talk about it and then the scientific people from beyond will also come to that and say, fix your pot now, the most important message of all is thank you."

    "content": "Hello friends, do you follow horoscopes? Earlier, you used to remember the horoscopes in newspapers and Chutku Chutku used to come, okay, and now a days, if the year goes very well on YouTube, then there is a lot of worry, this will go bad, that will happen and it will affect these four zodiac signs.  There will be a shower of money. Okay, see which one is mine. Right now there is a conflict whether it is the Sun sign, Moon sign or the Ascendant sign or that, people do n't have the knowledge about it, but the second thing I want to tell you is that brothers and sisters, please listen to this.  Don't waste your time friend, don't get involved in this, everyone is sitting with their own work, whoever knows permutation combinations, according to that 11000 crores is fine, combinations can be made, in astrology, there is that much population of 800 crores, the public is just fine right now, so quite unique  That's right, even a very rich man will suffer a loss of money, but the bread- winner will not suffer, so what you should do instead is try to learn a little bit of astrology instead of putting in so much time and for this I am making such a lovely announcement.  I am you  For all the people, on 6th January and 7th January, for ultra beginners, who do n't know much about astrology, we are conducting a workshop for two hours plus two hours on both days, Saturday and Tuesday from 5:00 to 7:00 pm, apart from that, all the basics will be taught very well.  It will be explained so that if you are interested in astrology then do not waste your time, at least you will get to know who is speaking sense and who is speaking nonsense, you will learn to do A B C D and A for apple B for boy if you read through English  If I tell you, then you have to pay only ₹2500000 which is the short form of ultra beginner, 95 rupees, even pizza is expensive than this, veg pizza is also expensive nowadays, it is okay because and you will get a recording of four hours, if you are not able to attend for some reason  Or if you are able to attend only for one day, or are busy in some wedding function or party, even then you will get the recording, you will get access to it, you can listen to it comfortably and if you come with your family, you will get to learn a lot from it in this new year. Slots are of course limited  There is no unlimited facility for anything because it is conducted on one platform, so quickly you could have done it on WhatsApp2, just spend Rs. 295 for four hours, in it you will be told everything, zodiac signs, houses, planets, many things in a proper manner, your basics will become completely strong And those who know astrology must join it because many times it is necessary to revise the basics. Many times you have gone so far ahead, gone to Ashtavargam, went to Vim Sotri, reached the Nakshatra level but this one asks you about the water element.  What is your zodiac sign?

    "content": "Hello friends, today I have come with a very interesting topic in simple astrology for you brothers and sisters. If you have not subscribed the channel yet then subscribe. There are lakhs of channels on astrology but no one is explaining the technicalities in such a simple and easy way. More people are going into ' Which is okay' but then not many people are able to connect with it because they get overloaded, so today I am going to teach you the topic, I will tell you about the whole planet.  How to remember them and how to associate with them because our old gurujis used to give knowledge in India through imagination and stories and they did not forget that many people ask a question in conjunction with this. How will it be if I sit together, I will cover all that further, mine is this, mine is that, so first start remembering this planet, then you will know which one is where and how I associate.  If I do today, through the popular characters, I will associate each planet with a character so that next time whenever you get a question, if that character comes to your mind, then you will understand its traits well, otherwise I will explain it anyway.  If you give that then I will explain further individually, I will also tell you that the Sun is like this, the Moon is like this, everyone is like this and this is how it is seen, but today I want to tell you in a simple way, let us start from the Sun.  Whenever Sun is talked about, Sun is talked about, who is Sun, when Sun is talked about in astrology, then people literally start thinking that this one is our Sun, this one is ours, this is how you should look at Sun like this.  That is, you have to associate the character with Sun, a self righteous king, the character for that which comes very easily in my mind is Prabhu Shri Ram, Righteousness Discipline and Raja Tej, so you associate this with it, second one.  Now whenever the moon is there, whenever the moon is talked about, wherever anything happens, the moon is sitting there, this is sitting, this is good or bad, this is good, this is bad, then you get into character for the moon, a moody queen, consider the moon as a queen and  She is also moody, her mood keeps changing, sometimes happy, sometimes sad, sometimes angry, sometimes love. This is such a moody queen who has mood swings. That queen queen is special because both of them are royal planets. Sun and Moon are royal planets.  Okay, now let's move ahead, Mars after Mars Moon, now Mars eats Mars, my Mars is strong, Mars is there, Mars will not exist without Mars, now which character should we put in our mind, where our Mars is there, no one can defeat us there, this is me completely.  Whatever is coming out of my mouth right now, I will tell you further, Sarata, it's okay, I sat down with passion, so what about Mangal, how are we, identification, who are we, look at the feeling of Mangal, first I told you Lord Shri Ram, you can have whatever you want in Lord Shri Ram, Arun Govil ji.  Do you remember that character or any other character because you want to associate the face also? You associate the face with the queen, associate the word, make notes, you will remember your life very easily, otherwise you will always be confused, just like in the basics of astrology.  Let me teach you and explain, no one is saying this, okay, it is the moon, Mars is the army commander, the army commander is also the one who is sitting on the horse, the enemy's army ahead is very big, okay, and he has a sword in his hand and there is no fear on his face. How much army is there behind this? This is the material. There is an army behind this too. This commander is Mars. This commander is the commander of the gods. Okay, now the order has come to him, from whom is the king, who is the king? So for Mars, this is to do and die not to ask why, okay. If you look at today's army, no matter how old the commander is, he does not ask why, it is the job of a king to think, it is the job of the sun to think, it is the job of Marx to think.  It is not the work of Marx, it is to cut and kill, so now you will understand why you become like this in some sphere, why you do not remain under control and why do not you think because it is Mars, now there is this thing which this video of mine is very high point.  There is a video, this is a formula, like in old times they used to prepare for IIT with brilliant tutorials and they used to give the key, that book with the formula is available everywhere, studies will continue, videos will come later, but this is when  Also, feel free to watch this video to see who told what, what is Mars, that army commander in English in Hindi, the commander sitting on a horse, on whom there is no fear, he has orders, he has to lead, he will not be able to do it, he will not be able to do it, he is not thinking behind.  The army is big or small, it has nothing to do with who is ahead, it has nothing to do with it, it is very comfortable and is moving ahead, so you all remember this character, as you must have seen it in some movies, right? movies happen  That he is sitting in front, doing like this, and in front, he is like this, all around him is like this, and he is sitting like this, there was also a movie doing 300, if you have seen it, where I get released like that, there must have been a lot of Hindi movies too, these are English movies.  Pick a character to visualize yourself, I have defined the character very well. Now let's move forward. Next comes Mercury. Now by what will we define Mercury? To understand, Mercury is such a planet.  I used to say Prince as Prince Rajkumar Rajkumar means child, I will say a curious child, now find out in your family, relatives or anyone, who is that curious child who has to know everything, what is this, how does this happen, he will ask questions wherever Mercury is. Your curiosity is there because Chhotu is a child and Chhotu is a child so whoever sits with him becomes the same, he is a child and not an army commander, change happens so quickly, now when I teach further, then you will know, but that is why I am here.  I am giving little hints so that you watch this video very seriously, you are enjoying, learning is also having fun, but whenever you ask next time how is Marge Mercury, then visualize it.  Take that friend, a small child is sitting with the army commander, so how is it, no one is very great, he said, he is an army commander, the child is fine, you understand what I am saying, Moon is fine with Mercury, she is a queen, she is also a child, so that ahead  You will understand later, but for now, remember the character, inquisitive child, a child who is intelligent and curious is also okay, then let's move ahead, Guru Jupiter, so visualize Jupiter, you are a round and round person, okay, the one with a smile on the face. Relax a little bit fat. Look at any person in your life who is happy, lucky but also wise and he is so wise that the knowledge he gets from him is very practical.  He can give you that knowledge very easily and simply. This is the Guru Tatva of a Guru. From the basic and after that you will feel like sitting, you will get coolness, you will get pause, even if he does not say anything, you will feel like going to him. This is the one whenever you next  If you do, then wherever this Jupiter is sitting, your stay is fine. Now I will tell you about those visions, I will also tell you the conjunction, but if you want to find a character for the guy, then find a character like this. Now you will say, he is fat or not thin. His trait is life and stagnation, that's why he has become fat and he will go to the gym, then he is not there, he is not going in the circle of good and bad, he should take care of his health, don't get into that in my character.  According to this, I am telling you a happy go lucky wise intelligent man, he can be anyone in your life and even a woman, okay then you adopt someone, next time whenever you check, you should remember that character, let's move ahead.  venus Venus means like it is Friday, we will say Venus, we will say Shukracharya, now you have to see Venus, instead of giving her character, I will give her some qualities, then you put your own in it, Venus is your grace, Venus is luxury, any luxurious thing, any thing.  It has a fragrance, it is beautiful to look at, it is a flower, if you believe that you feel good after looking at it, it is Venus, anything which is good to look at, which is good to touch, which is a luxury, it has a fragrance.  Well, she is Venus, so the spouse is also called Venus, ideally she should have those traits, but nowadays, the way marriage is going on, so many of the wrong things happen in it, so that is why I denote it as spouse, but by the way, I told you that luxury is a lot.  A good car, a very nice bed, Venus, everything that is good in it is grand, clean, some area, some place, some country is also clean and beautiful, a good country is also Venus, where you feel like going, where you feel like working.  Wherever you feel like staying, stay wherever you like only that thing, seeing that thing and feeling it, a good painting, a good song, it is also okay, so in that also I will tell you further which is the better Venus and how it is on Venus.  It is okay for you to remember this and then move ahead. Whenever Shani Shani comes, you have to see five or six things in Shani. I will tell you five or six things. Don't get distracted but understand that an old man who is a beggar and a poor person is also a poor beggar old man.  Who  He is also a little lame i.e. handicapped and also has leprosy which you can understand by meaning the one who can do as much as he can i.e. everything has been included in it, so you can understand it according to the money within the social status of a particular section of the society. Okay, if the identification that my Shani and Moon are together then how is it because now it is like this and she is the turned queen, made both of them sit together then see how is it, okay then that Sun and Shani are made to sit as king one  Man, then how would you feel? Understand yourself, do you understand why it is important to tell this, otherwise you will keep asking. Today you have to give a definition. Someone has to give a characterisation, no, but my Shani is like this, have I become like this?  No no friend, we are teaching you to get involved in it like this, you are teaching us the trait, not that something is happening to someone, it is okay, Saturn also gives a lot, what is the work of Saturn, isn't it, work is boring, basically, you are getting benefit from all these things.  You can remember the character that when it comes, you have to remember this which Guru ji told, not only the old poor, also very poor, that means bagger, I said bagger must be poor, then handicap disease is also there, so are n't all handicaps like this? How many things am I telling you, I am old, handicapped, poor, and even illness, even illness, has taken me towards leprosy. It is okay to do this and that, so it is okay to show this thing to you like this, now the last two. Favorite Rahu and Ketu is the one for Rahu which I have understood as a character. If you have seen the movie Padmaavat then Ranveer Singh has a character in it, the character he has played, you should remember that of Khilji whose eyes are the same as mine.  All you need is that attitude, it will help you to understand Rahu. Was he the elusive type, was powerful, was cunning and mean, was obsessive, was stubborn, all that was the way to you, you saw.  The real Khilji in the movie was worse than him and was useless. We will not go into history. We have to understand the character. We have to do our key to understand the astrology further. So, you can associate Ranveer Singh's Khilji with the character displayed in that movie. Take it, whenever you come next time, where is Rahu because what does Rahu want, there is also unsatisfied pun, there is a pun, peda pun, they understand that there is a thing in Marathi, so who will you relate to it, then that one. We are carrying all these characters in our body as elements, it is there, there is also Vitamin A, B, Ba, Cb, all these, everything and everyone is needed, I am not telling anyone here that it is bad, every friend is necessary, everyone.  One planet is present in our constitution, some elements are more in our personality, some are less, that is astrology, if you understand this thing that all these are within us, some have more of some, some have less.  There is a personality in it, if you are facing problem then you just have to change a little bit in these, this is the only solution, this is the consultation, it is so simple, you have to see the last one, you have to see that dialogue of Ek Fakir, have you heard that dialogue of Kisi Ka Hum To Fakir Hain?  Yes, we will leave with the bag. Now I am not speaking against that person but I am saying to focus on the dialogue that there is a beggar and detachment, someone who is a stranger these days, a beggar.  If you don't meet then it's fine but visualize it, you are also called Sambuddha, by the way, take that significant one, do you remember whenever there was a verse, the flag used to go first, always that flag is your Ketu, Ketu is your roots, understand that if you are connected to something.  Those are the roots, Ketu is very deep, Rahu's banara is a little too much, it bites, it is only Ketu that gives trouble, okay, Rahu is the air, Ketu is the desire, Ketu is the pain from Ketu, the roots are there, so like you  If you go immediately and get out of here, then that pain is there. Ask every person who is sitting outside, does he have any pain? Pain is inside everyone, it is not like that, but there should not be any pain there, but still there is pain because of the shaking of the roots. So I hope you guys must have understood it very well. We are doing the workshop on 6th and 7th January 2024. It is for very ultra beginners.

    "title": "Rashi Lords ｜ Rashi Ke Swami [IgKoBY0IHa0].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today we will discuss about the lords of the zodiac signs and the lords of the zodiac signs and we will understand them well that brother, whatever is the zodiac sign, who is its lord, its lord will be a planet and that zodiac sign will belong to that planet, it is its lord.  Owner can speak and the house it is in can be called Lagnesh II III IV i.e. the zodiac sign in the fourth house. Chaturthesh means who is the lord of the zodiac sign in the fourth house, so people in it.  People get confused in these words and this can also be called Bhavesh. Bhavesh, the lord of the fourth house, can also be called like this. People get confused in these words. I am going to explain it to you easily. Now we will discuss all the twelve zodiac signs of Paro and their Swami, I will tell you that it is okay to note them down and I will also tell you about some methods to remember them. We know that we have nine planets, Rahu and Ketu are now simple astrology, initially we remove them.  Because they are Lords etc., there is no need to understand them right now, you will come to know about them later when the classes will start, now we will only talk about the ones from Monday to Sunday, our Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn and Sun. Okay, so this is  There are seven planets and how many zodiac signs they have. There are 12 zodiac signs. This is the lord of these 12 zodiac signs. If we do the following then first of all we will start that who is the lord of the zodiac sign Aries, Aries, Mars. Write this. Take the Lord of Aries is Mars, Lord of Aries is Mars, write it down, okay, you just have to remember this, the second zodiac sign comes, your Taurus zodiac sign comes, Taurus zodiac sign comes, its lord is Venus, write down okay, the third zodiac sign. Gemina comes, okay Gemina, the lord of Gemini is Mercury, the lord lord of Gemina, whatever you want to say, who is she, Mercury, then comes the fourth zodiac sign.  Now I will tell you a little bit about remembering them at the end so that you get a little idea. Three, four, we have done it. Okay, fourth is Cancer. Cancer zodiac sign is their lord. Moon means Moon. Fourth zodiac is okay. Fifth is Leo.  Its lord is Leo, Sun, note it down and write it down. Okay, the sixth zodiac sign is yours, Virgo. Who is its lord again? Mercury is Mercury. Okay, Seven zodiac signs, where seven is written, sign where P is the horoscope.  I will explain it again and again in a simple manner so that the confusion is clear in every video. Wherever seven is written in our horoscope, seven is written, it is the sign of Libra, it is Libra and its lord is Venus, Venus, eight, eight, wherever it is written.  That is Scorpio Scorpio its lord is Mars Okay ninth is our Sagittarius Sagittarius its lord is Jupiter Tenth is our Capricorn Capricorn Capricorn is its lord  Saturn is the 11th sign, our Aquarius is Aquarius ascendant, its lord is Saturn and our 12th sign is Pisces, its lord is Jupiter, so if you have not noticed yet, then let me tell you, Sun has only one sign, Ch is Leo and Moon. Which is Cancer? It is one sign of both Sun and Moon and what is easy? Four and Five will be written. Where four is written, it is Cancer and its  The lord is Moon and where five is written, it is Leo, its lord is Surya and Sun, okay, this thing is cleared, the remaining five planets, every planet has got two zodiac signs, ownership 5 * 2, 10 and these are 11 and 12.  If you go then it means that you have two zodiac signs of Mars. Now in this way you understand that again there are two zodiac signs of Mars, One and A where it is written i.e. Eris and Scorpio.  Venus i.e. Venus has two zodiac signs T and Sen i.e. Taurus and Libra, Taurus and Libra are two zodiac signs of Mercury, Three and Six are written wherever it is, Gemina and your Vargo, Gemini is the lord of Virgo, Put is its two zodiac signs, Jupiter has two zodiac signs.  Na and 12 where nine and 12 are written i.e. Sagittarius and Sagittarius and Saturn's two zodiac signs are Capricorn and Aquarius. Now you have to see that these two  Even though the lord of the zodiac signs is the same, Mars of Eris, which says that in Aries, the energy is of these plates, this has to be remembered whenever we say that whoever is the lord of that house is the lord of the zodiac sign, if it becomes his house then his energy.  So they will come whether it is in that house or not, now I am explaining it to you in a simple way, but despite being the same planet, its energies vary a bit, so the energy of Mars is that of Aries. Taurus is different from Mars in Scorpio. Let me explain it beautifully further. When I explain the zodiac signs in detail, I will not explain the zodiac sign to you. Okay, but now you should understand that this was basic, this is what we have to learn, we just have to learn it, there is a lot of brain in it.  You don't have to put it because what is this terminology? Whenever you learn anything, you should know its terms. The whole game has to be played using these. 12 zodiac signs, 12 houses, nine planets, that's it.  I am teaching you guys very easily, comfortably and leisurely. I hope you guys are enjoying. In the comment section you will find a special Mera Astro Was a whatsapp-web. I will tell you things and then I will also keep a session on doubts. So, I am teaching one on one very well and in a simple manner. Please utilize it and spread it out to all the people who are interested in these things. Thank you very much."

    "title": "Rashis In Your Lagan Kundli Or D1 Chart [C-MaOCW_l5Q].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, right now I am teaching the basics of astrology, I am getting very good response from you people, people are enjoying it, I have to tell you very easily through small videos and I am a teacher sitting in the mind of a new learner.  I am teaching it by myself, that is why its name is Saral Jyotish. There are lakhs of other wise channels, but when the basic things are not clear there, then they just trickle in and you start listening to them and then  If you get confused, I am clearing the base for you here through videos, today we will discuss only our total of zodiac signs, how many zodiac signs are there in 12 zodiac signs, now whenever you see the zodiac signs, whenever that chart opens in the software, in any Nowadays, there are many apps, if you look at your horoscope, there is a D-One chart in it, which is called your ascendant horoscope, then you will find the zodiac signs written inside it, numbers will be found, if the name is not written then one, if there is one, there is one.  Your zodiac sign is Aries. Two is correct. That is Taurus. Three is your gemina. Fourth is your cancer. Cancer is five. Where it is written, that is Leo. Six. Where it is written is Vargo. That is your Virgo. Seven.  Wherever your number is written, that is your Libra. Eight, wherever it is written, that is your Scorpio. Nine, wherever it is written, that is your Sagittarius. 10 Wherever it is written, that is your That's.  Capricorn is Capricorn, where it is written, 11 is Aquarius, where it is written, it is Aquarius and the last one is Pisces, 12 is not written there and it can be different for everyone, husband can be different, wife can be different, children can also be different.  But this is a promoted combination, it will rotate within 12 days only, hence now everyone's planets in it can be different as to who has different planets in each zodiac sign, whatever is your devan chart. This is your selfie of the universe at the time when you were born, which planet was visible in which zodiac sign, how it was in the constellation, and so I understood this as a basic thing which I will repeat again and again in numbers easily because which  Of course, this is very important for beginners, but those who know astrology will say, 'Dude, this may happen to you too in this class. After 20 videos, things may start coming to you which you don't know, but here also I am saying something like this.  Maybe I will tell you which will reinforce you because maybe you too, if you have to teach astrology to someone, then it comes to this level and he holds the finger and teaches like A for Apple. Some people are being taught in that way because they get confused as soon as it opens. People simply assume that the astrologers who teach this for the beginners class, that you must know this much, I am repeating it again and again, the zodiac signs are not written by name, they are written by number.  If it is then you will not find Scorpio and that written anywhere, you will find planets written there and you will not find house written there, you will have to calculate like this and you will know. I hope you have learned so much in this time. Thank you very much."

    "title": "Sade Sati Explained In Detail [_Wb6wqEjS24].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today let's discuss a little about Sade Sati, it is a very deep topic and it scares many people, this word is fine, Sade Sati is going on, so first of all let's understand where Sade Sati is happening and from where.  If seen, it is a very simple thing, it is seen from your Moon sign, whatever your Moon is, from the Moon sign, where the Moon is sitting, then wherever the Moon is sitting, in whatever sign it is sitting, if yours is fine, then the Moon sign is  If you become Lagan, then it is okay, if Moon becomes Lagan, then it will be the first house. Okay, so now whenever Shani Maharaj is above the 12th Lagan or in the second house from that Lagan, then it is the period of Sade Sati. Shani Maharaj spends his two and a half years.  The whole cycle is completed in 30 years and if one stays in one house in one zodiac sign for two and a half years then Saade Sati means one two three 2 and a half nothing is considered one and a half.  Sati, this one thing has been understood, you people will discuss it very easily, how it feels, what happens, so first of all, a little definition has become clear, today when we are making this video, Shani Maharaj is talking about his  Aquarius is in the Aquarius sign, that is, wherever 11 is written in your horoscope, wherever that 11 is written, that 11 can be anywhere for everyone, okay, but if it is in that 11, then if your Moon is of Capricorn sign.  Either one is of Aquarius or Pisces sign, then your Sade Sati is going on, what kind of time is going on, please write in the comment section whether the watt is connected, is it being cut, is it going well, is it going bad, then write then they will share it with each other.  It hurts to discuss, when many people feel pain, when many people write that yes, it is like yes, something is happening, should we be very worried about this, should we do it, no, it is not like that, it is not at all, is this thing okay?  These Apart from both of these, I will also tell you one more thing, I will give a little hint about that, we will make it later. Shani ji also has Dhaiya. Dhaiya is the one which goes from the fourth house or the eighth house from your Moon sign.  Shani's Dhaiya is also called, now what is it that friend, this is also considered bad, so three houses, these are two and a half years, two and a half years, these are 123, so these are the remaining 30 years.  If Saturn is passing over Rahu, then there is pain, so there is no need to panic now, otherwise it will happen sooner or later, if you calculate more carefully, then at the time of 50, in the period of 30 years, there will be pain due to some or the other unpleasing.  We understand sorrow, we understand bad time, while unpleasing time, job, right relationship, right money, right health, sometimes no one always remains like this, Sade Sati is there in the average life of every person.  A good number of years are lived, the minimum comes twice and even thrice depending on if it came in childhood, if like you it comes at the age of 510, then the next one will come in 40 and then the last one will come in 70.  It is possible that you may not be able to see the 100 plus one, generally the younger one has more watts because when you are in childhood, there are some issues but father and mother are busy.  So if they don't do anything then most of the issues do not happen, neither are there much relationship issues nor are there job issues, there are not that kind of issues nor are there money issues because they are children, although there are some problems and issues.  Also the child is not like that, it remains exactly like childhood, there is something or the other, small or minor, but we let it go because now what can the child do, what will the child do, it is that he also eats.  If you take bath on time, study and take care of yourself then it is not that difficult because those variations are not as much as those which come in old age and give some physical trouble and some emotional trouble if you are in your 60s and 70s.  It gives okay but it is not as painful as the period of your 20's, 30's, 40's or 50's. This is the period of 40 years, so how many of you are Capricorn right now? Lagan is in which Capricorn Lagan means Capricorn moon sign hair not talking about Ascendant D and Ascendant of the chart, I am not talking about Moon sign here because Saturn affects the mind the other way, all the transits etc. you are normal D and  These are seen from the chart but this one which is a transit, we see it more from the Moon because it affects the conjunction of Saturn and Moon and many people call this yoga as Vish Yoga.  If we talk about emotions, then how can it be explained as an example when someone starts having emotions, it is as if you were sitting in a forest of animals, comfortably, I mean, let me tell you as an example.  Is it summer time or can you tell from winter time also? The video is being made in winter or I quote a little summer example so I will tell you from the same, you can visualize a little, although it is winter right now.  It is going on but you think, May the fierce heat of passion is going on, you are comfortably sitting in your AC, you are comfortably giving some of your TV CV, some of your whole self is coming, your juice is coming, talking is going on, everything is chirping.  There is a smell, there is an environment of fragrance, if this is going on, then it will be like Sade Sati will come, first of all it will be like this, the AC has turned off, now if the AC has turned off, then it is not that there will be any big thing in life, but a discomfort.  Initially it came, okay when it comes, like Shani Maharaj's arrival comes slowly, so as if the AC has been switched off, then you are having some trouble, you are not enjoying that much, now then slowly that cold cold was coming.  He stops coming, people start getting up and leaving, those who were sitting to entertain themselves, it was fun, a school of fun was going on, they also leave, after that slowly it seems that man, that fan is on.  he was staying  It also became slow, then that fan also became slow, then it became known that the fan also stopped, okay, now I am telling you further as an example and the fan also stopped, there is also water, people also moved here and there.  AC also got switched off then something like this happened where you were sitting in that room then you went outside somewhere under the tree, under the shade of the tree, it is hot but now you are under the shade of the tree and you suddenly like that friend  it came out  Now slowly the heat also started moving, then the dust also started moving, then I came to know that the shadow of the tree also went away, then it starts doing like this and suddenly when you do that situation of your AC in that situation, then disbelieve.  The system becomes like why is this happening, why is the AC not going, why is the AC not coming, how did this happen to me, I start feeling like this and all these things happen more at the level of mind than what happens at the real level.  that would have happened  It is 20 30 40 but it also happens in real level also in physical plane also there are wrong issues but people around, relationship issues, job issues, money issues, an element of humin also comes in. This is your testing time and also payback time, Shani. Yes, God is the God of Justice, you will get it as you have lived your life, so whenever this is going on in this time and especially now, Capricorn and Capricorn moon sign, Aquarius moon sign and  Pisces, the moon sign of Aquarius, Pius and Capricorn, how is the progress of those who are sitting with their moon, how are you feeling now? It is okay, you write it, Aries will also come from next year, it is okay, before that, the period of Sagittarius and Taurus is over.  A year ago, depending on two and a half and 5 years ago. Okay, tell me how it was 4 years ago. First, tell me how it was for those who were cut and those who are running. So, you cannot influence many things in this.  You cannot change things, you do not have to be helpless, you have to keep working on it, your first realization within 73 Sati will be when Sade Sati has started well, initially you will feel uncomfortable, then when it starts well, you will feel that  In the first time no work will be done, no work has to be done, no train ticket has to be booked, plane ticket has to be booked, some thing has to be done, the first site will be roamed, you will see anything, small work has to be done and the school fees have to be paid.  The guy will not be found, it's okay, if you take out the car, you would get stuck in the traffic jam, but that feeling will be too much that I can't do any work in one go, in Sade Sati, work will be done in the third time, it will not be done in the first and second time, this is a  If the general pattern is formed, then when the work is done in the third time, then you have to understand that the work is being done in the first time only, then your pain will go away because if you think about it, it is bound to happen in the first and second time, so if  sow if anyone happens  It is very pleasant, something good is happening to me, that is the one, you have to work hard within it, you have to work hard within it, you have to work a lot within it, now keep working hard without what is there, now Geeta ji says that there is no desire of the moment.  The desire of the moment is not to do it right now, keep working, what do many people do, they give up at the half-century mark, if you keep your neck down and keep working quietly, then you will have to wait till the last 2.5, 2.5, 3 years, the period ends.  You will start getting positive results even before your last dhaiya, which is the first dhaiya, which if I give an example, the first two and a half years, which is the dhaiya, is like your AC has just been turned off, then your people have gone, then your water is purified and  The cold which was coming has gone, it happens in the second one, you are standing outside in the sun, which I told you about the second one, that now this is the peak, the heat wave is also going on, even standing in the sun, you are getting worried too.  There is no help available, it becomes like a peak period, the peak is called Sade Sati, which is fine and then it is about to go and it affects many people inside the body in such a way that initially they get headache.  There will be pain in the upper body parts, then at some places digestion issues will start, it seems that some or the other thing is going on everywhere, so one has to concentrate very quietly and they go to the unpleasant a lot and this thing is also mentioned in astrology.  Is made bigger, it is also a fact that brother, if you are doing only half and a half, then what will happen to everyone, who is not coming, then they will tell you something, someone got a lot of peak in Sade Sati.  It was found that this is what happens to you, Rajyoga is the factor, they will show the horoscope of any politician and show that he has become the PM, in this he has become like this, Oh brother, he was living his life in poverty, if you think of this then it is okay.  For him  It was not making any difference to him, since the time he was born, Sade Sati was going on, so there is no difference in this Sade Sati, the person you tell me has been sitting under the sun since the beginning, he was not even sitting in the AC, his Sade Sati What difference does it make if she also comes, these people don't understand that now he is a rickshaw puller who is working hard, he is sweating every day, he is working hard, it will not affect him that much, these touch me notes affect him more, do you understand?  yes my word man  Shani, how can you avoid this? I can also tell you some tips to reduce its effect a little. Normally, not many people tell such things so quickly because there is water in it, it is okay, so one tip is very good if your Sade Sati is going on.  It is in the evening time when the sun is setting and the night is coming. Take a walk in the evening time. You are okay. Also look at your 11th house or Saturn which rules your part which is above the feet, what is your knee called?  below from  You get knee pain and if you walk the area below the knee, your muscles will get better relief. You will definitely walk for an hour in the evening. You will get a lot of relief. The walk had started. The day was waning and the walk would have been for one hour.  If it is over then you do this in the dark and in the evening you can use desi ghee or whatever you like. Here in South India, where desi ghee is not so prevalent in any natural oil which is acceptable.  There are many things like mustard oil, any oil, natural oil, whatever you say, you light a lamp inside it, it will tell you two things very easily, there are many other things also, but there is no need to spend much money on either of these. So you do both these things and in this time it is time to introspect and time to prepare for the bigger because this Sade Sati will shake you and change you as a person.  The person has to be changed, the person has to be made better, if you register it, I have seen that in normal time, a lot of people register, first two and a half years pass in disbelief, who does not even know what he has been through, what can be done through this video. I am helping you brother, if you have Moon in Aries and your start will be one and a half to two years in advance, then get mentally, physically, emotionally and financially ready, that's okay.  If you see someone going on the road, they write, or even your government writes that the road ahead is bad, be careful, now how will the road get repaired, you have to be careful, so don't drive, don't drive on 90, it is your accident prone area.  Suppose you are walking a little carefully, just this and that period, through that path in the journey of life, as I told you, everyone has to go through it at least twice, if not thrice, then the more you learn from it, the calmer you will be.  You will remain as you are on Saturdays, do not eat non-veg, do not drink alcohol, it helps, it helps that you have made a conscious effort from within, putting in that conscious effort, putting a little control on your mind will give you peace, otherwise they will come under pain, why wouldn't I? Nothing happens like this, it doesn't happen, it doesn't happen to them, then people start asking a lot of questions, it does n't happen to these foreigners, it happens to Indians, what is this concept, is it somewhere?  Be born too, see, if you want to live in all these things, then yes, live in it, it doesn't matter, nothing happens, it's all nonsense, it's okay, but if there is some problem and you want to fix it, you want to understand that period, then you have an idea.  Well, every one who is 2.5, 2.5, his flavor and template will also be different, even the challenges will also be different, some things will be expected, some will expect a lot, some will expect a lot, that means you will be very  Now what should I tell you, write down what is Aspet, whoever knows Hindi, it is okay, it means it will irritate you in a way, tired, very tired, very tired, helplessness, hopeless, it will give you this kind of feeling, it should not be there because you have to know that it is like this.  I have to keep doing my work, you have to be process driven and procedure driven in this year and a half, what is the process of anything, that it has to happen, it just has to be done like this.  You have to do this, you have to get up, you have to exercise, you have to earn money, you have to do this, if there is a promotion, it will happen, if there is no, then it will not happen, because in this, how will you face problems again and again, how will you face problems in the job, and you are not getting the due respect and promotion.  The boss is not meeting you, you are doing such things, this is what and what is the third and fourth thing, if it is okay in the job, then brother, you have to keep doing your work quietly, you will keep doing whatever work you are able to do, then you will get as much as you can.  You will get relief and when the time comes, if you have performed properly including all the previous threads, there will be a paper check, then you will get it and you have not learned anything by crying and suffering like this and have taken yourself down, basically this.  It is time to take yourself up at the level of spirituality, at the level of knowledge, at the level of wisdom, to reduce the yearning at the level of stagnation and to take yourself up on all these things but normally.  What people focus on is how sexy my looks, how much money has increased and how much my fame has increased and how much followers have increased, this is what I focus on because these things that I told you are not a trifle, how much wisdom is there within you.  There is no parameter because the parameter that is tested is knowledge, not wisdom. Well, how much better should a person be as a person from within you in reality, because no one is checking. There is no parameter, but there  You have to concentrate here, you will neither see the bank balance increasing much nor the net worth increasing much, you will see some losses, investments will be seen getting stuck at some places. Such an environment will come and since our focus should be on the intangible things, I also say that the tange force should be on things. Take it because you can count only those, it is okay, but at this time, you have to focus a little on these things, this is the message, the rest of the nine people who are sitting with the nine zodiac signs are not theirs.  If it's going on, then focus on other things, do your work, spend money, do it on everyone, they can do these things, brother, those who are going on, take a little deep breath, you mean become the basis for doing something big.  There have been many people who did good and behaved well in life during Sade Sati. As soon as Sade Sati is over, they got relief along with it and those who kept wasting their time are nothing but during Sade Sati. stuck in your addiction  What happens in this, Nana, I have seen that people who are already addicted to alcohol and cigarettes increase it at this time or some people start a new one, because I will cover that too someday, that they fell into the pit like this. Feeling enjoyed, to deal with that thing and come out of it, we take all these things to come out at the mind level because your mind is very affected, life is going on like this in the real plane, the outsider does not know.  It will be okay, your Sade Sati is going on but you will have such a feeling in your mind that you are sitting, the cake is being cut, a birthday party is taking place, people are clapping, everyone is generally happy, there is no reason to cry, there is nothing, but there is a feeling inside you.  There will be pain, there will be sadness, there will be no joy, these are traits and if these are traits, then accept them and live with them. Yes moral of the story is there will be unpleasing, nice deal.  With it, you can't run away from it, as I always tell myself whenever I talk to clients or those who are half-assed about something, like it's a river of fire, you can't go under it, you can't go over it.  You can't bypass it, you can't avoid it, you have to go through it by doing it like this, brother, when you have to go through it, take support, take guidance from an astrologer. Don't go to all these people for this thing that whatever is happening with us, brother, this should not happen to you, people will give you the strength to bear it, the genuine ones, the good ones, the good ones, and they will increase the strength to bear it, but that  I will not use the word pain because of the pleasure, but whether they are unpleasing, businessmen, very rich people, beautiful people, successful people, everyone has gone through it and the one who kept doing his work quietly has achieved a lot.  I have seen the heights, I think one of the persons I know is Amitabh Bachchan, it is okay and I have given a lot of hits because his focus remained on work, my penis started hurting, it is okay, I have issues, but my butt is bruised, if the focus remains on work, then he will achieve.  Even if you do it then you are unpleased that you cannot achieve things because you will have to be at it but that will distract the mind, it is called defeating the mind and If you win, don't lose from your mind. At this time, there are especially good astrologers who explain that they do it, they will not let you lose from your mind, they will say, I am coming, bear it, then what happened, he is like this, he is like this, he is ill-mannered.  He did it like this, he did it no better than me, hey, he was always like this, it will always be like this, if you go then control yourself, not your tomorrow, my boss did it like this, he did it, the boss is not doing it, Baba, you are a stranger.  From  What do people do to me in this? As I explain to people, there is a boss in the job who is troubling you, so you leave the job and go away. Oh brother, that problem is of Sade Sati, you cannot run away from your deeds, you left the boss and ran away somewhere else.  And whether that problem is coming from somewhere else, I told you that you have to go through it, if your mental anxiety, you will start feeling a little normal, it will basically go away.  Clarity, the yearning for your desire, not getting things according to what you were yearning for, not getting things as per your wish, don't you have a sense of despair, you will see it from all sides, tell me how you will run away from the stock market, the investment there went wrong, somewhere the plot got stuck, somewhere some other relation got stuck, somewhere.  You will run away from the job, but who will you leave behind? You will get trapped somewhere, that thing will come, be ready for the bouncers. You can think that this is such a thing.  It's time to talk about cricket in the same parlous because it is a very popular sport in India. It is a bit tough pitch. You will have to leave the balls in it. You will have to sit wearing a helmet and helmet. Two or four balls will hit your face. You will not die. You are wearing a helmet and helmet. You are right.  You will not get even a single hit on your hand, you will not score many runs, you will try to hit a six, there will be a fear of getting out, then there will be such an environment where you will be bowling on the ball, it is not a good thing. Learn from batsman Rahul Ravet, he used to tire the bowler, the ball can be of two types, Virender Sehwag who used to tire the ball by hitting it and Rahul Dravid who used to tire the ball by leaving it, now he will leave it and hit the ball.  To make it old means that the dasha of Venus is going on, your time is going like this, to hit the ball means that in 10 overs, he hit the ball like this, he hit fours, sixes and somewhere else Rahul has to rave, then you understand this as cricketing.  You will have to be Rahul Rubbed Patience person in pearls and stand like a wall, people will come there, keep trying and that time will go and you will become so strong in it that you will say for the life to come, friend.  If you have seen what is this then you will get such a feeling. If you have seen what is this then it is necessary to see what it is to see and say what is this. If you have not seen that then you can say what is this, then everything will feel like this. This is your preparation, your cleansing is happening and you are moving towards being a better person so embrace it when it comes just embrace it yes bring it on okay when the attitude is like this no bring it on bring it  The one on then is like this, it's okay, Jaspa is awake, okay, so how many Capricorn, Pisces, Aquarius zodiac signs, a little moral. I increased it because there will be many people, there will be people on 25, brother, three zodiac signs are 12, there are only three out of 12, so whoever you are who are subscribers, out of these, it is on 25 and if it is not yours, then it will be of wife or husband or children's or  If it is from the parents, then someone or the other's Sade Sati is constantly going on in the family. This is also a fact. Therefore, living in a family means that if this is going on then let's do it for the rest.  If you move your life forward, then how many people got a little relief, I did not do any magic just by talking, I just explained, there is no need to panic at all, many people speak like this, there is a fear in speaking, there is only a trap like you know.  No, have you been diagnosed? Brother, this happens to everyone. No, this happens to everyone. Is it like this that you have survived from the 3rd month itself? It has not happened to everyone. Tell me, a king or a pauper, who has survived this.  Everyone has to come, then what is the need to do so much in the things that everyone has to come, I hope you all liked it, please share and like, I have a subscriber info webinar group in the comment section, you can join that also. We keep doing programs for some months of astrology, so depending on your liking and choice, you can join it anytime, you will get a chance to ask queries in it and learn. Increase this video and share it with people because many people are suffering from pain relieving, clarity giving, ok, thank you very much."

    "title": "Should You Be Doing Kundali Matching Before Marriage ？ [TLEzzaYXywY].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, the topic is should you be doing horoscope matching before marriage, so instead of this, I will make a long video in the beginning and then tell the answer. In the beginning, I will tell you that yes, you should do it if you know the time of Dhuha Dhulan, but what should you do before that.  What people are not doing is that they first look for a random girl or boy and then set everything up saying yes, it's okay, after that they remember that they had to match the horoscope to manage it. Yes, let's go. Let's get it done and see how many qualities are found, it comes in a set of bones and then qualities come in it. Suppose if less comes then say this is nonsense. If more comes then say then it is good whereas this system of qualities is not the  The only thing in India is that marriage is not between a boy and a girl, her parents are also your in-laws and father-in-law, there are relatives on the girl's side too, it is not that easy, the second aspect is to match butt to match.  You need a very good astrologer. These are the apps that have come to you and the apps that you generally use in such a way that you have got so many qualities, that is not the thing. If it was so easy and free, then how can all the marriages be very difficult?  You are doing great, you got 28 qualities, you got 30 out of 36, you got 32 and you are very great. Okay, so they become very dowsers in marriages and what is called bare minimum.  If you want to get 18 then those who are at 18 have absolutely passing marks 18 19 20 Those who feel that they should be like this, this thing is on the edge but brother, they are doing well so what is happening then you will require a lot to understand this Today through this video I just wanted to tell you that off hand molding is necessary but there should be a way to do it and another way which is the best way should be that you  21, 22, 23 years old: Are you a boy or a girl? Do you know your horoscope? From your horoscope, a good astrologer can make a pen picture of your parents and you, that your future spouse should be like this according to your nature.  And yours is a pen picture, as they say, if we make a sketch, then what is the most wrong thing happening in the pen picture, that is, people, these days, whenever a boy is getting married, he has that ugly face. More attention is being given to the traits and characteristics, but what is his/her nature is not being understood. When the horoscope of a person is analyzed, his/her traits and character are understood. If a person with complementary character traits is taken, then marriage is possible.  If the partnership goes well then it can be told that your wife should be like this, you should be like this when you marry a working wife, don't bring too much of that family, don't do this or don't do that.  So you will have a pen picture, it has gone into your mind, now you have to match the following, in the real world people are doing the opposite, people are doing the opposite, first, in the real world, someone is catching you, go today, whatever it is, come, it's okay.  Rest, yes brother, mix it, right, this thing is happening, now I am not telling this thing as histology, I teach simple Jyoti, I tell you people very simply, let a pen picture come in your mind as soon as that girl or boy is seen and  there should be some matches there  Your bell rings like this and just approach it there, now call it love marriage, call it arranged marriage, you want to call it some marriage, get married but you should be very clear that your spouse will be like this, many times it is written that my husband is a little high.  He is on energy, now you can call him a quarrelsome person or maybe he is in the armed forces or in the police, you are looking at that thing, how through astrology you can put it in a different element.  You can also take it if your spouse is a woman of yours, she is a girl, she is supposed to be on this horoscope, she is supposed to be a little hood hood, dhabang dhabang, a girl of her own mind and after all that, then be ready that yes, you should also meet like this.  Find such a girl and marry her because if you find a petite girl and will be very obedient and if you feel like this then will something else come out of her or she will remain the same later Gulshan.  Gulshan flowers will bloom, later when the flowers will bloom, you will know what happened, then it will be a surprise for you, that is your promise of your chart, which is your flavor of the chart, you cannot go out of it much, in that you will get a lot of choice to choose from. Jaega Kun, this marriage is still a free will exercise, people say like this, it is destiny, it is written that it has to happen, it is not like this, it is not written in stone that it has to happen, yes, the general trait is written that yes too, as if someone says.  Is it true that there will not be much happiness in marriage? If someone brings such a thing, it means that there will be no happiness in marriage or the happiness of marriage may be because of wife and husband being separated a little due to job and they may have some other issues.  If you live with that thing, if you marry a working girl, then in marriage, as soon as you marry a working girl, you will face the classical marriage which is written in the text and which according to the society, there will be a reduction in happiness, but that happiness will not be there.  I got some benefit from it. Working lady has money.  She is earning, she is self-reliant, independent, smart, if you lose your job, it is yours, if you have got a stomach ache, if something happens in your life, then she is there, then you have taken the rest of the benefits, in this way, astrology should be used smartly, with using but that first.  You should accept that your marriage will happen at the age of 27, at 26, or at 28, whenever it happens, but brother, what is the need to wait till that time, if a girl brings a boy, Pandit ji, come, astrologer ji, Namaste ji.  If you match the horoscopes then the software will kill you by doing something like this and will give you any number. Hey, do you want to make a pen picture or what is right for me. There will be any two men, you will give them some numbers, right? What marriages are there for you because those things.  The marks may be cut for you, that is the most important thing in life. You understand my point, tell me one thing in life, if you are satisfactorily in those 20, then you can make my marks 50 but this.  My 80 have come and I am not getting my 20. Actually, I want only these 20. There are many such people, many of them think that brother, this is what I want and many of them may have physicality, may be something sexual, may be something food.  It may be possible for someone to have a brain, just as it happens to someone that I have a brain, my brain is stimulated by a partner who has less intelligence, you will bring that doll type, you will bring a Barbie doll.  You will come that everything is great but brother, I want this one, brother, I will not be able to marry again, if your qualities match, then 28-30 matches are made for you, but the one who does not match, you wanted only that one, your criteria was only that, if you get it.  You would have compromised everything, that's why this horoscope matching is very good should be done but it should not be done so casually expenses are wasted, people would think like this, we  Nowadays, I am telling you that only P does that, Ashtakoot in P, the matching which is done, you know, if it is on eight parameters, then it is Nadi Dosh, it cannot be a child, it cannot be so, then its number is eight.  Now it is technically what it is because of medical science, it is not given that much value and the things which we used to give less points earlier like compatibility and this Maitri Vetri, they have less weightage, they will have more weightage because brother, we  Actually, there are some big needs in 2023, I am doing research on this at my level. Now through this video, I am calling my astrological fraternity and those who follow astrology well, who know astrology, that we Need to change: I am making my own weighting system that for someone this thing is important, you have given it a number but for him this number is the most important.  It is important that if his number goes away then just don't do it. If you are sitting somewhere with something as per your wish, then modern times have come. Things are called whether it is constitution, amendments, society or technology. Changes are coming in everything, similarly this is a  Having our own system and having a very good method, the time has come to tuck it into the rules, the calculation will remain the same, it is time to change the weighting of everything because when the new time has come, a very good video has been made. You have to spread this in the astrological fraternity. If you are astrologers and know all this, then please write well in the comment section also that there is logic in this thing that has time come to now for us astrologers also to start working here because we are the ones.  They are carrying on with the old things and are doing them and the results are not coming, then what is happening with this, people lose faith in astrology and I don't want to do that, why did I do simple astrology?  Started so that even a 12 year old child can understand things in a simple way because when he will not work then people who are normal common people, they say to them that brother, it is a simple thing, if you get 30 qualities then it has become deviants, if you get 21 then they will not answer.  Now today I have got the simple answer that brother, 21 marriage is 21 out of 36, first class marriage is going on, 30 out of 36 is not going because 21 marriage is going on.  The points he got were the ones he needed, he probably would have got them satisfactorily and even if there were 22 numbers instead of 30, 23 would have worked well. I hope I have explained things very simply. Please do share this thing. Thank you again."

    "title": "Should You Buy Gem Stones ？ A Saral Explanation [-NHyoYaN_Lc].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, the topic of astrology is should you wear gem stones, many questions are asked on gem stones, I will try to explain in detail, there is a little higher order thinking, there is no absolute yes and no and this one depends a bit from astrologer to astrologer.  And many people within our community have their own take on this, so there is no one real truth, no absolute truth, no one can say that I am wrong. Or am I right and someone else is wrong or right, then those who are my subscribers and followers, then try to understand what the poet is trying to say. There is a discussion on what Jem Stos Ratan is, do these things work, should they be taken, should they not be taken. I will try to give some guiding principles on what should be done and at the end I will also tell you my take as a recommendation, so I will tell you one by one, if you want to see then it is okay, I am also an astrologer, okay so I am mine.  Nothing brother, okay, so this is one thing, I told you okay, the second thing I want to tell you is that it works, yes it works, okay it does everything, but even if you don't wear it, it can still work.  I am telling you that you can also treat them like steroids in case the need arises in case of emergency or something like this, but the reputation of the astrologer who suggested wearing it is much more important than his compton. So it is very easy to go to a jeweler or someone has given a gem stone, to check its purity etc., to check the Ratti, to put it according to the weight, to put it as per the rules, to put it on that day, to put it after taking a bath, to put it at this time, all that is done.  The question is that brother, if he told you, did you go to him? The problem is that money is not available, I will tell you as an example, I assume that whoever is watching this video, has some knowledge of astrology. Also watch my old videos. I explain things in a simple way. Let me pick a zodiac sign in which we can tell this thing well. Before that, I will tell you the zodiac sign. Before giving any example, Moon and Sun, Sun and Moon, Moon, this one.  One is the lord of each zodiac sign, only everyone else is the lord of two zodiac signs. For example, let me tell you this basic thing, the lord of Leo is Sun God and the lord of Cancer is our Moon. If we  Discuss the plates like discuss Saturn's Shani Maharaj ji is our lord of two zodiac signs Aquarius and Capricorn, okay Mars ji is okay of our Aries and Scorpio is the lord of Scorpio and Aries, of the two you are Mercury i.e. Mercury.  If you hold Mercury then it is the lord of Jamnay and Vargo, that is fine. If you hold Venus, then it is Taurus of Libra i.e. two and seven, where the number of the zodiac is written.  And whose lord is Taurus and whose lord is Libra, then in this way we come to Jupiter, Jupiter is also the lord of Sagittarius and Pius, so all the planets mentioned are the lords of two houses because there are two zodiac signs, two zodiac signs will be in two houses, so sometimes we  Just like when we talk about money, we also say that it is about money. Money is seen from the 11th house, so let's take the example of Scorpio from Letts. Scorpio zodiac sign where eight is written is now in its 11th house, the sign is Vargo. Okay, Scorpio has Vargo in the 11th house. Now the lord of Vargo is Mercury. So now let's talk about money. I came to know that they have mentioned some gems in the example.  I am saying that he has told something about his page and the one about Mercury, he has done a one order thinking but if I am trying to explain in basic simplicity that his  Even in the eighth house, there is the sign of Mercury and what is the eighth house. Do you know what land is there in the eighth house, whether it belongs to Scorpio or not? Tell me, the eighth house of Scorpio, which is in the ascendant, is in its eighth house.  There will be a difference in the eighth house also because you have done that also, like for Taurus, if I myself see that its ascendant lord is Mars, then the second sign of Mars, Aries, is in the sixth house, that is also the sixth house.  If you know what it is, then I am telling you in a simple way, I am not saying that you should wear it, you should not wear it, what condition is going on in it, what is the rest of the planet, whose vision is it, this is a specialist thing and the second thing I want to tell you is always  It does n't matter what people do, I'll tell you what are the biggest mistakes they make and children and someone else, my mother made me wear it, my husband does n't even know how to wear it, it's mostly ladies.  I will only talk about astrologer, there are more ladies in it, I have to do it for my husband, I have to do it for my son, I have to do it for my daughter, madam, little knowledge is dangerous, first of all, bring the one who has to do it and show it to him, explain it to him, then who will be a good astrologer, right?  That man will never tell by looking at the horoscope, he will tell by looking at it. This is a hint that I am giving, so if ever wearing this gem stone is considered a manly task, then it is a good strategy.  The inspector will say, show it to me, first of all, is it necessary or not and what will happen after wearing it, because if there is something else then you can know by looking at it, brother or sister, because if you take any medicine, antibiotics too, brothers and sisters.  Stomach upset does not happen, the rest is fine, it cures the infection, but the stomach issue remains, something does happen, won't there be side effects, how many will there be, how will they happen, this is a big topic in itself, beyond this. talk even for four hours  It can be done, but I am not scaring you here, nor am I telling you to take it very slowly, nor am I saying don't take it, I am not giving any one-sided decision, what I am saying here is that It will depend on many things, it is not moving around, it is not looking like that, my job is not looking like a government job, so I have to strengthen my Sun, your Sun is sitting below you, where is it sitting, is it sitting from somewhere, strengthen it and wear its gem. What is the point for many people, they will take a consultation of Rs 500, it is okay, they will take Rs 1100, they will take less, that is, many will write in it and include the expenses of Pooja and Ratan, they are their earning share, then you will first ask, where will you get it from, we are the only ones.  We will give you the slip, we tell you that the test has to be done, there are many doctors, they write it themselves, they also get the test done, so you know what that model is, okay, look for yourself. Casting Aspersions on Community is a Wrong Thing Always Doctors Never Do It I Feel Astrologers and We too I can never say this myself I am just clearing it now I am very great rest of them this is a wrong thing but I am here to guide you. Why am I saying it's bad, I'm guiding you to find your good one, don't look for mine, I'm not me, Jem Stoss, I say, I have a different take, I say come.  If yes, then it is fine to get punished, but brother, sometimes what happens is that the situation is such that it cannot be tolerated, so by all means, it works but as a guideline, I want to tell you one more thing here, you must be above 42 years of age.  Neither leave it with me, Guru ji of 50-55, please do this for me, I am wearing something, many people come, some people always come, just wear it for me, that means, it is ready from the beginning, someone also gives it a good one to Neelam Nalam.  While setting his program and many a times it appears from his face as if he is not saying that some rich man has come to slaughter the goat, Dyspareunia, any other mantra can also work, it is okay to do something other than eating food, just as the sun is washed with water.  It is possible and if its water falls somewhere in the pot then it would be even better, that is, these things will do the trick, but many people say that it is as if no one would take a Vitamin B12 pill, someone would just give him a few injections of Vitamin D.  just hit it once  Brother, this is something you can understand, so no, I will say that Vitamin D injections work, I am not denying, okay, I am telling you as an example, they work, but pills also work, but it depends.  Is it needed or not? Many times it happens that it is not needed. Well, one more thing is that you should not wear it all the time. If any of your dashas are going on, there is some difference going on in it, wear it accordingly, something is going on, something should be done about it.  For you still wearing that No one will come to tell you to take it off now and then something will start going wrong, so once it seemed fine, after that something wrong is happening, no one is going to tell you because mom had told you to wear it because she told me again and again.  You have to wear it exactly till this time. If this happens, then don't wear it brother. This is a very expensive job. Brother, you must be a very great and good astrologer whom you have tested a lot. Try it, whoever you have a long relationship with.  Yes, take it as per his request, these are the conditions, people coming and going, don't wear them while walking like this, I have never seen people like this on each other's hand, here also, there must be something happening between them too, system means it is like that chemistry, read it.  Yes, you people, there are no different elements in it, some with whom, some with whom, so suppose in isolation, someone has worn one, so brother, that is why I am saying that the astrologer, who will be a good one, will call first that you.  First show your hand, I don't know what you are wearing, everyone wears it because many people wear it all, now the world is not at my feet, the more you wear it, the more I fear, that means I am not making fun again, I am not again I am saying again and again in every fourth line that it does not work or you should not follow or it is not right or I am trying to tell something very great about myself and you people do not know the knowledge that it works. Works But Then You Have To Understand Okay And It Will Not Come At Low Cost That I Want To Tell That I Put Something For Rs. 200 And Take Something For Rs. 00, Your Price Will Be Worth Rs. 600, It's Not Like This Brother, This Is Then  There is a problem here, there is a problem, okay, the program will be fine in expensive, it is not guaranteed, but it is guaranteed that it will not be in cheap, if I am able to explain it openly, then you can tell me my style. This is the way to explain it in a simple way, now you will start getting more videos because I was more lost on that political channel and it is a matter of mood, sometimes what is the mood of a person, where is the fun, all this content, people think that I am I make it for people, I make it for myself, if it benefits someone then I feel very good and where the benefit is more, it is also important and it is also important to express one's own feelings, now man man ki baat man ki. Baat Guruji from Gurugram  This is my political channel, I am promoting it a little, you go and subscribe to it, it contains real issues, it is good, you will find it in the comment section, if you have not subscribed to it, then definitely subscribe to it, keep things simple, make people understand easily, example.  To explain, to relate, not to give knowledge sitting at a very high intelligent point, sometimes one feels big or not, what do many people do to show their intelligence through their words? What happens when we try? The man may get impressed because he does n't understand things but it is of no use. That's why I impress him directly by saying that there is no one better than me, so I do it. It's a dozen less from being.  Arrogant It comes from being humble in a way That man why waste time to tell me Listen to what I say Because if I spend half an hour to impress you then I will speak to you in 30 seconds Number one clarity from us  There is no arrogant person, he is just like that, a lot of people see through this as a nice gesture and that is why people are connected, such arrogance is not achieved by speaking, it is reflected in the face, actions and smile. Okay, so there is no one like this.  I will keep teaching astrology to you in a simple way and more videos will keep coming. If anyone has any pain or suffering, please tell us. We also do a lot of free sessions. In the comment section you will also find Sango Saral Astrology Group. This is like this.  This will make it happen there, hey, when that was written there, all this was written, then the life expectancy at independence was 29 out of 47 years, in 1947 it was 29 years, earlier, the life expectancy was more, no, people were dying more, you were living less.  Do you know that 2000 years ago, it means that animals, monsters, monsters attacked anyone, the law and order was not good or whatever it was, so it has been written in that type.  Don't be afraid of that, wherever death is written first, I will remove that fear a little through this video, that's why I say to you, do n't learn astrology from anyone, it is not a thing like English or social science.  If you don't read it yourself, then what will happen if you read it yourself? Death, death, you will run away from death in everything. If you say that it can be like death, isn't there any trouble? So today, the first thing in which the mother will be saved while giving birth to a child, the child will be saved. Today on A Big Thing  The infant mortality rate has reduced a lot but it has reduced a lot so we can be like race. Earlier it was more so the country and time character comes in it which country which time and who is the character whose section is being watched.  So, that's why if you want to give this thing to someone, then first of all take it to Jajman, whomever you want to accept, pick up that thing in such a way that whoever is listening to me, whomever is listening to me,  Moms have kept it, the wives have given it, go and get a consultation once again from the right person that she is wearing the right thing. I am not saying that your wife and mother would have done anything wrong, I am sure their feelings towards you must have been good but.  This or it dozen work that way if because if an astrologer has given it without seeing the person then that means there is something wanting in that person also because that is not  Supposed to be the way that way is supposed to talk to you Supposed to see you athletic and see many things, all the things, the meaning of the horoscope is also known from the horoscope, but you yourself, the horoscope, your tongue, face, mouth, body, body structure, everything.  Like they say, the dedication is strong, it is not there, there is no need to see the dedication, we can tell by looking at the face and body, a man's dedication is strong, it is okay, we will tell by looking at your tongue, but your strength is strong.  It is week, you will know it anyway. Okay, so when you understand Jyoti easily, you will know that there is no need of horoscope. When there is good astrology, that would be good astrology. Those who are very good astrology, they do not need horoscope.  They are looking at you and they know the question which is the passion going on, so now that I will not give so much free knowledge, it is okay here but if you are connected then it is okay, then it can be known like this also, then people say, hey, you are an intercessor. Light is not the innermost being  Yes, there is nothing Antaryami about it. Okay, so please like, comment. You can subscribe to the channel.

Please, what are you saying, earn money, another content will start in that, psycho life wala pais, earn money.  When women earn, they have less worries because they themselves are earning. I am also telling you this, so do not put too much age-a-hobby in these cycles. Astrology  It's for the needy, not the greedy. Well, it's for the needy, not the greedy. Just because you're in touch with someone and you're under the illusion that if you make your life like this, then he'll waste your husband's money too.  You may be thinking that if you earn money yourself, then those worries will also go away, so I will simply explain the points from both the sides, I hope you guys like it, I will tell you the best way.  Remedy: Get freedom from all these things. Learn astrology. Learning astrology in itself cures many things, you get to know a lot about yourself and that itself is the activity of Ath House, so you yourself become Ath.  If you are doing household activities then other activities do not come to you, this is also a remedy, I told you to give 11 bananas to someone, thank you very much."

    "title": "Significance Of 36-42 Years Of Age Explained In Astrology [k7TvoSR71Zg].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, 36 to 42 years of age is very important in every person's life. I will try to tell you a little astrologically in simple astrology. First of all, like the channel and subscribe. Amazing videos have come in it, which you can see separately in the comment section playlist.  Wherever you go, you will see that there are videos posted on where your pain comes from and where you will have to work more. Such interesting videos are given which If you are between 36 to 42 years of age then you should explain this thing very nicely without making it technical.  If you are listening below then you can write and speak your age. Thank you Guruji, we will be prepared. Those who are above 42, tell me brother, this is amazing, this happened with me and someone who is only 36 to 42.  Those who are going through this time, then you say that it was fun and we are going through these emotions. At the age of 36, the eyes start opening. Eyes means our inner intelligence starts working. Before that, we talk to our parents.  -They are trapped in their father's cycle that Papa ji will tell, Mom ji wants this, Big Boss wants this, at the age of 36, a person comes to know that actually this is the work he was doing.  I was made for this, I have interest in it, I go crazy, then at 36, a disillusioned stage also comes that friend, what is happening, do you understand that I got married first, so how did I want a partner, how did I like this only then.  I tell many people who cross 36 and don't get married, then brother, you can marry anyone, you will not feel any sorrow, you have got clarity in life, is the activation of Saturn in 36 a judge, but everyone's  In the horoscope, Saturn does not get activated at 36, it even goes till 42, depending on the degree at which it is in your chart, because it appears to have the formula that is fourth from itself. I will not make it technical, but in how many years will it take.  Will he travel, how will he travel, how much will he travel, in 12 years a complete journey takes place, then at the age of two and a half years, I will not do it technically but I am telling you that from 36 to 42 years.  An amazing age to become a lot of conflict will come to you, this is fine, that is fine, wherever your Sun is placed in the age around 38 years, it will ask for sacrifice from you and if you have made the sacrifice, if there is something fine there, then your life will become very good. Sacrifice will be asked, many people do not do it. For example, if your Sun is in the ninth house then around 38 years you should check, it is okay to check wherever it is. Sacrifice will be asked: If it is in the ninth house, then father will say something. Son, do this. You will be called upon to do some duty which will appear as a sacrifice. If it is in the third house, then the younger sibling will ask for something. He will come from somewhere and check you.  If you are sitting in the seventh house, the Sun is sitting in the eighth house, then these losses will come from there, so this is an edge and the garb becomes amazing, then the one around 38. Your Rahu gets activated in 42. 42 is a very golden age. 42 is the very special year in everybody. What is special. Okay, and those who are getting closer to this, please listen with open ears and send messages to other people also who want to touch this 40. In the 40th and 41st year of the 42nd year, you will get a chance to end something old and start something new. You may be able to use the opportunity, or you may leave the opportunity, but it may not happen.  Ca n't get a chance Ts wai I say that every big guy is in job A A No matter how old he is 25 28 30 32 His retirement age should be 42 in mind So you should think that even if you have a 50 over match but you  You are saying that I have only 30 overs, I have to retire at 42, which nowadays people often say, 'Fire Fire is FIRE Financially Independent'.  If it is okay to retire early, then retire early means according to me, it is not that you do not sit and do nothing, you do not earn money, but you will get opportunity, you will get freedom from job, then 42 is very significant 36 37 38 39 40 41 42  In this age, we have to listen more to ourselves and less to others, understand that no one will tell, I am the person who gives knowledge to people, I give it on everything.  When I am there, I speak, listen to what I say, listen to your heart in 36 to 42, that will be right, 32, don't listen in 33, not in 33, it is okay, 30, it is not that the mood doesn't come, it comes before also, but in 36, which  If Miji was coming because of not taking decision or because of not being able to take decision or someone was not allowing you to do anything, then now it will be clear to you what came.  Want in life because half of my life is coming into the world brothers and sisters because I don't know what I want, brother, I see that women are very unhappy, there is consultation in marriage madam, what do you want, do n't you know now what you know is this.  I don't know whether I have to go to Trim or Jammu, Vaishnav Devi, then which train should I put you in, if you are a consultant, we have the entire train schedule, the ship's schedule, but where should I turn my head, which of your flights should I put you in?  I do n't know if I have to be put in a train. Okay, so what to do now. I have to go somewhere. I am not enjoying it. You have to be very sure because there is an English saying. I don't know whether I will remember it or not. I have to tell her right away that if  You don't know your destination and you 're in a ship Okay and you're going to the sea And you don't know your destination Then no wind will be favorable Understand English wind first  The ship used to move according to the wind and even today it moves. If you get an even ship then it will be even if you are in flying. If you are into flying then it will be technical, but in that also PNR etc. are calculated. In flying, tail wind is head wind and everyone speaks.  And on a bigger level, when you are flying a plane at 36000, you are not flying, you are not flying, if you are flying in a plane, then the wind is coming from the front, it is coming from the back, the side.  Will it make a difference as to how much of its component has arrived and oil is saved? Sometimes it's okay, it reaches quickly, man, because your task is true, the speed increases, so if you don't know the destination, if you have to go, then nothing will happen.  Be Favorable in Your Life Thatch Things Will Start Becoming Favorable in Your Life Because Now You Will Know What You Want Now You Know Your Destination So  Now you have to just go and take a favorable win a mentor a guru a guide a person my best subscribers my maximum students are in this age group and what I enjoy the most I probably haven't told this even to my students till date  When I see this thing, those who are most engaged among me and who still understand everything, it is not that they are not in 20 or not in 50, 60, 70. Everything is there but who enjoys it the most or not, because those who have crossed 42, because even after crossing 42, it will be known from 36 to 42, the one with 42 knows, the one with 48, no one knows.  Do you know that even Ketu gets activated at the age of 48? The last planet is Ketu. After 48, life itself becomes different. Four 12-year circles end and there is a cycle of 12 years.  If Jupiter goes, then it becomes four, then in 49, a new one starts, then the case of the one with 4 becomes different and whose case and final case are different after 60, but till 60, people mess themselves up so much.  Let us assume that at the age of 61, he becomes very bitter. Learn Astrology, come and take membership of the channel. You will find group in the comment section. We have many webinars on Astrology, we have done them before too. Learn them, you will definitely get peace in life.  You will definitely watch my videos because now what have I told inside it, now what magic will happen from this, what kind of astrology can you learn from this video and by making predictions you have earned Rs. 1.5 crores, this video is simple astrology but you have realized that yes friend.  Actually, I did not know, yes, I did not know at first, then I came to know, but I did not find any guru, did not find a mentor, nor did I come across a dozen of gurus, which means that they put up photos of someone and him.  This way  Keep doing Aarti or make DP, I am not talking about that Guru, that too is fine, people have created it, look for someone where you get happiness, it is good, a person like me never becomes judgmental and the truth in life is that when you  You accept someone as your guru, it is okay even with a stupid person who is not that good, he also becomes beneficial for you, I am not at all saying here that you should go to hypocrisy or get yourself exploited and do not do that at all. but I am a  I am creating a different perspective, this is also a fact of life, so get a mentor, talk to intelligent people because now you know what you should not do and what to do, it may not be clear because there is a thirst after 42. That also gets cleared, Ketu also gets cleared, sorry, Rahu gets activated, so Ketu is 48, okay, this activation thing is very important, activation of the planet means and where it is.  If the first house is activated then Rahu is in the 11th house then brother will increase the income. In the 10th house there will be some work related event but will give you some opportunity or the other. Rahu is like that amplifier effect wherever Rahu sits, it amplifies and increases.  So when that year comes, you get the full opportunity to expand there, buy a house, go to a foreign country, expand your business, do a collaboration, get an inheritance from somewhere, and get a gift.  It can also happen that something rockets into your wife's job or your spouse's job. What good will it do to the housewife? What opportunity will she get? Here we have so many housewives, so her opportunity will come through her husband so that she can get something in her life.  If it is done then we can see it in this way. Like Share. Whatever innocent questions you have about astrology, put them in the comment section. I have seen that pleasure should come, so without making it too technical, I will describe the thing as pleasure.  I am taking it because my mission is to bring astrology into people's daily routine so that they do not become delusional, nor fearful, they come to know how to use it, they come to know what is happening, our old one is so lovely, now people, is there science in it?  That is the story of grandparents, now tell me, there is no buffalo at all, no, it is scientific, it is astronomy, it is astrology, it is Vara Mahira, who was it, how was it, which one was it, what was it before, why did we do it? Why are you getting into arguments? Okay, tell me, if there is astrology, then tell me. Like earlier you used to ask when will Covid end? Is Covid going to end or something like that? It is like asking when will this phone break, now its life will be over.  What effect is it having on it? Can I tease him with this phone? Can I make him tear up? Can I make him angry? No, then I can troll him like this if someone does something against me.  It is written that if tears come out of your eyes, then it can be predicted that you are weak or if you cannot do so, then you are strong. It is possible that if you remove tears from my eyes then it will be known by looking at the astrologer.  And to win, there should be a human being, there should be consciousness in it, now how to tell the future of the dog, where is the consciousness, many things are missing, have you ever seen any animal crying, do only humans cry, so there is emotion, no, we have few in some.  Are  And they will enter into the debate. They are still not saying whether animals dream. No, it has not been checked, there is no such research. Yes, now we are talking, you can dream, if you close your eyes, you can reach Switzerland, you are next to the bird.  You can reach here, you will also see Trump, now you close your eyes, don't think about all the elephants, don't think about the elephants, then you must have seen the elephant, then all these things are happening, it is happening to the one in whom it is happening.  You can predict the future because you can see the movement. Why do you have to predict the future? If you drive fast at night, then it is time to predict the future. An accident can happen. If you drive fast at night in the mountains, now predict the future.  And it has become easier, you drive fast at night in the mountains after drinking alcohol, now it is confirmed that brother has come two or three times but one day you are driving drunk.  If your wife took control, you were saved, but the future could not be predicted because your wife was sitting with you. You did not know that one day you were going, the car would have reversed, but then a cat came, you saw the cat, you applied the brakes which was coming from the front.  When the car was coming, he saw a stopped car, then it is not enough, these things also happen to you, can someone bring the cat to save it, those little things will happen to you like a cat coming on the way to save you, all your actions.  was useless  You are driving fast, you are driving under the influence of alcohol, it is okay, but will the cats come every time? This is what makes astrology interesting. Don't put it into debate. Experience, it is there. There are certain things that we have to experience which I have lived many times.  We do experiences in etc. They are good, I never record them because it is for experience, it's like good song, good food, say how good it is, the food is good, good, good  You don't know until you eat, astrology is also like this, so please learn it, you should enjoy it. If you enjoy the videos, then write in the comment section, I will keep making you, keep listening, one day you will become 100, 150, 200. You will become such an astrologer that people  You will bring peace in life without any element of being you. I need a job. I will get married. You do n't smell good. There is no glow on your face after seeing you. You don't have any money, father.  Yours are not rich, you are demanding a girl's program, you are sitting with so much. If there is no change in these five things, then you will not get married. There is no need to show me the horoscope, the horoscope shows how stubborn a person is, that the advice that will be given is this. You will follow the children, you will get a good haircut, you will cut your dirty beard which your friends have said looks good because your friends are not actually friends, they are cunning, they are you, you look like an [ __ ].  They are the ones guiding you. Get clean shaven, improve your personality, fix your job, you should smell good, you should know how to talk politely. Have you ever seen that many people get irritated? I may be an example of astrology, but I will talk to you about relationship matters too. Remembered from relationship, my relationship course is also starting after Diwali, whoever wants to join, brother, it is a wonderful thing, it is iconic, you will listen live, you will enjoy the expense.  You will have to do water and you can do it on the number given by me. Have you ever seen that he is not a very handsome man in height but he is a smooth operator? Girls think that he is a crazy lock. He also has a small belly. What is there in this, friend? Kashish is sitting next, brother Venus is in such a place, Shaktiya is good of the world, no one ever speaks dirty, you see, there will be five-six trades, then you will keep crying, girls are crazy.  It is stupid, it is useless, so if the boys are listening to me, then sometimes the inheritance also happens, although the inheritance is less, it is okay, but it happens, sometimes it happens, so you have to understand this thing that how ha how does it.  It happened that an IT guy came, the package is very high and says, Guru ji, I am not getting married. I am good to look at, I have money, I am also well-paid, yet marriage is not happening because the next person has created so much confusion in his mind. Regarding, I want someone who is intellectual as well as beautiful from whom I can grow something, that is our Acharya Prashant ji who has wisdom and consciousness, he does not know astrology, he does not know astrology, what do he believe and he told the story to other people that marriage  Do it in such a way that it awakens the discriminating intellect and consciousness. The thing that awakens the discriminating intellect and consciousness is not visible and does not look beautiful and the beautiful one too, when God was distributing it, was not distributing it like this and also gave beauty to the brains.  Even if you give everything to someone then enjoy it because if you have given so much to someone then he/she will not marry you then you have to pick and choose, you marry someone and increase his/her intelligence, intelligence also increases otherwise. I talk, then she is talking like this, she will talk like this, if you take this much, even if we go astray, sometimes what happened is, sometimes she writes to me because there will be so much content in my one video that I am  How many topics should I add, my topic should be that Anand  The video has come, all the videos should be like this, so those who listen enjoy it, those who listen enjoy it, because of what happens to us many times, there is one thing in life that many of my things are just for the purpose, you may find Oxy Moran  But sometimes what happens is the fun in wandering, the day is amazing, look at the scene in Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak, Aamir Khan and Johi Chawla get lost in the forest, but if the company is Jhui Chawla and you are young and it is amazing.  Is it the day or doing something like this and roaming around and the song is coming, so friend, it is fun to roam around many times, it depends, we are stuck in the lift for an hour, now who is your company, we have sat in the plane, who is the company?  If yes, then you should not take stress. Whatever I teach in the video, do not ever think that I do not prepare or I just write left and right. Many times I have such points. Take this, this is such a dirty writing, sometimes myself.  also like this  I don't understand, okay, but it is not like that, I am taking you somewhere, left brain, right brain, seroti, dopamine, endorphin, oxytocin, I am doing everything, my words, I just saw this, right now, that consignment was caught in Delhi, whose heroine's drug was caught?  Some hashish and some intoxicating thing, I don't know how many thousand crores worth it had come from Colombia, so this is needed to get drunk. If you have real knowledge to offer all this then there is no need to go anywhere. Well, we are even more expensive than that. If someone believes, learns more and enjoys, then he will get all the four things just by speaking like this and this thing is absolutely legal. Look at how much is being spent, all these concerts etc. are being made in this cycle.  If there will be a concert there and this is happening then it is good that Delhi Police has done a great job. The youth in the country should learn astrology. This is your child. If you are a 60 year old listening then send your child this. If he learns astrology then he will not be drunk.  I agree that whoever among you is addicted, you should start learning astrology, gradually the addiction will end on its own, it is not that it will end as soon as you start, but it will not start again but the body needs it.  No, you will run out of money, what a big thing you are saying and just learn what I am teaching for free, then when you learn better, then you can also spend money on water supply, but try it for free here before I lose it.  The rest of the channels will be left in the free channel only.  You can take membership, you can join, you can enjoy and being happy is not easy. Many people say that being happy is easy, being happy is not easy. Being unhappy is the default setting and easy. People go for the easy option. Learning astrology is easy but not simple.  Understand the meaning, sometimes something is simple, sometimes something is easy, you will learn, if you want to learn, you will learn many times, but do as much as you are taught, do not take stress.  In the Indian education system, did the teacher make the class high? I did not understand this. I did not understand why I am getting stressed. If I did not understand then why am I getting stressed because I have to give a test. If you earn marks in the test, then parents.  So even after getting a job, you learn something like I teach you or learn whatever you understand, or there is no test, you learn even 15 % out of 100, you will get pleasure from that too, whatever you understand.  Do whatever you want, and even if you don't understand it and enjoy it, it is better than doing useless drugs. Like, subscribe, share. I want to expand this channel. I have n't told you yet, so.  My request is humble, if you have a wife in your family, then you will not be affected by the husband, children and mother-in-law. Maybe you are fine, but if you take the parents or anyone, all of them, and whoever takes the mother-in-law also, then there will be peace in your house. Membership of this channel will bring peace in the lives of those who have spread Raita in their lives, subscribe them, just tell them, listen to everything and it is guaranteed that you will have all this within seven days.  There are not so many videos in it, it will be easily consumed, the amount of content that comes in your web series is much less in time than in a multi-series web series like Mirzapur, where there is only violence, even if you fast forward and watch it, your head will explode. You don't know where you will reach. If you make notes then you do n't know where else you will reach. I give a small technique in each. The video in each is of 2022 minutes. There are only two techniques. Sun 38 years old will ask for sacrifice. Have you done that sacrifice your life?  Have improved if you have not done then it will remain the same if you are 37 years old, 38 is about to come then open up quickly 38 years  Off life is 38 years of life i.e. if you have turned 37 then 38 has started. Remember if you have turned 38 then 39 has started. People make mistakes here too. I have explained it earlier also so please if not your friend then look around for someone.  38 39 37 Do a little of all three and see for six months, because sometimes what happens is that those things start appearing in the market and you start getting a complete feeling that the reason is wanting something and  He has given you time of six months of a year to do it, if you have to do it then do it, sacrifice will be good for you, if it is okay for you then like and share, thank you very much."

    "title": "This One Mistake Is Making You Chidchida ｜ How To Make It Right ？ [lkACODdKuQI].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, the topic is only astrology. Through my videos, I am taking people to astrology through simple astrology. I am telling it in a practical way, I am not even going into technicality. Today's topic is, what are you irritable doing this mistake?  What I am going to tell you and which you should not do this relates to irritability that you are not happy. In astrology we know that the fourth house is the house of happiness. Moon is considered to be the natural factor there.  And if you have to eat moon, then the mistake that I see people making is eating food while walking and listening to the radio in crowded areas. You can never be happy. I will also tell you what to do and how to do it. Food is very good. It is a good place and very good food to eat which satisfies your soul, if one becomes happy from within like a soul, people are not putting enough effort on their food, the new generation is so busy, they are not thinking.  That I should pack fruits, I should take some food from home, I should sit somewhere in peace and eat, I am eating food while walking and I am getting too much time to eat in my life, I have eaten my food, I have attracted it, I have cooked it.  It is okay and I have told you 1.5 crore times not to save strength but still he should go home and tell me that this bell has rung, there is no cure for it but I will still continue the video, okay so whatever food you have, it will give you peace.  Have a place to eat and eat as per your wish. If you insure this during the days of majority, your irritability will go away. Boss does not allow you to eat. Someone called during meal time. Food was not available as per your wish. Bread is being served raw. Food is not good. Salt is too much and is less.  If you are not enjoying, you will not enjoy life. This is the most important technique which I am teaching. Your mind will get distracted, your mood will get spoiled, etc. By linking with this, it is said that if the milk is boiled then it is not considered good.  Because  The moon got spoiled because your mind was busy somewhere else, so you could not monitor the milk. If there is any relation between such milk, then all these things are linked. It is very, very important in your life. You have to be very very particular about it. Consuming food in a quiet area, go to eat somewhere, eat under a tree, eat somewhere sitting peacefully, do not eat anywhere where dust is flying, in fine dining, even if you are going out to eat. Go to a very good place. Even if it is costly, otherwise avoid it. Avoid these things while walking. You will see a lot of difference. You can eat in peace while speaking love to someone. You can eat while sitting with your loved ones.  Ho to nothing like it and sometimes controversial things at the dining table, sometimes about someone, yes, how was your exam, don't ask all these things, don't give knowledge to her, light hearted at the dining table. Keep the conversation on the dining table. Keep the conversation like this. Hey, which picture will you go to watch, when will you have fun, how much fun to have, what to buy, how to do it, light hearted talk, address here to every father and mother and the woman, the trouble that happens at times, the moon is bad.  You say that your mood gets spoiled after eating your ready food, brother, there is no option, find an option, stay happy, when did I say that it is so easy today?  It is not easy in life that you can be happy so please follow this thing in your life. Thank you very much."

    "title": "Touching Feet , Blessings  And Sanskar ｜ Full Clarity Given  For First Time On Youtube [-80ZkWt54Tk].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, this is a deep topic, you have to understand it well, put it on your family groups, give it to your friends, spread some awareness because of this, I don't think any video has ever been made on this subject properly or this thing has been made easily and simply.  It has been told from Sango, it is a simple astrology, things are explained in a simple manner, there are so many things like this, today's topic is whose feet you should not touch, should you touch everyone's feet, should you seek blessings from everyone, this  There will be a lot of clarity on the matter and you should send these things to your mothers, sisters, mother-in-law, father, children, friends, relatives and understand the essence of it because I had once mentioned it like this on me, many people got questions, so I am making a video.  I hope that you will understand it with great pleasure. Understand it carefully. Whenever it is a matter of touching the feet or taking blessings or not, then two people evolve in it, one who touches the feet and the one whose feet are being touched.  One taking blessings and one giving blessings, so this is a video for both. If you are a little old because you fall in that category, do you have to bless everyone or do everyone have to touch you? Do you have to put your hand on everyone's head? I want to tell you first of all the way of taking blessings by touching the feet and that is that the person who is giving blessings should be sitting comfortably and peacefully and his shoes should not be socks. feet must be on the ground  The taker should also not have any shoes on, he should also be barefoot on the ground and you should touch the toe of the taker's feet with your hand like this, actually on top like this and the giver should have it on his head.  You have to give blessings by touching like this, whatever he wants to give from inside, this completes your circuit, you yourself visualize this, this is the ground, you are standing beyond this, you are fine, this person is sitting, this person is fine, you are standing like this, he is bowing.  now it is  He is bowing, this is also connected, this is how he touched the feet, he gave blessings by actual touch, so this is the complete loop of energies, if you understand, all the feelings are blessings, which is getting completed, this is the way, I should not say this but do speak.  So you know I have no hesitation in doing this to anyone. Punjabis, our beloved community, have perhaps realized this, perhaps they may be intelligent, that everyone is like this.  No, she says 'Mmm Aa', she says this to everyone, so they have made a parry pona system that eight people are standing, parry pona from the farthest, this is fine according to me, instead of this, I would call it gimmick, I am fine with it but it  This is still better than taking from anyone. Now do n't take from anyone and take the first thing from the person whom you don't like, it can be for any reason and don't take blessings from the person whom you don't like in any way or anything.  Don't bless, don't do this for the sake of it. Understand this deep thing. Your mother-in-law will say this to her sister-in- law or to her children. There is no mother in this, mother does not know. This is a sanskar taught from somewhere. Bend, bend, bend. This is control.  It is not a culture, it is what it is, I am going to teach you today, listen, this should come from the heart, one who does not deserve it, just because your parents first created you, a dozen became that you are wise enough and a good one.  Person that you are sharing blessings or your blessings should be taken just because you are older than someone Dozen do this second thing is also true just because you are coming to take blessings from me and I don't like you or your actions  If I don't like you or do n't like you, whatever be the reason, I do n't want to give it to you, then if you want to take it, then parents should not give this blessing to anyone other than their own children, i.e. those whom they have created. is this  We can follow one rule, daughter- in-law genuinely likes it very much, daughter-in-law likes mother-in-law very much, it is okay, however, there is also the fact that our girls are not made to do all this, I will never make it again, otherwise that Khichad is the focus there.  It goes, it should be done, you can also do it, you can't do it, it will have a different focus that what is the system of girls, so you don't have to do it, you don't have to do it, you do n't like, don't give blessings to your daughter- in-law, what can you get out of forcefully. you don't know  Then you ask anyone about your women who are old, there is so much pain in their bodies, why do they do all these things, they spread their raita on the contrary, they say that little knowledge is dangerous, look bad. I talk according to Guru Tattva, those who like me, I have no gender bias, no age bias, nor do I talk to anyone directly and they like it. Women have very little knowledge and men have zero.  So what they say about little knowledge, they say in this proverb in English, In the kingdom of the blind, the man with one eye is the king, okay, there is such a saying, do you know it, okay, so everyone who doesn't even know the name. Let's outsource what this woman will do, it will not be right, now as the woman becomes the one of that house, now taking that class, I too am feeling stressed that those were those who were there historically in our society, then when did they give them that knowledge.  They start using it for themselves, for manipulation and power, it is not known that it is there in the society, you know that there are different castes in the society, so one caste has been accused and there is truth in it, okay brother?  You people had this knowledge, you used this knowledge too much and misused it for the gains of your power. Everyone knows that it is in public discourse but that thing has also come inside our house. I am saying this.  Having more  This bowing will have to be used only in front of Har Re Gare Nathu Gare, this is not a correct thing and blessing Har Re Gare Nathu Gare is also not a correct thing, there is an astrology which gives its virtue from the ninth house, this is a virtue.  Yes, like he charges for consultation etc., every person has a virtue, he must have done something in his life, right, when you give blessings, you give with that virtue, so see this.  When Guruji came, I used to do a analysis of who is deserving and who is undeserving. Just like we used to study in our maths, there is some analysis in science or there is an antithesis or there is an Antonine to teach it. I also do some reverse thing to show the blessings.  What is the opposite of curse? Well, you must have seen it in old movies or old serials, there must be someone in it, if you hear that I curse you, then why curse?  It happens that you say something to him and something bad happens to him. Do you know the definition of curse? So have you ever thought that this is what cursing means, a person has got so much power that he will curse and that.  Will say and this will happen, then it means unlimited supply, then you become a world power, become a super power, there are so many Indians, we all curse our enemy country or whoever the enemy is.  If you have cursed, then you have to understand that the supply of cursing or giving your blessings is limited. Only the person who has cursed is able to curse and whenever he gives alcohol, his power gets lost.  If he can curse only one person in his life, then he will be cursed too. If there is such a definition, if you understand it according to religion, then you understand that he will not give liquor to random people like that. You did not make tea for me, I asked for tea, I give it to you, after today you will never be able to make tea or be able to enjoy it, you loose your power and just like that, you cannot use it on the go, just like you consume liquor on the go.  You cannot use it, this is a lifeline, because its supply is limited, it will get exhausted, so now you will say that man, he is a great man, he is a good man, he is Guruji.  There is a perfect man, he is of Babaji type or whatever good we have in him, people go to him and take blessings and he is living such a life that he is getting supply generated and he is such a great man. Which maybe you give to others as well, but from what I know and as far as I have understood, these people also do this by actually touching their feet, they do not even give this by actually touching, have you ever seen this and that is why they say Namaste.  These  There is no handshake, this is useless to us, this culture of handshake is the culture in other places, just like there is a culture of eating a liar, it was not ours at all, beyond that, a separate video will be made someday. In every video, I leave something from the video ahead. Well, we have that tradition these days, the wife is feeding the husband, taking photos of herself, taking it from her plate, no, absolutely no, absolutely no, we don't want anyone's food, if it is being wasted, then put it somewhere else, don't eat it yourself.  many mothers eat  I do n't have to do what is left of the child, that will be a different video some other time because as I talk, that thing also comes to my mind, but today I stick this thing here, let's listen again and again. Blessings to every person. Deni you have to be very sure just because some buddy is nice to you Namaste uncle ji baba ji this and smile mara now you really don't know just because some buddy is nice to you you this extreme  Let me take an example and tell you that the extreme example is a rapist type man or he is like this, he has not been caught, he is a cunning man, he is a dirty man and he talks to you very politely and you know that he is a very dirty man.  But ca n't do anything but you generally know what scandals he has committed, so will you bless him just because that person is very nice too?  You ideally speaking you should not because the first thing in giving blessings is that you should not have any greed of your own and you should be connected to that person at a very deep level and deep you know you know you can give the expectation of anything to your children.  Of course, they also should not fall in the category that I gave in the previous example, but generally you should be there for them. Unfortunately, I have seen the blessings of parents for their children.  They don't come out for us as much as they do for the neighbors and this has become a show, no, they don't come out, they do n't even behave well with us, so now you understand that you have seen this thing or this comes out of your mouth, I have consulted many times. I am asking this, hey, the person next door is so good to us, so it means there is greed in it, my blessing is for the one who is good for me, blessing should be for the one who deserves your kids, your own blood.  Deserves deserves, that is, if your child has not bowed down, then even if the hand can reach the leg, it is not necessary that he should not know how to take it, nor should he be a fool. If you are not there, then it is definitely for the children. You should definitely take it from your parents. Because it is within the family, because you are in your new home, taking out some juice from within yourself and giving it to every person, do not give it to every person. Many times people say to me, sir, I want to meet you, Guruji, I want to meet you, but I don't even get the blessings brother.  It's a distant thing, now the second part of this video starts, first of all you have done the blessing of meeting someone, there is no blessing in meeting anyone, don't even meet people you do n't like, you don't have to meet people, brother, the situation there will be like this.  No, that situation will not be like this, avoid it, you will suck the energy and go away, then you will not be happy. Look, either understand these things from someone and see the effect change in your life, in one, two-three months, in the next 90 days, I say.  But don't meet the one you don't like, whatever be the reason, I am not saying meet him less, don't meet him at all. No, I don't like my boss. How can I meet him? Yes, think about how I can get a job.  Should I change my work, how should I do my business or I cannot be there physically, emotionally, mentally, physically? The body will remain the same. Disconnect the soul. Disconnection of the soul. If you know the Atman, leave the connection from within, the pain.  You will not get an end, do not meet, do not enter, do not argue, do not discuss too much, do not meet unnecessary people who do not make you feel good for any reason, a separate video will be made on this too, many times people say, if I say one thing, he will not mind.  I say don't say anything because you know the point of saying bad things, do n't say bad things to me and the next person becomes like this, no no, not for your good, not for my good too, don't say, I will take consultation if needed, then ask someone. Not from professionals, I would like to tell you too, no one wants any good, to remember someone, everyone has to make someone feel something for their ulterior motive and these games are played openly in the family, in the organization, in the office, in friendship, everywhere and  No one comes with a straight face and tells this thing so casually, he has entered, take his blessings from him, take his blessings from him, don't say this, don't take it, do n't take it, mummy ji I don't know. That uncle is son, he is a very great man, no, no, I don't know which one is a great man, what will he give for what, you tell this to anyone, you are ready to drink tea from anyone's hand, anywhere, I don't say these things now.  Classist and this kind of people do not come, no, it is not from the hands of such a poor person, you will drink anywhere on the road in an unhygienic place, you will drink anything, eat food from someone's hand, you will do anything without having knowledge, even there you think, right?  he also washed his hands  It will be clear that only then all these different types of systems have been created. If you do not do all these things, then you have made the blessings even lower than this. By giving this example, I am proving my point. Blessings and blessings are considered to be such a moving thing that you can eat toffee of any brand, someone can give you a pill, they are sitting in the bus and they eat that, eat like this, some people eat everything.  Let's eat, I am not refusing, but do you see that the lid of this bottle is closed, it is packaged, it is Himalayan water, it is water- based, it is like that, do you think that what can be eaten by putting it in the mouth?  Is it okay before or do you ask 150 questions before doing anything to someone? You have kept this blessing even lower than that, what is there in it, keep doing it like this, hey I will tell you what you have to do if this  If you want to feel then you can use your hands  Keep it like this, close both the eyes, first see, listen, then do it and after this try to bring your hands closer and visualize that you have a ball which you are moving around like this, you will start feeling energy. Your hand will not come close, in such a way you will feel from inside that there is something there, try this and try it, now people say that it is superstition, so and so, oh, what am I telling you about my feeling, there is something, there is something, just close your eyes and visualize it.  that you have  There is a ball in the middle, globe type C and there is light in it, think like this and you are able to feel it like this and you want to bring your hand closer slowly like this, it will take a lot of effort to bring it closer, bring it slowly. Will you feel something now, how much great energy is there on this and that science and knowledge will be researched now, then you will see in which H will be the new by constant and this wavelength and then again you will accept all the things, accept all the things, do it.  Do it but brother, you go physically in your zone. You do n't say that I am feeling uncomfortable. These are women, they know this thing very well because their attitude is a little better. A man comes, someone is looking at me like this. How is he looking with his eyes? He did not raise his hand. It is said that his eyesight is bad, so how does his eyesight become bad? You tell me, I am talking about women, how should the eyes be seen like this, is he like that, Gulshan Karwar, Shakti Kapoor or  look just like them  You will have to do it to get bad at acting, like they do in the movies, I don't want to do it, I too am feeling very shy, otherwise I can go to some level to prove my point, the job of a teacher.  I can go to some level to explain, but I myself am feeling uncomfortable because I did not think before making the video. If I think, then I do it. So you understand that many women are not necessarily at that level.  Till them acting  What needs to be done is understood only in a normal way. Women realize that there is a man standing behind them, he has not done anything yet, has not even touched me, but this man is not well, tell me how to know.  There is something, there is something, women also know, just talk to a woman, if the woman is listening, please write to me whether yes, I am saying this right or not, then you people come to know that women.  A little man is also a little sensitive to all these things. So if it happens a little, then they will also start understanding what I am talking about, so do not interact with any person with your mouth raised, do not approach anyone with your mouth raised, do not talk to anyone with your mouth raised.  Don't eat that food, don't do it like that, I am not talking about any discrimination here, I am not doing it at all, it is okay but you have to do it where you feel right and it is necessary for both the people, there will be many people who will help you when someone is coming near you.  Blessings are above money, below it  Just think, blessings are above money, you say they are above money but you don't believe it. If blessings are above money, they are above money, then no man will keep giving you 00 500 000 2000 lines or you.  You will see that friend, I deserve it, when you give money to someone then what do you think about giving it that anyone can come and take how much, hey, we knock anyway, we knock and give to everyone, don't we?  But even if you give, it is not like that, there will be no one among you who would have never given money to anyone, would not have given money, would not have helped, everyone does it, but what do you put in yourself? What do you put in? I deserve it.  Brother, then why are you not feeling it in blessing, why are you not feeling it in giving or taking, or have you considered it as a very low level thing that keep doing this peri-pona, this peri-pona business has to stop, a community will feel bad.  What she was doing is all artificial, sometimes in the affair of Peri Pona, what is Peri Pona Pepo, one is standing, 10 people are standing from a distance, I did it like this from a distance, why brother, what is this, what is this Peri Pona, you with love  Say Namaste Aunty, Namaste Uncle, Namaste Ta ji, Namaste cha ji, say hello like this, say hello, love me and you have to give blessings only to your extremely close ones.  Keep your blessings reserved for the needy not the greedy. What I am saying to the giver and to the taker is that you are getting blessings so easily. You should be getting blessings in your family, you should be getting them from your parents and those who are very close, then you are taking them from others.  If yes, then there is no value in it and I don't know from whom you are taking it, I don't know whether it is worth taking or not, I don't know if he is a dirty person, you will come to know that a dirty person thinks that he has committed many scandals in life.  On the contrary, will you feel like going and taking blessings from someone who has done something wrong? If you still have to take blessings from within, then what is the compulsion? Under whose pressure are you taking it? What is the meaning of taking it? Yes, keep the blessings. Which blessing is this to the society now? Please spread this thing through this video, I would love it very much, the channel is small, I also know that no 1.5 crore people are going to watch it, but if you try a little, then this is what is happening forcefully to many people. everyone's everyone's  Take blessings, no, all are good, no, all are good, do n't speak like this, son, son don't speak like this, daughter do n't speak like this, this is trauma, this topic will then leave my Astro channel and then go to my other channel Sango Life on Sat, so I will stop it here.  I will give that I am thinking, let's not put it on that one here because some things might have happened in it where many people say everything is scientific, I say that these are the stories of grandparents, these are the stories of grandparents.  If you feel relaxed, if you feel happy, then come comfortably, listen, if you like logic then do it and there is so much good feedback here, although I have 15000 subscribers on this channel, I am getting very good feedback and I want to grow on this page, I do not want anyone to stop me. I want that those who understand things should get 1 lakh subscribers. It is good to hear, drink milk, it is winter, add turmeric along with it, it should be jaggery, ok, jaggery is the factor of what is milk?  Whose factor is turmeric and whose factor is it and if your spouse is sitting next to you, your wife or wife is fine, your husband or wife is fine and you are in the quilt and her house is yours, I have set things up today by giving you a small remedy. It is very much like this and there is no issue in your life or there is too much of this in your life, you do this as long as this winter is going on, watch good content, listen to good things and make time for yourself at night time.

    "title": "Transit Kahan Se Dekhein ？ ｜ Lagan Se Ya Moon Rashi Se [e7WHzbBlTbk].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, this is a very popular question in astrology, where to see the transit, where to see the transit, the transit that happens in the horoscope, people see it from the Moon sign, see it from the Ascendant sign, astrologers also have different opinions on this, I have an opinion of mine.  I will tell you, watch with dedication, Saturn's transit of Sade Sati is seen from Moon zodiac, rest you watch with dedication, dedication is your everything.  Yes, it can be shown through the mind also, but you will understand only through hit and trial that what affects it. My observation has shown that if we are looking at the transit of women, it is the horoscope of the woman and if she is a woman, then we should look at her.  Women can see from the Moon, yet men are more receptive to the Moon. I have generally observed that the dedication of men is the dedication of your zodiac sign. Do you know that the dedication is different for the moon sign?  If the ascendant is different then it is called D and chart, which is called Devan chart, then see the transit from Devan chart only. When Saturn is in Sade Sati in you and Moon, yes I agree, it is seen from Moon and by seeing from both of you, you can see your individual.  You can also check which one of mine works more, which one has more effect, will the Moon one have no effect at all, will it not be from D1 only, will the Moon one also have an effect, its percentage will also be anything.  Going ath from your Moon will trouble you, it will be fine as Saturn becomes Dhaiya, it is fine, but look at Lagan also and mostly do it on Lagan because it is simple astrology, I do not want to complicate, what is normal in technical keys now?  It happens that when people learn anything, they can learn it from zero to 80 very easily and instead of learning it directly, they talk about 95 to 100 level first.  Now you have to learn, out of 0 to 100, you are sitting at 10, the journey can be made from 10 to 80. Instead of doing that comfortably, everyone will get into the technical like me too. You guys are posting simple astrology videos in the comment section.  People have to ask straight Navansh, people have to go straight to Ashta Varga, people have to go straight to Nakshatra, people have to go straight to earth, this is like this, when you learn astrology, I should do it like this and this.  Then you can't learn anything, learn it as easily as it is taught, the journey is simple, it will go smoothly, why is it like preparing for IAS or any big exam, if I learn everything, then nothing will come of it, brother, little  -Learn a little bit, as much as the rest is a game of luck, will the paper come? Many people dilute themselves so much, I am not able to understand it, tell me this, tell that, tell me, connect the dots. No, it is like bites, you can eat, there is only so much food in the mouth, so only so much food can be put in it, so that it can eat, it is such a small mouth, if you put so much, it will not be eaten, that is the simple astrology, relax, watch my channel or other channels. Don't compare with me, my channel is very relaxed and excellent, I will tell you little by little, no one tells you, they start teaching everyone and these basic doubts arise that are not clear in your mind and your  Innocent questions come, there is no normal patience. Whenever there is a teacher who is doing paid courses and teaching, he is doing a little of that. I have complete patience here. There is no such question, it is a very innocent question and this is a stupid question. You are also having basic doubt regarding astrology, he should ask but now don't ask directly that brother, you explain it to me D60, ok Satans, that one, reach beyond that D3, reach something there, don't reach here brother.  You will learn it gradually and if you reach there in two to four years, you will see and that too will be taught and explained easily. Do not be afraid of astrology, you have to enjoy astrology. Learning astrology is a very good remedy in itself. I will tell you this because in the eighth grade.  It is connected to the house, if you have any activity from the eighth house, which I am just explaining about the house and all that and leaving it here only by giving a hint, then if you are learning astrology then somewhere else it gets cut off, which means a lot to you by learning astrology.  there will be benefits  You will get relaxation and as much can be digested in a day, small people say, tell big videos in one go, teach quickly in one go, brother, there is a lot to learn in one go, there is a lot of curiosity, there is a lot of everything, there is a lot of excitement. Comment. My Astrology Astro Vedic course is in the section, it has 12 classes, it is of two and a half hours, buy it, the work is done, here the government job is like a slide, the office will be done comfortably and peacefully, today we will learn only this much.  Just like Yudhishthir ji had learned, always speak the truth in a week because whenever any knowledge has to be understood, it has to be internalized, then it is learned gradually and it is learned in small portions, that is why I am five-seven  From the video of just one minute, your little one as they say, if you feed the baby then you don't feed it like this, you feed it like this only, to whom it is happening that I know this much, you can tell me all this.  Used to be  I know that by predicting me like this, Vedic Astro Course, Diwali is coming. Anyone who wants a little discount can ask from me, I will give it till Diwali, it is ok and anyway it is very cheap or very cheap, if you see the rate then you will say.  Should I ask for a discount but if you ask, I will still go and learn because you are very curious, okay then you take it, it is very cheap, okay, it costs less than a picture outing and 24  The content is of 25 26 hours, it is very 25 26 hours, you will understand its meaning very well. Those who do not have patience, those who have patience, then we are learning here, we are learning slowly, we are learning in small portions, so learn this also.  Thank you very much"

    "title": "Two Types Of Astrologers ｜ Which One Do You Want To Become ？ [eG5jIaD0igs].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, these initial videos of my basic astrology are going on which will be 10 to 12 in total. In this, today I am going to tell a very interesting thing to the subscribers and understand this thing very carefully because you are also one of them.  You will become an astrologer and the astrologers whom you go to are of one of these two types and today I will recognize you, there are two astrologers, one is Venus based.  An astrologer is a Jupiter based one. In Hindi, astrologers are Venus based, one is Shukracharya based and one is Guru based. You will find only two types wherever you go. Today I will differentiate them and tell you a little and you have to recognize which one you want to become.  Or which category of astrologers do you see? It is okay and you will get a very good match. If you ask me which one is good, first of all if you ask, you will say that  Till the end I will tell you whether Venus is best or Jupiter is best then it is like that every friend is important, both have their own significance, it will depend more on your nature that which will work better for you, allopathy doctor will work better.  Or if you do Ayurvedic, then I will tell you their differences. Understand that Venus based exposure is allopathic and Jupiter is best, understand that it is Ayurvedic because you will get allopathy and  I am sure there is a lot of difference in Ayurvedic, I know that both are fine in the mind, this is for long term and this is for emergency, Modern Medical Science, those astrologers having Venus base will look a little thin, they will look bright and high on energy.  They will speak quickly and make such predictions and their consultation usually lasts for 5 10 15 20 minutes. Your Jupiter will be the best.  They will be fat to little, the smile on the face will keep going on, there will be a pause and first of all, when you come to them so sad, then as soon as you come sad and come in an emergency, the person in Venus looks so professional to you that Yes yes yes, we will do this chart like this, tell me the time, tell me this and it starts everything, ok, Jupiter will be like this, it is a good problem, ok, ok, we will do it ok, then you will feel that man, this is looking loose.  There is a little Guru, which Guru will be the best, Jupiter will be West. Incidentally, I am telling you that the fee of the one of Jupiter West will be very high, it will be very high, I will also tell his region from Venus base, the one of Jupiter will do a consultation in 2 days because he is going to stay cold.  If he is relaxed, he will do five in a day, then the difference between the one who is doing 510 in a day and the one who is doing one in two days, plus his consultation will be 5 10 15.  Its duration will be 20 minutes, 25 minutes, 30 minutes. It will be one hour for minimum, it can be one and a half or two and a half minutes. There is a difference in this that it will also cure you, it will also cure you, it will cure you permanently, Jupiter is the best one, never again in your life or any astrologer.  There will be no need to go near it, it will mostly take away all your pain in life in one go and if you will not be able to go near it again, then you will not be a repeat customer. What is this? This is also an important steroid type.  The man is dying like a nut, literally, but steroids save him, okay, you know, that is Gem Stos Remedies, he will tell that kind of karmic remedy, eat like this, sleep like this, get up like this, wear like this, no expenses like this.  There is no water, worship this one a lot, go there, go to the tree, go there, go here, go here, I am not criticizing anyone, don't think that I am praising it, praise it.  Both are necessary depending on your situation and who you are and where is your Venus, where is your Jupiter and what kind of person you are, then you will automatically understand that yes, this is right for me, it is not for me like I am.  I know what type I am and I know from the horoscope what type the next person is, then if he is not my type then I refuse, okay I refuse, it is not in my power, you are not for me. Because if you go to him whether you want a job or are not getting promotion, if you want promotion, then he will force you to do something for promotion, no matter how much probability comes out in it, because it is client based, this one will tell you.  Now why should you say this nonsense, I am giving you so much money and you should ask me why should you say that even if you don't get any benefit by taking it, you will be away from the family and will stay away from the family and will remain irritable there.  it  Even promotion is not going to give you happiness, right now you are at rest, right now you are worried, you don't know how long it is, because Jupiter's horizon is very big and his vision is very far away and he thinks big, Varvara, your Jupiter is the one who will think big there.  Everything will become big there, Venus is this Venus. If you understand, like if you are doing puja or a wedding is taking place, if any ritual is taking place then Venus will be the base person, whatever astrologer call it or call it puja.  It will be very strict, only the left hand has to be moved forward, then it has to be done like this, then now now do this on the left, now get up, now do this, do this, now at this time, it will happen like this, and this is necessary, it is not condemned, it is not condemned by someone from Jupiter. Just like a client asks, yes, this has to be done on the same day, do it when you feel like doing it, then the next one will feel like this, this is the big one, the Venus person will not say like this, the Venus person will say at 12:30.  Abhijeet, by doing this at the right time, you go there in that direction, like this, this is allopathy, okay here it is that brother, what you have brought, you have not come to me to get treatment for problems, you have come to get treatment for your symptoms.  The problem is that you have so many symptoms, brother, the fee of the West person is five to six times that of Venus base, also know this, the fee is huge and he will talk very coldly, so you have to see that you get your bed.  I have to take a solution that the blood came out, stitch me, put a bed, take it out, that too is needed, sometimes you have a problem, this one will not do it, this one will not do the small consultation, I want this small consultation.  If it doesn't work, then release yourself whether you are in a Venus based situation, a Venus based astrologer situation or even a Jupiter face situation, I have told you that you will look like Golu Molu.  With Jupiter Venus, you will seem very sharp and very focused and very serious. There will not be much smile on your face and there will be a sense of urgency and the urgency will be to help you and also for the next client because there is a lot to do. Now the Jupiter guy is sitting comfortably, today if he has to do only one thing then he will give you full time but he is taking money, he is fat, at the end of the day both are earning almost the same, you can think this but it can happen.  It is a bit too ritualistic, being ritualistic is bad, it is good, it is not a point of discussion because it is required in few cases, like if you go into medical science, then it is ritualistic, isn't it? Medical Modern Medical Science Judges all rituals, whatever it is, first of all  When we give glucose to Lita, it is a procedure, it is a ritual that after taking this lump, all these tests will be done, you will have all the tests, so you will have to get the tests done, that too.  There is a ritual, then reports will come, then on the basis of the report, something will be given to him, there is a sense of urgency in it, is it a good thing, yes, it is a good thing, it depends on the time, what is your biggest thing, what did I tell you, how did I explain in the best way. What kind of disease is yours, what kind of treatment do you need, what kind of permanent treatment do you need, why did it come and sometimes what happens is that both are needed that you take it in an emergency and then use it to solve the whole problem. took  Astrology is not meant for a common man, it is meant for a special man, so the expenses have to be paid because some man, the old deeds of your 20, 30, 40, 50 years, this karma, this karma, give you clarity, save your big money from sinking.  Save me from getting trapped in a relationship. Save me from getting trapped in a relationship. Your energy is getting too much. If you save her then brother, her fees will be quite a bit, not that lakhs and crores of people waste it.  Wrong marriage can just destroy you. Not marriage can also destroy you. If I marry me, it will destroy me. So, without marrying, within a few days, I will destroy myself because someone else has destroyed me.  Didn't do it but you do n't realize that by being alone you can do it to yourself and when you realize that I am more dangerous being alone by myself because people very easily say no, don't get married, hey brother first.  Look at what you are worth, you are worthy of being alone with yourself, when people come to me asking that yes, I didn't do it, first see, don't take it, she will come and do this to me, Section 498 will be done, this will happen, oh brother, you are with yourself.  If she commits a scandal, then there is a chance with her, whether she will or not, it is not necessary that a girl comes in every marriage, I was born to do 498, girls are not born like this, it is okay, so there is a chance, but yours. with  You don't know what you can do by being yourself and then when you do it, then you will come to the marriage market to recover, then brother, all your hair has grown out, your age is above 40, so what will you get then?  So you can take this thing through a consultation, you can take this that I have taken the choice of life, someone has taken the suggestion that I should not marry, this is a choice, then they should say that this is a choice.  How will she work out? She gives a perfect workout for many people because they can stay with themselves, they are cool minded, do some of their work, keep reading and writing, do some work, is there any purpose, is there a fulfillment example, I am telling you that this is a long and long time.  If you want to see something long, if you want to see it for 10 years or 20 years then Jupiter is in waste. The boss is on your head in life. Every day, 10 days, 15 days are not passing.  When the days are not passing, when five days are not passing, it is an emergency situation. Venus is the best. Venus is the best. And when you want to prolong it, then if you have passed through it and do not want to go to it again and again, then take a look at this also once. Look at both of them.  Lo, understand the difference between the two, but today at least I have told this wonderful thing through this video. Otherwise, we astrologers do not understand how to judge that which one is this, what is he doing, this is bad, he has Gemstone.  If he has told you about worship, if he has told you this then it is bad. If he has not told then it is good. But brother, he has not shown even by doing any magic. In five minutes he will show you something by doing something during the day. So if he is doing something for a long time then it is in this.  If you have so much patience then he also took the full amount of money. Someone took less consultation fee and told you five things and medicine. Someone took five times the money for those five medicines but did not give the medicine. So many times people took this too.  There are so many that I feel useless  If medicine should not be given to me, then again the answer lies with you both of them are required, both of them are good, both of them are experts, both of them are required, they say the same thing, isn't it about astrology also, it is not a stream or types. What kind of people are there? You will be able to do anything. Like I told you with a beautiful example, doctors are also of different types, some are like this and some are not like this. All such methods have their own requirement like allopathy is very popular these days because people want instant results, so this may be required in your life, you have to get instant results and then go to get your treatment done because this one is this one.  If you say Jupiter is the best then you will say why are you getting it done, don't you, Guru ji, I have to get it done, you have to get it done, then you will have to do something else, then in a very good way, I will get it done.  It seems that I am explaining well and it is very important to clear the base. Before we start our technical part of it, we say OK, Kundli is the house, Rashi is what, this is what it is, so we have to start, but it is important to talk about these things first.  Out of these, write to me in the comment section, which astrologer have you followed in your life? Now do it mentally, okay, which one do you want to become yourself or how do you feel, after hearing these things, which way are you inclined? Jupiter  Both of them will have to learn this, this one, Jupiter, also knows all these tantra mantras, this one also knows, do it like this, but even after knowing everything, this one says this, chant Gayatri after waking up in the morning.  After doing it, he will turn it into a mantra, he also knows everything, he also knows everything, he is the Shukracharya, he is the teacher of the demons, if you call him the teacher of the miscreant children, then the teacher of the miscreant children is not a guru, he is very patient like that. And it makes a lot of sense to them also because when he was asked whose will you belong to, then Guru belongs to the Gods and he belongs to them, so I am not saying that if you are going to Venus then you give. Or by the way Varsa But I am telling this story through my word of mouth which runs like Puranic stream, Guru has so much respect for Shukracharya of Venus that when the Guru wanted to learn Vidya to teach his child, he sent him to him too.  There is a back story so this is how both of them respect each other while knowing it is just that both of them know what I bring the other person dozen bring the other person is bringing something very different and special which may be required  For that person so both of them recommend to each other also this person will say ok this go to this  And here is the case of this one and yours, you must have seen that even among the doctors, many times, the ethical doctors, who are good doctors, refer that brother, this one is my friend, that one is good, so this also happens because he is very good.  You are doing it by cleaning yourself because it comes to know because Jupiter Best comes to know that only this will help the person because its requirement is like this, it does not have that kind of thing, it needs it like this right now, there are many such people. not now  By doing this here, rest of the things come, yes, see, yes, we look at the month and two months also, we do the personnel, so this is how it is, so remember this, make notes, I hope you are making notes, I want my subscriber was.  It is okay to make notes here and please include more students with your family and all. If you make notes then learning becomes better. Have you ever seen any subject?  We do joint studies etc. as it is always good in the family, if husband and wife learn or children learn or with parents or with someone then you will have a bonding over a shared knowledge that friend, I have understood this, you have understood this, then there will be notes to come.  It is possible in time, if the subscribers of my channel increase and I like it and also get time, then I will not commit even a single free bit for whatever five 10 classes I cover.  I am depending on how I get the response, beyond that I will clear the doubts like A is for L, B is for Boy C, then you have spelled A for L, if someone has a doubt then I will keep clearing it because my aim is to spread astrology.  But just understand, I would like to send 10 people to 20 people, I would not like to come just for this, I will also have 500 Hajj, so it feels good to tell them because they say right in the rally.  When a big leader goes, he sees a good crowd, then brothers and sisters, if it doesn't happen, you can see till there and from here to there and the eyes are not able to see, then there is a feeling like this, that is the feeling, if you want that feeling then You people can give that feeling, what is the problem for you people, increase your subscribers, start learning and no one else is telling things in such a simple way which can sink into your mind because as soon as everyone comes, they start talking about astrology and then  The doubts that people were having, these things of mine are clearing their mind webs, it is like this for you, not like this, it is like that, he has robbed us, this one has robbed us, if you go to the wrong person, you will get robbed.  If you go to the wrong people, you will be robbed. How to recognize them will be my next topic. Now I have told the types of astrologers. In the next one, I will tell you how to judge an astrologer. Is there any way?  We judge the doctor later whether he has done it for us or not. So, if we find out a way to do it later, we can get some idea in advance without associating too much with him. Look, you will have to eat food at least once.  You will have to test something to know whether it is good or not, but I will still tell you the parameters to judge the astrologers who do astrology, no one will tell with such transparency, it is very important and all that astrology is ours.  I of the Fraternity want to tell and teach things to you all easily. Other wise people will not connect with astrology. These times are coming, these old times and old knowledge are coming. People are confused, mighty confused which is our country.  When he was a golden bird, he was an average educated man who used to roam around thousands of years ago. He knew all these basic things. He knew many things. We never got into many arguments with our grandparents. Now  Those things were of his, do them like this, take milk in turmeric like this, get up from the left, get up from the right, or like this, all those things are now done through reels, through paid courses of people and western people who are ours.  By copying they made patents and through them we are getting to know that if they say that home's chicken is equal to pulses then that is the same thing, home's chicken is equal to pulses but now we have to spread this knowledge and it is our responsibility, it is the moral responsibility.  And if you learn any of this yourself and analyze it yourself, then what is hypocrisy? Then who will rob you? Brother, what deception can there be in improving your life by analyzing your chart yourself? You understand what I am saying, it is not deception.  You are taking out your buffalo milk and boiling it, then you are making banana shake yourself in your mixer, so now what will be the deception in this, you are thinking that you have deceived yourself, so the hotel is with you.  be in  Maybe you are going out somewhere, maybe you have learned something once that this is a vegetable, it is available from here, it is cut like this, it is made like this and this is roti, this is wheat, this is flour, I made it and I ate food in it.  So there can't be much deception being done to you, you are the one doing it, so this is the M and when this M spreads then clarity will come among the people and our knowledge will increase and this is very relaxing, there is a lot of relaxation in the society today. This channel will go away or  The first thing to do through astrology is to bring stability in life, take a deep breath, relax, smile on the face, it is not forceful, it is what the air crew does when they go, they do it like this, you know, poor girl, she is on her third flight and has not had food since morning.  Have eaten and now they will make ttttt bells and come and tie the belt in 5 minutes, close the belt and that smile is not that smile, that smile is very forceful and I am not criticizing them, their work is like this only.  And people are such scoundrels, demanding and they still have to smile, I should never smile at such people, it is okay, okay then the actual genuine smile that comes from within, the smile that does not stop will come through. Well, astrology teaches us to smile, I thought it gives predictions of the World Cup, this Corona tells us to cry, so I will tell you that too, what nonsense is going on, a crazy game is going on.  Useless work is going on, I will make videos beyond that too, but first absorb my 12, then we will start technical and in between, such doubt sessions will also keep happening. Thank you very much."

    "title": "Understanding And Learning  Practical Astrology ｜ Saral Jyotish At Best ｜ Must Watch Video [0L6jWH5YEF4].en",
    "content": "So hello welcome everyone to Honest Astrologer, today my guest is very special, I would say to him that he is the most practical astrologer of India. He not only calls himself an astrologer but also calls himself a social reformer and in my opinion he is the person who does many things which we  Think but are not able to say, his contribution has been that he has brought that thing into the main stream and said it without any fear and has challenged those things which were very Hippocratic. But people are not able to speak. I salute his wisdom and he took out time for us. I am very grateful to him. Amit Sangwan Sir from Sango Life Sutra Sir Welcome to An Honor the Channel, this is your podium, this is yours, I will go to the channel.  Interview Roll And Please I'll Quickly Start With My Questions So Sir The First Time I Got To Know About You When You Reply To The Dhruv Video And God Knows  I wanted to but many of my friends said it's a political issue, it will happen like this, it will happen like that, so I made a video and deleted it, I said let's not post it so what give you the tax on astrology I like I will say that your channel name  Is an honest astrologer? So now why have you kept honest astrologer, it means that there are many astrologers who are not honest, so there is some dogma around.  Astrologers but now to take it that they should also take it to astrology like I told in that example also that doctors can be abused yes it is okay medical science cannot be abused okay doctors are good some are bad some are good Many are very good, similarly there are astrologers, more quantity of astrologers may be bad, it is possible, but the thing which is not known is good, then more comments beyond that.  Do it without complete research because what is there on social media, if you type something anywhere right now that the Earth is flat, then you will get articles even beyond that, at least you will get something, okay, the moon landing has not happened, no one has done anything about it.  Show me the proof, show me and then show me that this is a narrative, it was said like this, now people use astrology like a game of drunkenness that show me a magician, then in my opinion astrology is so easy to understand. Jyotish is just a part of Astrology, Jyotish is nothing but Jyot Plus, Jyotish is the Light of God, which awakens the light of God and shows the world that Jyotish, Jyotish is about so many things which you know. Okay, so I thought, just for the sake of it, it suits him that Baba is there and then he clubbed everything and put it within astrology, so I thought. Some people need to say this because of what it means if you don't speak then look, one thing that happens is that you come and say 'come on, someone is speaking' but if there are 10 million subscribers on such a big platform then it's okay if someone comes like this.  If you make fun of me, I am not saying this, I do n't even know how many views my video got, but the ratio is 100, but it is like your poet, there are people like I teach.  If people had told me then it would have been like that if I did not do this then I had made the video, after me Dipanshu Giri ji, he had also made 'Lar Astro P Sir', the second thing due to which I became your fan, you have shown the very bad condition of Indian Holi Cows.  Those things which people are afraid to name or speak, our conventional wisdom says as a parent, god, whatever has to be done or if you speak against feminism, people get angry.  If you speak against government jobs, people get angry. I have received a lot of trolling and hate many times because I have spoken against these things, so the first thing is your insight, how did you come to know that this thing is wrong because we are brain controlled.  Bachpan se through movies you pray to society how did one release you and how did you decide ki haa ye maine bolna hai bhale se mujhe hate kyun na mile si what happens e  Social conditioning has happened like it happens in all societies and it has happened in Indian society too and it is necessary to happen if we have to live in a good society but unfortunately what happens is the social conditioning of 30 years ago which was done 40 years ago.  Many had gone, it is not applicable nowadays, okay, what used to happen earlier, the parents were illiterate, when independence came, they had children, their children were illiterate.  Actually good, it means they are better than the parents. Now the parents who got educated after the second generation of independence, their children also became educated, then their children also became educated, so now the fact is that the difference  Was there not much difference between the parents? What happened in the difference between the parents? Jonah was born in 1950 and 60. He was born in 1950 and 1960.  There are children who were born first after independence, they will be born before 47, only then will they become a father. The one of 51 was lower in the society, was not born in a free country, was not educated, the country itself was poor, so everyone was poor, now this is the generation.  Better now, this generation struggled a lot just like the country struggled. The country 's struggle was very high from 1950 to 1980. Then came the time of Narasimha Rao ji, things happened after 91. And little by little we kept improving and today we have reached at 2023, so this generation of 1950-60 has also done Chaudhary Hat on their parents because their parents were actually educated, they were not educated, their parents and their  Parents also left early because life expectancy was low, brother, India's life was short, so they got Chaudhary, if you do research 25 At the age of 30-35, now all of them have turned 75. For 40 years, no one has questioned their thought processes and their sense of achievement is so high because they have seen poverty and poverty, have worked hard and become fans.  From fan to cooler, from cooler to AC to split AC, his sense of achievement is very high and from that sense of achievement comes an arrogance.  It is we who have worked hard. I am talking about the people who have gone towards the middle class. Okay, so now what is the difference with that. The new generation is oppressed. Yes Sir, because now that generation is sitting on assets, the assets which have increased since 1950 are also there.  The assets that the 60 people got, there was no cost of land, there was nothing in the land during independence, okay, now those who are sitting on the assets, they have been sitting on that much for many years.  And neither money is earned nor the generation gets assets because of the meaning of inheritance. I have made videos that brother, if the father lives till 90 years then that child will also turn 65-70, not 65-68, till then he will get it and then he will sit.  He will not be able to do anything for 90 years, so to say this, see what happens in India when God starts speaking, I have told this to the parents before too, I will repeat it on my channel also, here your God.  There is a lot of forgiving, yes, it is okay if one's God is also very forgiving and forgetful, I also do consultation under the garb of this, I want your well being, a lot of narcissism is going on, now narcissism is a word, it is like a western word in India now.  It has not come but then this is such a thing that parents should not be afraid of being questioned, the belief system being broken because if this  If things do n't change then we will remain in the time warp, our time was good, that was our time, sometimes, always, the time which is today is good and tomorrow will be better than today, we have to follow this feeling, only then the country, society and world will progress and sir.  I Totally Love You For What You Said About Baghban That Movie Has Destroyed Hum Aapke Hain Koun And Baghban These Should Be Legally Banned Baghban Baghban If You Do The Research What I Have Done Is Based On American  Movie of 1940 Okay, so in the America of 1940, this feeling was going on, if you do the research but that was like 1940, now America, everything happened after that, whatever progress happened in America, the American society was also struggling with it, so what was that?  It happens that while doing all these things, a little bit, people feel good in crying, not that yes, we did this, we did it like this, we did it like that, and the children do it, you see, I just tell people, don't follow the Amitabh Bachchan. Character in Bagwaan Follow Amitabh Bachchan in real life Abhishek Bachchan lives together, Aishwarya also lives with him, Aaradhya also lives with him, Everyone lives comfortably, Live in Jalsa, Live as a family, There may be clashes but stay together.  We are living with love, we are building assets, we are building businesses, everything is happening together, so what Amitabh Bachchan ji is doing in real life, we have to follow what he did in Bagwaan, that is not ji.  Yes, great sir, you have spoken a lot on career and I come from an HR background so I know who is speaking accurately and who is speaking nonsense. Your words did not resonate with me, as we have come to the upper management.  Had learned that friend, this is happening in middle management in the market, even we did not know about it. Apart from your clarity, I would like you to give some career tips, especially for the youth, those who are in government.  Preparing for jobs, I refuse, I get abused a lot. Secondly, people who are interested in foreign education, I am mostly not a fan of foreign education. The third thing is that people who want to go into such a career with high failure rate, have it become writing or acting.  It becomes a little difficult to explain to them, this is my approach to me, this is my personality of my channel, I do not believe much in explaining to people that I am not to anyone.  We have to convince the angry people, we have to motivate them, I am for the champion, that you are the champion, or to make them champions without you, it is like the Olympic coach, the Olympic coach does not teach you swimming, does not teach you how to throw javelin, he is taking you for the gold medal, all of you  Okay, so I am every kind of people, it is necessary if there are not many losers in life then there will be winners from winners, let those who want to go do whatever they want, here I am, I am roulette in that way brother.  It is not forced to explain. Whatever you have to do, do it on your own. When you have doubts, the man comes to ask. If you are so convinced about that foreign degree will do well for you then go and do it. Why are you asking?  I come from the world if you feel writing is good and this is good that is good then don't do it I am stopping you I don't understand why  Can't you do 20 things, I do 68 things, I have told you, I don't even tell you much, why waste time, brother, let's talk about work, what do I do, I do 68 different things, even 10 20 things in these  The public domain, rest I do something in my private, so a person can do anything and in which you get peace or money or success, then the more you do it is like  De Se Na Luck Luck is like a verb You have to be at it to become lucky If you do 10 things then one thing will be good Learning will happen and then if you do something else then if you do something more then it will help the youth Not by holding on but by holding the finger I I give this meaning through template, my videos will also bring clarity for youth, I talk about career but more like I talk about career, first of all I am like, very focused on career. Now people will say no, career is like you have been in HR and corporate then look at the career, you should focus on living a good life, a career is a part of it but if you can be at 80 in your career it is a good. Thing Relationship at 80 Money at 80 Health at 80 Because If You Go for 100% That Journey from 80 to is So Tough That in Everything Else You You will turn 20 today if you have to excel in any career, it is okay like a corporate career or even government, also people are so ready to endure their life that they are all in after enduring everything, they are all in so you have to take a call.  That Do You Want To Be All In Are You Happy With The Lesser Increment Lesser Promotion Lesser Pay Increase Divota Your Brain Juice And Energy And Time To  Other Aspects of Life To live a fulfilling life and at the same time try to do something small business and so that you can always be still ahead of this person because even the career shop closes, it happens to everyone one day and the way  The matter is going on now. In the IC corporate career, the shop is to be closed in 45 to 50 years if you don't come from that blue blood pedigree of IIT. IM And That's High Five Degrees Na If That's Not Your Normal Profile Then They Will Say You Will Reach A Position At 45 Bhai Ab Tere Ko Upar To Nahi Jasa Is Iss Up To Na Jaga Nahi Jaaye Lock Cricketer Will Retire At Some Stage Ok  There is something very new and good will come right in our time they used to say new 6th stage aa one thing I used to say to my class is looking for government when a asking elder answer Nai Aayi Thane said that there is also a technicality in it that in the competition, are you looking at the horoscope of a person? You can just tell whether it is yours or not, will you benefit from the government, if so then maybe you will get a job. Next question sir.  What would be your advice to those people who want to make good money in life, don't mean billion, not everyone can make it but a working middle class man, how to live a good life financially. This is the problem nowadays, so many people have also come into financial influences and they are taking all the focus like this question is wrong, how is this question wrong, I just tell you focus should not be on becoming, rest focus should be on having.  A Capability to Add Value in the Life of Others Money Will Be Taken Care of If You Have a Capability to Add Value in the Life of Others  If you suppose you are just selling your time to someone, if I get 160-180 hours of work in a week, then it is not making any sense, it is okay because that time is limited, now the question arises whether it should be given to me. Simply growing your skills so that you can charge more is good for him only when you are able to add value in that Zuckerberg said value.  Add curry, he got money. Anybody is adding value anywhere. The L people did whatever because of technology or because of their brain. Now like a maid comes to cook for you, she comes and cooks. She is cooking and she is taking 000 000 mein yes 5000 mein she can cook something now if she knows more dishes Now she has learned dosa and has come again  She learned some more dishes then she can come and ask for 8000 because earlier she was making normal dal, roti and dal rice for you, now she is making certain other things. Okay, so concentrating on value adding capability is money.  A by product of if you just focus on money then that is not your capability, neither is focusing on money thinking that becoming rich is not going to help me.  On your capability and skills, you will have to acquire some such skills whose money is in demand in the market and the market will value it. Next question: Hardcore Astrology. Most of the people come to astrologers in the condition of Shani Rahu or Ketu. And I have written a book on Shani Rahu.  And Ketu, so what advice would you give to these people who are going through Shani Rahu and Ketu Mahadasha or End Dasha? Look at some of yours, a little bit of all three.  It is different, there will be detachment inside Ketu and things will not be understood and it is a small dasha, it is of seven years old, it is okay and it will not be understood, okay it will come because of that, there is too much friction in Saturn, it is not being understood, absent down in Rahu.  Very many are coming, okay but the answer to all three things is the same if all three are going on because in that then how are your individual charts, how is your individual position, so many things are  Affected is fine, transit etc. and after doing all that, but to tell you the basic thing, your Rahu is moving, whatever gains are happening or the condition of Rahu, whatever is going negative is also a dream and  Positive, a lot of things are looking great, that too is a dream, after this is over, nothing will remain with you, neither bad nor good, so do not be afraid of the worst and do not be too happy with the good. Whatever gains are happening in Rahu, it is better to take them out and adjust them somewhere else in the name of some family member, so give them the last other wise, they will be destroyed. Said, it was a lot of fun trading, brother, made a portfolio worth Rs 25 crores.  But now again something like that buzz Rahu will show you this pride of 25 lakhs, even the brain will not listen, hygge will also come because of Amitabh Bachchan too if you see his lot. Movies Hit Rahu's Dasha And All That's Okay But Then Again He Went That Complete Super Stardom And Then Then We Know Kaun Banega Crorepati Se Again The Matter Changed Okay In Between That Period Game Ya Kut Sustain The Guess To Rahu  The good thing about Shani is that brother, you will have to work hard, you will get less results than the amount of work you do, but you will definitely get it, Shani will not deny you, delay you.  Will test your patience, whether it is of Sade S or of Shani, patience will be tested but deny more that you have to be a little bit patient and a little bit detached Sir, you are also a neurologist, I do not even know the ABC of Neurology but in my life,  I have seen that the lives of those with numbers four and eight are very up and down. I myself am number four and the numbers of my vehicles and the numbers of my house come on default four for some reasons and as much as I know neurology. Four and eight are considered to be very difficult numbers, so here are your observations and some suggestions for them. Sir, the suggestion is that four and eight are perhaps more difficult for others than for themselves, so do n't be afraid of four and eight for yourself.  Maybe the people around them are scared because of their nature because they don't care, this is their struggle. My two videos uploaded on 4 and 8 have become quite popular on my channel because after I told 7, 4 and 8, it got closed. I am fine.  And I have included three, four, seven, eight and three. All four are very popular. Seven has become the most popular because the way I explain it with Numerical Ji examples and I do n't think that on youtube, four and eight, I will tell the basic thing that energy like houses.  If we talk about residential house of four and eight, normally people say because I am in real estate, they also say that it should not be taken in the house, now people do not know the logic of residential house because if  If you know the logic, then you can live four and eight, they do not let you survive, there is a lot of energy, now your house becomes four and eight, then you will work from home as you are probably doing, then the house is for peace, but if there are four and  If eight is the number of your commercial shop then it is very good because there will be foot falls only foot falls there, there will never be any crowd there, by increasing the crowd, you got what you want in commercial, you don't want peace in commercial, four and eight in commercial. In Very Good Residential we call it four and eight. If an elderly man has to live here in a four and eight house then there may be some issue for him because the energy will not be like that but if it is a young couple then it is a work couple.  Is it from home or is it some kind of network that they are doing such work that people come and go in the house like a politician, now the politician's home and office, you know, everything is the same thing, such people keep sitting in his house, meeting outside and inside. Security in the lawn inside and outside and that too, so those four and eight are big good faces for him, if he himself is four and eight then it is okay but the one thing about four and eight is that both of them look good on each other but their  The world view you have is a little strict, your sense of compassion is less, because as your father is four, your sense of purpose, which you feel is necessary for others, does not come naturally to others if someone is working.  Under you, if you are in HR then the people below you will cry because your outlook is to work without supervision, to work with all your heart and mind, to give everything. If you are getting salary, justify it three times, if you are getting two lakhs then it is 6 lakhs.  If it is okay to do the work then it is a natural trait. Now it is not that you will be able to do it alone, anywhere you can even rub the people below you in isolation, isn't it like the work of a laborer is being done that you have to do it?  If you want to lift, then you have lifted too much. If you are the boss, then rub the bottom also, then the person below feels very rubbed and what is yours in it, then the emotional connect with the family or with the worldly world is a little less.  Because there is always a strictness in it, so a little plus or double caprice comes, that also remains, that is, I work in my business in seven days, so my doctor and my wife, with great difficulty, got me to take half a day off for the whole day.  Will you not do it in the evening? We are seeing a lot of disharmony in couples these days. Children live in the house and go away. Breakups happen over small things. Disputes in every house. What would be your top two or three tips to maintain peace in the house? There is little in my wife. Meaning, if not a lot of love, then at least there should be a sustainable peace. Look, people have started focusing on one problem, look, job, money, everything else, the focus has shifted from marriage and gets sucked into the job.  is man  Patience is not good and there is competition among ourselves about bringing to the table, there is too much competition as to what the wife is doing, she is not working, the mother-in- law is not working at home, the husband has to work, life itself will be busy.  It is normal as it used to be earlier, the duties were divided that the father would take care of the children at home, there would be guests in the house, food would be cooked, father would go out and come back after his job, the boss would not shout at him.  He shouted that there is no stress, he had to do the work, he knew it, his wife also knew that it was my job, I am not supposed to wash the clothes, I am not supposed to clean it in the house, and they also used to quarrel among themselves, but he used to go on with the matter.  The evolution of the old ones, about which I told you, their parents were poor, illiterate, they used to harass their daughters-in-law or whatever, they also had demands, but their demands were very basic. The present mother-in-law of the past had  I am talking about my mother-in-law, okay, today's mother-in-law, who has become 19560, I am talking about her mother-in-law, okay, so it used to be her, 'Give something to my daughter, while we say hello, our basic needs would have been fulfilled.'  What do people say these days that there is some interference because it is said that we all know that these days, where will the children invest, where will they buy a house, what clothes will they wear, how will they raise the children, what food will they eat because the previous generation was poor now.  They used to feel enjoying experience in everything, like if a child has taken a cooler, then for the first time the cooler is in the mouth, for the first time, the AC is in the mouth, if for the first time, you are sitting in a car, then that generation was still giving that feeling, the next generation.  Today's mother-in-law and father-in-law say, 'Dude, you are doing something good'. Today's generation is not getting the feeling that we are doing something and watch their demanding programs or reels. Look at this and one lack of fomo type is not knowing what is happening in the other's life, then they are bitis, the last generation is sitting very judgmental, okay and there is a lot of demanding program between husband and wife that neither husband can meet.  If the wife can do it, then they need to relax first of all. The new couple should never stay with the mother-in-law and father-in-law the moment they go to another house.  The problem ends % after that both of them together cook food, order from Sugi, wash their own underwear, wash their own clothes in the washing machine, wash the maids, dry or not dry utensils in the kitchen, do not wash them at night and the trouble is over and we will see what is there.  Whatever is left, they deal with it. What is the problem now? The syllabus of this generation has increased a lot, the syllabus of marriage has become very wide, it is not limited to them, it has to be reduced.  The syllabus will have to be changed, as it is happening these days, AI is eating one job after the others, many people are getting hired, we are studying in new every day, like big companies like Microsoft are getting involved, there is a danger that maybe after 20 years  There is no job left, this is G and AE and this link and this is take off, this is a little confusion, I will just tell you with example Adani, we are a big group, okay, the report of Hidden Berg had come.  You would know that the market cap was halved and how much loss was caused. You would know, okay, not a single job was fired. Nobody was fired, not a single Adani employee was taken off. There are as many as 50 companies in your group, right? If you look at their quarterly profits and revenue.  I am not talking about, if you look at the profit then I do n't know how many billions of dollars they are asking for hire and fire. Otherwise it is not that industrial When the revolution came, people said that jobs will be lost. When computers came, if you say that the job of a typist will be lost, the question is that when artificial intelligence has come, now I will just tell you what will happen and people should know this fact.  Because of this, I am thinking a lot, talking to people and telling them that whatever you can catch in Artificial Intelligence, from movies to movies to IT to  From designing to any department, designing anything, clothes, there are so much work is happening, there are 100 professions in every profession, those who are in the top 5 or not in the top 5, those who will understand this thing, will do it well, will use it and are already very successful.  He is good and creative Artificial Intelligence is a force multiplier Artificial Intelligence is nothing but Rahu where ever it will sit  It will amplify, so if you were already sitting on an advantage, you will reach here, then those who are in the top 5 will earn a lot of money, the rest who were at the bottom will become Medicare and Medicare in Indian sense will become so much that the maximum profession you can wish.  Become your Tankha, it will be between 40, 45 thousand to one lakh. You understood that the maximum crowd's tankha will be between 40, 45 to one lakh.  India will be in the middle of Pan India. If you catch 100 children, then what will happen in them? Your auto rickshaw driver, your Momo driver, your Monday worker, the plumber, these people will also fall in this category, so what will they do?  What happens is that like in America and etc., the taxi driver is also earning 000 00 dollars and this one is also earning just by saying this and both wear the same clothes and eat the same.  The way they eat, they are the same, this is a merging, isn't this the merging of lower class and middle class, this is what is going to happen, isn't this going to hurt many people, psychologically because what kind of a thing have we created when we take a taxi?  When we sit in a car, in India we feel that this driver is below me, this is not the case in America, this is not the case in other countries, yes, no, he has no dignity, in reality, leave the dignity. These days, so many memes are coming that these momos are earning money in actual. They are earning one and a half lakh rupees in actual. They have opened a juice box and by making gram bhature they are earning one and a half lakh rupees. Because one more thing has come. If people don't know how to cook, then AI is not eating the jobs of the day after tomorrow. The jobs given by AI will be done by AI. AI is not going to eat anyone's jobs. The current situation of money is not lower.  If the employee above 75 80 60 80000 is earning 1.5 lakh 1.25 lakh 2 lakh, then the gap will increase. The one who will understand it well and implement it will use it, he will be in demand and suddenly the rest will come down.  Most of the people will go, the majority of the country will remain at the bottom but the capita GDP will grow but the children of the middle class will struggle, if this happens then you  If you have to give one piece of advice to those children, then what? No, do not give any advice to such children because these children belong to those parents who are driven by respect and honour. These are the children who want to become something in life, their focus is not on earning money. You will catch the child of the poor who is 2022 years old, he wakes up at 4:5 in the morning, at 530 he is a newspaper hawker and throws newspapers at 6:30.  After that he becomes a car cleaner, at 8:30 he becomes a Sugi Zomato seller, at 121 he becomes something else, okay, he is changing four times a day and he earns Rs 50,600 per month.  Yes, but middle class people have to settle down and become something, some dreams have to be fulfilled, so this middle class has emerged, it is okay to fulfill some dreams and become something, these two things are not going to happen, you cannot become something today.  Okay, if you are stuck at one place like I am, I should just focus on astrology. Now technically I am probably not that good an astrologer. If you test me then I am not someone sitting with your technical degrees. Okay, I know many things from you and you will ask me about technical things.  I won't be able to tell but why I feel I still do a good job is because I bring 360 degree perspective I don't have only knowledge of astrology I have  Knowledge of finance, I have knowledge of real estate, I have knowledge of human behavior, so many other things, then by combining all that, it becomes a good package. First, if the astrologer is a pure astrologer, who has not done anything else, just shloka and astrology and that now. He will say in the house, brother, you will do milk work not today because you know that this profession knows today in medical science.  Being a doctor, you can become 50 kinds of doctors, that is, you can be a pediatrician or an oncologist, he has four super specializations. Okay, so you can become anything. If you hold engineering, then I do n't know which kind of engineering you have. So, the more exposure you have as an astrologer, the more you can impress the clients, so the same thing is that you should not correct the message which is the only thing or restrictive to yourself. Becoming something because if you become something, then you just remain the same, then you have no scope and that is the mindset that I have sat in the AC and used the computer, apart from this I will not do anything else, this is the same in middle class, so now last.  Question: It is our tradition at Nest Astrologer that whenever our guests come, we ask them about their top remedies for the benefit of our clients and top suggestions for three things.  One Inner Peace to Marital Harmony Three Financial Success To Aap Jo Ha To I Am Well I Give Personnel I Don't Do The Second One C All Three Of Them Are Linked You Can't Be At Peace If Your Married Life Is Bad Your Finance Can't Be Good  If Your Married Life Is Bad And If Your Finances Are Bad Then Life Cannot Be Good If Your Finances Are Extremely Good Then Chances of married life are good are also high, I am not sure but chances are high, if there is money, then money is very stressful, if my finances are fine and married life is fine, harmony will come on its own, that is the problem.  In this people they are saying that stress in marriage life is considered as separate from marital life and actually as separate from career. Everything is life, only your marriage is marital life, what does it mean, then there will be family life also, if you have a child, then it is okay, then your family life is different, marital life is different, professional life is different, people say that let's not mix personal and all.  Everything gets mixed, now a person's child is not able to turn the lights on and off like that when he comes home in the morning, marital life is on, it is bad, he goes to the office, it is very good, it is not like that. If the boss has informed the boss that you are in a bad mood then he will be in your home too. Okay, so first of all remove from your mind whether marital life is something or something that makes you happy in marriage.  Have to stay because you are committed to the idea of ​​marriage and institution of marriage. The partner may be an idiot. The partner may be very good. The partner may be very good today. The partner may not be very good tomorrow and the day after. Again ok, so what is there in marriage? To get peace, we have to relax in marriage. Whenever there is trouble, right? S.A. Astrologer, you also know, I also know that time is bad, now there is trouble in bad times, so where will the trouble come from?  If he is the closest one, then who is sleeping next to him? If he sleeps, then the problem will come from there. If it is not coming from there, then it will come to him. If he is not facing trouble from his spouse, then it is very bad.  It will come from somewhere, because there is no problem because the time is bad, isn't it? Brother, sir, I have seen a lot of marital distress during Shani Ketu period. This period will bring detachment to you. That detachment can be good also if you are ready for it, okay. Because don't do Farmaishi program in it. If you know astrology and you know that time is going bad then talk to your wife about All India Radio.  Don't program the request that sing this song, now sing this one for me, reduce the request, your wife is coming from the office, she is coming from outside, she is bringing vegetables, as soon as she comes, hold her vegetables in your hand and  Run away and give her a glass of water. If husbands understand the point about wives, there will be complete harmony. What ever you give to the woman, she will multiply 10 times and give it back.  To you be very careful when you are giving her, give her love 10 times, give her respect 10 times, give her money, she will give the value of money 10 times and give her every trouble, what is good, is n't it, it is not available immediately, it can be found after time.  Time and place of every choosing will be there, so if you make a mess today, it does not mean that you will get it tomorrow, maybe you can do the nuisance for many years, nowadays this one is very fast.  That time has come, right now a days, and the era of instant instant has come, so nowadays you can get it instantly, earlier you used to give it later along with the yarn, then the husbands feel that they can get away by doing these things, they should be very careful.  They are giving to wives. Give a glass of water to your wife. The wife who came from the office will become so touched and happy after drinking the water in two minutes that she will say, \" I will change right now.\"  I will come and get dressed, I will make tea for you both, we will both drink tea. Feelingless is very important. The man will lose his logic. The woman will get stuck. Don't give logic to the man in the marriage. The wife will have to see how she feels right now because you are in this situation.  You are giving the logic of one thing, the discussion is going on, it is okay to buy a house but there is conflict, you are giving the logic, friend, this house is good, it is available cheap, payment plan is a good thing, this is the conflict of the past.  Why did n't you set this thing, why didn't you do that, now you don't know that she is coming with the previous baggage, you are applying logic here, logic will never win, feeling will love to win, so main should be going for. Leave your feeling logic in the office and come. Very good, this is a remedy. Understanding this thing is a remedy. Yes, this is a remedy. I am also a marital counselor. This is a remedy. And  As far as financial things are concerned, it is the same thing again. Never ever you know. Do n't try to impress anyone with your lifestyle. If you want to go out, go for nice clothes. Get a nice car. But do n't try to impress anyone.  Take the John with which the work is going on, take the work with the small car, take the big one, take the big one, stick to whatever means you have and concentrate very much on yourself so that I can do value addition.  What skill set can I acquire for this, only then money will come on saving money because what has been created of the entire narrative of saving money of the middle class, don't drink coffee, don't go out, do SIP, friend, nothing is going to happen with this, nothing, you will keep roaming around at home and the same, okay.  No, after so many years you will become one crore. Hey brother, I will need 12 lakhs. After four years, I will break the SIP. I am not waiting for you to become one crore. No, I did not want to break you. How will I not break it if you have you?  You are feeling thirsty and you are dying of thirst, so you had kept this bottle for four days to drink water, so you will not wait for it, you are dying, you will open the money for it, it is natural, okay, let's talk about practical things, sir, this is the problem on the internet.  It is so feel good, people become happy, they talk intelligent things for themselves because whatever you see, now if you say abstract things, you will say higher order thinking things like I do.  I say in video type or something like whatsappwap.in, there is no need to leave anything, then suddenly the middle class gets completely relaxed, after listening to this, I will make a video on the content that this is such a simple thing and should be done and how to become rich.  There is a scope for the emerging middle class, for the middle class, because from where I started from the bottom, my child should also start from the bottom so that he can know what I am, okay, so whatever content you will get in these  It will take you towards action and will give you the feel good factor, like motivation to say something, if you feel like throwing a stone, does it leave a hole in the sky, say anything, it leaves a hole in the sky, it means big, it felt good after hearing it. Then when the stone gets pierced, it will come and hit your mouth. Even if someone has pierced it, you will feel good to hear it like this. Wear two coats every day, court means take motivational court, like alcohol, as long as that intoxication lasts.  fun again  Then if there is a need to drink then this is it, if we live a little realistically then peace will come, infact I have just started a membership on your advice, just yesterday, on my Clarity for You channel, its name is peace and money, is it paid?  Membership is, I am saying, if you want peace and money, then first give the money to me, okay, after that, come and see, because if you get peace, then money will come. If you get peace, you will get peace, and this cycle will continue, okay? Great great sir, thank you, thank you so much, you took out so much time but you did not come for the last time, I would like to promise you this, I will tell many of my viewers that their videos are even, please sir, Sangola Sara and clarity for youth, I am a subscriber myself.

The real guru is the one I am telling right now as per the primary teacher. Then  I will become a TGT, I will become a PGT and I will also become a PhD professor, so I am slowly teaching. Right now in primary school, if it is okay, then these five things are seen. Sixth house is called disease, debt, enemy is seen as disease.  Debt has become enemy disease, disease D is for disease D is for debt, okay and enemies are okay, who will be your enemy, how many will be taking loan, who will take loan, where will the diseases come from, how will the enemies be, now we will get into other body parts.  And if we go down from the stomach, then the body part will come lower abdominal. If it is ok then this will be the seventh house. The seventh house is a very important house. Your spouse is seen from the seventh house. First of all, in the husband's horoscope, the seventh house is the judge, wife, wife. Seventh houses in the horoscope, how will the husband be, how will be the nature, we see the marriage from the seventh house, we see the quality of the marriage, is there any extra marital affair, marriage will break, divorce.  All these things are shown by the seventh house, it shows you and also your business partners, so it is about partnership, so the first partnership is in life, with the life partner and then it also shows the business partners, what kind of system will be there in the body parts, these cells, organs, genitals.  If it shows 'Ka' then it is equivalent to 'Eth House'. Let me tell you about the four or five main things in the 'Eth House'. ' Eth Houses' tells your death house, 'K' tells your age house, basically you can find out your personality. How many years will you live, how is your health and wealth, will there be any scandals in your life, will there be any troubles, these types of things are known and inheritance is also known, whether you will get some money from father, mother, grandparents or there will be some trouble in it.  So inheritance will not come, it is a very important thing in every big life, there are many troubles and disputes, so where will that thing be checked, then it is checked from your eighth house, infact you  You will not learn astrology, there is also a link to Alt Science, also from Ath House, this is your hidden house, it is not visible, here whatever you learn and do is not visible to anyone, okay so this is that also. Religion is spoken in the ninth house. Religion is checked. Your long journey is checked. Higher education is checked like graduation. If you want to check your primary education then you will do it from the fourth house after primary. Whatever happens from 6th to 12th, you will check from the fifth house and how much higher education you will get, how you will do that, you will check from the ninth house and long travels will also be checked from it. Short travels, I told you from the third house, long travel from the ninth house, remember this.  Keep it and note down that it is opposite to it because many people know that I am mine, when will I go, will I travel, will I be able to go, will I not be able to go, all this remains and is the father's house.  This is father's house. This is Guru's house. How will your Guru be? How will father be? This is his house. It also shows a long journey. This 10th house will show thighs in the body part. This is the place of your karma. This is the place of karma. Political power will you get. How much power will you get in life? Fame.  How much will you get and whether you will become such a king or not, all these 10 people mostly ask, how will it be brother, mine is the tenth house, so this shows that your tenth house is also yours, if there is a pen in yours, then that is yours.  We will check from the 10th house. 11th house is the house of gains. What is yours here? Where will the money come from? Now how is it different from the second house. In the second house I had told about the accumulated wealth. The 11th house is how much money is coming, how much is left.  If we have to see from the second house how much assets are being created from it, it happens to many people that a lot of money is coming in. If the 11th house is strong then a lot of money is coming in but nothing is collected in the second house.  When it is happening, it is not like the bottom of the glass is coming and it is just going. If this also happens then I am telling it in a simple way because people get confused about how many assets will be created now, that is there now.  The fourth house is telling how the house will be, because a lot of things come in assets, demat account also comes, gold also comes, crypto also comes, okay your house will also come, intellectual property will come, anything means asset.  meaning your antique  There can be 100 types of assets ranging from furniture to paintings, so the asset has to be seen from the second house, the money has to be seen from the 11th house, if you have to see your house and the propertyist then it is okay, do not get confused in this, what is from the 11th, how will the money come because what is good.  It may also happen that in the 11th year, you are not getting any money but you have a lot of assets, then maybe you have a rich husband who is buying property in your name or it may be inherited from your father somewhere. This can also happen and its result is that brother, you will get a lot of assets, if you don't get money then it means you will not do anything yourself, it may be Rajyoga type, you are sitting with something, not doing anything yourself is fine and that.  It will come, okay, so we come to the last, in this, your own earning potential is known, how much is it, okay, from the 11th house and it represents the calves, it is okay inside the body part, last we go, 12th house in the 12th house.  And the house is called 12th House Expenditure shows where you will spend or where you will incur loss. Loss is also an expense and expenditure is also a loss in a way. If it means your loss of wealth, it can be said that money will be spent.  Loss of wealth can also speak, foreign travels will also tell, your bedroom life will also tell, your sleep will also tell, your bed will also tell pleasure, bed will also tell, so in a way this also becomes a hidden thing, okay Moksh.  Will we not get it, how will we go towards it, how will be the spirituality element, that is also the work of 12th house, so today I have very simply told you all the significant things, note down them all very well.

This is my moon sign, all this is important, the whole horoscope is important and every horoscope is unique, learn this, we brush everyone off that everyone will be the same, then print someone  Is it the same for everyone, this is also different for everyone, brother, there can be many permutations, who knows 12 factorials in 9 photos, try doing 9, if the figure of 11000 crores comes out then there is a lot of confusion, 1100 crore people have not been born yet.

    "title": "What Is Guru Chandal Yog？ ｜ Best Explanation Given On YouTube [DxfWMbgQ44c].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, in astrology, you must have heard a word Guru Chandal Yog. Its Guru Chandal Yog, let's understand it a little. Instead of getting tensed, if it is of any child in your family or your own, then understand it yourself. Guru Chandal Yog happens when Rahu and Jupiter are in your horoscope. If Rahu comes along with Jupiter in any house, then it will be called Guru Chandal Yog. It has been described differently in different texts and classics. I try to explain it in a simple way because of the shloka and its medium.  If I tell you, many times people get very scared, today you have to understand this like this that if this is someone's or maybe it's your child and you the parent are listening to me, then you have to understand that this child will demand a lot of logic, if you  He will not agree to anything he says, he will not accept it just like I have said it, in this itself I will tell you another work of Jupiter Ketu, but if Jupiter is Rahu then this person could be your junior, your employee, your spouse, any person.  can check in your life  Do it in the Kundali and this works very amazingly, okay you have to check, this person will not accept anything like this, now what is wrong in this, why many times people get scared in doing it with such a person that if you are telling him some theta like  You are telling that any popular thing that happens nowadays, no, girls are not good, they are good, they file section 498 or it goes on like this, there is body count of girls, anti- feminism talks, pro-feminism, this kind of things that you see in debates  In the society, on religion or on any other thing, when you talk to this person, he will come after you saying, you can't get away, how did you say that, either you explain it to him or he will agree to what you say, but  There should be logic, so the moral of the story is, in short, do n't open your mouth after Jupiter and Rahu, if you don't have any logic, because you generally made a statement, friend, I was just saying it like that, no no, how did you say it like that, how did you say it like that  can you how is it possible how can all girls be like this Brother, someone will come after him or vice versa, I am not saying that he will completely support his religion and not the matter, it can be on any side, so there is a stubbornness which is visible to other people in the society, that is why what is there in Guru Chandal Yoga  If there is any Guruji, if there is a Guruji like us, then now that it has come, no one wants to take such disciples, in the old times, who would want to take disciples in Jupiter Ketu, what is there in Jupiter Ketu, there is a belief, if Guruji says it, then it is okay  The one who is sitting with Jupiter and Ketu is a very composed person. Well, that Jupiter and Ketu have the blessings of the God. If the combination of Jupiter and Ketu is together anywhere in your horoscope, then Ketu is the blessings of the God. You will be a very composed person. If you ever get away from such a person,  You are going for some work, right? And take his blessings that brother, even if it is a child, it is all right for you or he should give you all the best or he should do this or that and the work will be done, then the people with Jupiter and Ketu are the best students, so Guruji  is visible to  In this way Jupiter takes Ketu to become Jupiter Rahu, then Guru should also be like this, Shukracharya is needed, then the one who has all the logic and facts, Jupiter alone does not work that friend I just said it like that, I do n't have that much energy to explain the Guru element  There must be more of a person who is more of a guru like that, he doesn't give much logic and says I have told you and that's it, otherwise I would have known, so today if you see, many people have taken this, now what happens in many, exactly Jupiter Rahu is sitting with you, there is an aspect in many, there might be some other relationship in many, so you will not encounter many such people, tell me the logic, do it like this, how do you explain astrology, no no, you have said it, so if this Jupiter is sitting with Rahu, if you have  If you tell him that astrology is good then either you explain it to him or you will have to take it back, he will pester him so much that this is what it is, other wise why would you say it is bad if a person is asking for logic and  If you are not giving logic then it  should matter should and then there is no time for that okay you go your way, they don't let you go your way, you said how so if you are sitting in an auditorium and there are people sitting in a crowded gathering, like the one who got hit by the Guru Chandal No I excuse me, once they get the mic, why did you say this, then this is a challenge for the gurus, the real guru who is sitting with the knowledge, brother, he should teach even the Guru Chandal person because if there is no logic in your knowledge, then you are not the answer  No, yes, many times it happens that you don't feel like it, but if you come across a Guru or a Chandal then to get out of that situation, the real Guru will have to give an argument and he will have to identify this person again that brother you are too high, your fees are too high.  If you feel like it, then many times I tell you practically in my consultations, not only about astrology, like real estate, relationships, investments, there are different consultations that come, so when I see that friend, I have told him the basics of consultation. Time is limited, not unlimited. Now if he needs one and a half crore proofs for one thing and logic is needed, then brother the time of consultation will increase and then the fees will also increase, so that is also a problem for the Jupiter Rahu person or not. I have to understand everything but you will tell me I will not leave you anymore, that is why it can be seen now that it is moving a little towards east, so there is nothing else left for it, Guru Chandal Yoga has happened, there is nothing else left, that's all, it works beautifully in the charts. You should check yourself and check the Jupiter Ketu person. If someone has got a Jupiter Ketu child, it is fine. Then that Jupiter Ketu child will be like this. You should check it. Okay Papa ji, it is okay. Papa is okay. Mummy, okay done. And as a parent, you will find it difficult.  It will happen friend, he says yes to everything friend, it means that I am not taking unfair advantage of the innocence of the poor guy, it is of subservient nature and if this problem occurs then Jupiter Ketu is a great joy in itself  It is there but what is there in it, as a society Jupiter Rahu will never be exploited, if you are sitting with Jupiter then you need not worry, if you are sitting with Jupiter Rahu then the need to worry is for others who sit with you everyday, okay  If you get a wife with Jupiter Rahu, then whatever you say, you will have to explain logic to her everyday. If you say a dialogue like this, you are sitting reading a normal newspaper and you say that this politician is good or bad, see, there will be opinions, how can you say such a thing?  Diya why, why do you feel like this, then you will say something like this, Alam Ballam, something of mine did not like it, logic logic is fine, it is bad, he will decide, you cannot do it, if you do not like it then brother, then you will say, friend you have to talk to him  It is not right, the simplicity with which I am teaching this rule here, I am explaining it to you people in the form of prediction and this story, no one can do anything about it, friend, I am just telling you some solution for the pain, who knows Whom to tell the solution  The one who wants to do it, he has no problem with it. If others have problem with this thing, then from where can they tell him the solution, then if this had such a solution, then this Jupiter Rahul would have been sitting with him, people would say, yes Guruji, this is the solution for my child. He will do it, it is the biggest thing for you brother, it is like that, tell him that yes brother, this is it, I do n't ask for it everywhere, she is a bit stubborn, look everywhere, who knows, some big principal or some very big professor or some big  If it is in settings then it will get triggered, don't get involved everywhere, every big design o you an explanation for free, what do you have to do with it, the teacher remains under tension, no, why did this not happen, then this tension will be there.  It goes on like this but why does it happen like this, why is the circle like this, why is it like this, so look at it that way, okay friend, if there is a student of yours, has come after paying the fees, is curious and asks for logic, then it should be given to a good teacher, but Guru  The fees of those who practice Chandal Yoga are high because if they suck you then the guruji would run away, that's why these gurus are called Guru Chandal. If you have done yoga then you don't need to worry too much because when you read it in the classics, you get scared whether it is written wrong or not, it is a matter of interpretation, like in class six, things are written in such a way that very That storehouse will be big, if it has such yoga then it will be a cruel king, now there is no king here, half of the astrology is written in the name of the king or in the name of saving the religion, now it is not like this, people come here today, they will get visa and job  It will seem like this means they are asking, forget about marriage, it means there has been a breakup, the girl is not looking back, Guruji, the girl will see, am I interested, will she be interested, it means these things are being asked and we are sitting here, I mean those old classics  This is a cruel king, Moon in 10th house will do the work of milk.

    "title": "Where In Life You Will Have To Work Extra ？｜ जीवन में आपको कहाँ ज्यादा काम करना होगा？ [nbo0sBHvSIo].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, a very unique and amazing topic of astrology, you will enjoy it, from which you will come to know that I will have to work in this relative's or this place's sphere of life, whether I want it or not.  This is a place where you will have to give more than the normal, whether you like it or not, you will always be called upon and the circumstances will be such that you will have to do it, whether you do it crying or being happy, you will have to do it, so if every person comes to know this  If it goes then there will be no fun in life, if there is any, the fun may take a little long but I will do it with each person, everyone will enjoy it, I will make a video in full detail, it is very simple, you just have to apply it after doing it in 10 charts, in the comment section  I want to write if this technique is working, it is a very amazing technique, it is explained in the tree bed only, but I am telling it here, so sharing it will help people and let's start applying it, what is the technique that the zodiac sign of Capricorn  where 10 is written which  Capricorn is the sign, 10 is written on it, that sign 10 is in your house, this phenomenon will play out there, so let's start with Aries ascendant, okay, let's start with Aries ascendant, if Aries sign is in your ascendant, then your Capricorn  It will be in the 10th house, yes or no. So as soon as it is in your 10th house, you will have to do some work regularly in your job or workplace that you will say why only I am chosen or why only I am chosen  Why do you get more, now you don't have to cry over this, this story will play out like this, if it is not working out at the workplace and here, then it will work out in father's family because father is in the ninth house, second from the ninth house is father's family which is the tenth  When the house is built, you will see there that I don't know, I have to do the work of my aunt, father's original family is fine, there uncle's uncle's work is like this, you will feel that I have to do something, then move on to the next zodiac sign. your zodiac sign comes next  Taurus so if your lagna is number two then in which sign will your zodiac sign number 10 be, in your ninth house so here you will have to do something for your father whether you like it or not you will be called upon to do something  But your brother doesn't have to do this, your sister doesn't have to do this, nobody else has to do this, or when you feel like travelling long distance then you will have to do something extraordinary, which means you have to get a visa, you have to go, you have to do a booking, then in that  If the degree of difficulty increases a bit, then this technique can be understood in this way that wherever our zodiac sign is Capricorn, it is there in all our horoscopes somewhere or the other, then we will have to put in extraordinary effort there, we will be forced to put in effort.  If it will happen or we will be called then you should be mentally ready for that. Similarly, those who are sitting with Gemini sign number three, their Capricorn sign is number 10, it sits in the eighth house. The eighth house is also the eighth house of these losers.  If it is also for research then they should never They will have to do some such work whether they want it or not, all the Gemini people out there, write to me in the comment section, brother, you have to do something or the other for your in-laws, whether you want to or not and mostly it will be work that you don't want to do Because here whenever what happens is that look, when we have to do something above average, then we do not have much desire to do it, we will have to do it, so similarly when we come to the next zodiac sign which is Cancer, number four, it is in its seventh house  If it is inside the seventh house, then brother, you will have to do it for the spouse, only then look at the people with cancer, brother, they remain worried that friend, this person makes the husband or the wife do something or the other, well what is the big deal in this, that person will make you do this in every I will go on telling you little by little, you have to correlate them all, then put that formula everywhere, there you will be made to do it, if there is such an attraction, then if you get to know about it, then once everyone has the same place, no one has been born who  Capricorn is nowhere, every passion is lying somewhere, so brother you should surrender a little there like  If you surrender, there will be peace in your life. Today I am giving you this video which will give you so much peace that your dilemma will go away. Guru ji has told you that this is astrology, some changes will have to be made, I don't want to do anything.  It will have to be done brother, if you have done it happily or sadly, then do it with a little surrender feeling that friend this will have to be done, so all those who have cancer, write in the comment section, I am talking about dedication only if  If you want to do it on the moon sign then it will work there as well, if you do it by making the moon sign your lagna then it will work there but a little less but it will work there as well, but you should go according to the normal lagna, okay let's come now Brothers and sisters, in Leo sign, you have the sign of Capricorn in Leo sign, so in the sixth house, either you will have to do something related to uncle, okay uncle, these days there are not so many relations, so brother, work place is also mentioned about the job  It shows something or there will be some date on the loan or it will pull you somewhere or something  No, there will be some problem with you, especially in job, the work place is in the 10th house, the place of job and that is the sixth house, so you will have to check something there, this thing is fine, after that it increases if your Varga  If you are sitting in the ascendant with zodiac sign number six, then your 10th sign will come in your fifth house which is of the children, so brother, you will have to do something for the children, they will get it done, the children, papa, want a toy, want a phone, want this, you friend  It's done friend, no, I have to go immediately, I have to do this, the children will keep on asking for something or the other from you, whatever, wherever your zodiac sign is 10, wherever it is, whatever it is there, the system is saying and give that  He is behaving like this and he will remain for everyone, I told you somewhere that he belongs to everyone so he will remain, so whatever you want to do or not to do, decide that, but don't feel sad because now you cannot say that stop asking, he will always keep asking.  in the same way next let's go to libra zodiac sign okay  So the sign of 10 of Libra is in the fourth house, the fourth house is of mother, the fourth house is of home, the fourth house is of happiness, so something or the other will be constantly asked for it, either mother will ask for something, whoever's work  It is happening beautifully, just look at it, every house has significance, I have mentioned seven or eight houses in my old videos and here I am telling only two or three, according to me everyone's ID should be on 90 in these only, but if you  Look, is it reducing, if it is not reducing then there is the rest of her significant house, the car keeps asking for something or the other, give me the engine oil, get it serviced today, get it cleaned, it happens to many people, they keep on getting stuck in their cars, she is asking for the car  If not the car, then the house is asking for maintenance repair, give this, give that, this of mine or my mother's or all of the above or some of the above so you have to work on that because look, I do not want to complicate it, which one  The planet is sitting there and it is enhancing it, Rahu is sitting there  It will increase it somewhere, Saturn is sitting there so maybe it will affect it some more, if someone is looking at Jupiter then it will give some wisdom, Jupiter is absolutely sitting in it, that's why you see, the wisdom doesn't work much here, the wisdom doesn't work much here in Capricorn  Because here we have to give something, another logic of this is that Jupiter, which is our Guru, our wisdom, becomes low, Jupiter is low in Capricorn sign because it has no work, because what is the work of Jupiter here  This is in cancer, the highest relaxed enjoyment of emotions, fun of Jupiter, you will not see a Guru type of person much, he will just sit like this once or twice and make a video, you will not see him roaming around much that I am searching, I am going here  F is Jupiter, Jupiter will be lazy, will be chubby, so he is not happy in Capricorn, because there in Capricorn one has to work and a person with Jupiter cannot do physical work, so that is why this  If you understand the thing, then the person whose Jupiter is sitting, then he will become like this, okay, so let's move ahead, next, if you are sitting with Scorpio sign, then the tenth house is the tenth sign, in the third house, siblings, younger siblings, brother, younger brother and sister have to do something or the other  You will have to do it, he will come and ask for it, tell all Scorpio people, is he doing this true workout or not, tell me quickly in the comment section, I am telling you an amazing technique and teaching it by holding hands, no one teaches like I teach, everyone does not tell everything I am telling you slowly one by one, now tell me Taurus people, your younger sibling will do that and if he is not there, someone is alone, then you will find an email in him, whatever thing is there, the younger sibling will take it from you Or email communication, office paper work, some extra work will have to be done, you will always have to put extra effort in some paper work, documentation is not complete, property papers are not complete, you have not kept them safely somewhere, when you go to take a loan, you will have to put in extra effort there every time Put in extra effort instead  In this kind of thing, wherever paper work has evolved, passport has to be made, driving license has to be made, voter ID has to be made, anywhere a person's normal will have to struggle, you will feel that wherever it is inside you, you will feel it takes a lot of effort.  It is going to happen and it will seem to happen in reality as well, both things will happen, it will be felt and it will feel in reality as well, perhaps the feeling may be more than what you feel but both things will be more, I have told you an amazing technique and if you are sitting with Sagittarius or with nine zodiac signs  If yes then the 10th house where the sign is located will be in the second house. Your second house again belongs to your original family, your clan, your father, mother and others, you will have to make an effort for them, they will demand something or the other from you, this is not right, that is not right  You are thinking that there will always evolve, your wife will always be upset, she will hold her head or her father keeps doing the same thing, this has to happen, you have to show the video to your wife, tell her, guru ji must have told me brother what can I do, whether I want it or not  you have to do it, you will always have  To do that and you cannot run away from that and even assets have to be created, second house is also about wealth and assets, there will be a fight of yours in creating that or there will be an effort in creating that, they will always keep asking for something or the other, they will keep asking for effort  You have to do it and the last thing is that if you have settled down with the Capricorn sign, then brother, it is very good. You will have to work hard in the pattern of your whole life, Capricorn's Capricorn sign or what do you say if you are sitting with Capricorn's ascendant, it is Saturn's ascendant.  OK brother, he will definitely make you work hard, you will not be able to sit idle so there is nothing negative in it, you will become a hard working man, you will not be able to sit idle and you will have to work a lot and only your work will give you peace and now your dedication is the most important thing, the zodiac sign is in the dedication  If you sit idle, then all these phenomena will play out in your entire life. You will have to work for many people, you will have to do your own work and you will always feel in life that you have to do a lot of work and you are doing the same job that the world is doing.  but you seem to be doing the same thing  Yes, there are the same relationships, so many people are fathers, so many people are husbands, so many people are servants, so many people are doing all these jobs but none of them feel so much stress, but if you are sitting with this then you will also feel stressed and actually  I will also feel both these things, wherever the Capricorn sign is, you will have to put in effort, you will feel more than you feel, so if you understand this thing a little bit, then you will know that this is such a story playing out. And it will happen like this, we do n't mean there is any need to be sad, this is how it will play out and everybody is going to have Capricorn something, did you enjoy it, if you want to take the membership of the channel, then you can leave a comment in the comment section  You will get the link of astrology.

If you want to learn professionally then it is within you, here I can easily  Let me tell you, the main aim of this channel is to spread astrology and astrology can be spread very easily where easy techniques are told which can improve your life, here all the people are only into predictions.  I keep telling him what will happen to me in future, how is my life going, it is also important to understand that brother I have to do this, now if someone says that Guruji, what can I do, I cannot do anything, I have to do that  But you can explain to your mind, intellect, conscience, that brother, if this is the case then God has given you the tendency to get cancer, then you should serve your wife, serve your husband, follow his orders. So you can understand it in one word that here where there is Cancer or Capricorn sign, there is your Big Boss and you want Big Boss, every person wants Big Boss and he is sitting with Big Boss, see where he is sitting, Capricorn  If you have to do it in the amount of Rs. then don't cry, sit with it, take it with you, where the father-in-law of the people is taking it  You will have to do it, in some your mother's place, in some your father's place, in some your children's place, everyone is sitting with them, now if your child is sitting with Capricorn, then if you are the father, then enjoy, okay, if your child is Capricorn, if Capricorn is in your ninth house,  Quickly tell me which zodiac sign it will be for, number two zodiac sign it will be for, so the number two zodiac sign which is sitting with Capricorn, your son's or daughter's lettuce has two torus, so those with torus, in the same way I have done Samrai for everyone, you all should see.  Yes, it is okay and one more zodiac sign, well, there are two left now, I had stopped at 10, 11 and 12 are also left, so if you are sitting with the 11th zodiac sign, then your Capricorn will be in the 12th house, so in the 12th house, that means you will have to make effort to sleep  Sexual blood pleasure is also about that too, it may require effort, you are understanding that right, and going abroad will require effort, it will take more energy and you may have to pay a little more there to do it, in the same way if  If you are sitting with Pisces sign, then Pisces sign is yours, then your tenth house, your tenth sign is in the 11th house, which means that your friend circle is elder brother, sister, elder sibling, friend circle is also there, so from there you have to give energy to them or money.  If you want to earn more, then you will have to put in more effort towards it, you will have to work hard, wherever your zodiac sign is Capricorn, you will have to work more than normal, and ultimately you will have to do that, I understand you have no choice.  That much you will have to do, so now I had stopped till the sugar, I remembered it later, okay, so many times because one does not read from a script, one reads from it, so I suddenly remembered it, so tell me how did you like the video and like this  If you want more videos then write in the comment section and subscribe to the channel and please, I do n't tell this video to many people, but please share this video with your family so that everyone gets the idea because half of the relationships are based on this  We get confused at the very mention that why do I have to do this brother you are liber  If you are sitting with a Libra then the tenth sign is in the fourth house, then tell your mother and wife that I am sitting with Libra, do you have to do it or do you think that you will have to talk to me whether I want it or not, I will have to do it, so I hope you enjoyed it  Like share people thank you yuri much"

    "title": "Which Book To Read For Astrology ？ [rboAA8ovv8w].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, many people of my audience on Astrology and those who are associated with me keep asking many times, Guruji, tell me which book should I read, which book should we read, then I will tell you one book, okay, I will tell you only one, but  There are many books on it, but before that book, I want to tell you one thing that it is a subject that cannot be learned from a book, it is not your English, Hindi, it is even higher than Maths, so someone should be there to teach and explain.  Why do you need a book? First of all, before telling you the book, I will tell you why you need a book. I will tell you a book. There are many books but I will still tell you one thing that people should do if they want to do something on their own. But before that, I will tell you.  I will tell you what is the precaution. You see, when this astrology was written, it was written thousands of years ago and many people have made different commentaries on it. Many different people have written in the recent times, some even 50 years, 100 years ago.  has been written  No one has written anything much in the last 10-20 years, so on the old things, at that time, the country and time characters say that there is variation in astrology according to the country, according to the time, according to the person, so time is also a thing in it.  Time is also a thing, they don't put it in the book because when you read it you will get scared many times because this will lead to death in this house, this will lead to untimely death in this, this will die soon, this is like this first friend.  there was no life expectancy  Most of the people used to die early anyway, there was no need to have some astrology, time itself was like this, look at the infant mortality rate at independence, what was India's number of years, there is no need to go for thousands of years, six, seven, eight children are being born, how many survive? Ask your grandmother or great grandmother or who would you know what is the status in your family. I did n't know, no, no, that also happened, there was another one in between, remember, I am very old.  Ladies, I have had a lot of interaction with my elderly women. In my life, I used to ask everyone, yes, grandmother, how was it, what were the times, there was a lot of learning, there were very tough times, so the astrology of that time.  So this will tell you what is happening today, wherever death is written today, I would like you people not to think of it as death, if you consider it equivalent to death, then the meaning of equivalent to death is not that if death is written there, you will not even feel bad.  bad to roch  So it will come a little in today's times, but do n't worry, that's one second of confusion. What is confusion? When things were written long ago, there were very few professions. Nowadays, there have been a lot of professions. Earlier there were less, so when we  These days, because mostly in astrology, these days people come to the question of career, Guruji, tell us what is the career, tell me what will happen in the career, now there is a modification of that too, that too will not be found so easily in the books.  If you get it through interpretation or by learning, then you will get these things through membership. If you take membership then we conduct courses. We have separate discount for those other members. If you want to learn at a higher level, in another way, for two to four six months, then brother, this is easy. Listen to simple astrology videos, see if you understand something, see if you taste something, see that some dots are connected, see that life improves a little, only then learn a little about yourself, like he is the one with ice cream.  I am in Gurga, go to Ammi Small, Hey Guns or which expensive ice cream do you have? It is very expensive, so you will get only this much ice cream but in it, he does not show the spoon that he has to take this one, he has to take that one, many times in my life.  Like, I took this too, I took this too, I took that too, all looked the same, brother, some arrogant bamo, give this one, okay, so many times, how many tests will you do, but if anyone has children, the children have understood the test.  that chocolate one  If you want to take sweets, which one to take, then this is your tasting, you will enjoy this tasting too, okay, this also makes things hot in the race. You must have seen my small videos, earlier also I had posted a video, I used to post small simple ones.  What is to be implemented in practical life? There is one knowledge and there is practical knowledge too, like I had recently made a video about the last one of my Dwadashi, what to do on Dwadashi Tithi.  If it happens, then look at it, now these people are like this, I am very careful because when I say that the name is specially kept Sango, Saral Jyoti, easily so that you can digest it slowly, do n't know how to talk high, it has become like this, it has become style like this.  Don't beat me, my dear Guruji tells me very easily and explains it. Okay, so my meaning remains like this because learning also remains like this and teaching also remains like this and it is more fun.  make it heavier  Neither do people run away. Now I had to tell you the book. I have this book in English as well as in Hindi. It is looking vomit, wait for a minute, I will still tell you about it. You can clearly see the Vedic Astrology. Vedic Astrology, this is the Elements of Vedic Astrology, Volume One and Volume Two. If it is Doctor Case of Charak, then this thing is explained easily, so this book is very Hindi, there will be edition in Hindi also, so this is a thousand books.  You will take five, you will take 10, you will get confused, buy more books when you reach some level, in the beginning, if you have to take it, then this one is good, and whenever you read a new subject, do not grab five because Bhavesh's book is in it.  What to do with Asar and Panchamesh, Medical Astrology about children, it has entered into it, it has entered into KP, some are doing something else with Gemini, Nadi or Vedic Astrology, most of them are the same, rest is up to you.  Brihat Pra Hora Shastra do this shloka loka and in this also all the shlokas are loka, everything is fine but we have to learn astrology, we do not have to impress anyone, it is okay not to come and read your knowledge, first of all we have to learn, when we learn.  Then reach to that level that I will recite the verse and I will say that it is written on this page and there is this and its part is there. Friend, I say learn the thick of any subject at 50-60 but it is good. People keep discussing about the last 10-20 marks and they keep discussing about the last 10-20 marks and if they don't get 60 marks then it is like this in the Indian education system and here too I have seen that people have to do big things. Learn the basics, friend, first feel yourself, you will start understanding, then I said it in a simple way, many people were talking, so I also told this book, you can read this book side by side, you can read my videos.  You can see, you can take membership and otherwise we also plan many webinars at almost free price. You can read astrology information in the comment section and that too, you will get to learn things easily in life. You will see this by learning astrology.  Meaning, the eighth house is also related to astrology or astrology is also seen from the eighth house and you all know that the eighth house is also a bit problematic, problems also come from there. Will you keep learning astrology?  And whether it happens or not, troubles will definitely come in life, they come to everyone but it will not seem like this. Suppose you have listened to this video of mine very attentively for eight minutes, then if you have listened to this then you are not very sad in the last two minutes. Because you were listening to something, wanted to learn something, this is the only thing that I should learn which will be of some benefit to me, my life will become better if we walk on this path, especially this year is the eighth year, anyway, it is okay.  You will get a lot of relief at that time  So you will get when I am learning and when after learning you are full of value and wisdom and some knowledge then you start getting that wise man type feeling in yourself then you do not get entangled in buffaloes if you spend maximum time of your free time in learning things.  If you are taking it out then you are avoiding arguments with people, jealousy and envy and in this because the mind has to be a little free to be jealous of someone if the whole mind is occupied all the time.  He is learning good things, if he wants to know something, then his mind will say, friend, what more can you do, he does a job, earns money, gets time in between, he is also learning something, he also entertains a little, but this backbiting and argument people.  Discussing, doing family politics, doing all this and I would also request the women, there are many women who live in this, come sister, gossip like this, I mean I am not putting down, but she lives in this moat, she speaks with her mouth. So she doesn't say it but she likes it very much, so don't do it, there is no use in telling your husband to anyone, telling your in-laws, this is like this, they are like this, this is like this, so the men who are looking at their women. Evolve also, friend, I am so surprised in astrology, it is normal, I think that if people come to classes or learn astrology, then if 100 people are connected to astrology, then normally a person thinks that there will be more women because it seems that this  There is a women's department. Yay, man thinks that 5050 would be the normal gender. It's like it is in this ratio, it's almost fine, but man, there are very few women in it. It's around 75, 80, 82, 85, there are men, there are females, not even 15, 15, 20. Now everything I am saying is busy in raising children and is busy in it and this is such a thing if your small child also  You are one year and six months old, you are also pregnant, you have a three-four-five-year-old child, you can take out time comfortably, and those whose children have grown up are housewives, not doing anything, nothing is happening in life.  Then brother, feel free to come and learn, at least if you learn this then you will become relevant by telling good things to the people around you in your community, in the society, by imparting knowledge. Being the basis, this is the life of housewives in mid 40s and 40s.  When the children are grown up, they are no longer relevant in the children's life, they do not care much about their mother, the husband is busy with something of his own, okay and brother, life is going on like this, how many kitty parties will you go to and how much?  Will you go to that kitty party and eat something satisfactorily? Then today you will visit Mrs. Mehra's place, then Mrs. Nehra's place, then Mrs. Sunny's, Sharma's place, Mishra's place, if anything good happens in your life.  Learn it is fine and the one who is learning is very happy, then she does not need anyone and people need her, this is a good life, you are not dependent on anyone, some people are dependent on you, if you ask, then this is my  It is a matter of peace to take people on this path, whether you get something else or not, whether something happens in life or not, become a great astrologer or not, whether something else happens or not, you will get peace, that is guaranteed and it comes only in learning the right way.  will mean  The work itself will start bearing fruit. There is no need to wish for the result. The work itself is bearing fruit and when the work itself becomes the fruit and not the very act of doing it itself, then nothing can be better than that. This is my  personal ex pa"

    "title": "Why Controlling Birth Time During Caesarean Operation May Not Benefit You ？ [Kdlgh2o-T-o].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, again a very popular question that is asked is about controlling the time of birth, because nowadays caesarean operations are done, then it is too big. Guruji, it is time to have a child, tell me when should you do it, because this is a favorite and not match fixing.  Let's do it brother, we will tell you when the child will be born, it is a very interesting topic, I am teaching simple astrology very easily, you will see these types of questions in a playlist now, frequency. Or Frequency Queries on Astrology because in a way I am teaching what you are seeing, the technical ones like this house, zodiac sign, ascendant, I am teaching the significant ones but I am teaching these also simultaneously because.  These are popular questions and I am teaching them very simply and if these genuine questions come then the answer has to be given because these are the answers which astrologers tell in public.  I don't want to come and commit because then what am I here? By doing social service and social like this, it is not my aim to show that I am very great, that is my aim. It is never like that others are bad, so I can never help my fraternity.  You should not even do one thing by spoiling it, everything is spoiled, I am very great, that is not the purpose but some people shy away from telling this publicly, so today I am going to tell you what should be done if your wife is about to deliver.  Yours  Daughter-in-law's delivery, daughter's delivery, delivery is taking place in your family, date has been fixed, so now you know that Lagan also lasts for two hours. Okay, so every man wants to get some good Lagan or you can set something good.  Lest such a bad thing happens to many of me, oh, the passion of Sade Sati will happen and I was not understanding what will happen, meaning Sade Sati comes to everyone, so if you are born in Sade Sati, then what is there, how much fixing you have to do.  to do  What is it, I tell it in the beginning and then tell its logic. I will not call it like this that people say that I will tell the result in the end and then I will keep talking, I will keep talking, so I tell you in the beginning that there is no need to do anything when the child is being born.  Whatever is happening, let it happen, let me tell you interesting things which in my practice, I have never told anyone like this because I believe in this thing that brother, when the child is coming, he is a soul.  it has been a journey  Is it fixed, why do you want to do something like this, it means that it could be that the soul was born in this life to get salvation and her life is going in a pattern, you come playing God, after doing something, you want to do something else, poor thing.  Then he will do it to her, he will hold her head, I don't know which father or mother, here the program was to be right, it was to be according to us, they did the match fixing, they went to someone else and said, ' Hey, this one will be very good, if you do it like this'  The first thing is not to be done. Okay, the first thing is not to be done. And now I will tell you a little bit about my reasoning as to why it should not be done. When we say that it is good for the child, if some chart comes, then you have to do one thing.  In practice, I saw that those who fix a lot, gave anesthesia, did not do the work, the doctor who was supposed to come met with an accident, the time of the operation was fixed and everything was happening, some other emergency case came and that doctor was called there.  you had to run away  Cesarean was not an extremely emergency case, so it was said that after half an hour, some obstruction occurs even after the vagina is formed and in many cases I have seen that it occurs when the man was becoming very weak, something or the other, something or the other, that happened.  Because even after fixing, it is not fixed so great because it is not that any big leader of the country is getting a powerful position or appointment, all the doctors are for you sparing no effort and so much.  Even fixing has been done, sometimes this does not happen and sometimes even if you have done it, why is it wrong? I would like to tell you that if you see this for the child, then you will fix it. The child has said it is something like this, this is okay for the child.  You had something to happen here, you fixed it here and separated it, now what is the matter that you can change it, you cannot change yours, whatever parents are listening to me, parents and these grandparents share knowledge.  are or Grandparents or someone else distributes the message that you fix it, you and your family cannot fix yourself, you fix your own dedication, you are sitting with all of them, so you can do it for him, so called good dedication, he is there for you.  Then it may not be so good for you that it becomes you, you, me, or it happens with mom, it happens with someone else, you try to fix one thing and another thing happens. For example, Shani Dev is currently in Aquarius.  Okay, so wherever 11 is written in the horoscope, wherever 11 is written, there is the zodiac sign, the horoscope is formed, Shani ji is there, now you can place them anywhere as you wish, you can do match fixing only in your passion, or who are these 11 zodiac signs?  You cannot remove Shani ji from 11th house and you cannot remove it from your horoscope. He will definitely come. If he comes to the 7th house then you can delay the marriage.  If you come to the fifth house then it is possible that the child may get delayed. If you come to Lagan then your nature is a little less emotional. If you come to the second house then you will have different pain. Wherever you go, you will get pain. You cannot run away from Saturn in the same way Rahu.  If Ketu comes anywhere, he will do something or the other, so you are just saying that if it does not happen here, it should happen here and you would like to fix Rahu ji in the 11th house, if Rahu is good then  If Rahu is placed in the 11th house, then maybe Shani ji or Sun or any other plan may come to such a place that they are creating mess, there are no planets, no five, no seven, and no rotation, so how many can you fix?  If you fix it somewhere, it will make you sad somewhere. You see, it is something like someone fixing the cricket pitch, not Motera Motera. Now the name of the stadium has changed. What should be the name of the one from Ahmedabad?  Gya, write that the pitch will be like this, you will get out on 240 runs, if you become Ghan Shane, then they all make noise, they were making noise before that because you have no role in the toss, did you think that Australia will bat first because  Sri Lanka had also batted first in 2011 and then Dhoni had done it like this by hitting a six after dew, so even now we will do like this, Shaina turned out to be a bastard.  First took the batting, first did not take the batting, then gave it to you, oh yes, the same work is done in match fixing, with the dedication you want to play this kind of game, for example, you have laid out the cards, is it a game, like opening an oyster?  There is a game in which those cards are of spades, maybe by se or something like that. Here is an example. I don't know much about playing cards. I am telling you an example of a game. So, you have seen the cards which have points. By stealing it, you kept the queen, kept the king, set everything up and kept it with yourself, then it is in your hands, you have cheated, you have done match fixing, but how will that order be carried out or how will the counting be done or who are the initial cards?  If you were not able to fix the cards that will come from them, then the way the order was run, even with the better cards, such a situation happened that the next person would have those red cards as his own and the other would have said those sweet cards of yours like the black ones would say all those orders. He took that, that and his numbers got higher whereas you had distributed that nonsense to him, you had distributed good things to him because you don't have control over everything, that's why it is said that there is no need for anyone to do anything when it is in your hands.  I am not in it, let it be dealt once, just like the cards are being dealt, tell me about that, will you play the game otherwise your focus will remain like this, friend, we did that too, now we should have done that because if something good happens in life, we will have to take credit.  The match was fixed and then it got spoiled  If things happen then you will blame yourself that why did I do it because no one can stop anything bad from happening in someone's life, there is no perfect time, there is no perfect moment even in the moment.  It is said that there are five different things in Panchang, auspicious time etc., let them explain them separately sometime, there will be five different things, Nakshatra will be yours, Vaar will be yours, Tithi will be that, Yoga will be there, okay, all are different in this way.  You will not get the perfect ones, the date has become good, there is something wrong in the marriage, it has become a little less perfect or the yoga has become a little like that or the constellation is the same, how many will you adjust, brother, to what extent will you adjust, maybe you are getting good Lagan or something.  But something has happened to Nakshatra, you will give it to Nakshatra because you have to be able to fix the moon, now the child has to be born in cesarean, it is not like that you can postpone it for five days, only a little time is available.  There is nothing to be done in that also, if you do too much then there is no need to get into this trouble, now no one will tell you in any way that the shop is a bit spoiling because too much is spent for this too.  Today, if you see, it has become very popular because caesarean operations are being done at 95 in big cities, normal delivery has become very less and the delivery comes according to the pennies, nowadays you know, call it hospital, women.  say system or  Generally speaking, out of 100 children are born, 95 out of them come through caesarean operation, now they come in caesarean operation, then in those 95, those who have system of astrology etc. want to fix the match because in India, Jugaad has to be fitted, right?  If someone gets it there, if I get this, if I get benefit, if this happens, if that happens, then this is a national of India. Now all the people who have developed themselves in astrology or I in astrology.  It seems that if there are no parents then there are grandparents, okay, there are grandparents, there is some aunt or aunt, there must be someone or the other, then they come and give the idea and then the consultation starts for that, I realize that because of my  I know it a lot and now how can I explain it to each one individually, so today I explained through the video that brother, don't get involved in this matter, don't try to play God, they say, if it happens as per your wish then it is good as per your wish.  If not, then it's good because then he is planning, he has planned a journey, there are original manufacturing settings, something is fine, you are trying to play with the thing that is coming, it is not right after working.  What I am trying to say is, leave it, you can avoid it, there are many more arguments, but there are many more reasons, but I feel that they will become very technical. If you agree with me, then I am fine, then brother, I am saying the right thing, accept it now.  i him What did they talk about? Start studying the scriptures. It has not been reached with any big astrologer or anyone else. No, it cannot be done like this. Hey, do it, when there was real science, and the real thing was the concept that was conceived many thousands of years ago. That was considered a birth, all those things were erased so that then you can create devils and who knows who else in it. They themselves say that she was the real one, which one, what do they say to the children these days, what about science and technology, because  Astrology has come in handy  So, those terms, those babies which you conceive artificially are fine, so all those things could also be done, that was the time, but that knowledge was removed with great care because it could be misused a lot, that if at that time,  If you do this then it will become like this and this will happen and that real birth was the same that when your sperm plus ova is becoming a jagote, when is it becoming a jagote, at what time is it being formed, then that knowledge is the child of the king and the king. At that level, the protection of religion, the threat of such and such was at that level, and at that time too, whether it was released or not, it can still be messed up, it can be misused, so gradually it was made to disappear from the system and from knowledge. That Vidya is fine, then that again, otherwise in the next one, you will go to the D60 chart, there is a little idea in the d60 chart, what is that d60, which chart is that, I want to tell you one thing in the complex.  To explain it simply, to show the thesis, to prove it, there is knowledge time, to give 50 arguments, but that time will be a video of one and a half hour. In that time, believe me, brother, I have told you through letters as if it is Motera.  I am repeatedly saying that the name of the stadium is different, why do you have to do that, friend, the batting that is happening, the toss is not in your hands, then how do you know, you will get it first, she will say, you do something like this, it is like  Try to do that and lose the World Cup. Do you want to lose the World Cup? You yourself, your child's star is good, bad or bad, you are there for that, just do your hard work, you say, child, I am with you, many  It is such that many a times it has been seen that due to match fixing, it backfires, something or the other will happen to him, he is not yours, if he gets from the father, then he does not get from the mother because he is under the control of the parents. Not there.  No, which kind of passion are the parents sitting with, the parents have different passions, okay, and the planet of that time, wherever it is, is sitting there, it has to give its impact somewhere or the other, you are saying it to me.  If you do n't get any effect here, if you don't get much effect in the seventh house, then there is father in the ninth house, if not in the ninth house, if you give it in the fourth house, then there is mother in the fourth house, no, do it in Lagan, you are getting effect in Lagan, no, do it in the second.  Give it to him in a second, your Ansel, the family of the beginning, it is not about him, put it in the lens, then it is your money, what do you want to compromise on, when you tell me, if not on someone, then let it come.  The wheel is the wheel of fortune. It is rotating anywhere. Because of your dedication, let something happen. After it happens, we will look at that thing. We will pay attention to that thing. This will be done selfishly. According to me, it is bad karma. Anybody who does this. This is my personal opinion. Now, which one will you say? I can't tell, yes, there is something, but it is my personal opinion that like this, doctors also do more indulging, sometimes the doctor offers it and sometimes even a package is offered today.  This is done because this is also a very good business, there is a good hospital, he has typed it with a good letter and says, we are giving it in a package, this is a different startup idea, by the way, you will say you are a scoundrel.  On one side he says don't do it, on the other side I am also an entrepreneur, tell me a very strong child, I will make a perfect chart and give you a package of Rs. 000 and made it expensive. Guruji's fee is Rs. 200,000, 40000, whatever is fine, but don't enter, please tell us.  We don't want it, it will happen when it has to happen, okay, so this is my take, how many of you guys have now understood, then type 's' in the comment section.  Now spread it in your circle because this is good karma. According to me, when you spread this knowledge to the people, that friend is telling this, it is right because now all the children are born by caesarean, thick is fine, 95 is plus, it is fine in big cities.  I am also getting the habit among the athletes and the younger ones too. Wherever I am coming, they are saying, who should wait, it will be painful, run like this, hospitals also have to pay their bills half the time and that is the normal one. So she will go home in a day and the one with caesarean will stay for five days, so in terms of day, I mean more, even the anti-medical people flog her, everyone is my friend, it is okay for me not to spoil any business, everyone is doing their duty.  Is it okay, so nowadays they say that the baby comes out big, it does not come out due to stress because if it comes out normal, the baby also goes under stress, so nowadays a new one should also be told, I don't know how many or big baby.  Is the baby comfortable? Is the baby comfortable? The baby should not have any problem. There is a big baby in the caesarean. These days sir will come. Instead, tell me what is your take but do not fix it in the matter of time. That is the M, don't try.  To fix the time, how many will you listen to me and spread this message? Please write this message in the comment section. I request you with folded hands, this thing should not be spread. You should know, according to me, you will send this message. So according to me it is good karma and if even after knowing this thing you still want to do match fixing then according to me it is not right. This is my personal opinion that you should not fix matches like this. Many times people have tried to fix it.  It does n't happen and even after getting fixed, the results are like you were thinking that something will be great, something is not great, meaning you will not think that I will do this, then I don't know, become an IS, it is nothing, nothing, do as much as you want, it is not possible.  They  The flavor will do, that and that will do, adjusting the vision from somewhere is so complicated that it does n't matter if you say no, it's not like that, because at that time, like big stars, you can't change them, isn't it right?  So I hope you get the message ok and spread it. Thank you very much."

    "title": "Why Life Story Of 2 Children Born In Same Place At Same Time Turnout To Be Different ？ [9IrRWUGlKmU].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, this is one thing that is asked a lot in astrology, you people must have also heard that there are non-believers, although I have already cleared the matter of belief and non-belief, but you must be curious that if two children are the same.  If they were born at the same time in the hospital, then their horoscope will be the same, because the location is the same, the time is also the same, in this I will also tell about the twins, I will make the second half of the video.  First of all, you should think that two different children belong to different parents, because twins belong to one parent, so let me explain both the things very beautifully. These videos are also my technical ones which have started for the learner but this also.  Together are necessary because when things will be understood in the mind, if not a little, then it will seem like this, why is it not the same, then if you tell me this, then you will think that Ramesh and Suresh are fine, Ramesh Suresh takes the name which is a bit old fashioned.  name is on  Let's take Ramesh, he was born in a Lilavati hospital or take any name, he was born here on the first floor or in an operation theater and at the same time a groom was born, so the distance is the same, the time is the same, the universe is the same, your horoscope is the same.  That is nothing, that is the selfie of the stars at that time when you were born or by chance you took a selfie, who was where and what planet was there, so both of you were born with the same things, so brother, then their lives should be played out in the same way. This is exactly the case and then why doesn't it happen in real life? Some people's life is good, some people's life is very good, some people's life is bad, then we will discuss that thing. Yes, Kundli, both the things are same. Let's say today because of respect.  Both the horoscopes are the same. I will also tell the twins' horoscopes. Both are the same. Okay, so in this horoscope it is written that it will work better than father. Let's say the same in this one too. It is written that it will work better than father because the stars are the same. Now.  The father of both of them, his father is worth two crores, his father is a leather worker, so he will become a clerk from the cloth because he is also good and this is relative first of all, where you are starting, where you belong, he will be from the graph onwards.  It is a template and it is relative. If it says that happiness will come in marriage or not in someone else's then how does it matter, I will tell you that this is a very beautiful chart. That is a promise that you were born with a promise, this is the promise of your life, you have got your playing cards, both of you have got the same playing cards, you have got the same color and color, but now how are the players and their mentors, gurus.  And the exposure and what is that, that is different, isn't it, now who is his father, now someone said, yes, Mars week has happened or they would have said something like this planet is a little week or the real estate will not come, not the property. Brother, if she comes then it is okay, but her father has a lot, father is standing behind her, father's inheritance will be given, and inheritance is written here also, but here the inheritance is worth 10 lakhs and here it is worth 10 crores.  No difference because let's go ahead, what are the stars of your parents, are they like Ramesh Suresh, then do their parents' horoscopes are the same? I assume they will be almost the same, but what?  Do their parents also have the same status? Do their siblings also have the same status? Are they the younger children of their own family or the elder child or both are older children? Gender also plays a role, whether it is a boy or a girl, caste or creed also makes a difference.  It also makes a difference, the ecosystem also makes a difference, eating and drinking everything will change, will all those things be that, then when you look at it, it is something like if I tell it with the formula of chemistry, although I don't like getting into astrology and science.  I do n't want to intrude because I have already told you what astrology is and the story of grandparents is not just nonsense but to prove a point, I tell you through science that if we have chemical beans, this is also chemical and this too.  It is a chemical, now we think that even if we mix them, we will get one thing, but if many of us have studied chemistry, then there must be a catalyst, there must be an environment, there must be a temperature, there must be some moisture, there must be different things.  That is also a thing, you are sitting with the same thing, but how can you do it now, like if you grind rice in South India, it gets fermented and Idli is made from it, Dosa becomes soft, the same thing is made without adding yeast or anything else in a foreign country.  If you ca n't make it then the ingredients are like if you have cooking oil, if you separate the cooking oil or leave the cooking oil aside, some are making it in desi ghee, some are making it in mustard. This is cooking in oil, the taste will definitely change, that is understandable, I am telling you that some are cooking on stove, some are cooking on coal, some are cooking in pot, some are cooking in another vessel.  If you are making it in the microwave, even if the ingredients are the same, the result is different, the taste of the food is different, so you have to understand this thing, in this you should not become one thing, yes man, this thing seems very logical, yes those things seem logical.  So my words are not looking logical but what is this problem, no one told you logically like this, the name of Ts and channel is Sango, simple astrology because I have not spread this awareness because whatever doubts you have in your mind, we will see them logically only. This science is not being experimented in very great labs. If you want to become a great scientist, then go on that path, go to NASA, DRDO and all these facilities which are against ISRO.  Those ISRO people also follow DRDO people, NASA people also follow it, that's a different thing, okay, they follow many things but no problem, if you want to become a great scientist then you can go, but if you want to bring peace in life then these things.  You will have to understand now what is there in twins because in the case of twins the ecosystem will be the same and they are also born with a difference of two minutes, there is a difference of two-three minutes, although the d60 changes.  There is a chart, it changes in two minutes, I don't enter into it, I exit because it is simple astrology, I don't follow its exit route because it happens many times, we get too technical, it doesn't change, friend, by and large it is the same.  If it is rough then it is the same, then d1 is the same, your d9 will also be the same, okay, the rest is getting changed after going to d60, yes, its flavor etc. changes, if it happens a little, then this is  Tells you that there is something called free will also, that's why, yes, that's why, this is a perfect example that everything is not in the hands of stars, everything is not in the hands of parents, everything is not in their hands. If you want to explain this then you can also see it in this way that the concept of Prarabdha Karma is beautifully explained, in this case Prarabdha Karma means previous birth.  If you believe in Karma then it is because you are listening to the story because the logic is through the story. The story of the grandparents is going on. You have not seen it. No, it is the grandparents' fault. Logically, we will do something. Brother, look, is it a boy or a girl? Well, what is the difference between the two? If twins are born, then the gender changes. Due to the change of gender, how the work world looks at them is different. They have got the same status in terms of potential but since the world  If the external is different then the result also comes different. This is an interpretation. When the gender is different in twins, now the gender becomes same in twins. Let's say the chart is also the same. Parents are also the same. They are going to the same school, wearing the same clothes.  We are eating the same food but there is not much of it. One is being fed from the left side and the other is being fed from the right side. Differences start appearing little by little. One is liking something in some way, the other is liking something in some way, then gradually the parents also like it. You take any roti, no matter how much of it you have to halve, then brother, there will be a difference of 1920. You expect the same amount to come, the same difference starts coming here too, but the theory of Praar Karma is more prevalent. For example, both of you have opened a bank account, the twins are fine, their account is also opened with ₹ lakh, this too is ₹  It is okay when both of you are born, in a way now equal amount of money is being invested in both of you, parents are investing exactly equally in lakhs, then at one stage both of them should have one crore rupees, but now we  Let's see in real time that one sibling has done better and the other has not done well. I am telling you as an example, that is, a person was born with a minus bank balance, the old one was positive and the other one was probably positive or zero.  If one was born with balance, one in life is there, one is a sibling, he has reached here, the other one has not reached, well, this one has reached, the templates will be different in me too, one will be monetary, one will be in relationships, one will have good marital life, one will have less.  It is good that one child has become two, one is not able to give birth to a child or some such situation can also happen. As far as education is concerned, now the school is in both the schools, so if I take the example.  If both brothers are going to the same school, they are going to the same class, then there are 40 other children in the class. Well, they were born somewhere as per their choice, but they studied in the same school, some are appearing in IET, some are appearing somewhere else.  If it is not working then the results are checked there also, here also you will see it checked because what you are carrying from the past and how what ever happens if you have the same potential as the chart.  Promise How you are affected by others and outside people have equal influence on you, what kind of influence will also make a difference and yet there are many common things, it is not like that, I am not saying that every twin's life is like this.  It happens so many times that it is quite similar, there is same in the property also, here too it is same, it will be quite equal, two brothers are also equal, anyway if you analyze the charts a lot. In the family, you find Kamli in the charts anyway, where there are no twins etc. You look at the husband, wife and two children. You look at their charts and you will find Mars in common. For example, if someone's Mars is in Leo, the mother's and the child's will also be there. It is possible that he will be there in the house.  It is okay if the passion gets separated but you will see the similarity within the family. You will find 100% similarity within the charts. It will be found common in either the houses or in the seventh house of someone.  If Mercury is found in someone else's too, then you see such common things, only then we are related, only then we are related in the family, each one of us affects each other and as I told earlier, those who have first two children, then parents.  Sin stars are different and they also affect positively and negatively or the way things are, they make one's life different. Like they say, food is being cooked inside a pan and on a wooden surface like before. Time  Things used to be made in the same way, but in modern times, there is a difference in the taste of cooking, so in the same way, I hope you have understood through this example, thank you very much."

    "title": "Why You Don't Cut Hair On Tuesday ？ [XKwQWSB76hM].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, why don't we cut hair on Tuesday, some say that we don't cut nails, some say that Thursday should not be cut, Saturday should also be removed, but mostly on Tuesday, I think most of us agree upon, okay, so what is there in astrology, I have very  Do research on this topic. Hey Guru ji, we know that Mars is Mars, it is Hanuman ji 's day, that is why we do not do it. Hey, all the days belong to someone or the other, friend, which day is it from Monday to Sunday?  Which Dozen Belongs to Anybody? Now even though it is Shani Ji's Saturday, they don't speak like this. So when did this happen? Is it written somewhere a thousand years ago or is it just a 200-300 year old phenomenon? Only the British had come since then.  Phenomena: Earlier it was said that one does not cut hair on Amavasya but one did not do any work on that day. What is happening? I will just tell you today that one does not cut hair on Tuesdays and nails.  You don't cut your nails like this, you don't cut your nails at night, you have to see that first everything is called religion, then I do n't know about religion, then I got connected to Astro and then he said that it is written in Astro that it is religion, then he says many times 'mummy mummy', oh I do n't know, just don't cut.  Hey, I told you, it just happens like this to you, sometimes now there are new children, they are curious, it is okay, it is Mercury, the child will ask, what is the logic, so I am also asked, I too do not have internet, I have read books and all this and worked very hard.  I worked very hard, I do n't think till date this video has been made on anyone because these videos have been made on why don't they cut and they have answers which is my answer, I don't think anyone has given this which I have discovered.  And this is the answer and this seemed logical to me and I am an astrologer, also a religious person and having read all the books, I am born in Vitabest and am giving the knowledge here that why hair is not cut on Tuesday then it is a fact, okay. What happened with the arrival of the British, things became a little streamlined. They used to say that Sunday has to be taken as a holiday. In our country, Sunday is not a holiday. According to me, Sunday should not be taken. Sunday is not a day. You should take a holiday. You should take a holiday on a new moon day. Which used to happen earlier because at that time your system is such that you want to relax and you should relax. You will see yourself that on Amavasya day, you do not feel like doing the work. You will note down the date from next time.  Get engaged and it is not like that no no no, if I say it then you will not feel like noticing it on your own, Sunday is something, we should celebrate and work is done, earlier there was economy of water system, work used to be done on Sunday but the British did it.  Then a day came that if any Nana will open a shop in Barbersville, there is a sense of loss, then something is made to implement it, if brother does not do it on this day, then there will be trouble.  Feel like, what should we discuss, how should we discuss which story will we be able to make more, which day will be suitable, let's do it on Sunday, everyone will be off on Sunday, so everyone will come on Sunday, if you close the shop then they have free time.  Even today, most of the cuttings take place on Sundays. Well, earlier it was said that one should not cut at night. If there is no light then the hair was not cut. Now there are lights everywhere etc., now children.  who from job  I will come to the barber's shop like I will tell you which day I go, I will also tell you this, so see all these days, which day was told in such a way that this day is fine, otherwise, if it is Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, then there are a lot of reasoning stories and  Everything is fine, rest of the places, even Sunday has not been said to be fine, it is better which day has been said to be fine, according to all this, and I will tell which days are cut off, I, I, I will also tell about mine, that is fine.  You may not be able to follow it because there should be a routine for it, okay, so I will tell you about my day, you have to choose that, do it, I have chosen and why I am doing it, I will tell you that too, okay. Most Liked Reason of Tuesday This is what I understood that if I had to do it on any one day then that Tuesday was chosen It is something like this, why is this right, why is this left, why is this not right, why is this not left, brother  Someone had to say right, someone had to say left, no, North Pole, South Pole, the earth is round, so this is North, this is South, yes, now the sky is above, below, space is above, below, on the side or right, we have to tell after going ahead.  It should be like this hand, now call this one this, now call this one right, someone call it right, it is okay and that is Punjabi usm khabbe paase ye pass, saying this, everyone has made it their own, he has to say something, so in everything when  You start searching and people start giving and then it seems logical otherwise then you lose faith in those things, what nonsense is this, this is superstition, this is astrology, this astrology never said when to cut hair, when not to cut it, now people have  Theta thought that look, this is how it is, Mars is Mars, if Mars is Mars, then there is blood, so if you apply energy on this day, then the energy will be like this, then blood will come out, yes, this energy will be like this, yes, there is some energy like this.  It happens, I myself tell you, I also use the word, it is not like that, and if something happens, it will happen, but man, if he calls it more energy or phenergy, then he is telling you such things that your five senses.  There is something beyond these which you do not have and you cannot feel, then this is logic, friend, this is not fun, then this logic has gone out of logic, then now if you do this then Dhruv Rathi will make further videos, brothers and sisters, Wikipedia.  Specialist Dhruv Rathi, so many crores of subscribers, look at this, if they do it like this, then we have to feel ashamed, joke, we all are like this in this one, otherwise now one of our own will say like this, we know that it is not to be done on this day, so how can we tell now that  Brother, all this system works well, come, learn, understand and see and whatever you cannot digest then leave it, I have left it, I told you on Tuesday, brother, I have decided, Tuesday is for the British.  It has started from time, it was not long before that, long before that, you can see that big sharp things were very rare, there were no scissors and screws, there were not many glasses and tools, so things were cut during the day only, not at night.  This was the reason for the night. They say somewhere in the village at night that a child should not be thrown up at night. And that lamp was lit. When the lantern was lit, there was darkness above the height of each level. So if you put the baby up, then there might be a problem in catching the light, now I say that it should not be done in this day, you are throwing the baby, the light went out, the door did not take on the stand.  Bye, it took time to come, so you threw the child, the lights went out, okay, you should not cut your nails at night, it is dark at night, if you cut your nails, your hand will be cut, now what is there in that simple thing, put a little religion in everything, a little  sa put it all  Then people used to agree, who should explain, what should not be done by speaking directly, what is a sin, it feels bad, now that, that, you see this, you are now sitting above you, no one should go from above, no, one should not go from above, go from above.  That person remains small. Well, by going over the top, he becomes small, meaning then how does it happen like this, how can one remain small? So the question is that friend, it was basically a poor country, they must have been sleeping together, so they would have gone over each other. I'm not a good  The thing is okay, who am I going to walk over, otherwise if you do n't call him a bad thing, then everyone should do this. Someone is sleeping on the footpath, someone is walking over him, someone is sleeping next to him, you are walking over him, this is it.  If you are, then you should not go on this, it is not a good thing, but now you will have to put theta behind it, so put some reason, otherwise the next person also remains old and small, now what is education, logic has come, you have studied, you can also be rich.  everything is gone now  Those things will remain with us. Why can't we say directly to him that no friend, we can like someone, we have shoes, we have feet, now we have something, so if someone's feet touch us, then we do like this because we  From inside, that thing is a hurtful thing, that the feet are contempt, it is okay because there is dust in the feet, the energy of the feet is from the house, now these things too, so I can take liberty in astrology, yay Sango life.  I will tell then people  You will not understand, 12th house, you know, feet is the 12th house, okay, there is that kind of link somewhere, so we touch that bo positive hand, okay, touch the feet with the hand, do not touch the hand with the foot, that means if you understand, then hand with foot. That circuit is formed by touching hands. Sometimes I will also tell you about the system of blessings. In India, you should not give blessings to everyone. You should not touch your feet with everyone and you should not touch everyone's feet. This is also a no-no culture.  P No, this is not the culture, this is not the culture. Touching everyone's feet is not the culture. Touching everyone's feet and blessing them by touching is not the culture. Namaste is the culture that I agree. You should not shake hands. Namaste, this is the logic of it. All these things too.  I will tell you in one go, it will be too long, so I will leave it at this that brother, whatever these things are, these things were celebrated according to a routine and they are followed somewhere where  If it is Thursday, then Thursday suits them there. Whatever bar association was there or where those people were, shoot many people on Saturday, then whoever is shooting, he did it. Wednesday suits me, Katana, so I say, Wednesday is good Wednesday.  That too at 11:00, now at 11:00 on Wednesday you will go to a barber shop, good, bad, cheap, expensive, very expensive, it will be empty, it is the middle of the week, no one has to go anywhere.  What is normal? Hair is cut even on Friday. Why is there a party or a wedding on the weekend? There is such a scene that there is a crowd there. On Saturdays because of the weekend, there is a crowd. If you go in the evening, people come from work these days and want to do their work for the next day.  It's someone's interview, someone's function, presentation, those people too, or it's okay to get time only then and there is a crowd there on Wednesday and there is no story for anyone on Wednesday. No one tells you not to cut Wednesdays, it's okay, rest of the days there is something or the other made for every day, okay then cut them when you can, yes they are cutting but if mom is getting angry, wife is getting angry, someone is angry, then they are angry.  Is it necessary to give rest on Tuesday? Now many people will start cutting hair on Tuesday also. If they cut it, if they do something then it is their community, it is brotherhood. Those who are going to cut their hair are also breaking their rules.  Brother, take rest for one day, we have already told you that it will be Tuesday, otherwise your body will not get any rest. It will say that brother, we will give you rest on Tuesday, when you will be in the market of Gujarat.  If you go or go to Bengal, you will not find anyone else there in the afternoon. If lunch break is going on then lunch break is going on. If they have to take a cyst then they have to take it, they have to do it, they have to do it, they have to do it 100%, okay then?  In that, the whole market treats you like this, but if you come to North India, the shop opens in the morning and runs till night, brother, everyone has their own nature, so it is for this reason that they are here and there is no other logical reason.  It is not consistent with the scriptures, every day there is something related to some of our gods and goddesses, so now you do not have to compete in that, I can displease this one but I cannot displease this one, so it would not be a good idea logically that I should displease them.  so make me angry  I wonder why are you cutting into their day? Then it's okay, so Tuesday was chosen and at that time when chosen, they applied logic that yes, this is the logic, we are also applying this logic.  Well, we feel that this is auspicious, blood is energy, energy is high, a cut will be made and blood will come out, this day is furious, if there is anger, then it means the barber will get angry instead of cutting your hair, he will cut something else, meaning what is the logic?  Really do n't know, if the logic that is being told does n't even fit into that logic then it means it's okay, anger can come to some people at some times, it's okay, so this is mine, I pushed you harder than I did.  If you are getting any other logical reason other than this, then it will be learning for me also. There is no one who knows all the qualities, neither am I. If you like it very much, but these are the four or five reasons which I have given.  Apart from this, it should be said that these chaps are the ones who are doing float rounds, all of them are saying that actually this is actually energy, this is not this, I did not understand, okay, so this reason is that it started from the time of British.  It is more when the British were ruling us, they did all the things slowly and gradually, this day will be like this, this day will be like this, holidays will be like this, it will be like this, they made it like this, so all that  There are market associations in things like mostly Tuesday was the chosen day, many people did Thursday, many people did Saturday, this has also happened, so I hope you people got clarity from this and got to learn. Thank you very much in the comment section for Astrology Webinar.  There is also an Info Group, you can join it too if you want to attend the webinars, seminars, workshops on astrology topics that we conduct. You can join him, thank you very much"

    "title": "Why You Should Not Clutter Your Roof ｜ Astrological Reason Explain [lPa6T6Tx23I].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, this is a very important topic of simple astrology, you people have to implement it immediately in the coming weekend, whenever you are watching this video, please declutter your roof and those who live in flats, who do not have their own roof, means not in the house.  If you don't have a house in your house, then your two- chattiya ji is your twelfth house. I come and see it. Usually, when something related to Vastu happens, I go to the roof and look at it. The piper is old.  The tile is broken, it is an old garbage material, the iron is rusting, that is, the useless things of the house which are never used and thrown away, they are not putting SIP there. Yes, it is not that there is any gold nugget lying there or silver which will grow.  Later you will be left with scrap material, it is 99 rupees but sun and rain and anyway whatever is there is getting finished, please sell it to the scrap dealer also, Rahu increases if you do this then if not  Astrology is your 12th house, so now you will see the benefits of this house again, you will automatically see the benefits of your expenses, whatever is being done unnecessarily, that house is also there, it is the twelfth house, it will come under your control and see you getting sleep at night.  Issues are happening, they will seem to be getting resolved, your anxiety will be affected, you are not able to go to a foreign country, you are not able to get a visa or your idea of ​​going somewhere foreign i.e. the place where you were born got stuck.  You will see all these things happening, you will see this benefit 100% and all the clothes that you are sitting with stuff in your boxes will be used someday, sometimes you will be fit, sometimes you are not going to be fit and  Maybe there is no need to have it, okay, that much time is gone, please give the clothes to someone else, give them anywhere, dispose of them, old books, old electronic items, bad electronic items, but someone calls them eggs.  no eggs no eggs  There is no need to keep them anywhere, there is no use of them, so remove from everywhere in your house whatever things you are not using and have not used in the last 6, 10, 12 months, please throw them away for the sake of children. Old toys, old items, stationery items, people don't know what they keep, they do n't get rid of old possessions, leather goods, torn bags, people also keep a lot of polythene, it is okay, it will be needed sometime, it will be needed for someone, broken bucket is okay.  The coolers are dead but maybe I can get it repaired and become a tycoon or sell it to someone. This is the kind of planning that if you are doing then please don't do it. The message is keep the roof completely clean, your mummy. Keep it clean. What happens sometimes is that you have cleaned the stuff or even if the stuff is not there, still check there to see if any type of moss is frozen. I would suggest people to spend a little water and put good stucco on their roofs.  4. I also know that there is an expense of 50 feet and if there is 500 feet, then the expense of Haj is 253, but it will remain clean, there will be a broom and a mop, whenever you feel like doing so, please keep it clean because the people above know.  No, they have a brick type setup and the roof is as if you go, nowadays real estate has become very expensive in big cities, so I don't know what all they have made, they have kept the whole thing green and grass type.  We give it complete paint job, it gets amazing type, tiles are used, trees are planted, flowers and plants are planted, good plants etc. are there, plant everything in a good way so that one feels like sitting there, make the terrace as per your wish.  There is a roof and the people who are sitting with two chhatiyas should have only minimum luggage in it and there should be empty suitcases and do not fill them with too much stuff, do not fill them even under the bed, that is another message, people under the bed too.  We keep a lot of stuff, we have to keep it clean, keep a little bit, POS is the city of space, I also understand that, I am a real estate person also, so I understand the importance of that, but don't keep garbage, that is, don't keep anything that smells.  Or whatever is not good to look at, which you cannot wear, which cannot be touched to your body, that is, things like this, which you do not use, which you declutter, you should do all these things, it is very important, it can be done through simple astrology. I am bringing practical things which people are following me. The practical things are small, they don't cost much, even water does not cost much, people are getting very good feedback on these things, I will keep bringing videos like this, I will keep bringing them through practicality.  We also do some small workshop webinars in the coming time. If you want to join them too and want information then you will find Webinar Info Group in the comment section. Astrology Simple Astrology Webinar.  You will find an info group, please join it, then you will get to know and learn all that, thank you very much."

    "title": "आपका मन कहाँ लगता है  या कहाँ लगेगा ？ [zlQZJMghDBc].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, where does your mind feel, then I teach you just like simple astrology, I do not want to do anything technical, you understand the mind, okay, Rajesh Khanna once said, Pushpa, the mind is fickle, okay, the mind is fickle, the moon is very fast.  The fastest moving thing is that within astrology the zodiac sign changes in two and a quarter days, so where is your mind, this is defined by where is your moon, now where is the moon, where is the moon, in which house is the ascendant.  In the horoscope, if you are sitting with the Moon in the first house, then brothers and sisters, then your mind is focused on yourself, whoever has Moon in the ascendant, you can see them, you cannot tell which one is their caste, trust, simple.  Astrology is like it happens many times, we can tell by looking at the face that he is from this caste or that caste, the sage will not get this round face, you will not know about the caste and vata, he is sitting with moon in ascendant and I am whose face.  Let me give you an example, I mean you can see what kind of face it will be, it will be round face and suppose if he is a Jat then he will talk like a tradesman, okay that means you will not be able to find out what is his caste, okay then you can meet such a person.  If you know, then you can write in the comment section whose words are something, caste is something, the face looks round and are happy, these people are normal but whatever their moon is sitting in the ascendant, if they have the same emotions then they will be on their face.  You will come to know that if he gets angry, then as soon as he gets angry, it will be visible on his face. As soon as he gets angry, it will be visible on his face. As soon as he gets angry, happiness will appear on his face. There will be no control. This is your Moon in the first house. To some extent, this Moon will also work in these Aries. See it anytime, whenever in astrology.  Planets in houses and all this is discussed, so you can interchange it, in houses it works 100% but in zodiac also it works 50 to 75 depending upon which planet.  I am sitting with you and if his flavor changes, then I will not complicate it. Astrology is simple. There is no need to take 100 out of 100 numbers. If you understand even the thick and thin in astrology, then you will get so much peace in life. What are we, isn't it a new thing? Learn what I tell you many times to students or here, you don't have to get a job by topping any exam, you have to bring stability in your life, you have to bring relaxation, then understand as much as you can.  If you apply as much as you can, then the Moon will be in the second house, then what are the working elements of the second house, what happens in the significant house, Moon in the first house is also food and the second house can also be food, that too in the mind.  And how much identification will you have in it? It will also take into account your original family, the parents where you were born or were born, and the face will also be good. The face of the person in the second house will be generally attractive.  There will be a factor on the face again, there may be something in it that the sign of Saturn is sitting or sitting with Saturn, there are exceptions but generally it works till 80 and even if Saturn is sitting there will still be an attraction.  It is seen that there is a physical attribute that is said in beauty like a fair complexion or body and whatever is your personality, height is big and all is said like this but sometimes what happens is that one does not have such complexion.  Even if it is there, the attraction is still there, so you will definitely get the attraction. If you have to see, if it goes to the third house, then you will be interested in the younger sibling or in things of communication or whatever things happen with the third house, maybe in the neighbor too.  You may feel in love with a boy next to you, you may also feel in love with a girl, this can happen, if Moon is in the fourth house inside the third house, then you will feel in your own house, your relationship with your mother may be good, the connection with your mother will be good. Ok  If you will enjoy peace, then it can be seen in this way, if you go to the fifth house, then you will be interested in children, you can also be interested in romance, you can also be interested in old knowledge, whatever is significant of the fifth house, you can do it, I am the fat one.  I am telling you that you will feel that the same thing will work in Moon in Leo. Also, if you had talked about the fourth house, then Moon in Cancer will also feel that you will be an emotional person. Moon in Gemini, Moon in the third house. Can interchange with Moon in second house, can do with Moon in Torus. Okay, now Moon in sixth house, so Moon in sixth, how about a little bit of that, that is, there is fun in fighting. You have seen many people who have fun without fighting.  If one does n't fight with someone then the bread is not digested. Sometimes this can happen. You will have to write in the identification with all the people. Moon in fifth house working beautifully, working but not.  Very beautiful, it's fine, it will work, see what happens, many a times, when people are told something bad, they don't agree. If you tell a good thing about someone, he agrees, but Moon in the sixth house is not necessary, it is not necessary to feel like fighting. Moon in Sixth South: It is possible that you may have more sub-servitor ba bhaav, this can also happen again by mixing and matching the sign which is the sign of the squares and their significant of the house. Look, think about it, I am also a good guruji type astrologer, I am telling you just like a mother feeds a child by mashing it, that is why I have kept simple astrology, I am not telling it by doing any other technique, ok mummy, sometimes I mash the potatoes. Sometimes she will make you banana and sometimes banana shake. If I am telling you like this then Moon in the sixth house can also make you feel like fighting. You can become a lawyer because a lawyer has to fight for money, he has to fight and a loan.  The work of taking is left, this can also be seen. Moon comes in the seventh house. Moon comes in the seventh house, that is, there is attraction towards the opposite sex. If Mercury joins here, then it is fun. In terms of quantity, it is okay for many people. What is Mercury? If there is a sign of Mercury in it, or if Mercury itself is sitting in it, then multiplication also happens. If the matter is a little fine, then the Moon has to be seen in the seventh house in such a way that it can be  If you are interested in your spouse, maybe he is your happiness. If you get happiness from there, Moon in 8th house gets debited housewise, but it means that the activities of 8th house are also of research and astrology, so it is possible.  Do you feel like there too, although there are many other activities, there may be confusion in that too or your mind may remain a little distracted, may even remain indifferent, but researchers have also seen here that something is happening at a subtle level.  go and find out  Those who are a little serious in nature, it has also been seen that if the Moon comes in the Ninth House, then the significator of the Ninth House is interested in being older than the father, right? Or is he interested in doing long journeys or is interested in higher education? Or if you are interested in religious matters, then it is seen in this way, Moon in Ninth House, moving forward to 10th House, if your Moon is in 10th House, then your mind is on work place.  Your attention has to be felt, you will talk more about the same things, you will be focused on work, what is happening in the office, normally in olden days, as they used to say, the moon house will work as a milkman, no, it will not work as a milkman, but your emotions are your work.  According to today, if you see and your tenth house is father's wealth, also because father is ninth and second from father, father's accumulated wealth can be assets and property wealth, then it is possible that your mind will remain there also.  Not in a negative, many times there are many children who look after their father's finances. Restructuring the father's assets will be an initiative. This is a little higher level thing that I am also telling about, where I have less to tell.  If it is happening, please go to a higher order and tell me because we can do that also, like, the house which is further away from the house, does it belong to him? For example, if father's 11th house will be father's younger brother or sister.  If there is Moon in the 11th house then now a days the relationships are no longer like that with uncle or aunt, so we will say that you will be interested in the larger friend circle. Moon in 11th house Moon in 11th house also benefits  If there is a house, then it will also be on top of the cash flow. The second house was of accumulated wealth, it was of assets, so that is the thing that has happened where there is wealth, there is attention, many people are like this, many I have seen women.  Those who are concerned about the assets, where the money is coming from, how much is coming, who is earning, how much will be earned, they are not concerned about both these things, we have to understand the second and 11th house, money confuses both of them with money and wealth. If 10th house is your liquid and cash flow then if Moon is in 11th then you will concentrate on those activities. It is okay to earn money and 11th house is also your larger network in life. Your network is larger with friends.  Many people say circle but I say this, who do you know, how big is the circle? So you have Moon in the 11th house, that is, it does it to many people, so Moon in it also comes a little in the 12th house.  A person can also become a little spiritual, if suppose he is suffering from some intoxication or is dependent on something, his Moon is afflicted or he is under the influence of any sinful planet etc. then if he  If the mind goes towards spirituality in the 12th house, then it will get peace because the mind is sitting in the 12th house, otherwise it will also spend money, now Venus is sitting with Venus, who is watching, so things will keep changing a little, so how will this one be?  It felt very simply, I told it very simply, I told it very simply that our mind is there, wherever the Moon is, our mind will be more there, that's all, so it is not that someone is sitting with the Moon in the ninth house. So he will never take care of his children, but where is he looking for more peace? Where is his mind? The mind is fickle, it goes here and there as well. You know, the one whose mind is focused on his passion, then he has his own photo.  You see, in general, he is happy about himself, he does n't need anyone else, I don't need anyone else, I love myself, it's okay, she is Gyana, have you seen that Katarna ji's moon is in the first house, so my heart is happy.  Everyone has to put in a little bit of space. It is not that if the Moon is in the second house, if you do not concentrate on your wife, she will get angry. Your mind will naturally attract people, where will yours automatically go, as it is said that it is not very much on its own.  There are people who keep intruding into the life of the younger sibling and wonder what is happening, this is what is happening, I am very much like him and his wife keeps thinking throughout his life that what is this, what is this, what is happening?  You might be sitting in the house with me, check the ground, someone keeps saying 'mummy, mummy', someone keeps talking about 'papa papa', someone focuses more on children, someone focuses on fighting, someone focuses on earning money, someone focuses on job, we change him.  Today I told you with such a simple thing, that's all, there is no need to change it, it will be something like this, just accept it and this is what you see in your horoscope of all the family members, test it on five horoscopes. It works beautifully. Now brother, why are you taking his mind away from where his mind is? Now see what he can do there, because the mind of the ninth house also means long journey, one can become a travel blogger, one can have interest in religion too.  It is possible to be significant in higher studies. If someone is interested in food, then he can become a food blogger. If he becomes a food-based chef, then if you listen to your passion then it will be very good. Partnership in Seth House.  It may not be necessary to be of the opposite sex. When people work in partnerships, there is also networking. Businesses are also run in that way. It is not necessary to tell anything negative in the house. Its researcher may be good, astrology is good.  Maybe psychologist may be good, dark domain is Ath house, you know it is dark, so many people go into dark things also, you know and there also people earn money, so this is how you have to understand, enjoy after learning astrology.  want and  You should feel strong, you should not feel scared, if you are feeling scared, then you are learning wrong. If he is a good teacher, then tell him that yes, we are scared, don't scare us. And even then, if Jyoti is scared then you are learning wrong.  If you feel scared, are you learning wrong or someone is teaching you wrong, this is a simple test, do n't be afraid because you can sit down with so much nectar, no one has come after drinking the nectar, everyone has gone, it is okay and that is the whole song, isn't it, the old happiness of your Kishore Da.  If you want to  Sadness is also an army, okay, sadness does not come to me, the army desires happiness, Guruji, do some work, I have to sing Kishore da's song, my name is Amit, okay, now many Amit Kumars are good singers, Amit, I am not but  Emotions are our right and we know the lyrics of the songs, we are fine, if nothing else, nowadays through techno ji, can you always forward a shot or video, brother, listen to this song, listen to this one, what is the desire of happiness?  So  It is okay to bear the pain, otherwise leave it, the mind is where our mind is, it is there, now what can we do with it, everyone is sitting with it somewhere or the other, there is no one whose moon is missing from the horoscope or is not in any house.  Or it is not in any zodiac sign, the flavor changes like it is potato, potato has its own nature but potato will taste different in peas, in gravy it will taste different with dry puri, they are prepared separately by adding them which are taken in the train.  are fine and in potato potha  If you get a different taste then it will be your change but the basic flavor of potato remains that it is potato, okay so it is thick like that, I taught you gradually, you will come to more videos, I was not trying this for many days.  I will do this. If you hit this one and like it and send it to your friend circle and the views will increase then my motivation will increase because I am the creator. Now you see, I have five channels brother, not just one, sometimes I get carried away in politics because  I don't know where is the mind of all people, don't you know where is your mind, if my moon is fine, then I will tell you sometime where is my mind, if it is fine, then like, share and check everyone's horoscope, your relatives, your wife, everyone nowadays.  It comes out in a flash as to which zodiac sign the person is sitting in. Check both of them. First check the Moon in the house and then consider that zodiac sign as the house. If someone's Moon sign is in Leo.  So the Moon in the fifth house will also work on it, it will do both the things, then the number written by the Moon is your zodiac sign, do not consider it as a house, I have already taught you that there are constants, those who do not even know this and are hearing this for the first time.  If you are looking forward like this, then brother, go and watch the old videos, watch them in the playlist or go there and you will find the videos that are uploaded, everything is explained in a simple way, so please celebrate, not celebrate. Circulate and like it more and leave a comment in the comment section. Then I will start telling you things in a very simple way. You will enjoy learning astrology. There is a lot of fun in learning astrology. You will learn astrology, won't you brothers and sisters? The troubles of your life will go away because you have learned astrology.  Jyoti, after learning how to make my eighth house active, there will be no problem now. It's something like I had to spend on medicines. Okay, so I bought the medicines.  Donated, the person who comes to the hospital after making rounds every month and donates medicines, to some needy person there, his trips to the hospital were also made and he also donated medicines, this is astrology, now he will say  No, you will have to go to the hospital, so friend, you yourself take the trip, it's okay, go around half a time and come back, it's okay, you have to spend on medicines too, you have to go to the hospital, so you have done this, now he says.  Does it really work? Try it, friend. Giving medicine to someone can't be a wrong thing. Okay, needy. It's okay, if any relative goes to the hospital, sometimes you should visit him and ask about his well-being. I am satisfied that yes, I am not worried about the hospital right now, otherwise I may have to go again. Otherwise, nobody wants to ever go to a hospital as a patient. Nobody, if I tell you, brother, so many handfuls of medicine.  There are two choices, donate it or eat it. Which of the two will you choose? If I eat, it means I will have to suffer some illness. It is okay and if I donate, it is good, it means someone in need got benefit, my expenses are over.  I lost the medicine but I didn't have to take it, so brother, this is astrology, it's as simple as that, understand it, it's okay and a good life is spent for the one who understood, now that happened, the same money was spent on the medicine, I had to go to the hospital, but now you  learning  Look friend, that's why this laughter that is coming is not an artificial laughter, it is genuine laughter, okay, it is genuine laughter, okay, friend, it actually does, only then I am trying to tell, many others will come, it is not scientific, this is from you.  I felt scared somewhere in the whole video, tell you this, people don't say this, understand it as the stories of grandparents, I liked it, there are folk stories too, there are folk songs too, okay do it, okay like, share. Share in the comment section Saral Jyotish whatsapp.in group, if you are not on any other group, I have many groups of different channels, if you are on any then you can get the details because I do crossover work also, but if you are listening for the first time and  If you ever want to come to my webinars or any of the many things we do for free, then you will get the information in it, you can join it passively, you will get to learn something, you will get it in the comment section.  Join it if you haven't yet and please share it on your family groups. Mother will also know where her mind is. Mother will know where father's mind is, then there will be love among each other and there will be no fights.  You will know where your wife's mind is, where is your mind, okay, those who have her in the seventh house, then you should have the mind, okay, you check and if you don't have the mind, then I am not much of an astrologer.  Want to teach but the mind will come out in you, it is okay and if you are sitting somewhere else then it will be visible there also, there is no need to be angry in it, people with Moon in the house, there is no need to be angry, the friend will remain busy in work and his mind is there, he will be at peace.  If you are getting the same then B part of that is ok so I hope you understand these things well, you go to many places, what do those people do, no one is teaching it so easily, so stay connected with the channel, if my I will give it very good  I will teach everyone a lot, ok thank you very much"

    "content": "Hello friends, this is a very important video, it will be a little funny, it will also be a little painful and it is also practical because these people have taught astrology because this is how I teach astrology, I will not call them astrology because this is not it, these people have made a big deal of astrology.  And I will tell you people so that you people do not go to the wrong place and get trapped in the work of defaming astrology and do not laugh at astrology because these are the cartoon characters who  Astrology is done and a lot of people are appearing in the podcast. They will make their beard black, they will apply gel veil, they will wear a few taka, they will wear a good rosary and they will talk with confidence. The way I look at them, I also teach astrology and many more.  I know it, but there is always an element in telling that there is a little element left, please check and tell, get the paper checked, this is with such confidence that brother, there is pain in the knees and there is no need for surgery, tit one.  Write the truth on one page and then see, it is so amazing what they do, these people mean crazy butch, the knee replacement surgery that is happening inside Medanta and the Gods have worn out all over the world, it is hurting.  It is so easy, do that system by titling. A brother says that the money will be waived off. Give me one kg of lentils. I work in real estate. I have a flat worth Rs. 3 crores and a loan of Rs. 4 crores.  Yes, take it and next time don't give it and go to the bank manager and tell him, I will not give, he will say, I will take the house, yours will say, how can I take the house, my loan has been paid, your loan has been paid, how will you say, lentil dal is good, one kg. Lentil group price, come, get all the property in your name, take loan under pressure, your loan will be forgiven, where did you learn this from, where and what are you teaching to whom, I am saying that whatever knowledge is a normal common sense [ __ ].  Ca n't remove the taste, those who promise big things, look at some small thing, say that bha masoor dal bha, you will get some sleep in the night, that means still the man thinks, come on, what stakes will there be in this, let's go and see.  So these loans are being waived off, they are telling in the scheme every day that if you do this then there will be rain of wealth, it is so easy to make the rain of wealth, why don't they make normal rain when there is so much pollution, if this is what is said in astrology. those who remain in it  You will get stomach ache after laughing so much at these things, I mean, I consider them as comedy, but what is the point of following people, now that something like this does n't happen, Bha Guru ji, so much has been done, how was something supposed to happen, meaning you do all this.  The mean man laughs in the thing was some old dirty joke that do you believe in ghosts, there was nothing like this, do n't tell me the content, but its punch line was that it means you believe in these things, weeding, maybe you guys have ever  must have seen Sango must have come in life to know what is evil eye, what is practical from practical, as is the Jajman, so is the astrology, as if he needs magic treatment, then only those magicians will be found for you, all such people will do magic to you, brother, change your name like this.  There is a rebellion against the person doing this, there is so much ruin among the phone number people, if this phone number is there, then it will lead to wealth, that is, and this phone number is like this, if there is eight in the number or something like that, then it will be a loss, oh one thing.  Tell  Friend, when there were no phones, there were no mobile numbers, then there was no harm and see for yourself, these astrologers are all sitting with these numbers, those who are going to eat anything themselves do not see anything of their own, they say that the correction of their name is not there.  Get it done, they have six websites of their own, youtube2, put something, hey, where are you, whom have you taken different catchment areas, change the name to become so good, meaning yes, it has tried, meaning the government has given the name of a city at one place.  tha gurgaon is ok  Then it was named Guru Gram that now there will be no problems, the problem is waste, changing the name will solve some of the city's problems, you will have to increase waste management, you will have to save from pollution, you will have to improve the infrastructure, change this name, there will be a lot of problems in Gurgaon.  If you were having problems then now it's no langar Gurgaon it's Guru Gram You are a Guru Grammar by changing the name or name you can get away on your own This can fool you for a while, if you believe in this planet, astrology, karma, God and all this, then you should also believe in it, I am saying that if you have so much faith in this, then are you so foolish that your  Due to their actions, they will become fools that if they do this then go to the hospital and then they will not get sick. The disease is being caused by your eating wrong. If you eat straight and wrong every day, then I want to tell you one thing about the remedies. Do these remedies work? ok these big ones  No, write triple two and write masoor. Any solution which tells you to change something is fine. Like you chant. You are fine. Someone asks you to recite a mantra. Someone asks you to do some physical activity like offering water to the Sun, doing Surya Namaskar, doing exercise.  Doing it like that, this off course works, but it will also work only for those who want to live a particular virtuous life, your thoughts are all very fine, your actions are all very bad, your eating habits are all ridiculous.  Now how much medicine can you take, you will not be cured, if the doctor tells you that brother, you have a bad throat and you gargle with hot water like this, it is okay, take this medicine, do it like this, then go and have ice cream.  If you are also eating then now everyone knows this thing that it is common sense that if the throat is sore then one should not eat ice cream but people do not have this common sense with the pain they are facing in life.  They are also eating its equivalent of ice cream and then they are doing all the activities and then they are saying that if it didn't work, then if it didn't work, then who is the idiot because what is there in astrology, either they will be given the maximum remedy which is maximum only those people.  They give a lot of work. Okay, it sounds like this, write this here, write that there, write that below this, write this, do this, do that, manifest it, do this, this is a lot of work.  Anyway, do whatever you want, it won't work, a few things will work, what I say is okay, a few things will work, for those too, if you are not living that routine and lifestyle, then brother, then that too.  That too did not work. What will be the result? Will all of them become 'Allam Ballam' that all is nonsense, all keep looting, which astrology has become infamous, then what is the right method for it? First of all, you should learn it yourself because when you learn astrology then you will understand the limitations and also astrology.  Will understand astrology also  Astrologer also has limitation, every knowledge has limitation, everything has limitation, many things change like I take the approach that brother life will throw surprise at you why do you want nothing to come your way why can't you use astrology knowledge clarity what  Ever to overcome two hurdles, why can't you do this brother, you will throw a bow to the ball, world bowler, is the world okay or will you hit a full toss?  Or spin will come, why can't I become a good batsman, why can't I keep my guards good, why can't I wear my helmet, then this is the excitement of life, isn't it? Now in Bring It On Bring It On astrology, the good ones are your mentors and Strategists are guides, strategists think that they are the ones who have strategy in life, that is why the fees for people like us are high because we do not have to earn money by doing all the work.  You are doing strategy to an intelligent person, I tell you, don't quote astrology to me, whatever I tell you will make you do strategic thinking and will try for better to change the life path of your life, because you are giving sugarcane every day.  You are getting juice and you want pomegranate juice. The only fee is to tell that brother, please don't do this. To get pomegranate juice, you have to add pomegranate but it sounds very natural.  I wonder what is this but many people are like this, they are not changing the action and they are repeating the action, thinking that this time the result will be different or not, every time they are putting the ball there, every time they are hitting a six, every time.  If you are hitting a six then no? You were not hitting it in the last match. The pitch was different. Brother, now the pitch has changed. Is it the batsman who has changed or the direction of the wind has changed? You will have to change the strategy, you will have to change the ball somewhere.  And you will have to bowl, they say round the arm and he comes from here, he spins over the wicket or something and says, left side, from here, the umpire is standing here, he will bowl from here, he will bowl from here, when many a times sixes would be hit here.  If there is a person then he says, let's try it from here, it is a simple thing but otherwise I will do it from here, I will put it like this and I get a different result, this does not happen but in many places, this is what I am talking about, examples, such simple methods.  I am teaching you all very well, you are understanding it very well, yes, it is obvious, but is it so obvious in real life, is it so obvious in relationships, you are doing the same things, the same thing is happening to you, you are just changing something.  If you are not doing it, then how will there be any change, then look at these people as entertainment and please name and shame them, you people are the audience, we cannot do this because we have fraternity and this  To say that I am very great or not, it becomes a little bit of that, although sometimes I do not hesitate in taking the names of some other people on my other channels because they are spreading mass stupidity, hence it is necessary to take their names and that too.  If there are two or four, then in taking names, here brother, it is 200-300, because the name of one or two has been taken, that of five has been taken, injustice will be done to the rest, they will say, Guru ji, why did you take our name, he is also doing that, so do it. Even I have not seen everyone, but those who talk like this is foolishness, this is foolishness, I am telling this, I myself say this, if you want to use the stories of the best i.e. grandparents, then be very clear that  Grandparents' stories will make you sleep, that's all. Whenever someone is using grandparents' stories, then by using grandparents' stories, it does not happen that you get a job or something great happens in your life, just at night.  I felt sleepy Brother, if the purpose is the same, but the work that this person is doing, these are not even the stories of grandparents, I do n't know what these beautiful stories are, what are their stories, post them here, do it like this, catch it.  Well, it will happen that the blessings of money will come on these zodiac signs, right now the zodiac signs don't know that these are the mind signs, the ascendant signs, the moon sign and meaning the sun sign, many people say to themselves that I was born on 5th January, so I am a Capricorn.  I am, but this is your sun, then which one is that one? What happens in the moon? Yes, what is this? Wherever it suits everyone, we put ourselves there. Brother, the lottery will open for Aquarius people, so now you are an Aquarius sun.  That is, whether it is Aquarius or Moon or you are sitting with passion, then anyway there is a chance of 25. There are many sets in three out of 12. If you are just feeling bad, then it is not bad. Now it depends on your psychology. If you like the ship, brother, learn it first.  Sometimes someone consumes so much of something without learning it, then if you want to learn something then you can write about it in the comment section and in the comment section you will find a group of astrology if you are not connected to that.  My already, now we keep doing something or the other beyond that so that we can learn things, when you learn then neither will you feel fear nor will you become a laughing stock and you will seriously improve your life and help those around you.  You will improve your life. If every person learns a little astrology, he can genuinely improve the life of 10 to 15 people near him and if 1 crore people learn astrology, then the life of 15 crore people can get better. Basically, people like me.  Do I teach you or should you learn? The yearning of your life is not a useless yearning, reduce it. Come and learn astrology. Learn it in winter and when that yearning subsides, you start getting relief. Light your fire.  If you are sitting on fire, it is cold, if it is outside then it is fun to learn. If you have a rocket built in your back side, if you are going up, it becomes a big problem. You should not be sitting on fire. You should be close to fire.  If it is cold, it is okay, then I teach you the same thing. The milk is boiling on the milk gas, so the maid has kept it on high speed and as soon as she turned back and placed the spoon, it was out of doubt. Had this sim been there in a second, there would have been no tension. multitasking  If you don't do it, then those who are easily influencing your real life, like me, are doing it positively, there is great one on one feedback, that is why I am telling you this, brother, whoever tells you to change suddenly, astrology should do this.  Do all these mean formulas, do it like that, do it like that, my friend, if it was done then all the professions were over and the best thing was that I thought, book three flats in Na Kilo Masoor Dal in Gurgaon on loan because the loan is waived off.  The loan is over, you will not have any problem, the loan will be over in a month, the bank will say, oh brother, you have done it, why didn't you tell me earlier, make a video, put the photo, put it in running water, your loan will be waived, amazing, amazing.  No one comes to them and asks them, 'How do you do it like this? You mean, you are getting four flats for four kilos. Come on, Ninja Technique is the way to get real estate and real estate is amazing. Don't make fun of them and do this otherwise.  These will continue to spread and spread like this, such big podcasts go to such big and popular ones with 20-25 lakh subscribers, what else can you push, it will happen like this again, it will happen like this, don't speak with so much confidence, friend, whatever you mean, at least keep it to a minimum, yes.  Try doing it too, by doing it like this, now you see, friend, this little person has knowledge, I am not denying, does n't he have no knowledge, but what is the problem, little one?  Knowledge is there and little knowledge is always dangerous. Sitting somewhere, attending something small or big, then this is Rahu, it is okay in the form of astrology, unguided missiles will go anywhere, Chinese goods will go anywhere, if not till the evening, then till the moon, then it is okay not to go.  So if it goes further till the evening then till evening anything means depending on which thing, so friend this is not a coincidence, don't get into the trap of such probability, yes it will happen, you too can do anything.  Do it because no matter what you do, there will be a possibility of something going right. You can always get away. Any yes or no thing has a 50% chance of getting it right. So, customer, wake up, learn the light yourself, it is important to learn yourself.  Life changes, it will take a little effort, it will cost a little money, but you will learn things, then you will learn, either you know it or you don't, it's a simple thing, so I hope you liked this video, share it is a request, subscribe one Increase your subscribers. My request is to all of you to increase one subscriber each so that we can move towards 50000. My next milestone is 50000. As soon as we hit 50000, a little bundle of knowledge will open and if we move further, the bundle of knowledge will open slowly.  Slowly, those of you who are watching this video for the first time on my channel, go to the playlist and whatever old videos you see, things are explained very simply. 12 Even if a 12 year old child listens and he does not understand then you should tell him because if you cannot explain the thing to a 12 year old child then you are not an expert. Explain that thing in such a simple manner.  Do n't try to impress him by giving him all the memos, it will happen like this to someone, then it is ok, which one Ayansh do you use, which software, then this is the technique, do you know D60, you can do with D1 only.  Opinion has not reached till t60, no one is sitting here taking two minutes of time, they are busy trying to impress, those who say that astrology can be taught to everyone at the age of 80, no one is interested in teaching it, everyone talks about 97 to 100.  Brother, no one has learned how to impress and 80 how to be a normal person. Brother, a very good job can be done with 80. By doing this 100 by 100, no one is sitting together.  I am fighting after one stage, the moment or knowledge of 90's, then every buddy starts calling each other, after doing this, take your peace till 80's first and then enjoy further, ok please share, like and if subscriber info  There is a group on the comment section of webinars, you will find it, definitely join it, thank you very much."

    "content": "Hello friends, today's topic is very interesting. I am telling you very simply in simple astrology, from where will the pain come in your life. Look, everyone faces pain in life, it is not like that, but you can get some idea as to where it will come from and it will come from there.  It will come so that we can get peace from it and then we will discuss about the solution to the pain also sometime, last time I had made it clear that your mind is in the moon in houses, if you had understood then today whatever we will talk about, we will talk about Shani ji, so what  Shani ji is suffering, yes, so it will be a very interesting topic, my topic of Sade Sati has become very hit, if you have not seen that video then definitely watch it, it is recommended from the playlist and tell me what you feel like doing, I teach astrology in such a simple way, so much astrology  There are so many channels, there are so many people and everyone is doing good work, to stand out in it and connect people easily requires a little effort, I think I have to move towards that, the house in your Kundali is Saturn which is signified by poor man, dry planet, dryness of emotions.  There is also pain in reducing, you should check that you open your Kundali, open your Lagna Kundali only And check in that horoscope where is Shani Ji sitting, in which house is he sitting, so if Shani is sitting in the first house, then there will be a life of pain, there will be a life of struggle, from where will the struggle come, means now that life itself has become like this, you should understand that the struggle  It is complete, now Shani ji is sitting, whenever I teach or tell anything about the placement of planet or any planet, I never feel bad about these are playing cards, some are butt and  If there is any loss in the living aspect anywhere, the material aspect will also do good there, I have already told this, you must watch my old videos, things have been explained very simply, so if Saturn is in the first house, then you will be a little serious.  And now you have to match this, take out your family's horoscope in all the horoscopes and make notes of the houses one by one, I will tell you everyone's horoscope is placed somewhere or the other, so match yourself, match the following, there are four in the family, extended family and the elder one  Family is of 10, 12, 15 people, then there are friends and sometimes someone comes into someone's life  If you are having pain or suffering, okay then you can come into it and ask him that brother, is it like this or is it going to happen like this, then you get to know a little bit, yes friend this is bound to happen, Saturn is a cold planet, wherever it sits,  It will cool things down, it will cool down that relationship, so if any planet sits in the lagna, then now all the aspects, lagna is very important, so your personality itself becomes such that you yourself are a cold person, cold means hot passion  No, there are no emotions, okay, if Saturn goes to the second house, the one whose Saturn is sitting in the second house, you can do it interchangeably with the zodiac sign also, that Saturn in Aries, Saturn in Taurus, I am also telling you a fact, but in that it will work about 50  But whatever is being told will work in the house 100%, you can understand this way, I am not complicating it further than that, if we go into advance then there will be a talk of views also, but I am not complicating it now, we will do it simply  Let's go first, Saturn is in the second house, it is cold, then you may feel something  You will like cold food or you will get cold food. There are many people who are destined to eat cold food only. These people have Saturn in the second house. They will either like cold food like ice cream or normal food like microwave, this is basically their fate.  You can see whether you can eat it after microwave or you can eat it cold, there will be no need to even microwave it, everyone has to taste it and write in the comment section, brothers, watch the video comfortably because it will be completed in this video  In my second house, it is also of your original family. I have explained what is original family and every relation from every house. You should watch the video. You will be hurt by your original family of parents, siblings.  In some way or the other, you will suffer some pain throughout your life, your assets will also be built with a delay, wherever Saturn sits it will cause delay there too, so when there is pain from one eye, it means that there is only physical pain, it can be emotional pain as well.  it can be physical pain it can be pain it can be a Disputer is also there, Disputer in the sense everything gets delayed, so your assets are also getting delayed, if you see it, Saturn goes into the third house, then third house is of younger sibling, it is of communication, you may get pain from there. Your email, your drafting, all these things pull you in the office or something goes wrong, that is where the pain comes from, communication happens with you, paper work happens, documentation happens, relationship with younger siblings happens  You are a little cold, you are suffering from there, you are suffering from younger brother and sister, you are suffering from some things in the workplace which I told you about, Saturn moves in the fourth house, see the fourth Saturn, there are many benefits in having each one. So today we are talking about the pain, where does it come from? Today we are not telling the whole story because what would happen if we tell the whole story. The video can be of three hours as well. We are focusing on one aspect today. It is not like there are only benefits too.  On some other day, Saturn is in the fourth house, which is the house of the mother, the place of happiness, then the mother  There will be pain from the heart or the mother will suffer; the opposite can also happen in the relationship, like there can be a problem in the life of the younger brother, if Saturn is in the third position, there is pain in his life, there is pain in his life, then there will be pain due to his pain also.  It is possible that this imagination has to be used, what everyone does in astrology, they do not do a little higher order thinking, they say that this was told to me, I have very good relations with my brother, but friend, it is possible that his life may go a little like this  It may be that because of that you may feel that the life of the brother is not going well, the younger brother's younger sister is not hurting him directly, but you are getting along with the way her life is going or you have to take responsibility.  What happens many times is that you have to take the responsibility of that person, so in that way it means outside in a way, in the same way if it is the place of mother in the fourth house, then mother is seen having bone problems a lot, which also  You are sitting with the fourth Saturn, tell me, there will be some issues like arthritis, osteoarthritis or many times the relationship with the mother will be cold there.  You will suffer because of that house, the construction of your house may get delayed, although a lot of things are constructed, I will tell you about it in a positive way, a lot happens in Saturn, I will not complicate it, who is looking at whom, who is eating whose zodiac sign, go to that and predict. We can do that but right now we are learning A for apple B for ball then Rohit is a good boy sentences will be made later we will go to Past Perfect Continuous later right now we are learning here that Saturn is in the fourth house so you guys have  I have learnt that brother, you may have some pain from there, heart is also included in it, you have reached an age from there also, there can be issues from there also, take a significant part of that house, you will find some issue there.  If we go to the fifth house, if the fifth house is of children then either the children will be delayed or there will be suffering from the children, there can be a disruptive love relationship, there can be a lot of romance as well, Saturn in the fifth means that they must have had a breakup and they cry very badly. if they have it, either they do not have a romantic relationship and  If it happens then they cry a lot in big heartbreak, they will keep crying that my wife is gone, my man is gone, in such cases it is okay to look into it, there are many digestive issues also, they have digestion issues, Saturn five is fine, fifth house has issues, Saturn sixth house  If Saturn goes to the sixth house because the house itself is like that, then maybe it will be a little negative but still you will face some trouble in the work place, from there you will face trouble in getting a loan, there may be a delay in taking a loan, its significance  You can get pain from your maternal uncle too, who is not a close family these days. Your mother's maternal uncle's younger siblings are also in the sixth house. Your maternal uncle's younger siblings are also there. You can find out about that maternal uncle's family.  You can also get it from this, you can see this, you can check and tell yourself from where is the shade coming, where is it coming from so that we can extrapolate it, I have the initial two- three shades now  Even the umbrella is seen in the house, that is extreme astrology which is the last point till here  this this this this so now if they start saying this 50 for each one then the 50th is the umbrella, okay so now how can there be any pain due to the umbrella, yes there too there will be some issue, prediction is very strong But I am dealing with it in simplicity right from the beginning that you will get it in this, otherwise you tell me where it is, okay, the seventh house, everybody knows that it is the seventh house of the husband and the wife, so Saturn in the seventh house will be a cold matter, that relationship will be cold.  It goes that wherever Saturn is sitting, it will make that relationship cold due to any reason, if there is a relationship then there is no warmth, now if it is someone's wife or husband, if Saturn is in the seventh house then that person's relationship with the spouse will be cold, but what is the relationship?  What is Saturn, if it does not break then the marriage will not break, what does Saturn do, it delays, denial, that is a good thing, it delays and things get right for those who have patience, so I will tell you one remedy for it here while we are on our way, from where  Are you feeling pain too, pain is bound to come Saturn is definitely going to come, he is holding everything somewhere, you have to surrender from that aspect, that pain is going to come and you have to have patience, the moment you will have the feeling of surrender where Saturn is and patience, your pain will end at 90, this is my  I promise, what a lovely remedy I have told you, in what a lovely way I am teaching astrology, there is no need to go anywhere and spend a lot of money on consultation, I am telling you myself, there is pain because everyone is carrying Saturn, who can run away, no one can run away  In the seventh house, now we come to the eighth house, the eighth house anyway belongs to the in-laws, so Saturn in the eighth house means relations with in-laws are cold, eighth house also deals with inheritance, so Saturn in the eighth house means parents will live longer, inheritance will get delayed and if the parents Not much delay means if due to some reason brother's inheritance is delayed or else there will be a court case with brother and sister also because inheritance is delayed then a good reason for inheritance delay can be that  If your parents are living for so many years, what will you get, if they are living for 90, 95, 100 years, then that is a good thing, then delay, someone or the other will cause pain there, okay, or you will suffer according to the eighth house  It is okay to check, I have seen researches also because if Saturn is in the eighth position and you start learning astrology or get involved in research in any thing, then you are only suffering because you are getting inside but this is a good thing.  There is pain, I keep giving small ideas in each one, wherever I get remedies, okay, wherever Saturn is there we have to be humilated or we will be made humid or if we lie down, then Saturn is fifth and fourth, which means Mata ji is lying down  It may happen to you or it may be that you become a cunning child and do them, this is the rule of a ritual, you have to bury yourself in this, if mother is doing it then take it, you know why it is happening friend, where Saturn is there, there is humiliation in the fifth house.  If I am there then there is going to be humiliation, the kids will humiliate me or the kids will fail or the kids will do something like this  that he will have to face humiliation, so this is a law of the system, with Saturn in the seventh house, if you look at it, he gets elevated, but brother will not leave his work, no matter how he gets elevated, he will do it, he will do it a little bit, okay now Saturn goes into the ninth house. Look, do not take stress, to be happy in astrology, first of all there should be joy in life, wherever you look at yourself, look at others, this is a Saturn technique, I am telling you a simple technique, you normally say 100 on 25 charts, but try it on 25 charts And make notes, it will work amazingly and then when it works you will realize that friend, I keep telling you in between, first thing is acceptance, second thing is surrender, the pain ends at 90, you can bear it at 10, okay so Saturn is ninth  If you go to the house, you may get pain from father but there is one more thing about father in Saturn, if you surrender there to father then no one will be there, you will serve him, if you start serving wherever Saturn is, Saturn is third Younger siblings serve in the house in fourth  Service to mother in the fifth, service to children in the seventh, service to wife in the eighth and if you surrender then the humility will automatically reduce, if someone is doing service then he will get friend but that will be reduced considerably, same work should be done in the ninth house.  We will have to understand what Saturn has to do with it, it is a pain and it means pain, I said pain or sorry pain, where will that pain come from, doing someone's work is also a pain and effort, isn't it? Saturn is a factor of effort as well, so basically you  You can use one more word that you will have to make an effort, it will be challenging there, father can attack or you can meet father, it will also be seen that it is related to religion also, Saturn will be there, so you will get your support from religion also. The ridge will be high, it can be a good thing or a bad thing for any religion, beyond that if Rahu and Mars do not come then it is good because if they come then you can go towards fanaticism.  So we will keep it simple for now, okay, only Saturn is visible, okay, so ninth house  Saturn is in my horoscope, there can be a delay in higher education because Saturn is also a factor of delay, you know that formula has to be applied everywhere because Dispiter starts with D, delay also starts with D, whenever there is some delay in life, Dispiter is late.  The flight is running, you reached late, you got something late, the food order came late, if it is disruptive then accept it, first of all, Saturn is in the seventh house, the marriage is getting delayed, so brother, you tell me that I have been waiting for 23 years  If I want to get married then your reference point is 23 years, if there has to be a delay then it will happen by 28, you will say I will definitely do it at 28, then brother it will happen at 33 because the delay is from reference point, see how much I am not enough for free  I am giving it to you, it seems to me that I am teaching simple astrology as well as New astrology, it's all a game of your mind, I want to get married at 24, my Saturn is in the house, it is 24, I did not get married, I am 25  what happened  If the marriage has not happened then it is happening and it is coming to fruition because if you had to do it at 23 then it will happen at 28, it is not that bad at 28, okay it is delayed as per your requirement but then it is according to the society  It is okay, so this is how Saturn works in the 10th house, Saturn in the tenth house will bring you humiliation at the work place, whoever sits with you will get forced humiliation, if there is the best scenario then it will be that you will not be humiliated, but you will not get fame either in the tenth house and  If you look at the work also, if you look at it, the tenth house in Kaal Purush's horoscope is the sign of Saturn, so that way it should not be bad and it is not bad also, but brother, the theory that I am following, the formula that I am teaching, that is  Saturn will work, it is not bad, it is fine but it will work, there will be many benefits in every thing that I have told, there are many benefits in each one, Saturn is in the seventh house, but if we tell you according to the house, then Saturn is in the tenth house in his Kaal Purush's horoscope.  so it no but this  That someone or the other will humiliate you, there will be some delay, there will be some delay in fame, something or the other will work out, you will get a delay in your life, Saturn will come intermittently, it will be late, Disputer is nowhere if you are sitting with Saturn 10 and you  You deserve the fame, it will be delayed but not denied, so we will not mind Saturn that much, whatever Saturn gives you, brother, it gives you something solid, if you mean something like that then you can touch it, it is not air and Rahu's  He gave it and then went away Saturn means it is moment by moment whatever you will get, you will get it due to your hard work not due to luck you will get it due to your hard work and you will definitely get it, there may be a delay but you will definitely get it, so have patience wherever you are, the opinion of Saturn is 11  Again, if it is the zodiac sign of Saturn, it does not mean that the person does not earn money. People with Saturn in 11 earn a lot but many times it happens that you did the work today and got the money after 10 months. There are many such people, I am also one of them.  the works which i do that  It remains that if you worked today, you get the money after 10 months, 12 months or sometimes after 14 months. But now what happens is that if you worked in January, you got the money in December; if you worked in February, you got the money in the next January; if you worked in March, you got the money in December.  You got it in the next March but then you completed that one cycle so you are getting it every month, you understand, you are getting it every month, so this is the delayed cycle that the payments get delayed but you keep working since you keep working.  If the work keeps happening regularly, whether you are getting the money regularly or that money is coming, then you are sitting with it, do it this way and this will happen with you, surrender a little, accept it, do not get irritated, what many people say that I  If I worked today, I will get the money after 10 months, then what is the use of doing some other work that I do it today, hey brother, work today, you will get it after 10 months, whoever works after a month will get it after that, then the cycle of flow will be formed, right?  You learn things from this simple astrology, okay now come the good Saturn  In 11th house you will have a larger network, front circle, you will get some problem or lesson from there also, in this way there is an elder brother as well as an elder sibling, so just like we told about younger sibling, you can also suffer from elder sibling as well.  It is okay in this case, now let's come to Saturn in the 12th house, Saturn in the 12th house, again if it is your bedroom life, then there is a human there, I understand that you may have performance issues, you are not a human, sex is not that easy for you but it is important  No, that means you should do 100% workout and many things happen that people mean there can be ifs and buts in it but your sex life will become cold now it is because of your shortcomings it is because of your spouse or because of differences  It is because of living in different places, your posting and reasons will be 150, so I am not saying that the meaning of Shani Bav house means that brother, you have some deficiency, you have some weakness, it is premature ejaculation, such thing  what am I not doing many times  There are many things which a person feels while telling that if I have told them then no, it is not like that, everything is fit, everything is good but there is some delay, okay, it does not mean that much, it can happen due to disruption, you have to use your imagination in human mind because  The things that are written in shlokas or rules are just statements, they can play out in a thousand ways, one should not grasp it immediately. By the way, many people do not need Saturn in the 12th house, it also happens in the mind.  If it is not done then this can also happen, so all these things are our own techniques, you see how for everything there is some remedy or treatment, for many things, so I have told you first of all, I have told you to accept it, even after that all that is there now  Things can be taught one on one, they are taught in paid courses, they are taught everywhere, it becomes very big, every thing means it is of two hours, one does not watch two-hour videos, then there is a feeling of devotion towards learning  it happens in a structured way but some of the issues will be worked out like this okay and you  I made a complete video, I gave a lot, the paid one is fine and now a good student can derive many formulas from this, how many formulas by doing higher order thinking that this will happen, that will happen and after seeing it, hold 25 Kundalis which you know  You don't have to go and ask the people whose life you are in, how is your program? You have an idea about the scene. So, as per the Kundali, if a marital issue has come up in Saturn's house, tell me, there is an issue in sex life, yes, it does n't matter, we will do it.  Okay, do this one like this, you do this, what do you do, it seems a bit difficult to tell everything at once, why I don't tell is because there is also an astrologer code, there are so many people who are making a living on astrology for me to become  Come to Cheap Popular and make everything 100% free, my subscribers will increase, I am a great man, I don't want to become a Sarpanch, nor do I want to become an MP, nor an MLA, I don't want votes, nor do I want to be Cheap Popular, my work goes better than other things, so Thatchi Community  to me  He said that friend why are you doing this, you can earn money from there, you are kicking us in the stomach, very right, that's when my Numol ji's videos stopped, you guys must have seen them a lot on youtube3, number seven, number eight, number four, number three.  After that they stopped, there were five issues left, people said when will it come, it will not come, it will never come, it is okay because everything was taken out and put into it, it cannot be made again, if such films are made at that level then many people will be hit hard  So still as easily as I can put curiosity in you, this is like primary school of astrology, yes we can take you, I can take you to PhD level, also but then at PhD level, confusion occurs in the beginning, so join yours first, if you  Whatever I am telling you is working in your life as I taught you, only then will you develop faith, you will enjoy it, only then will you have the confidence that yes, something is happening, take it straight to Ashtak work, take it to Mahadasha, take it here, take it there  Then go to Navamsha and take the big D60 predictions peacefully  A for Apple B for Boy, this is how things are learned gradually, so stay connected here for a while, if you want to see better and in-the-way technical content, then take the membership of the channel, many videos have been uploaded there, many of our workshops You can take membership of the channel which has videos and one more thing is very important, I have a course of about 12 classes of two hours each, Sango Saral Jyotish and discounts are also available on it, if someone has some Rakhi, then you must check it.

    "content": "Hello friends, simple astrology is a very lovely topic. This is the way I am approaching astrology in a simple and touching way. Very good feedback is coming in. The subscribers of the channel may be less now but I feel that it will increase in the future.  It is necessary and I request you all from the beginning, if you are watching this video in A-forward mode, then please subscribe because I tell things in a different way here and those who have subscribed, brother, two. Add subscribers, you will get a lot of motivation to bring such videos quickly, so let's start the topic is food, food is fine, we will link happiness and astrology and if there is any trouble in your life because of this, then maybe it will reduce then food is good.  Let's talk a lot about the combinations in the horoscope, two or three, I will tell you, check yourself that whenever that person eats, there will be trouble, you should also check, I will tell, two, three, I will tell, there are many more and if you have experience.  By doing this, the woman will struggle, but before telling about that commotion, let me tell you one thing in general, when the husband eats food, if the wife struggles, then 10 years of her life is reduced, it is reduced by 10 years. Now how will this be known because two You can't do it twice, you have two salty husbands, one has troubles and the other doesn't, one lived more and the other lived less, this can't happen, there is only one husband, everyone is fine and there is no  Alternative Story: Either you do it or you don't do it. Okay, so what do women normally do? They remain busy during the day, something happens to them, mother-in-law said something, children said something, her own desires, husband's 10 demands, there were programs, so the rules were  According to this, the husband should be spared 10 minutes before eating and 10 minutes after eating. If he eats for 10 minutes and eats for 10, 12, 15 minutes, then this is half an hour.  You can easily give it to all the women, I am telling all the husbands to forward it and the wives also listen a lot and do all this astrology etc. So please note down yours somewhere. What is normal when the wife screams and does something? The husband runs away.  When he goes, his wife thinks that he is eating, where will he run now? You did this today, you did this, this becomes poison. Those who have Scorpio Ascendant, check, this is happening with you only, those who have Scorpio Moon, check. Do it, it is happening to you and if this is happening to you or if you are in trouble then trouble will remain, check whether Moon is Moon in 8th house, Moon in Scorpio or Ascendant Scorpio Rising, so this is what I told you and also  There is a lot of communication, Saturn is sitting inside your second house, food is getting cold, your Moon is sitting in the sixth house or in Vargo sign, check all of you, tell me whose is which.  If your Moon is in the sixth house or is in the sixth sign, then you do not get the food you want, are you sitting with a lot of money, will you go to a hotel or what food will these people not be able to enjoy according to them.  It will not be cooked or the person making it will cause trouble. That is the experience of food, they will be deprived of it and nothing will happen. So you are wanting someone to sit and eat food with me and talk to me nicely about that experience. be deprived  You will go and they will be eating food, this is also seen a lot because sometimes you want to talk to someone while eating, have a nice talk, this is the desire of every human being, not of these people, it is the desire of every human being to have a complete house. That house is heaven, being rich is not money, that's why it is said that money cannot buy happiness, because people do not know these things, people have no idea about these small things, food should be the top most thing in  Anybody  Life, you are your boss in the office, tell him your troubles brother, because what is theirs, what I told you are combi combos, their boss will not let you live, a message will come from the office, a call will come, you will have to make a ritual for eating food that is exactly the same as you have ever seen.  By the way, some people eat water while sitting, some with sticks, some can't do it now, then increase the importance of food so much and tell the world that your food causes digestive ulcers and you do n't know what is true and false. Tell them that it is very important for you.  It is important to eat food in moderation, otherwise people will not even let you eat. Youngsters are compromising so much that they leave within a minute of eating. If someone gets angry, they leave. Hey, this whole game of money is happening just for the sake of eating.  God's nature has not created us to do this coding, it is just that eat, take care of your body, reproduce and if life continues then there is bread, clothes and house. First of all, there is food, then there is clothes, then there is house, then there are people, then there is car. Coding.  Ghoomi Ghoomi Investment there, here, here, this is your roti, it is not set, no, you do not get the roti, but are you getting happiness in the roti, are you getting happiness in the roti? So brother, different, okay, these are the combos that I have mentioned, which one half of the family has.  We will meet because what is there in the family, brother, there are four people, husband, wife, two children, someone will get something, then everyone has issues, so now if you cannot go and check them, then you have to take care of them as a remedy. That I don't have to do this thing anymore, I don't have to do this mess, it's a tradition in my house, brother, come on, I have to calm down, I have to calm down at that time, it is your husband, where will he go to escape, okay then?  It is not the case that husbands also do something, but what is normal is that wives do more, which has been seen in practice. Because wives do more, I have 90 but the blame is on the wives, the blame is on the women, they do not have to eat. You have made it only after working hard, why are you making it poison by causing trouble and if your mood is not so good then don't cook food, Sugi Jumato will do it, we will cook the food ourselves. If you cannot feed it with love, then there is no need to cook it.  If you can't keep the environment right during messages and meal time, then all your job promotion, sexiness and everything has gone to waste. I have seen in Marwar that big families, whether rich or not, are very big on food.  I have seen in business families, I have gone for Vaastu, I have gone for consultation, for everything. When I have gone, I have seen this thing, treat it very much. In a house where there will be so many maids, so many cooks, everyone will be there, even then the women of the house will be minimum.  She will make one or two items a day for her family, this is also a big thing because no matter how big the family is, a woman will make something and I am not saying this here by making it sexist and feminist and if a man also wants to make then here  The man of the house should make one thing and if nothing else, drink tea of ​​his wife's own hands, this is also a very big one, these are the issues of the moon, these are the issues of the mind, these are the issues of happiness, which is directly connected to your happiness, which is the moon.  Moon is there, it is the factor of your mind, it is the factor of food, it is the factor of your happiness, it is the factor of your mother, treat the food with such intensity, your fourth house, your happiness house, your peace, your mind will keep everything good, three times meals.  have a plan  They look forward for them and not just like that, I ate anything while walking, I saw people take pride, I take five minutes to eat, then which one does great work, then which one, because of your work, India and China are left behind.  He will leave in 5 years, in 2 years he has become tired, will you be great, will your organization be great, will you be great, hey, the man who cannot spare 20 minutes to eat one meal at a time, has to eat food in vain.  You should have papad, some salad, some pickle, some raita, some roti, some balanced mille, I am saying roughage, some buttermilk, some jaggery. Are you taking interest in the items I told you? It is very easy but the effort is missing. It seems that what is missing is the roti.  Eat like this, eat cold, it's okay, you didn't pay attention, when you don't pay attention, then in old age you have to pay a lot of attention, then teeth and intestines are no longer like that, then life comes out in frustration, not like that in youth.  Got the pleasure of eating. In old age, food is not being eaten in the same way because you have made your body like this. The biggest success is that even at the age of 80 or 85, you can eat as per your wish, you can digest it, even if not much, if only a little, then it is the biggest.  Take care, share this thing, like this video and subscribe to the channel, you can also take membership of the channel, you will get astrology group egramswaraj.gov.in, you will get many recordings of very good things.  I do n't want to do any advertising, just watch the videos like this, there are many videos, you will get to learn a lot, try it once for one and a half month, you will enjoy it, after that you also get some discounts etc. There are some courses etc. Astrology  On a different level, on a professional level, you want to learn other wise, who is enjoying at this level, then keep enjoying, these are natural practical things, don't spoil your  If the moon is affecting your food, then the moon is spoiled. There is no need to ask anyone whether my moon is bad or not. There is no need to ask like this, it is visible that your man cannot eat food comfortably and This unfortunately seems like a trend to me, the boss himself is bad, he is complaining about all the employees, the wife will complain about him going to the house and in the morning he complained about the breakfast, the wife came to him. Every person in the office sows poison, they are saying, what is there in positivity, whatever is there in positivity, it is like plowing with poison, it means it should not be planted, we have to stop it and this is a big issue.  People say no no food should not be an issue no food should be the biggest issue in every family and I have seen it in successful rich happy families that way  Food is treated. The approach to food is treated. Where will the vegetables come from, who will cut them, what will be the hygiene, how will the kitchen be? This is a process. It went to some stage and because of feminism, because women were in charge, it was made a very trivial thing that what is any food?  So anyone can do it, but people are not happy, you have achieved a great post, you have gone to many places, then what have you uprooted, you still don't eat the food properly, you don't eat what you feel like eating.  If the food does not satisfy you like this, then that means your process is something, the way you are eating is the way you are eating, so if you want clarity on that too, then I will make such videos in future videos.  If you want then please write in the comment section. Thank you very much."

    "content": "Hello friends, the video on whom should I marry on my another channel was very good, now I will tell you astrologically how you should find your life partner, okay people do a lot of horoscope matching and all this but I will tell you in a slightly different way.  If you enjoyed then tell me that you enjoyed it because this Sango is simple astrology. I am giving you the fun of practical astrology in an easy way. Let's start here, what do normal people do, be it a boy or a girl, in your mind. social  According to the status, according to their desires or whatever the reasoning may be, they make a dream that my boy, my girl will be like this whom I will marry or the boy whom I will marry will be like this and they keep searching for them in life, although perhaps they do not find them.  Or marriages are not possible with them or they are not able to understand and there is a lot of confusion and then they meet someone and come to get their horoscope matched, brother, how is this and there is only confirmation in it, basically they have to get it done.  Is there any Pandit, any red flag, Pandit ji, by the way, I got an astrologer, it is not necessary that every astrologer is a Pandit ji, then you will go to an astrologer, the astrologer will raise some red flags, saying some things, some they do n't want to hear because you want to marry them, so the confirmation is somewhere in the mouse.  If you go then you will say, sir, I have 18 gunas, 20 gunas is also fine, 28 gunas is fine, and people are a loose man, no marriage even in 32 gunas.  It works and all that is also fine, that is fine but I want you to approach me as per my opinion, it will be very beneficial, how about you go to a good store, I also consider myself good and show me your horoscope and your Make a sketch of a character from the horoscope. The same person of your future spouse is the best for you. Like they don't say character sketch like the one we have seen, the policemen make it like we see in movies or web series.  Hand They had seen what kind of nose she has, how it is, no, no, it was not like that, well, it is like this, so this sketch is like that of the girl who is opposite to you, you have to understand that whatever your passion is, it is different from her. Opposite is Lagan, it will complete you and it is a little different. Look at any Lagan, if your zodiac sign is Cancer then the sign of it is 4, its opposite will be 10. Now 10 is Capricorn, it is the sign of Saturn, so where is Moon.  And where Saturn will be a little bit, then you have to see that it is of 10, so now I am telling it only from the zodiac sign, the flavor of the planet also seems that it will be a little Saturn based, it will be hardworking, it will be hard working, it may be stocky, it is possible that your  It may not be very fair as per the calculations or are you understanding that now which zodiac sign is it, which are the planets, which are your planets, but the fact is that a very good character sketch can be drawn that yes, this is someone's Father-in-law, her father will come from such a family which will be a government type element, that is, there will not be much money but respect and society, he will have a middle class type job, the girl will not be very tall but may be like this, she or her association will be someone with education.  The environment will be there whether it is the daughter of the professor or her father or the environment of the student. See, every one of us has the same environment. Like if any person comes from a business family then there is a different environment. If a person comes from a government service, he has a different environment. If someone comes from a teaching or education system, he has a different environment. If someone comes from a farmer's family, he has a different environment. Just like your spouse is different from the environment.  That environment comes, by the way, it will be very big on that, from which region will it come from the Dutch state, will it come from below, will come from above, come on, if you are from Delhi, no, yours is from far away from below.  If you feel like it then you start mentally searching for something like that, then what happens is that you make a character sketch, you write seven or eight points in it in broad strokes, as soon as you see someone in real life where you can talk about it, then see, brother, this is your For the best, if for you it is written that you are a little round and fat husband and happy go lucky, then for him, six pack abs and that jaw line is very like that and the hair is flying like this, find the item with that type because it is the same.  Only your beloved will keep you happy, right? Or is there a girl whose standards of beauty are normally conventional? Because look, there is a lot of English proverb, I completely believe that beauty lies in the eyes of the bearer, right? Beauty happens according to who is looking and with what eyes. It is okay, but if you get a little idea then you will become a little realistic. Marriages happen only when you become realistic.  Yes or if you say it in Hindi then the tantrums are reduced, many boys and girls are roaming around with tantrums, that's it, you are roaming around with a salary of Rs 40000, the one with Rs 2.5 lakhs, the ones with Rs 2.5 lakhs are already booked when they are 1.25  When they were paying lakhs, that east facing park facing plot was already taken, now it is two and a half rupees, that means you have to demolish their house and book it again, that is, do you want to buy it for resale, okay, I will talk a little like this.  I use it a little, this is only for comedy, people should not take it a little seriously, sometimes you can make jokes even in astrology channel, okay, so it has to be seen that you have to be realistic, with a salary of Rs 40,000. Why can't a girl marry a boy with Rs 600? Is it a compulsion that I will give you Rs 5 or Rs 10? He will not value you, he will say leave my salary of Rs 2 lakh.  I will not give you Rs 40,000. The one with Rs 60,000 will respect your Rs 40 very much because both are not in the tax lab. The one with Rs 2 lakh is in the tax lab. The one with Rs 60 and Rs 40 will not pay even a single tax. Both of them will save tax.  You have to understand again that who knows if he is a stable boy, then you will know that I will marry this spouse, it is your character sketch that will emerge in his life.  The spouse will be a wanderer, that is, he will not stay at one place, his job will take him from here to there, then you start getting hints that perhaps he is not in a government job, he is not somewhere like this, so can you do a little of that with him?  Let's tailor-mate your search and reduce its bandwidth to a small extent. When you do this, marriages take place only when you have kept it complete. Well, girls have a lot of choice, the girl is an engineer.  From  From doctor to businessman to young to old to rich, it can be done by anyone. Boys' choices are limited because if a boy does something in a particular way, then he will get some system only in a particular way, but girls have  Open yourself completely, that bandwidth has been fully opened. Okay, so let's go to the character sketch for a little help. This is called a pen picture. Apart from the character sketch, there is also a pen picture that what kind of person will be, how will the family be, about the mother-in-law.  In  If you can know about your father-in-law, then a pain picture of the family can also be made. How will you have a relationship with your brother-in-law and what is your sister-in- law called? Whatever second masculine or feminine gender you use with your brother-in-law.  You will know how the calculation will be done, then when you will match in that real life, you will see a little template, it is the same again, now there may be some mistake in it, some small thing, some work is not perfect, it is not done everywhere.  You have to accept that yes this is my destiny and or I have found my match and only that person will complete you. It may be that your nature is a little serious type and if you find a flirtatious husband or a flirtatious wife because only then will you be complete.  If these two boring people collide and that too, if you give birth to very boring children then you will definitely get a little bit of opposition because if you look at any of the houses, they are always there.  Opposite is always there, whenever it remains like this, it is a good trick, good video, it works well, that is, very good knowledge given, Brahm, this is the video of Abhijeet's time, okay, it will work well for marriage, anyone, you see, there will be opposite, like the zodiac sign is Leo.  If the opposite of Sin is Aquarius, then Saturn's zodiac sign is opposite to Sun, then you know how it is with Saturn, so you have to get some opposition, only that will complete you.  So don't run away, there is no fun even doing it on your own. You won't get the feeling of complete happiness. Don't run away from fight, argument and don't find perfect perfection. Then you won't taste it. You won't enjoy it. A little bit is needed, so I hope this gave you a little idea.  Details on this, we will have to do a workshop sometime, we will plan that too, in the comment section. If you want to join a simple astrology webinar group, then join, thank you very much.  mach h"
