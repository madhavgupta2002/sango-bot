    "title": "02 Lessons For All Gurgaon Real Estate Investors From Two Recent Launches [Fg5McFEn7nE].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, in the two lessons learnt for everybody, we will all learn two things from the two latches. You tell me, had you bought in these two latches? Recently, allotment has been done of two projects. Which projects of Gurgaon are you?  Tell me, one had 225 units and the other had around 1300 units. Both are superhit projects but what are the lessons learned? Did some people make mistakes? Those who got the option of choice in both these projects, they got any one and  They did not take this option, that is why I am telling you this first lesson because they did not like the unit, that is the biggest mistake that they made. Yes, I will tell you how and why you people did it, phase three of a project was its first launch  This launch happened at 6500 sometime, the second one happened at 83 something but I am telling you according to the super area per square feet and the current one happened between 11 11:30 12 so whatever happened earlier also  I had left it at Rs. 630 saying that this unit does not seem to be a good one to me, I just checked the rates, in one and a half years it has become Rs. 11-12,000 and today those who left it at Rs. 1112, that project, brother, there are still two phases left, it will come at Rs. 1314 and the last one after that  If it comes at 1617, is it a bad unit in your eyes? Could you have bought it for 11 or 11:30? Brothers and sisters, no, but I don't live here, I don't enjoy it. My wife refused, so what? The rate was increasing anyway.  After that we would have limited the exchange program, there are two types of people, I am trying to explain, the lesson learned, the same story played out on the other also people sat, luckily their priority number was there, such UI was given on time, everything was fine  I do n't like this one, oh I don't like it, a worst unit of a project and a best unit of a project, can there be a 100% difference between them in the coming time, can you tell me brothers and sisters, a  The unit is being sold for Rs 3 crore and the other similar unit, the so-called bad unit, is being sold for Rs 1.5 crore. This cannot happen. Even today, the difference will not be more than the difference in PLC, but it can definitely be in the absolute amount in percentage, brother.  If you had paid ₹ one lakh more for this unit, then even after 10 years you would have got ₹ one lakh more, but at that time, as a percentage, today it was probably at 7, 8, 10, at that time it was only at 3 per 2, and when it increases, this  I have made a lot of mistakes, it should not matter to the investor at all because just like some people like chana bhatura, some like dosa, some like pap chadi, what sin, I am saying papdi and chaat, okay, so every person can be found as a tenant  Everyone can be found, the sunlight comes less, it comes more, it is above, it is below, it is green facing, it is outside, Sanu, do you know the difference, half the people in India don't open their curtains, no matter where you live, even if they are sea facing, do not open them.  I am telling you with a practical example, half the people and half of them need it, so what I am trying to say is that you can get a tenant for each unit, if you are an investor and the choice is also yours, now I will tell you as an example, there was someone  Our customers are from Punjab, we wanted only lower floor, but were not getting lower floor, their turn came, even then they are getting on rent, they are not taking us on rent, we do n't like it, so we found out and asked them if they want to stay there, we don't want to stay there  You live in Firozpur in Punjab and you are from Punjab, very good and you like low floor, very good, then you do not want to live there. Do you think that in Gurgaon no one wants to live in a high rise on the high floor, then this high  Why are everyone building rises, take it, live in the rise, no, but we don't like it. Hey, you don't like it, but many people here like it. I like golgappas. I like these burger, veg burger, tikki ones, I don't like the potato ones.  But this means that if I have  I want to open a ready business, I want to open it somewhere, I want to open it somewhere in front of a college, I want to open it somewhere in the afternoon, those kids will eat snacks, who eats golgappas in the afternoon, okay, I cannot open golag, this is the thing that as an investor, you have to find out your  Choice P Now suppose I buy shares of ITC then do you do I need to be a smoker if I do n't smoke cigarettes I don't smoke cigarettes so can I not buy shares of ITC if I don't drink alcohol can I buy shares of United  I cannot buy shares of Burundi. I am not asking you to buy them. I am just telling you that maybe I get my house painted with Lex and I buy shares of Asian Paints. How does it make a difference? When will you think about that as an investor? This is the biggest first lesson which I keep telling people again and again as an example, if I myself like cars, let's cut Innova and it's okay, then can't I buy Dzire, even if I don't want to drive it as a taxi, I will not buy Dzire.  I do n't like it, you have to drive  No, the taxi runs very well because its maintenance is relatively low, the mileage is very high, servicing is also available because there is no need to travel in it, it has to be done from one place to another and the pricing per kilometer in it can be one Reduce the price by 2 rupees and the customer also benefits, you also benefit, it's all fun, so taking these practical examples, I am telling you people that a big mistake has been made here, which was missed because I don't like everything that you  I don't like it, it is like if the rate of gold is increasing, you don't like this set and you don't have any other set and the rate of gold is going to increase, then take it and exchange it later, brother, in buying another unit by selling your unit  There will be a brokerage of 1 per cent for selling one and 1 per cent for buying, so it is only 2 per cent, right? So if it is from Rs. 6500, as I told you, that product which was launched in Phases, which had 225 units, brother, the difference is only 2 per cent. You read it but the rate there is almost  If it has doubled or not then you tell me and we will keep moving forward, so if your so called unit was not that good, then you settled in the society, later groups are formed, someone or the other sells his  If you sell it, it becomes an equal deal, at least you took the ride, your money got spent at 20-30 rupees there and the rate has increased by 56,000 feet, that 6000 feet, brothers and sisters, if you multiply it by 1800 square feet, then it becomes 1 crore.  From where will you get 20 lakhs which you left for a small thing, to get 1 crore 20 lakhs more means you will have to earn 2 crores, the rest will go in taxes and out of that not even 20 is left, if you earn 00 then your savings will not be 0  Maybe 2030 goes in tax, out of the 70 that is left, see how much is the saving, so brother, the increase of one crore and a lakh or one crore and 10 lakh rupees is done by saving that, you will get the benefit of that.  It will take 1215 years this is when you earn a good amount of money so on a small thing that I am not liking this facing you have asked a question because once these tantrums happen in the beginning when the DTC bus comes  From Delhi to Chandigarh, when the man is sitting at the bus stand, he starts throwing a big tantrum, I want this seat, I want that seat, I want the front seat, I want this one, by the time we reach Karnal bypass, brother, if you are catching it from there, then you will find Jan  I would have gone and sat on that side, oh I got a seat, it doesn't make any difference, you can see in the bus, those who used to sit after making a lot of planning, I will sit here after making better planning, that's how it will be, then some uncle comes and sits like a Bhundha  I will tell you, we use a strange word here, it is called beedi beera and then you tell him that brother why are you smoking beedi, turn your face away and then start fighting with him  It is not allowed, you should teach him the law, smoking in public is not right  yes that is not right and everybody is looking at you with that detention this has happened to you brothers and sisters I am a practical example so you had done a lot of planning okay this one has been settled next that one later what will you do then  there are a lot of these tasks, okay so much, when the plane takes off, then all the seats become the same, before that the tantrums of this one, this one, that one, they reach on time, so whatever project you have, if  This theory which I am telling you, this first mistake is getting a bit long, I will tell you the second one as well, I am telling you this theory, you have to test it so what should you do, you go to any assisting project, in a normal middle class project, I will not tell you any  I will not tell you to go to Camellia where games of 100-10000 crores are played, those games are different, different formulas work there, I am telling you that too, but go to a normal project, any normal middle class project from where you can earn between 1.5 to 2.5 CR.  The old society is like a rock Pick up 50, it comes out, go to sector 56 in Gurgaon or any society there, you can go there and ask how much variation is there in the price and secondly in the rent, you will see that rent will vary on what work you have done in the apartment  How is the wood work, how is the furnishing, is it fully furnished, is it semi furnished, how is the cleanliness, how is the paint, how is the feel, rent will vary in that too, cross the limit, doti 4 5 000, doti 4 5 6000 depending on whether the rent is 40000 or 70000, bracket of 40 to 70000 Even in the rent of Rs. 4-5000, he can't pay more than that, that too when what have you done inside, make a difference, so it does make a difference, please do this due diligence, go to assisting societies and see how much difference is there And people have to wonder how much difference there was between the original and the upcoming products. Be smarter, the second thing that people made a mistake is that some people were lax and did not give the OI on time. If you have interest, then you will benefit only by giving the Expression of Interest on time. And even if you do not understand that money, then 5 lakh, 10 lakh, 15 lakh Rp one and a half, two, three months, cross the limit, now you will say three months can also be done, cross the limit, otherwise it will come within a month, earlier in Haryana there used to be Hooda draw plots for six months, for six months there was no draw, there used to be money and the draw  Even after this, it used to take a month or two for the money to come, so at that time the money would remain stuck for six to eight months, a lot of money used to be lost at that time as well, due to the inflation of that time, a lot of people used to lose money, so now  So you do not have any choice at all, this is the way it is going to be, so if a product is coming, you will never fully understand it when you are being told that you will have to take a broad decision that brother, in this budget  It is inside I don't know the rough exact rate, okay and  Like these two projects had come up, the second big project which had around 1314 units in Gurgaon real estate, even the layouts were revealed in the last two days, one and a half days ago and the IT layout was like a CBSE exam paper.  Meaning, it is opening and allotment is being done, I don't know how long ago it came, I mean, just like you kids get it these days to read the paper, I got it just like that because I know that it came on first day, first show, first off.  Was there okay first, I mean the line started from there like this so I was aware that friend this and that, I am telling you a tricky personal experience unit when there is something left of yours and you have to choose, man uses his brain friend  Which place is the most stressed about? I personally go through this stress when, bhai sahib, you sit at the table and everything is open, you can take whatever you want, meaning whatever you put your hands on is yours because you are number one, okay  There is more tension in it that which one should I take or this one  But this PLC is going too much, this one is there in it but everything is available, in fact when there is a choice, in my opinion, then decision making becomes better, when there are more choices, then I saw this problem in it.  Have you ever felt this, has it happened to you that you are getting everything, oh I am getting everything, I will buy it now, now I don't know how much the stuff will sell, it will sell quickly and that is after that you are like that it got sold well  All of it got sold out, completely sold out, this one also got sold out, then you are seeing the situation with your own eyes like a cricket match, after taking your unit, oh this one is gone, all of it, good, there is a lot of demand in it, good, good, the tower itself  It's out oh ho very good very good well the second one also aha ha ha ha after that the fun begins the fun isn't like I first invest in that project in which the whole world has taken everything now I have nothing at all but  Now I will invest for you. There is no builder who will buy the unit that you liked, sir. We still have it for you.  I have held it, you are the best person, we like you so much, respect you so much, no one can belong to anyone, you will decide later, when all the units are sold, then you will come to the end like Azim Shaan Shahenshah, come on now I I give money, it should not be like this, a leap of faith, one has to go through some stress factor in decision making, only then one can earn money, it is not like that you sit like a laat sahab and the price is also good, the unit is also good, decision making is also easy, the wife also likes it  The money came, the bank balance was also settled, everything does not happen like this, no matter how much property someone has bought, whatever it is, there is a little doubt and it remains like this always, many have more, many have less, here I have less. And teach people how to take all these decisions and how to go through those emotions, there are lots of emotions, 40-50 those counters are open, all the people are sitting, push hard, take this one like this, it is okay, let's hold on for 5 minutes.  I do not want to tell you to take it, it was released, within 5 minutes of its release someone else took it, now it is gone, now this is gone, now this is not there, now how to take such decision making, I teach these things in the comment section.  I will not give you the one at one rate so this is decision making that brother we have left the thing of 13000 square feet at the rate of something, now we will go to the next one which is probably of 15, so what is it like that, has there been an arrow in the pumpkin  That location must be very great, is the builder great, will anything change in any way, no, the only thing that happened is that you did not buy a good thing for one small reason, like I always say, any video and whatever else  YouTube tells the future ones to be better than the project that is going on now, I am saying it again and again that even the projects that are going on now are better than the previous ones, and the earlier ones were better than the previous ones, and these ones are better than the upcoming ones, and the upcoming ones are better than the upcoming ones.  If the one coming next is better than the one coming after him then I am telling you this clearly, I never say that no  The upcoming project is better than this, no, it is getting costly because whatever thing we call better, what ever this thing brother, you see what price you are paying for it, if something worth ₹1 is sold for ₹ 200 then it will be better but  You should look at the value for money, what was available for ₹1 and what is available for ₹200 now, so brother, is the thing worth ₹1 twice better than the thing worth ₹200 or even ₹1? Is it not so that  It is better than that at 20% but I have to pay 100% more price here people are not using their brain because it is very fast very fast this is like this so all the people who know about these two projects you will say  I do not even mention the names of the projects. My channel is for info investors. I am not coming here to share knowledge. There are 150 other channels to show and give side visits to the projects. Subscribe to them too. Learn A B C D Learn A for L Okay but if you want to learn the rest of these things then come to me Okay there learn Fur L B for Boy Okay so these were two projects which one of the two did you choose  I took the first one and both are excellent because many people kept comparing them for two months and I had said that there is no meaning in comparing between the two. In the first one, the allotment of 225 units got completed among 303 people. 600-700 applications were received but 225 units were settled out of 303 only. This means that the drop out rate remained at 78 only. 78% means that the selection rate was 75 which is a very high rate. Okay, I just received the data of the second one. No, but I will tell you the rough figure is that it has come out in smaller units, look if you are rejecting something because of the budget, then it is your compulsion whether your budget was for a 1 BHK or a small 3 BHK.  It was a BHK and that thing got gone and you did not throw any tantrums, there is no system for tantrums because you do not have any budget, if the one whose budget is between two to two and a half crores, now he is getting a thing worth 33 crores, then it is worth Rs. 2 crores.  The one with 2.5 crore can go up to 2.5 to 2.7, 2.8. It takes a lot of effort to go up to 32 from 2.5 crore. So the unit got rejected due to that reason. You have made another mistake in that, that if you had made a decision in the beginning and given the UI, something could have happened.  So it would have been better, so for them the lesson of the second mistake is learned and the brothers who have left out the things that were within their budget, they will have to realize a little loss, this is the video for that only, isn't it?  And it will not come, it will be expensive and even at that time there is no guarantee that you will get your dreams and the facing of the dreams which you think is very good, some tower will come in front of it, something else will come somewhere, if it is not there today then something else will come tomorrow  If there is a surprise, then decision making is not taken from him half the time  It is night; in winters more than half the time it is night; then in the morning we do not wake up with the sun; we do not go out as soon as we wake up. The most important thing in life is not what your flat is facing. The biggest reason for the happiness of life is that  It is that when you wake up in the morning, whose face do you see next to you? When you are sleeping at night, who is sleeping next to you? That person is your husband or wife. That is the quality of life. Face it, take it as you please.  If this is the conflict, the trouble, whoever the person is, then happiness cannot come in your life, so concentrate more on this, my relationship workshop was very cool, I am adding one in real estate right now, whoever could not attend it due to some reason Bhai, the recording is a super duper hit, like it happens many times in your performance, you feel that it is very good, so if anyone wants to take the recording through my app, then in WhatsApp2, you are for relationship, yes, so this relationship  It is because of this that you have rejected me. Does any man reject you alone? The wife says  Some dad and mummy say it, some one comes and says no, no, this doesn't look right, no, it is not good, oh sister, buy the suit, next time it will be available for Rs. 8000, some colour is what you are feeling, it's okay to your sister-in-law  Give her the suit, it will still be useful, otherwise you will have to buy a more expensive one for her, it is possible that she may like it, your sister-in-law may not like it, but it is possible that your sister-in-law may like it, okay, or your mother-in-law may like it, or your  If mummy likes it then take it, I am not able to find the suit again, I have to choose what I like, or you don't like it, I can agree, it happens many times that the color is not right, but the suit is good, yes the suit is good  Well, the rate is also fine and even if the rate will increase then you can decide later as per your choice, right now if you give it to someone it is possible that he may give you something later, so this investor man, he thinks in the same way and the end user  The end user also has to think that he has to buy something now, if he doesn't buy it then the rates will go up like this  If this is a message that Bhaiya you will not be able to take it, then please share it, like the channel, subscribe, thank you very much."

    "title": "02 Projects On Multi Utility Corridor In Gurgaon ｜ Price Points And Micro Story Discussed [DGijADvLCZ8].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, we will talk about two projects because many people are interested in them, what is their resale price, both the projects are facing each other, both the projects are of the same builder, the name is Godrej Air and the other project is Godrej Zenith.  This is a newly launched product. Close of one position has come, so first we will talk about Godre Ger. If you have bought it or you want to buy it, then the video will be very useful for you. Even if you have not bought it, then there is the general market trend and that thing.  will get  Godrej Air has a base rate of ₹ 1 per square feet and I am talking about this super area. I am talking about all inclusive. There is no GST and no need to do any legal charges and all that, whatever the rate is in the mature market.  It is said that there is an all inclusive rate in resale, there is nothing above that, now this is a base rate but some properties are even touching Rs 15000 in this because you understand that it is the fund of PLC. Having a margin of 000 is like paying 14000 at 7 and in the window of 6 to 7, there is price variation in the market depending on which tower is which floor, which is the facing and beyond that, how much PLC was given, where was the sunlight.  Where does the shadow come, you all know, there will be that much variation, so depending on your flat, if you want to sell in resale, then this ball is a Pak figure, not less than 14 at all.  And things even go up to 15. Now things are discussed on the spot. There is a ball park figure for the buyer as well. This project is a bang on multi utility corridor. It is already very wide if you want to actually feel how wide it is.  If it is built then the mall which has been announced by miracle, as it starts from there, it will be built as wide as you can see in front of it. It is already a very wide road, but it is as wide as it is.  It will become much bigger than that and you get to see how much width can be in the front of Elan Miracle. What is its other advantage? A Godrej I have already told you that the construction is very good, it has good construction and it is a very good product.  Its opposite is Godre Zenith which is a late launched product and Godre Zenith is a late launched product and currently the sellers are expecting it.  000 per square feet premium is 2000 especially on small units in 2 BHK and 2000 on small units of 3 BHK they are expecting and on bigger units the expectations are 1500 to 1800 so this is the expectation whatever price was there now.  Why am I not telling the exact price like Godrej Air, because here the matter still remains  By doing PLC, VLC and all this because he is not yet an investor in his mind, he is only demanding premium from his costing, it is okay, this product is not mature yet, so it is okay, that is why it is being talked about mostly.  The inventory was of PLC, non- PLC inventory according to me was only around 25-30, some of it was PLC, a little less was more, it was within such variety, so understand the matter that if Godrej is  There are 14 to 15 in which the position has to be taken quickly, all the money will be gone, so here the matter is comfortably between 1530 to 1630, depending on the opportunity, how much is the unit, if you talk about all inclusive rate, then it is almost this much and if there is any unit here. Small unit is available, if anyone is getting it then you can take it because what people have not seen here has understood because this product will be available in 6 years, you will get Zenith only in 2030.  The same is made at the same pace, is as dense and the same things have to be made, so now a lot of commercials have started being made around it, but all these commercials are like a belt, it starts with the announcement miracle, ' A will come again, new things are here'  Commercials are being launched, Godrej 's touching project, Zenith is a touching project, this is a commercial project, then the cyber hub to come is in sector 88 and 89.  The dividing road which goes ahead where there was a factory is now also being removed and joins Pataudi Road. It is a road of 1.25 kilometer and all the off-office and commercial areas will come on it, which is called Cyber ​​​​Hup 2. It may happen in the future. It took 3, 4, 6 years, heard some stories in 3, it started being built in 4, 5 years, then it is a global city and that too at a distance of just 4, 5, 6 minutes from this location, that too 10 years old, 10 years old  There is a Sutri program, that too, it is not like that something is coming the day after tomorrow, but these projects will do very well in this residential project because of such a location, such a big road, it is very rare. AIPL's commercial of residential project has come across the road. They have put a huge board wall within 10 acres, it is coming there and the touching side is coming to them, it is all commercial, so I think it will be good and you guys. Those who have bought it, the story is still far away. Now their payment of Rs. 30 will come in March and after this payment of Rs. 40, you will get time for the next payment, at least seven to eight months.  If anyone is ready to sell the Haj at Rs 2000, then you can reduce it as much as you can by bargaining, if you want then you can buy it because now no product is coming because whatever comes now is coming at Rs 22000.  Right there, I am not disclosing the name right now, Rare Vera will come from this location, just 40 seconds away or 30 seconds to 40 seconds by car, walk on foot, not even 5 minutes, okay, so 22000 to 2000 on this same road.  If the rate of square feet will come then where is 15 16 where is that of Air 1415 where is this 151 and where is 222 then there is a lot of difference ok and that is like  If it comes to 22, it will bounce another 1000 feet, so if it is 16, it will easily go towards 17, 173, because it will come and it will come in 22, it will come in 22000, it has to be taken, it is not to be taken, what to do when it  If the project comes, we will talk about it, but right now there is a chance of going up to Rs 161000 by the end of this year, if that project comes on 22nd, there is information like and  If instead of 22 it comes at 21, it will be a little less. If it comes at 20, it will be a little more but from 20, it is definitely going up. As far as I have heard, 22 has been heard and if 22 becomes 23, then brother, jump further.  If it comes, please keep coming such videos, write in the comment section. If you have purchased here, you can also take membership by pressing the join button. Thank you very much."

    "title": "02 Types Of Investors In Real Estate ： Which One Are You？ [tKa7Rd62y_g].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, understand these two investors in the real estate market. There are two different types of investors. We also consider investors as one type. I will tell you how all the two types of investors are. Through this video, there is one investor who has got the money.  Either he has sold something of his from somewhere or he has got inheritance, which means he has got a lot of money, it is in the bank, the second investor is that it is 10 15 20 30 lakhs i.e.  10, 15, 20 is to be given and the rest will be taken as loan, both the investors are different, it is up to the investors to understand, it does not matter what kind of property you go for, it will make a difference, I would have told you what mistake the earlier investors are making.  I am here so that people do not commit such mistake in this market and burn their hands because many people are seen burning their hands. Someone got the money and made a fortune of Rs. 3 crores through lets. I am telling you these two things as an example.  CR can also be one CR, I tried to get hold of three CR and understand what is the mistake, this three CR money has come to this person, he can easily buy a property from it, any flat which is two and a half to three CR  Was he coming somewhere or looking for one property, he runs towards two properties in three CR whose total sum value is 56 CR and is under construction or in the same five CR property, he does not want to play games with CR.  I will give money from 40 to 50. The one who is playing at 30 is a khatron player, the one playing at 30 is a khatron player, the one at 50 is a player, that is fine but ideally the first investor who is playing  Those who are in this kind of category, you have to tell them that if you have to buy even two properties, then buy such a property which in total will cover your budget because it may be under construction for the next three to four years.  If I make another Rs 50-60 lakh of my own then don't over leverage thinking that I will take two and will make profit in one and from that profit then I will do the rest. Don't do like this, I have told you earlier also, tell me through the form of this video.  I am in the second category of investors, I would like them wherever payment plan games are coming in the market. If you are an investor and are not sitting with the entire money, then you can go for the payment plan one.  Wherever there is an easy payment plan, you have double leverage that your loan meter has not gone down, you have played the game at 203, you have played with it, you have not taken the loan, you have the capacity of the loan, here also I will not say about over leverage.  I will not say that no brother, it is a thing of ₹ 1, you are sitting with only ₹ rupees, you do not have the capacity of 70, you have the capacity of 70 to take a loan, but there is no need to take a loan, so this is advice for the  Second Investor: Which investor are you or in which category do you fall? One or two? Please tell me. I hope this short video would have been easy for you to understand and would have been beneficial. Do not over leverage. Do leverage but do not over leverage.  Is it a game of 200 or 3300 out of 50? Will it be better if you play only 50 out of 50 or hit the limit? You can go up to 60, 70. 20 Do it above 30, yes, okay, especially if you have got money in LSM and do not have much of your own income. I see many youngsters here whose income is very normal, due to which you cannot buy a big property. Who is that income?  C is, many children are not able to buy a big property even up to Rs 1 lakh 2 lakh 2 lakh, so in 70 80 90 Hajj, they don't know which one to buy and have dreams of over leverage.  You see, don't do this, that is the advice, that is, spread your feet just by looking at your bed sheet. It is possible that if you are in North India, you may not get the solution in North India now. For investment, you may have to go left and right. Be open.  To that no no then which money is not easy to earn there? Who will take care of your job? Yes, we take care of you. How much salary do you get? Yes, 60000, how many hours do you go?  Yes, 10 hours, how many days do you go? Yes, 25 days, how many months? Yes, how much leave do you get in 12 months? Only after going 10-12 days in a year, you get money, that is, if you want to earn Rs 10 lakh for 6 days in a year, then you have to do good for that.  Be ready to invest 121 lakhs. If the one who is earning even 15 lakhs is left with only 56 lakhs, then be ready to spend the whole year and investment to save 56 lakhs.  You are not ready to give even one or two days in a year for the opportunity to grow, you have to think that a little effort seems to be everywhere, no one stands like this in Delhi, you live in Pritampura and in Gurgaon.  Have taken property on golf course extension so don't stand there every day to manage the property there are people who take care so I hope you understand this basic difference like subscribe the channel and if my  If you want to join the info webinar, then in the top of the comment section, if you are not already ready, then it will be a duplication, do not join, but if not, if you are watching this for the first time, then I will explain things better there many times.  Let me explain, I am also running a real estate mentoring program and if you want to join then give me a course on real estate."

    "title": "03 Kinds Of Grahak In Real Estate Market ｜ Which One Are You ？ [-_BVbnzKZa0].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, there are three types of people roaming in the real estate market. It is okay to tell which are the methods. I will tell you the example of Gurgaon real estate. There are three types of people, one is those who want to get into real estate today and want to get into it today.  Okay, these are the ones who have been bought, it is more natural like you buy a lion, your mother says that brother should run away now so that I can have peace because I cannot buy women, so now these people who are like me  I want to add these to the window Now I am dividing the Windows offer into two parts, there is one on the window shop, you cannot buy it, you are looking at the rates, you are looking at the rates, there is a Windows offer, you want to see the rate of everything and such a rip leader, that IPL.  Like want to rip the sixes of the square, not all the posts are gone, this also got spoiled and we and the rates of the special project which they have taken, keep increasing in the second phase, in the next phase, in the launch, then another customer, second people. Confused, he is feeling like the rates are increasing, he is feeling as if he is being fooled and this means confused, he has no opinion yet, he is feeling like a brother, he also wants to take, there is also greed and fear.  There are all mixed emotions and they are going with a budget of their own. They are confused. The wife says the story. The kitchen is not good. The story. If you understand the layout, you don't understand the payment plan. The story. Even if you understand everything, it seems expensive. The story. Wherever it feels right, someone comes and tells a story. Those corny stories are told, I will also discuss them a little later in the video and that too is a very interesting and ridiculous marginal method. Okay, so that one is ridiculous. The third people are those who are a little  Beater, you are in the window shop, you can't buy these people, who are these people now, they do n't have money, they don't have loan taking capacity, mostly they are young people, their age is between 22, 23, 24, 25 to 35 years.  And many also live on Groupon, many are looking at real estate because they have a lot of time, other capacity, father is not giving money, like father from Delhi does not send all his kept but they are following, now they do not want the rate.  Quickly, Barh Jain, because look, this is the psychology of the man, now see what is the truth, should it be increased or not, they will definitely discuss because sir, the game is very simple, demand and supply, one day we understood that this number of people.  What is the number of these people in Real Web Naz, from the middle of the data, from the middle of the real data, I am 10 to 15,000 votes late. I, you people, who are connected to me, are the ones who support the party. It is not that I am anything. Speaking, I am not Karpa, I always do 10 to 15000 votes, I have these trades very well and I do not share these trades in public for free. This train is very proprietary information. Okay.  So this gives confidence in knowing what is going on because these people are very important and important people in the market. If ever I vote, you guys also participate in the comment area and I will vote in the community page that real status should be on fire. People agree, yes or no, it's a simple thing, then I will give the result later when the result comes, now you must have posted this video on the community page, then the post will also be visible to you in the community.  By going to the page, you can participate on it, you can also see how many people have voted and what do you think from the example of Gurgaon and real estate. Tell me, Gurgaon real estate is on fire, from where am I speaking, because how things are being carried out.  There is only one thing, whether you remain in displays or not, now it is just a bubble. How bubbles are formed, I will tell you with a very good example.  Again this is Proprietary Information. One day Guru Tattva will wake up and I will be able to tell you for free, I will make that video and release it in a very good way. Actually, for the first time, I will have to take help from him. Okay, if I tell it verbally, then maybe you will not understand.  Let me explain the thing in some part off and maybe record it and release it because it will have to take the help of open technology, it will have to be drafted and explained under some examples, so if you want a date video, then that one.  The video will also be sent to you, so now let's see what is happening in this confusion creation. There is a lobby which has bought, okay now it wants higher rates and can buy, it is confused and it cannot do anything. Now I can only see that it is bitterness, they call the opposite sex wrong, they call the institution of marriage bad, all the girls will put the area a498, that must be that category, it is okay, it is not like spirituality.  Following the lesson of ' Walking in the jungle, going to the mountain', he became a point one percent yogi. I don't know the story in the mountain. I do n't know where he went on WhatsApp. He grew his hair and grew his beard. This is not that category. He definitely has to do a job and stay in the middle.  And if you have to live with mom and dad and have to cry, then I am calling him an equivalent example of real estate people. Here, these are such people who cannot buy. If the rates are seen rising, then the grapes are sour.  Now it would seem as if he would like to say that all Ma Jains, Vultures and D'Crosses do nothing, desires do nothing for anyone, that is what has to happen, but here, like Lucifer, where are the forces going, where is the trade going?  It can definitely be analyzed, so those people who are confused in the middle, their confusion comes from a lot of people on social media who do every project of yours is fine and in that I have to ask them that whatever  Come let's tell are you dear but de selection game and rejection game it is something like Kamal ke khan karke ke kam karke karke hai not RK he comes and calls every picture bad, Hari picture ko pathan aa rahi hai, it is useless, it is useless  Everything is useless, Bollywood is useless, some of the pictures in it are husband's caste, then it becomes correct, if there is any movable caste, then there is nothing else, then come next and tell me, even the stock analyst is less like this, the lion will increase, it will increase, it will decrease.  It will increase, it will decrease, it will increase, say so many things, make 100 predictions, I am also an astrologer, understand this psychology work, make only this much prediction, something will be right, whatever will be made right, bye bye, don't talk about the things that have gone bad, only then make predictions like I will give it in Dwarka, check it again or I will put it in the description area, see what she will say about March 31st, April is not going on yet, so check the first week yourself.  Just check, what should I tell, the story has gone ahead, the story has gone ahead, it has gone so far that now I don't even feel like speaking because you said that something will cost ₹ 100 and if it becomes ₹ 120, then what is there to talk about further?  Now if I want to tell what will happen next, then I will keep telling about the future also in this way, for the first time what is happening to the people is that it is like a marriage is taking place and there is a girl and a fair time in it, at this time say that friend, this girl will have only 6 months.  first i dated a boy  I had seen you going on a motorcycle with me, this is a true thing, a sitting girl, will you not marry on this matter, will anyone, these days, the story, girls do not take lift from anyone, they do not know anyone, they do not have a social circle, what can I do, two girls, three Boys don't go to watch movies. Is it okay? If you had taken it with you in the society, despite many things being true, your thought process is such that you don't want even 1% doubt about anything. This is what people are looking for in property.  I am worried that you will be rejected.  You are playing a selection game. Do you want to get married or just get rejected and enjoy because whatever the project is, the builder will come as per the land available. Many people are very concerned about the builder. The builder is making big money.  If builders will not earn money from builders then we will leave then Amrapali wala of Greater Noida will want hello project will not be built builder you make money and not they don't want builder you make other money only should billosis give us house cheap you  Should be a very happy debt builder, find a good rate, give the profit earned, give a good payment plan, give good specifications, give you a good product and be capable enough to complete the project and sell the goods if his goods are not sold.  And he did not get profit and he reduced the rate very much, now this is real estate, no, your Zomato cannot work as per Paytm, okay, it cannot work as per Bajju because it is real, it is real.  Have to put in the rest of the place, something is happening from here and do investor that investor from here loan right topper Aradhana, it is not the case here, when he has to bring bars and intro cement and all, then he does not need money, since he is not going to give the money.  You can take a loan because he has mortgaged the land, now he has mortgaged the land, it is a big complex, it is a structure, but still you people have to realize that when the real estate does well, it will be good for everyone.  It will do good for you too, middle class, if you think that no, no one will spend my nights in between, no work will happen like this, Everybody Bill Make Money and Everybody Lose Money, Example after Example, Lion's Market, Lion's Market, the chip goes up, first of all, the Government.  I am not in real estate. Government also makes stall of money. You all know, I will make a separate video on that. Okay, so what are the factors, what are the factors which For those who are confused about which category of these three you are in, please join my real estate info WhatsApp group. You will get to ask questions, sir, sir, yours.  Confusion will go away, everything will go away because while moving around you will meet many uncles. I had seen the girl on the motorcycle but the one who told him that the girl was very fine, she was sitting on the motorcycle, she was also sitting in the car, you also spent time and nothing is achieved by sitting.  Is Everything else about him is good, his mother is like this, his father is like this, the whole system is like this, his aspirations are complete information, his complete comparison will be this thing because if you do it with Heer while walking, then you will never ask mom to write anything. Mom said, this is good to me.  He is not going to buy it after looking around like this because when the good one comes, then he will not get it at 11-12 thousand feet, then he will get it at 18000 feet, but mom has nothing to do with it.  Is it right for mom or is it right for dad? My wife has just gone, now I have seen the layout, everything is going well, the kitchen is getting smaller, the kitchen is being made small by the hands, so give double the rate and go in some old one, you will go there again and drink cheap.  And the sewerage treatment plant is built with a capacity of 200 and there are 600 flats and that stock bursts when actually people feel like starting it after three to five to six months of handover.  This is happening in many places, nothing has happened, then it keeps happening, then once cheap employment becomes expensive, if even a donkey, a lame horse, a lame horse runs away, then what kind of animal is that? It is a dead animal because now we have to see that now what is this  Donkey, horse, lame, horse, lame, donkey is running away, I have to dig through the dust, friend, this is my horse, if my horse is not taken, then take the donkey, lame horse and lame treasure are like this.  There are developers who were horses at one time but they became lame horses. There were some developers who were donkeys in the old times. Non donkeys were donkeys. Also note that N Bed thinks because of this he also has a lot of luck but he has become a lame donkey.  So that is also bad, so today we have to invest money on the donkey and horse because the metal and cost of the donkey bill is fine, the horse is a pea of ​​the bill, so first you have to define whether you have to invest money on the horse and then both on the donkey.  There should be fit fit donkeys, it is okay to put them on a horse, under this example, I will tell you very simply, first, if you have seen my video earlier, two-three years ago, I used to be a genre in it, the project that used to come was to speak a first air.  One second, one third, what is sleeper class now, which was one three, one was you and cheated, became at the rate of ac3 ac2, became at the rate of ac2 ac1, I do n't know what happened to this one, so I said that John and  You said, I have banded it because I used to put it in the segment, so the segment may be there, but the rate tick of TikTok means whatever the rates of its projects are, they will be very expensive. Now people are not able to understand that 1 year 1 1/2 Years ago, you used to take this very thing in the budget, now in the budget, you have got these three A's and one thing has been removed from this, friendship whose train has stopped, especially those whose train has stopped, now this is called speed.  Because absolutely, now what happened to most of the people that I am in the market and many people are joining me, they are comparing such 3 and one you, date it n color think which is different inside, I am now like you are comparing XUV500 with Fortuner.  Can't compare, there is a difference in seconds, people would prefer Scorpio to Fortuner but that segment is not good, there are different cars in that segment, each brand has them.  Compare among yourselves, this is your Maruti car and this is your Creta. Compare Honda City and Ciaz. It should be the same. You cannot do the same like you can compare Honda's expensive car which is priced at Rs 25 lakh with Maruti's car priced at Rs 10 lakh. Comparison is a wrong comparison. One can get to know how much knowledge of real estate one has from one question and that question means Sir, if the syllabus gets leaked then real estate education.  Thoughts are the same tomorrow Myself D Number One Real State Clarity Life Many people say otherwise self proclaimed means self proclaimed means there is a scene of 56 inches no one else will come and measure it, you have to speak only there is a scene of 56 inches in this Sydney's  It's not a matter of speaking, you need strength to speak, not every man can speak, not every man can speak, 56 sign's dialogue is very chilly, people find it very chilly, they will have to speak after knowing who will come.  Bhai Saheb will say that your honor of 56 days will not speak on its own. Once you have said it, then those who will offer it will definitely come. You are understanding it right but you will have to say it yourself that I am the number one real estate of your nobody, this is giving 360 degree perspective in.  If the country has the money, who has it, how to get it, then it is important to know about all these things. Along with this, the lion's share of the journal economics, market's economy, etc. What is happening in the country, if the dollar is tax and NRI is a tax, that too is the effect of real estate, so these things are playing out in a big big way. I hope you people will understand all this very well. How did you like the video? Do tell.  If you have not subscribed to Sher Karna channel yet then please subscribe. Thank you."

    "title": "03 Kinds Of Viewers Following Real Estate Channels ｜ Which One Are You ？ [UMNnzrxRrjU].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, I have already covered that three to four subscribers who are in the market, today I have brought an interesting topic that three to four subscribers who consume real estate content, I will not call them customers, I will call them subscribers and discuss on this.  I will do it and you all tell me which category you fall in. Before that, someone had sent me a video, some subscriber had said that brother, some fellow was giving me some knowledge after a long time.  When I saw the video, I did not get any knowledge on time, so I said, who is giving me the knowledge? I am so knowledgeable myself, that video was made by some troll type of mine, but what struck me in it was because see Guruji, only the one who works is there.  Takes out a useful thing, I took out that there are some YouTube which come with a disclaimer that it is very good because it is on the right side of the law or something, but they put the disclaimer, brothers, sisters, till the pot and the second, that is, till the second.  if you their Also take a screenshot and read it, which has to be searched a lot, something like this is written in it, that is, before making the video, if you want me to put it like this or speak like this, then you should understand. It is very interesting. The content is published in this channel. Anyone.  The name of the channel is of general nature and is furnished exclusively for educational purposes. The material contained in this video is with reference to general sources of information the objective of  This Video is Solely for Educational Purposes and Not Intended for the Sales Marketing of this Property Project Provided that No Information Cited in the Video Shall Be Deemed for the Aforesaid Purposes Not Withstanding Anything Contained Here to Its Strictly Advised That the Viewer Shall Exercise Due Diligence  Prior to any decision for purchase or which is public social Posing as reformers, they write these things which the public does not read. I am telling them after reading them. Friends, after reading them, mark the subject as mutual fund and tell them. At least the idea should go to the public. Here, you show it for a micro second, brothers and sisters, any commitment is meaningful.  TO THE INFORMATION APPEARED IN THIS VIDEO IS WITHIN THE VIEW OF THE VIEWER RESPONSIBILITY AND WILL BE PERFORMED AT THEIR OWN RISK OR SUBSCRIBERS ARE BY Advice not to act upon any information imparted on this channel without seeking professional and expert advice. Further, I will also put everything like this, after this you will feel like watching the video, if someone 's brother's food is cooked like this, the stomach gets upset, don't tell us, we tried a little.  Tried to clarify but he can't speak this much English, he knows this much, his is fine, this much he knows, can't I also speak, my English is also good, this much One of our black coat brothers has written this but I want to say that why does YouTube have to write this because to the public and subscribers, if I tell you three types or four types then it is not a condemnation of a YouTuber friend, what happens sometimes?  They all troll like this, hey brother, since when do people from the same community fight so much, hey, you also do it, yes, I too am a scoundrel, I too should not indulge in scoundrelism, even myself.  I advise you to look at each other, doctor, doctor will not fight, lawyer will not fight, it is okay and these are many professions but many of us are like this too, it is okay, so today I try to organize a class for a few subscribers, if you enjoy then enjoy.  Come and find out what type of person you are, make a video, it is okay by coming here, you have been sold, if you take the name, you are sold, if not, you are sold, if you take the name in gestures, then it will be a problem. Because look, if a man says that there is a man who has a white beard and they say brothers and sisters and has a chest of 56 inches and this is what it means, it is better to just take his name, I also came to know that it is okay to be whipped.  So either you should take names or you should not take them, the journey is gradual in life, we learn slowly, so either take names or don't take them and if you want to condemn then tell openly that it is okay and clear to condemn like this. do it from  So that the next one also gets peace or don't do it, I, as a professional, I want to ask you, are you a subscriber, according to me you are in three or four categories, first of all, you have bought real estate, pan India can also be good.  Gun specific also, I can take an example, you are already sitting after buying real estate, then there is a bull run in real estate, the rates are increasing, you are seeing that the projects are becoming expensive, okay and you are enjoying because  You are sitting with it, you could have taken only that much, the second category could be that brother, you could not do decision making, you did not understand the thing at that time, now you are a big dyspareunia and sometimes this brother, this one is good, brother, that one.  Okay, brother, this verse is that verse, that verse is that verse, because you know that those who have these verse and those verses are very big, they have to give them the same verse, today I will tell them very clearly, may people have great peace.  It will be fine because who cares about the voters? Everyone would have done aarti to the voters, but which election do we have to fight? Subscribers, they will run away, such subscribers will run away, they were not killed by us anyway, those we have killed will remain, it is okay, they will be seen, they will run away.  So you will know, it is okay to play, but I am telling you for you people, I am trying to troll my subscribers, if YouTube1 is a clarity giver then you can do such work. I am fine, second people are like this, thirdly these people are those who cannot buy, they are not able to get a job, so they are just surviving on salary, father is not agreeing, they are not selling the property, money is not coming from anywhere, they are saying that  The sky has fallen, the sky has fallen, these rates will fall, everything is like this, everything is like that, no it is like saying, if the marriage is not happening, then all the girls do section 498, only the girls are not good, if the girls are not good, then at night.  You see them, they have worn out their hands on mobile phones for two, three, three hours. You are fine in every way. Yes, this is the condition of the youth who troll more, this is the condition of most of the people, this is the condition of many people. Okay, so who are you?  Are you able to buy any property in C category? If you are not able to buy it then ask because this question is asked a lot. This is the rate of 20000, this is of 21, this is of 19, this is the justified rate.  It is justified because the thing is being sold. If the thing is being sold then it is justified. It is being sold at a slow pace. The next one is coming with the same rate. You look at the cost of the land. Now some group has bought 1.74 acres of land in Gurgaon worth Rs. 153 crores. I am here.  I don't know how to increase GK. There are many other channels which bring updates like this to increase GK. It is okay with the name, this is the one who writes this and this also writes that our question is  Don't read this, we have already told you that we do not have any respect or religion. Okay, so they have already given a clear cut because but that is my English. You wrote it very well, but please show me these words in seconds.  I cannot read it and it takes a lot of effort to read it by pausing it and zooming out to see what is written, so if your intention is to actually tell what you want to tell, then you will have to tell it in a manner like I am telling that I  any time anyone  The product will be spoiled by you no matter how bad it is, it is okay if any food item is spoiled in any way, it is okay whether the paratha is useless or the vegetable is useless, if there is any thing, then I will not take its name because I have released that I am mine.  I used to claim that I have a lot of desire but I released that I have a lot of desire that when you read the stories, you feel relieved that it was there in reality otherwise because some video 10 12 15 people have seen it.  There are so many people in the market, so I will never do any such work which will kick someone's stomach. If I want to do good in it, then how will it be good for the general public? If the good of the general public will be done then it will be done by taking consultation. Give the consultation fee. Come, understand me one on one.  Model, now other YouTubers have also started applying, I am telling other YouTubers also that you have become 'G' and you have become 'G', all the knowledge here is free versus this versus that, this is good.  Is that good, ask us, ask us, stop telling everything, then yes, only then it will work, if the public will come against you because the public will come against you, you will call one thing bad, they have bought it, it is like I say, sometime before getting married.  After all, the character of the tune or the son-in-law is not asked. If your son is getting married, then don't ask about the character of the tune, you have taken it, no, how are you now brother, how is it, say good, no, good, say bad.  Will you give? Why are you speaking bad? If you speak bad then you will not get paid. If you are speaking well then you will get paid. Okay, tell me exactly as I am speaking to my subscribers. What is not the case with any project? Tell us your approach and content. Tell us all.  There is a dirty drain in the front and behind, then it is like this, then it is like that, then this is the rest, you see, it is not told like this, you do not understand, we will tell you, those with some verses, oh brother, ultimately you have to make the one who is on the project win, right?  I am telling people that we all are not barbers, we are hair cutters and our living depends on saying yes, so if we come for hair cut and you ask us that Guruji, if we cut our hair, then what will no one say, don't cut the work, if you want to cut hair then yes.  Friend, you have two hairs on two heads, one so much, one so much, we will say make it equal, make it equal, understand why are you asking me these innocent questions, this YouTube that includes me looks very innocent, are you just trying to earn money?  I came here to earn money and who did I claim in which video? Actually, what is it? Very few people watch a 10 minute video and they leave within 4 minutes. Last time, I made some video series which came in my yellow blue thumbnail which were in my  It is an all time favorite, it is good, it has value for money, in which I said in the disclaimer that I have taken this one, then in the comment section also someone writes that he must have taken it from this, so hey brother.  If you had watched the entire video, you would not have written a comment, within four minutes you would have written it and gone away, but this does not mean that we have a platform, we can also take Watts, a subscriber's subscriber can write a comment, the rest of the users can write a comment. You can make 100 videos, you also have to watch and understand because if you do something like this then if the moral of any YouTube gets low then it doesn't happen to me, I am a thick second but if it gets low then only you will learn something.  You will be deprived of it, then everything will be paid, so there is a lot of things, if you want, you should not get anything for free, like I have made a very good video, if you guys want, I will release it on how to check the intention of the builder. I have taught a very simple technique, no builder is a builder, how to check his intentions, I have given a formula, there is a one minute video, if you want to see it then write, now you tell me from whom did I sell that video and get everything.  It happens like this does n't it?  So social service or some normal professional work has also been sold, it is possible that the doctor is writing a prescription, he is prescribing medicine, he has been sold, yes, you should look at that medicine man, do n't take the medicine, everyone is sold, like this the whole world, you too.  You have sold out, you have also sold your time, all the subscribers who listen, those who are employed, you have sold your company's time, you have sold out, so everyone is selling something or the other, someone is selling himself. Someone is selling knowledge, someone is selling service, someone is selling something. The country is free and the same thing is done for free like free electricity and water. See what happens to free electricity and water. Do you know who is so happy with it?  In life, if you are one of these three or four types of subscribers, I want to know how my subscriber should be, I give my definition, if you can come in that definition then it is a lot of fun, if you ca n't come then it is important to go there.  where we were born Dosa is not being made according to your taste, I don't feel like Sambar is not good, I have to eat only that and I have to say to him every day, if it is not good, go where it is good, then I want a subscriber who is open to all in life.  Who has possibilities? Who doesn't get hung up on his own. Who has decision making skills. Who has little. Who has some doubts. Wants to connect some dots. Who is afraid of confirmation bias. Very much. A little bit. Everyone wants confirmation bias. But it is not that you decide by taking a poll from 100 people. When you go to get married, do you ask 5000 people that this is the photo, brothers and sisters, should I get married, that is, do you run the poll by setting up a group on Telegram or do you run your own intelligence, discretion and consciousness?  If you decide from this, then those who have a little awakened conscience, those who have reached somewhere in life, those who want clarity, those who want to understand everything, I want my subscribers webinar in the comment section.  There is Info Group, if you have not already joined then you can join beyond that and there are old projects for resale which are not covered by anyone if someone tells them that these are good projects because one more scam is coming, what is coming in the market? I will tell you a separate video on that, it is also coming in Gurgaon market, you just see what is going wrong in the market now, my aim is to prevent that thing through those videos and because of that in the market.  today's day  Resale has stopped a lot and even more people are feeling chilly. I will tell you clearly what is happening in that video. It is definitely power to influence and I will use this power very responsibly.  I will use it to anyone anytime while walking. Don't ask what kind of builder is this, what is the project like. If someone is telling you while walking then it is wrong. It is a proprietary information. Please learn to pay up and consultation fees will remain.  If you are buying things worth two crores or three crores, because less than this, like Gurgaon is not available in Real Estate, learn to pay for consultation because in many places you pay a lot of money for very small services. When you make a builder buyer agreement, then a token.  That's what the lawyer's son takes. Tell him how much money do you pay? You would know the rate in Gurgaon. He takes the token only and gives it to you. Your builder brings it and then he tells this lawyer. Give the money to the lawyer. The face of the lawyer is not visible. There is some small person who comes there and comes to get the signature done and they are 20, 30, 40. How much money does he take from everyone, give it, I have given it myself, what a great service he has given to him.  You will definitely give the meaning, whenever it is said that he is the father of Dhule, he keeps wasting money in front of the mare, when you go to get the registration done, then the whole public gets into that mode and where does that story start, like only then I  I say that it is necessary to take pre-marital consultation before marriage. You invest Rs. 10,20,30,50,60,70 lakh in marriage. The middle class, I am telling you, rich people invest even more. Okay, do it first in that and do it first in real estate also.  Take care of yourself because if someone is selling sweets then he will take money to tell which sweet is good and which is bad, otherwise he will give you whatever you say, say yes brother, in everything brother.  Sir, we are in the mood to buy a commercial one, yes, take it, brother, how is this builder, it is very good, yes, how is this one, this is also very good, but how is that one, yes, that is also fine, what do you want to buy, brother, for me?  You have to take this, take it now, we will get it to you sir, but when you ask these five things, you don't like it. You know that you did not enjoy it, but you think that some person got proper flour for free because Indians were not yet used to real estate.  real estate in  What was there in me, anything is coming, it is coming, what has become different, in the same city, on the same road, within 2 kilometers of each other, 000 square feet, 12 13 14 15 18, 20000 square feet, within minutes of each other.  Otherwise, how can one justify and understand that brother, take this one, take that one, take this one, which one will increase, how will it increase, what will increase, what can the data say?  What is the future saying? What are the parameters? What are those parameters like I told you as an example by which you can judge whether this real estate is overpriced or underpriced? Brothers and sisters, which is coming in the month of May. I am starting a real estate mentoring program, my batch is starting, who wants to register for it, if you want to know, then rumm rem p on the given number [music] whatsapp2 square feet increases, it increases just like this  It has increased by 3000 2 square feet and if that thing was 2400 2600 square feet then 80 lakhs have increased, 80 lakhs is 8 lakhs. If you have savings then 10 years of savings is also a package of 20 lakhs. Brothers and sisters, you are sitting with it.  20 lakh is a decent package, not much at all but many people in 20 lakh do not have more than 8 lakh left out of 20 Can't you, if a person who is earning Rs 20 lakhs, will also pay taxes and will have to eat some food, he will be able to save only Rs 8 lakhs, then the rate of your future savings of 10 years increases in three months, so learn it now, if not then when.  Learn that nothing is going to happen by trolling. I think so, what do you think, what do I think, how do you think, does anyone think it is beyond 400? Someone is saying that if only 150 seats will be available. 400 will come, 150 will come, how everyone is feeling their own, the result will be known but the same thing is here in real estate, what are you feeling, what am I feeling does not work, what works is the sum total of what is everyone feeling.  So if suppose there are one lakh people who buy and sell in the market, what do they all collectively feel? Where is the trend of the market? If things keep getting absorbed at higher ticket prices and the goods keep being sold, then the goods will come.  There may be some goods that may not be 100% sold in three days, may be sold in six months, may be sold in a year, may be sold in three years. Any project that is coming up will not be completed before six to seven years and for that you are RERA.  You can see that I will tell you all the different educational videos that I will make and I am telling this clearly with a disclaimer, I will also make a disclaimer before and I am not showing that half-second video to you guys, whatever video will be made and which  It also becomes my benefit before becoming the first one in that. If there is no benefit for me in that video, then I will not make the video. You think this, now it can be my benefit. I get peace by making you benefit. This also happens.  Why should I forcefully paint myself as cunning, which I am not, Guruji, I am a good person, so I will not forcefully paint myself as bad, but I have given this disclaimer, see, the benefit is mine because the views will come.  hee na that age a  YouTube is a benefit, no matter what you create content as a YouTuber. If 5, 10, 20 thousand people watch it, then make a YouTube video of that too. Will any film maker make a movie or you will just make people do it like this, yes, do it like this. Even leaders are made to get votes, they can say anything to get votes, they can say anything, brother, he needs votes somehow, I will make it somehow, then I will see, so understand this thing, it is better if you do not troll in this matter. So I would like you to not do anything to any fellow user, not to do anything to any real estate person, every person is someone's child, they want to earn money by doing some work of their own, if you understand then it is okay, if you understand then don't look, there is no coercion here.  No, there are 8 crore creators in India, there are 8 crore channels, like I alone have five channels, I am saying that there are crores of channels, you have to watch them as per your wish, it is your choice as to whom to subscribe or unsubscribe.  Never watch this, you will not watch anyone's video or its algorithm will tell you why you are spending so much of your time and energy. Save means you are wasting it. You save, go and watch someone's video. If you have increased the rate or decreased it then reduce it.  How to reduce it, tell me what is the way to reduce it, everyday he came and said, no, the rates have increased a lot, they have increased a lot, they have increased a lot, they should not reduce, they should crash, they will happen when they have to stagnate.  Or time correction has to come, it will come but we can tell you the situation as seen with our eyes, now some 222 runs are being scored, 240 are being scored in 20 overs, 200 are being scored, 100 are being scored, the pitch is low and fast, we can tell you the situation as seen with our eyes.  Now I have seen you with my eyes, do you think that no no, this is not the actual situation, you are telling something else, so brother, you tell me what you are feeling, why are you feeling just feelingless?  If you don't like it, then understand this video a little bit. This video was made so that I can reset for future, I come into every thing and tell every person that you have been sold, you have been sold, I am being sold on every channel, then politics is somewhere else.  When I am speaking, politicians are also buying, builders are also buying, I mean, the general public is also buying me, my courses are fun and suppose I am being sold, then I will study after Adani Mukesh Ambani.  No, since when did I start following me, read, I don't want to follow them either, they are also doing good work, why do you look for competition, you understand something about yourself with a normal person, see who is telling you something and explaining it to you.  If you understand, then everything is good, I get to know something about other YouTubers also, my GK also becomes very good, very good YouTubers are doing very well, they come with some updates, they come with this, they come with that.  It's a good thing Everybody Buddy has got a mean talent Everybody Kishore Da So everyone copied Okay, and whoever copied also becomes famous So style of speaking Style of taking examples Style of hiding things Style of not taking names Style of taking names  So look even more flat than this, imitation is the best form of fluttery, no matter how much you troll someone, use abusive words, but if you are following him, you are speaking his words in the same style. Or are you trolling him, okay then this is the best thing that you arrived, like my podcast went viral on one of my channels, got 12-14 lakh views overnight and started making memes, so it means feeling bad. If your memes are not being made then that means you are not arrived. Becoming a meme is a very good thing. He is like our Bobby Deol, he is not such a superhit hero but his memes are popular so they are relevant. Because you must have seen that Lord Bobby guy, I do n't know who started it, but when he was asked for an interview, he did not say 'I don't dislike it' because if it is becoming a meme, then it means that you are relevant in the public's mind and  If it is relevant and people are talking, then anytime in any video, because you will consume a lot of real estate in the future too, so you people have to take information within it, you can take webinars a little.  It can be done openly and the other way, then the last route is of paid consultation for those who are totally stranded and have to restructure their portfolio, have to dispose of old things, have to take e- under construction, have to take close to position, have to take ready to  Have to move in small city or big city Have to take a plot in another state because there are many people who come from Bihar and from particular areas of UP, they do not want to take their place. Now if they want to take their place in a big city, then for them, Gurgaon should be the same, Pune should be the same, Ahmedabad should be the same, Bangalore should be the same because they have left their homes everywhere, they do not want to settle there and keep doing jobs in all these cities.  If you are interested then you have to take that consultation, if someone is stuck in the commercial and does not want to get stuck or if there is some other decision making then we will help in that but now you will not get to hear which builder is good and which is bad in the coming times.  Because I learned a lot from Young YouTube, as I told you in the beginning with the disclaimer, whatever it is, it is a big honor for you that you have put so much mind into writing such good English, how did you free yourself from Panda and that thing too.  I liked it very much that you show him only the points and seconds. I want to show it to the public because after showing it, he will not like it, he will think that you have told everything, then what are you telling me? You have already said that.  brother, all this is like this  He is Janal Fernal hai apna dima laga leo mere toh phir tu toh so I know there is a compulsion that punt and second should be shown. Okay but give me a little bit, we can change the delivery. You can tell me the things in that video of my builder.  The intended one is a blanket, you can check it on any page, I have not told anyone in it that it is bad, it is ok, it is a general video, you can check it, if you want it, you can tell me.  so you can be mine  If you are in groups, I should tell you the same, I should give the information in the same way, I can give it only one on one because the information we can get from RERA is in the open domain only, but no one has told me, no one has taught me like this.  That you should check this way, you should like the video, subscribe, subscribe to the channel, there is respect for everyone, everyone who comes has the intention to learn something, whose only work is that it happens to many, if the stomach is not cleared then the anger has to be removed.  someone someone  Neither will we release any video beyond that which came earlier. Real estate is something like a feeling that we are left behind in life if we are not able to buy it and there is a lot of pain in it, I am very comfortable with this pain. Accustomed with this pain of a normal person that a thing worth one crore comes, you don't even talk about anything below two and a half rupees, it does n't affect anything even in that, it went away at three and a half, what happened, suddenly the land is gone now.  The affordable housing resale positions that have come are going for 7580 lakhs. The affordable housing in Gurgaon that has come out was for 2021 lakhs, the smaller ones are 500, 550 feet, 650 feet and till now perhaps a position of 645 square feet has been found. No, I think it is fine till now and the one which is slightly smaller in size is being traded in the same sector, what is its rate?  Tell me brothers and sisters, what is the rate of this tulip 11? Anybody, rat rat, last I knew, it comes in 20, 21, 22, there are two small sizes in it, so who among you is staying, then crowd crowd, I will tell you all the things in detail.  Now tell me the latest rate, I will make interactive videos on many things, some of you can take membership of my channel, beyond that there are reviews of the videos.  In these good top projects, I have also explained the target price that if you do this then you will definitely watch it and in it you will also get many webinars, recording workshops and you will also be a part of the upcoming paid ones to learn.  Thank you very much for"

    "title": "03 Top Real Estate Markets For  Investors  This 2024 [gIqb2Bkyb5E].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, the three real estate markets are the ones I am bullish on in this 2024. I will cover them. Let's start from number three. Now everyone will say, hey, we know who is your number one. No, whoever you think is my number one is mine. Number three is Gurugram. Gurugram on number three is fine. Guru in Gurugram, Guru in Gurgaon, high tick prices are coming in Gurgaon. These are the only options. Supply is very limited. Apart from that, I have also made a video on supply separately.  I will tell you how much goods have been sold and what game is going on, but here the controlled supply is being taken out. Builders have become very smart, they take RERA in different phases and things come under control in a day or two.  Those things which are said to be sold in one or two days also require an effort of one or two months, so it takes one or two months of effort to get everything done in two days and despite that things are still left, sold, sold, so many people came.  Then  But that material is not more than 15-20 rupees. If the project is to be made for four to five to six years, then the sustainable team will sell it easily. So this market is at the third level. There is not much supply. It is an artificial thing. Call it luck or method wise, now I am not going to put any conspiracy theory in it unnecessarily, but the fact is that the supply has stopped a lot, how has it stopped, why has it stopped, let us discuss it. Look, Deen Dayal's new schemes have been stopped, a big player is not coming here, he always comes here, he has come, he has come, ripped apart, everyone swears by him from morning to evening, sends 150 messages to every person, 150 people.  Every day, okay, that money making machine is kept cool, okay, you know the matter, so its supply is not coming from anywhere, okay, Deendayal has been closed, how many days has passed since the third builder floor?  Clarity is not coming, the third will be made, the fourth will be made, now it has come, now due to its affair, those active players in the market, those who came from Delhi, the builders of Delhi, who used to come, buy plots, build four floors and sell them, that cycle has completely ended.  Went because the cycle of buying a plot, getting the map approved, building a house, giving OC, getting individual registered is a cycle of three and a half years. If someone is very fast, he will build it in one and a half years, otherwise it takes at least two years and this is  Due to the ban imposed by NGT, nothing is built before two years, even four builder floors were not built, because construction does not happen for three-six months, there is no supply in the market in the period of two years.  There is no supply, is there no place for supply, but whatever land deals have been done are fine, they have been done at expensive rates, so now whatever goods are going to come, they are going to come at expensive rates and  Middle class has been out- priced, Rice is emerging as a city of rich people, that brother, this is below, otherwise many people are getting the feeling of sour grapes, it is also a matter of pain, I too am not taking any resolution.  I always wanted, I still want that something from the middle class should come, the matter may be tight or small, but why is it not coming? If you want a separate detailed video on that, then definitely a comment will be made on it. Write on the section that friend, tell us this phenomenon, the prices of resale are like this, the price of money is like this, there is a difference between the two, I am the number one clarity giver, no one can explain it to you. If these questions are coming in your mind then definitely ask that this  The launch is here, the resale is here, what is this, go buy it here, can't find it, tell me what is going on, Guruji, if you explain it properly then you will explain it properly and no one will get confused.  Let's do this, there are some real estate channels here, mine is from Gurgaon and is from Pan India, I am only giving the knowledge of real estate, okay, however, on one of my gram groups, I had done a poll about who is my subscriber, about 50 55. Interested in Gurgaon, interested in other cities and if you have not joined that Telegram group, then please join in the comment section beyond that. Polls, Polls and all  Things happen, I told the second city Gurgaon, the second city on which I am bullish is Bangalore, it has the highest rental demand, no one wants too many amenities, but they want a basic house, now people with amenities have also started coming, okay, there is a very high demand for rental.  So I have heard that earlier it was for six months, now I heard that they take advance rent for 8, 9, 10 months, let's find out your 10th and 12th marks, find out why.  Landlord, I don't know whether he will score more marks in 10th or not. Lincoln's profile is checked regularly and instead of giving the profile, it seems as if getting a job is easy in Bangalore and buying a house is difficult. This is the calculation being done.  Those who are people of Bangalore or have experience of Bangalore, what I am saying is right or wrong, please write that after Corona, they worked from home and some people came first and this one.  It means returning with a bank, so there are some products which I keep covering, you people are connected with me, you people are watching me yourself who are connected till now, I am coming for the first time in a public platform and am telling this with the name left.  Because the public will keep talking about somewhere, we can connect with people anywhere and people have understood the inclination of the people. It was the first more advantage. Now it is 2024. In the last two-three months, many people have bought very good value for money things.  Have bought and that will have to come out of your comfort zone. If you are from Fatehabad or from somewhere else, you do not have the budget, you are from Gurgaon, you cannot buy now, so you will buy something somewhere, if your children will work, then Bangalore is my number.  Two are okay, it's okay in the top three destinations, okay, I could have done 10 as well, I could have given that city only seven or 10 are useful, so I chose to do only three, the top city where I am now.  Am bullish Am bullish on 2024 which I feel is very value for money One I am bullish I am not saying that in the next three years you will get returns in this order May be Gurga will give you the highest returns Ok or may be I am covering three cities, it is possible to give fourth, fifth or sixth city, of course it is fine but the return means the price is not increasing but I am telling you that as per the risk reward ratio.  These are the low hanging fruits that I am telling you, these three things that I am telling you are safe here, genuine and speculating of risk, you take the reward which you are like to get, what is its equation, what is its ratio, it is very favorable here yes in  Some micro market of some other city you may get more returns because returns are very with in that city also returns of micro market of Dwarka Expressway will be very from  Golf Course Extension Will Very From Sona Road And New Gurgaon And Sona And Anywhere Else Okay So Top City Which Is Top City Is Top City Of India And Declared By Government Of India And Recently People Who Are Connected To Me Have Been  Covering that city very very what say in detail lot of prod top builders again listed place and I find it very value for money name of that city is yes Pune is ok  It is a historical city, a cultural city, used to be the capital of Peshwas, it is the second city of Maharashtra after Mumbai, it has the number two units sold, after MMR in its quantity it is okay, so a lot of units are being sold, there is a lot of demand, absolute price at Cosmoprof 11 to 12  I am predicting there will be a CAGR of 3 to 4 years but since you get into a good under construction project and your money goes over  A Period of Four Years in a Payment Plan Which is Even Lets Se Construction Link and Sum 20 30 40 This type of plan so when you calculate these returns of 10 11 12 par also you will realize that your actual returns are 16 to 17 par these  Are Low Hanging Safe Routes Risk Reward Ratio Ticket Size in Favor  Less then and CR in many of them that choice is not coming in late from daily NCR in Gurgaon there is nothing now other than that may be if you get any affordable housing in the draw plot you know chhach eight eight 1010 times and subscription be  And subscription is happening even in people having Rs.6-7-7 crores, so here the story is different, there you will get choice, there you will get some choice. This does not happen in Pune. The project came in two days and was sold out in three days. Like this, there is no fire there, neither the sellers are on fire, nor the buyers are on fire, nor the builders are on fire. Everything goes on peacefully, it comes with ease.  The product is explained, seen, choices are made and it is sold slowly because you all know that any product cannot be made before 4-5 years, high rate minimum, so much time will be required, 4, 5, 6, 6 on the lower side.  and six on the may  B. If the higher side of a good player is fine, then the things keep selling comfortably in that amount, the rate keeps increasing every quarter, and how is the rate increasing comfortably every quarter, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, it is okay to do it like this, depending.  On which quarter is it, if it is reduced in the same, then it becomes two and a half, if it is big, then four is big, this is the case there, and it is big, for a retail investor who is buying a property for the first time, this is a very good thing for him, I can say this.  would like  The one who is a youngster is taking a loan. Buy one construction is good for BH, it is a bit expensive, it crosses crores, it touches crores, at some places it is available even for 99 lakhs. It is okay, depending on Pune, basically one of yours.  West Pune, East Pune, it is okay, one is your Hinjewadi IT area, that one is in Kharadi and that one is in the other area, everyone has their own story, it is okay in Pimpri Chinchwade, Hadapsar area.  Pune is getting this IT and your manufacturing's both stories are playing out. There is manufacturing of vehicles here and also the system of IT is going on. Okay, so if there is a requirement of mix and match, then there are a lot of youngsters in this ticket size.  There are many and Pune is the Oxford of the East. It is also the education capital. There are many education institutions from your MBA.  There are a lot of government people with doctorate, engineering people, all kinds of them and the climate is very good, unlike Bangalore's climate is also good, in Bangalore there are conflicts in big cities, everything is fine, in NCR it is 1500, there is traffic in Bangalore, but the weather.  It is very good that they will be from big cities, they will be a constant work in progress since there are more people there, hence there is a problem, otherwise buy somewhere in Rajasthan, where there is no one, then the rates do not increase there.  If people don't come then it has no meaning, then Pune has been declared the number one city of India. The government, which is its urban ministry, tests those parameters on 100 parameters in the second week of August. The complete report is on the top 100 cities which run beyond them. They have done that in that too, Pune is number one, so I am bullish on this three, which are your favorite cities, I will cover all the cities, whoever comes in the top 20, which one is yours?  Put it all over India, pan India knowledge and work is also ok, Kolkata is not the eastern one, now I work, I go till Guwahati, it is ok and if you have to go to the East from Guwahati, then go there too, Shillong will also go, you will go everywhere, you will go everywhere.  Everything about the place has to be mentioned, but what is it for the investor? What is the value for money thing for the investor? So Chennai will also be covered, Hyderabad will also be there, you will go to Jaipur, Bhopal, Ranchi. Want Ranchi, tell the name of your city, tell the name of the city, it happens to be my favorite, these are my favorite picks, I think it is value for money, it is for the story, but due to many reasons, many people want to take it in their same city, in Lucknow Chaper  Right now I am not able to cover both the cities, I like food, travelling, taking photos, but after doing that, some kind of project should come. You can't go and buy Hong Kong market, stock market and you know New York market, everyone should buy stocks.  L's take  Whether you or Microsoft have to take that share, it should be something, ultimately you will end up buying some piece of property which has to belong to a builder, so the renowned builders have not gone there yet but the inputs are coming in Indore Mumbai also.  Things I will cover: Mumbai is in great demand. Mumbai I haven't been covering for quite some time but in the new year, all these cities which have come out of my mouth. These names will definitely be covered. There is great demand.  Tri City is also coming Tri City Pay I am not bullish It is a home for many retired people Himachal people take Punjab Government Retired people of Haryana Government live there No one's children will come Jobs No dead space is being generated  I have come here after seeing it, I have no taste, no desire, but there is a lot of demand. When I did my survey on Telegram and I got thousands of votes there, it was  The demand definitely came, now there is a demand, so I will cover it. It's like I am saying that I do n't like this Balushahi, I am fine, I am saying eat Anjeer ki Barfi but come to me, Balushahi, many people come to the shop.  You have a sweet shop, you are asked which one is good, you tell me that mine is good, but you still have to buy it, you want to know, I will do it, okay, but then don't make me do it, if it's the same.  It is okay to invest and those who are in jobs to live themselves because what is the region, many of them are related, those women want to take them to their maternal house, that poor person is doing a government job somewhere, he is not there, no, Chandigarh and where is Chandigarh?  Can take I don't think any of you can buy a house in Chandigarh No Chandigarh What to talk about Zirakpur is not Chandigarh Mohali is not Chandigarh Kharar is not Chandigarh Panchkula is not Chandigarh Central  Eight sectors on the road and where can we buy that one, what an expensive program it is and only three floors and two and a half floors will be built, there will be no separate floor registry, they will have their own Tantalus and the whole program and everything, all that is good but brother where is it there?  If you are buying in Zirakpur, you will say to yourself, 'If you let it remain Chandigarh, then whom are you fooling? Do n't let it remain Chandigarh, Zirakpur is not Chandigarh like Najafgarh is.  Not Delhi, that is to say, Narela, Najafgarh, everything is Delhi, Mangolpuri Pat, everything is Delhi, it is Delhi where we live, BB is rational, it means, where do we live in real estate, because one should be there, pick up and go there, money will not be there.  It would not taste good, that is why I was not covering the rest of the places where there is demand in the market. The rest of the data I have is from Comcert and I am doing this only in Gurgaon market.  There are so many people connected there, everyone is connected there, this was one thing, but still if you want and you want to write, then I will do Jaipur again the same thing, that government itself was not right, now double engine government is coming, no.  So, it used to be like this, but it is a lease work in Jaipur too, I would like to know the details, I will tell you that many people are stuck in the land of plots outside Ajmer Road, I don't know, since last 15 years, nothing, rate weight increased, ok.  There is a lot of organic growth in Jaipur. If you want to cover real estate also, I will do it. There are one or two players, there are listed players, they are fine, Jagatpura area is fine, Mansarovar area is fine, Vaishali area is fine, things there.  There is something, it's okay, people from outside want to do it, it's okay, something is coming up in Jhotwa too, it is being built there too, but it is organic growth, no one from outside is coming, what about Jaipur? It is of the people of Rajasthan only, so it is an organic growth, there is nothing of our own because I will tell you in detail about the tourist places too, they come from outside, eat, drink and go, do not settle down, this is also an affair, it is not that IT is coming there. Manufacturing is coming, there is nothing like this, there is no story, see all of you, you have to understand one thing in real estate investment, first of all, before the good and the bad, ask this brother, what is the whole story?  Will the stories be true, will they not be true, how true will they be, what is the probability, that is a later matter, but there must be a story, even if it is false, there must be a story. Don't go to two places and cities where there is no story, there is no one to tell the story.  Story Hai Geet To Bayah Ke Saare Saache Nahi Hote Hamare Haryana There is a saying in Haryana that all the songs sung during wedding do not turn out to be true Aisa hoga waisa hoga Aisa na ho jaaye waisa but some songs  Have to be still with you No one is singing songs, no one is listening to stories, no one is swearing, no one is making promises, then do you have anything, then it is possible that 100 promises may be made, 90 may be spoiled.  10 It's okay somewhere like Gurgaon is. Gurgaon is a very good story. It is playing out in different ways at different levels. You can cross check. There is a coherent story. What is happening is always when ever you invest in any city The first thing when you have to understand that And here I come as the number one clarity giver The first thing I tell in all my What ever things I do Is what is the story  Let me tell you the story first because whenever you invest in any stock, invest anywhere, pick any stock in your life, stock means equity share market, take something from that company.  There should be some story, there should be a story of the promoter, what do you have to do brother, what do you have to do next, we will do this, we will do that, there should be something, how probable is it, will it be deciding the risk reward ratio, man, how many stories has he told before?

    "title": "05  Fresh Factors Which Drive Real Estate In Near Future [bs_h0WhBVrs].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, some positive things on real estate. First of all, you all know that the news has come, so I will tell you about that one. Apart from that, I am seeing two to three to four more things that real estate is going to take off.  Now tell me how many of those things do you agree with, then first of all I will start the benefit of indexation, although I had made many videos on those videos, I feel like clapping if you have seen those videos of mine, then you will agree with me.  You can clap and write well about me, it feels very good, no no, I am not a narcissist, but this is how I enjoy, okay in writing, if you enjoy writing like this, then write MG, okay MG, you guys write.  You can say that I had said in many videos on indexation that friend, give both or choose, the government has done this and this is the clapping of the government and this will boost the sentiment of real estate. So this was my number one but this.  Most of the people knew that there will be a boost because look, practically there was not much loss due to it, but now the sentiment also got better because many people were doing calculations, many have profit at Rs 125, many have profit at Rs 20.  The calculation was going on differently, now the government has said that whoever has the benefit, take it, it is a very good thing, it is a very good thing, after that now the property that will be taken will be based on Rs 125. So fair enough good enough ok now let's talk about the second thing and what else is happening brothers and sisters what else is happening on 15th August I have full hope that some such announcement will be made which will make the real estate go up, it may be just a figment of my imagination.  Maybe, but I feel that something like this will happen, this is the second point, then the third thing will happen from this, anti- immigration sentiment is going on in Europe, people from outside are being targeted, directly, indirectly, NRIs.  The sentiment will shift towards buying property in India. This is a very important point. I am not saying that they are going to come from there. I am also not saying that so much is happening that they will have to come, but that  You see, this riot is going on and on in the UK, look at the rest of the places, see my NRI brothers in every country, what are you feeling? Please write in the comment section because of crowd sourcing.  This is information, it will just help us because I am in touch with many people, there are a lot of consultations with many people and those sentiments are coming, so the interest of NRIs is coming in real estate which is a little less before the elections and  It was gone, now it is starting again. It's the beginning of a trend. Again I see it increasing towards Diwali. Okay, third thing. Rumblings of recession in the US.  They have started talking about whether or not there will be a recession in the US, the percentage of recession coming is at 60, the chance is at 70, but I am seeing 100% chance of one thing and you tell me whether you feel or not that the US Fed will  There is US Fed which controls the interest rate etc. like our RBI, it will cut the interest rate by 100 basis points. 100 basis points means BPS.  1 But if that cut comes late, in September or October, then within 15 to 20 days of its cut, brothers and sisters, write it down somewhere. If it is cut, RBI will also cut it in 15 to 20 days. We are just cut and copy paste, yes.  Yes and that has to be done because the global economy and all that, they will not focus on economics, they will talk about real estate, as soon as it is cut, sentiment will run again. Practically, I have one thing.  Let me tell you practically publicly, I normally avoid telling this about my paid workshops. Practically, it doesn't matter the interest rate. I feel like we have to look at the period of 15 years, it will increase, decrease, increase, decrease, all that happens and people don't pay in a year. But the whole game is of sentiment, they feel that something good has happened, otherwise no such magic is happening but still it makes a difference and it is played on sentiment only.  If this is the case then the interest rate is also certain to reduce. In any case, the Indian government will also get a boost towards real estate. I also have some cent state governments and this idea in the coming time, through this video, before the implementation of the code of conduct.  I want the government of Haryana and the government of Maharashtra and BJP is the government at both the places and from this video I have an idea and also a request to reduce the rate of registration now.  You are not going, elections are happening now, you will win or lose, time will tell, how much should be reduced, I will tell you, cut 3 for women, 4 for women, 4 for men and 5 for men, circle rate has to increase, increase it.  Cut it later but now, and this is within the budget. Nirmala ji has also encouraged all the states to reduce it. When you see that the prices of real estate have increased so much, then that rate can be cut because  still one he  Very recently, if the thing of indexation has been done and they were talking about black black, all that will end, it will not happen, because if indexation comes then that will happen, then people will take it from there with more transparency, if it is a thing worth one crore, then they will give one crore rupees. Will give it to you at 4 instead of hacky- packy, break its incentive at 7%, instead of doing direct work, get it at 3, friend, get the rate of registry for women at 3. Next  All the deals will be done well and that whole economy will come into the real economy instead of the parallel economy. That money will give an increasing spill over effect and I feel that this will be done and if it was not being done till now then it will be done in this video of mine.  Through this I am giving the idea and I will give more emphasis to this idea and put it in the comment section and share it, somewhere it will reach the ears of the person who can do it or will reach that group. and this  After watching the video, he will talk in his meeting, then do the right thing, whatever benefits the party, benefits the people, benefits the state, benefits the country's economy, if it benefits the country, then that work should be done, isn't it worth asking about it? What is the benefit, only the benefit, yes, there is the benefit, how much will the common man be happy, where were they paying so many rates for the registry and now where will you reduce it so much, it makes a lot of difference, now I will save ₹ lakh on the registry of two crores, which I have.  those on three four 5 Formula has been arrived at, man will feel very good, if someone saves ₹ lakh, he would try to do this thing, I would like it to happen and this thing will move the trend of real estate forward and from what I see real estate growing in the future?  I am here, the wedding season is coming, October November December, I have started a campaign and have been doing it for a long time, but I promise you all, this is me alone, one she, which one has come, someone has come, a web series has come, only one person has come.  is enough Manoj Bajpayee's One Man Is Enough, One Man Is Enough, I will spread the advice of not spending too much on weddings and that is the model, so much so that people will buy houses on weddings, many people will not spend on weddings.  This is the new generation, they ca n't afford it from their own salary. No, will they get a flat worth Rs 80 lakh even on marriage? Yes, it is possible to get a flat worth Rs 80 lakh for Rs 20 lakh. Yes, it is worth Rs 80 for Rs 20 lakh.  I will tell you the calculation when a person's down payment is made, support is taken, loan is taken, rent is availed, income tax benefit is taken, the ocean is filled with every drop, pick up a lehenga worth Rs 3 lakh or pick up marigold flowers.  Plant lily flowers in place of that, no marriage is going to work great, I am only a marital consultant, I also settle marriages, if it is okay to fight, then those marriages work very well where the house is in the beginning.  There should be no conflict, the house should be found and the girl should have it, the boy should also have it, and the parents of both should give as much as they wish with devotion. I am not asking here to invent any new tradition by saving unnecessary expenses of the marriage itself and to add new expenses.  I am not saying this to the parents, I am saying that the parents should decide that yes, we can invest this much in the wedding, now here through my videos, I will spread this thing so much that there will be a demand in real estate. Any  There is no need to increase the rates of real estate, there is no need to speculate, but now very good small units will come, whatever property is worth Rs. 60, 70, 80, 90 lakhs in big cities, it is in LAX, in big cities, the advice is to buy it wherever you can.  You are getting it in the city, it is not necessary that you live in that city, otherwise what is the use? Hey brother, it is hedging, you have taken the house, you have taken Mavan Construction, the top builder has taken it for 100.25 years.  There is life and big money, Kanyadaan's gift is visible and all this has been put in it and once this thing is told in the society that it is dusty, I have also suggested this to the government many times and now in future I will do many more videos.  I have different channels through this medium, you can also subscribe Guruji from Gurugram, if you have not done so then I have launched a campaign where I will tell the government that the couples who 90 days after marriage, 90 marriages have taken place today. If Vidan takes the property in 90 days, then waive his stamp duty, registry, or waive off GST, or give someone a subsidy for it. Give three things in the 90 days of marriage, if you have that.  We can see that booking is done, date is done, BBA is done, so if you take the figure of 90 days or even 180 days, then 90 to 180 days are included in it.  We will give rebate in GST, we will give rebate in stamp duty and we will also give subsidy inside the home loan. If you get Rs 85 from outside then we will give you Rs 72. These three-four things will help you. Couples will take it and the economy will do very well, just a little bit has to be encouraged, a little here, a little here, a little here, the government has given a little, the boy's father has given a little, the girl's father has given a little, the girl has given her  Got the FD broken, some boy adopted it, some got it from some relatives, some relatives gave it to me, some how many relatives come, tell me brother is buying a house, they make it a tradition in the country that if a house is being bought, then  It will be done at the home side and in the family where the marriage will take place, if you come through the house, then everyone will see the house being built and how good it will be that we have given you a rate of ₹ 1000000 square feet in this house, suppose it is from somewhere or 6000.  8000 square feet is 12000 so sir, I gave you one square feet, aunt gave three square feet for nephew, uncle gave 5 square feet, what are those square feet, how much is the house, it is 1000 square feet according to the carpet, if we stay  The rate depends on the carpet or two BHK. I am not asking you to make it very lavish, I am trying to keep it at a reasonable rate, but what a great idea.  Write how many square feet it is. Yes, it is 700 square feet. Okay, how many square feet are you? It happens in weddings, many times it is said that so and so gave so much, this one gave so much, this one gave this much. There is a record too, so that brother, you.  How many square feet did you give? 7 square feet, 5 square feet. What a great idea. I will make a separate video for this too. I will do such ideas by doing them by doing them by making people practice them. People will take them. Don't take unnecessary things like a car.  Even if the car is bought, a second hand car will also work. Take father's old car or someone else's. It will work. Once you take it to the house, the fecal matter will become a strong joint and there will be no tension. The house may be ready to go.  If you move in, even if it is under construction, it will take three to four years to buy even in under construction. If the money is spent and it is big, initially the payment has come at Rs. 30, 40, 50, then it is at Rs. 20.  I will still save both in 4 years, after that, I will take a little loan, I will get some income tax rebate, I will save some rent, the house is done, what else, if you set a target only then it will be fulfilled, otherwise, I will keep thinking at any time. Earlier also I made a video that this people will never be able to buy flats and houses on their own, I was going to write that further but I left it in that part so that the clicks remain British, they will not be able to buy all this on their own, they will need help.  If you don't help them and the society, otherwise this generation will not be able to buy, then they will keep paying rent, the rent will keep increasing, then you will get trapped in the trap of doing another job to earn more money, rent will keep increasing in Bangalore, Pune, Gurgaon.  How much have the rents increased? They have increased a lot in the last two-three years. The backs are with a bank. The supply is decreasing so much. The rents are increasing and people are being asked to pay the money for their security deposits.  If there is no money, then the rent will increase further, this will definitely happen, so I hope these were three-four points, which ones did you like, which ones did you think would be positive and you will see the change, this is the promise from this.  I will come and comment on how much cap layout will be, yes brother, it has increased so much, it has increased not so much, it has increased so much, it has increased like this, I will also tell you, but these were all the factors, I hope you will understand the factors, what do you say?

    "title": "05 Mistakes Wives Are Committing In Property Selection [gUf8VJXQnWo].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, five points in which housewives are making mistakes during property purchase decision. Women, wives who are approaching wrongly. Five points that all husbands have to listen to and share with their wives. You are not making many mistakes because you are going to buy property.  If you are living alone then the decision is not taken, then housewives or working wives too, what about a mix of both? Issues are coming and coming and you are not making this mistake because real estate is on a boom, real estate will not weigh you for your mistakes, so let's start first. First mistake is happening. Are you going to buy a new house? Talking about cities, if you are going to buy a flat, then you are comparing it with your current house. Where you live on rent, you are living in the same way. The prop is being compared with the current house. It is being compared according to the size of the current house.  If so, then you will never be able to buy the old flats. The sizes of the flats which are coming now are bigger, everything is smaller. This is the hard reality. Of course the specifications get better, the efficiency gets better and why are the housewives not able to buy this?  No, the housewife is able to say yes, I am saying it again and again, wives will also do, because the issue for single ladies too is that their belongings should be according to that house, a fact of life. Give you a small cupboard, give a big one, give two, give five, give everything, fill it according to the availability, the goods are spread according to that, this is a fact, then it is possible that you have spread the goods so much.  According to the house, if you don't see that stuff fitting with the new house, you may have a sofa, maybe a bed from your wedding, or some furniture, like if people roam around in the wedding lake, then they are no longer in those houses.  It may fit there but you will have to buy a new one here  This is the advice to avoid this first mistake. The advice is this, do not think of your existence. If it is not cheap then spend two to three lakhs more according to the energy mix of that house. If you understand that according to that house that It should be L shaped, it should be low, it should be a little bigger, what size should be the dining table, what shape should it be, a new furniture, new curtains, new curtains should be taken accordingly, do not try to fit the old one.  It will always be out of place or decision making will not be possible because if you get a house of that size or bigger than that, then what is the mistake, then it is money, the problem is that the desire is of the current one because every person wants it. Even if I am living on rent, I should go to a bigger room than the one I am living in or a bigger one but that is becoming difficult. Secondly, ladies are very unhappy with the kitchen when they see the size because  It is agistified but a utility kitchen has come on it, you can keep a dish washer, plus the system that has come now which was not there earlier, if you go to your kitchen, your shelf used to be only up to 7 feet and the top 3 feet was empty, the matter is yours.  Look in the kitchen, most of the people have the same work in their kitchens and modular kitchens are less and there is also issue of cylinder. In big cities, now pipe gas lines are coming everywhere, so a lot of space is going to be freed up for cylinders too. This will also become a problem.  Fact is plus which above  Nowadays, there is such a system at that height that if you press something, the thing comes down. Every day you do not have to climb up with a CD on, that system itself comes down. Nowadays, the modeler in the kitchen rotates that thing.  There is a lot of work to do behind it, so the utilization of space can be more efficient than what is happening in your current kitchen, then the kitchen can exist comfortably on my 2 feet slab. At two and a half feet, there is a little space to work, then that comes to the height of 2 feet, your storage space, that goes up to the height of 7 feet, now you have 3 more feet to come, so think of the amount of storage space you have in the kitchen.  You should know your existence, in this, you and the utility kitchen have their own advantage, utility balcony has its own advantage which is coming these days, the kitchen is getting smaller, but the utility balcony is being given, this is the third mistake women often make in their  of the job  I feel like taking a pass, that is a legitimate requirement of mine, but the problem is that the place where you are working may be an already established place, it may be a very mature established place, there are no new launches in buying or assisting property.  If the price is very expensive then you will not be able to buy it in that case and the problem in this is that initially what the youngsters are doing is what I was telling in the consultation that they should own the place where they want to live.  If you want to do and stay, going near the job, all these things are not sustainable, then brother, if you do not have money, then you can take your own TVH somewhere far away, which is an upcoming location, and rent it in the same city. Pay it off and live here yourself. Look after you hit 48 50 and your kids grow up. That's the time you can't move around the house. Till then, concentrate on building your wealth. If you're in your If you are in your late 20's and 30's then you can apply this formula because otherwise what will happen to you, you will not be able to survive, you will never be able to take a decision, you will also need a pass, but if you are not able to come then you will fall at so many thousand feet.  You will not be able to buy, what you could have bought, you did not buy, the rates have also increased, now nothing is bought because this is what is happening, no, no, no, no, I give this example only to explain to the ladies. Madam, you wanted to buy a set of seven tolas, seven tolas of gold is fine, you liked it but you don't have that much money, so I am saying, if gold is rising then buy five tolas, you at least take something, husband.  If you are in a mood and have money worth five rupees then take it and see later or maybe only five rupees will seem good to you or maybe gold will become so expensive that people will like even sets of three to four tolas and your five rupees will be fine. Be this also this one inside real estate  This can also be a thing, okay, this was one thing, we will move ahead with this, the fourth point will be that you take whatever money is coming to you, there is no need to take too many loans, I tell people that if you stay for 4 years.  If you take a loan under construction then according to me you should not take more than 60 to 70 loan. You should not exceed 60 to 70 of the property. So this is the target you have to achieve, bigger and bigger and bigger.  There is no limit to your belongings and furniture and storage space can be managed very well by making good use of carpenter and using imagination. This is the message and the last point which I think ladies should not do at all and  That word should not be spoken, after doing everything, no, yes, I am okay, then at the end comes a word, you see, nothing, a trauma, a husband, more than a. Listening to these three words, once a big decision is to be made in life, especially investment, especially buying a home, you should see it, I mean, what should he see so that if something goes wrong, then you had told me to see, the rest had shown displeasure before that.  Just think about that husband because I am also a marital counselor, you know there is a lot of work to do, look at the pain of the husband, earn money, get a job, go to a house to make him happy. Take care of your family and wife, you take a look, I am not liking it, it is small, it is a matchbox, madam, you have to work a lot for a matchbox, because of the job you do, most of the people do not say this dialogue.  This dialogue is like this, if a woman asks for a job then she will still come into ownership, now I will say that you are dividing the women also, yes this is also a fact, you see, not normally working ladies.  Because they speak, they still have the spirit of decision making that they also have to take decisions on the job, mostly this dialogue comes from the housewife, see it like this, see it like this, I don't know, you see, if something happens, don't tell me, then this is you.  There is a syndrome of watching, this is one, due to which I feel that housewives should get a sense of ownership of their husbands and take an intelligent decision that yes, this is what they are getting. Be realistic, I would like to say to those women, you did get married, you could have got a better husband than this one, but you settle at this, no, yes friend, it is looking fine, it is fine, it will not decrease, will it not?  So many girls keep waiting, they turn 35 and better and better and better, then after doing this and better and better, you have taken the decision of marriage that whatever you ultimately want, you waited, whatever.  Your qualities were your requirements, your luck was your wish, whatever you got, you did with it, similarly it is your property, no one will make it exactly tailor made for you so that you may like it but the rate should also be as per your choice, it is not possible that you will like it.  It may be that the rate, size and payment plan may not suit you and the one which suits you is keeping you comfortable in every way, you are saying that it is not fun, even if you buy a car, everyone will keep playing with you at home.  of  Will not give security because he tried once or twice, your tantrums were too much, then you also released that it is okay, we will live on rent and then we will do this, we do not want to live in this city, we will go with our parents, then that wife will get distracted.  She goes, hey, mother-in-law and father-in-law, we will have to go to Dehradun, we will have to leave Bangalore, leave Pune, leave Gurgaon, leave Mumbai or after doing this, what programs are coming, or will work from home not be possible again anywhere else?  If it won't happen then he will panic even then he will go away. If you have bought the house then maybe he will stay with you but you are not letting him buy the house then see mother in law and father in law also by the mercy of God 97  You will live for 98 years and then when you turn 65, you will have to serve him for 10-12 years. From your husband's retirement at 58 59 60 when you  R 55 and the mother-in-law till 77 only okay and she will live till 97 98 Do you understand why because she did not let her husband buy a house You will say that the one who looks at me is a big scoundrel Okay but if I had understood all the things  If I am, then I am giving entry to the women, look at them, understand that if you get home then you will have an excuse, how should I go, it is my house, it is not even my mother-in-law's house, she comes, yes, if anything happens, she You are happy in your home. If you are happy in your home, then keep it somewhere else because if you throw tantrums, then you will not get anything. Whatever is available to you, take whatever is available as per your budget, take it wherever you are, fire the rocket, it is done.  It will not seem ready already, it is not engaged, hold this rocket, do not wait that the booster of the rocket will end, when will it happen again, when no big house is going to come for you, the age of now unleashes till you start working or you earn a lot of money, your husband will love you a lot.  let's win some lottery Or parents can give money, if something great is not happening in people's life at 95, normal life is going on, normal salary increases, government people's salary increases at 3, rest of the people's salary increases a little more.  I'm tired of doing things."

    "title": "07 Things To Know Before You Buy Any Luxury Property In Gurgaon [iQHnuD6xYp0].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, if you want to buy a house or want to settle in Gurgaon real estate, then there is a different system of investment, but if you want to settle down, there are seven things you should know, especially the daily ones. If you do not know, then I will tell you through this video.  I will definitely tell you from the beginning and why I am making this video, I will tell you the secret in the end because no one makes a video like this in vain. Okay, so its secret, I will tell you in the end why I made the video and these seven things.  Address If you are from Delhi, want to leave Delhi and come to Gurgaon, want to come to live, you have to come to Gurgaon because you know I praise Gurgaon a lot and do all this, but today you people should know these seven things.  To the people of Delhi, especially to the women, to the men, to the father, to the mother, the first thing is to pay here in Gurgaon. Maids are very expensive in Gurgaon. Service providers are very expensive. Washermen are very expensive. Everything is like this.  These things are very expensive, they are very cheap in your Delhi, congratulations wherever you live, Shalimar Bagh, Karol Bagh, Punjabi Bagh, there are all these gardens, then there are many puris, then there are many more, there are many things left, right, there are many other things which are even more than this.  It is very expensive and very expensive and can trouble you. One problem that can arise is that the school fees are terrible. If I tell the average of the schools of Gurgaon, then the standard is less than the top schools of Delhi because the schools of Delhi are very old.  I do n't know how long the teachers have been there and the standards are better in the schools of Delhi, the hi-fi of the schools in Gurgaon is similar to the sets of Karan Johar, you will mostly see them, the atmosphere is like that of Student of the Year, the bathroom is big and good.  Clean AC, food and drinks are all good but very expensive, five star hotel type feeling, Rs 17,188,00 fee for one month for a child is a normal thing, that means it is a normal school.  You will not say 'Wow' to the school, ' Wow', whatever they are, now I will not create any controversy here by taking the names of the schools, only a few 'Wow' come, 32, 33, 35,000 and who are the others who are from Gurgaon, write so that the people of Delhi also know.  Come on, in Delhi, you get a cap, there is an uproar, in Delhi, if something is left, if it increases, the school fees here are very high because the children who are coming now, I know the secret of this video.  I have to tell in the end why I am telling, okay many people may think oh why am I telling so I will tell in the end okay then the school fees are very high because now you are coming youngster, you will give birth to children too and they will be here only.  If you have to study for 12 years then this third thing will be very important and will touch the hearts of the people of Delhi. Maintenance is looted in the condominiums of Gurgaon. Here, ₹ is a normal thing but square feet is normal, this is what is being built now.  If you are living in your own flat of 3000 square feet, then paying maintenance of Rs 24,25,000 after 4 years will not be surprising and Rs 8100 is a common thing now and this is if you live in Dwarka.  ₹ 800 and if you live in colonies or live on floors, then there is not even a drop, so there is a lot of difference because when it is the region, not when people from Delhi come.  So the people of Gurgaon do not have earned money, they have cash flow, people of Gurgaon, maintenance is something, very very very very, a red flag for the Delhi person because if he has sold the flat, you have sold the floor, you have got the money, who will pay for the monthly expenses?  It is like it is fine but who will get it maintained, who will pay for the insurance, who will drive it, if the father-in-law has given it, then that is the problem, then this thing is the fourth thing which is a little.  It may be that the classes may make noise but the fact is that it is a little gentrified, it is high-fi, that you will come here in the condos, that style, that jumping, that English speaking, that is something different, that you do n't know why these people have come here and  The joy of having a conversation in Delhi is not like that in the locality today, his mother or Sharma ji or Sharma ji's wife Mishra, the system is not like that, so one can feel a little out of place, especially in the elderly societies, no one.  Will even talk like this? This is the fifth thing, which is a small thing but very practical but it hurts the heart, that is, there is no public transport here in Gurgaon, much like your Delhi is not so well connected metro and metro vehicles.  They move to condos and live in expensive societies. There is parking available for two-two-three-three cars on each flat which is six six-seven-seven meters across the road. Then when people from Delhi buy it, their car is parked there. Karetta or below is the wealth of the vehicles parked here. Accumulated wealth is the generational wealth which you bought by selling. If cash is not followed then this one is a big mismatch. After that let's move ahead. Take peas, take carrots, take these, take kulchas.  Take this, you will not meet on the road like this when you stay in condos in Gurgaon, which you have all the facilities in Delhi, go out like this or pack two, do it like this, you are going there and that is its time.  It is fixed and this time is passed by ladies, that time of 11, 12, 1 o'clock, husbands of the day, everyone is busy, everyone is busy chatting, it seems like this atmosphere is not available in the condos, there is nothing in the condos.  They will make fine dining restaurants, they will make loot, Khasoli Chaat Papdi is nothing, for that you will have to go somewhere physically and wherever you go there will be 700 800  You will not get anything less than Haj 000, which can easily be bought for Rs 50-100 in Delhi, so brother, it is very expensive and the seventh and last region is main another region Cosmoprof culture. Don't know. Yes, people from India have come here and talk about hi-fi.  In these condos, we talk about something else and the wired connections will not be able to connect. Here, the work is different, the groups are different, the thinking is different, I am not talking about good or bad, I am telling this to the people of Delhi.  According to me, the people of Delhi, which is a more enjoyable thing, there is some advantage among the people of Delhi, right? You will not get to eat those chaat, papdi, samosas, momos, momos so ready, they will live in condos in hi-fi society. Who will bring your ready there, I do n't know.  Where will you have to go to get momos? In Delhi, go here, momos, go there, momos here, momos there, some burgers, all these things are available like this, you will not get them here.  If you live in condos, you will not get the taste, that is why parents will run away again, you should have known this thing. Now the most important thing comes that I made a video, why I made this video very easily, 2024 is coming, Gurgaon real estate is on fire. Half of the people of Delhi have set it, so I am sprinkling a little water on such a hot pan, I am not pouring the cold glass completely, I am sprinkling it so that it cools down or 18 200 Hz.  By doing this through this video, there is a new offer which will come within January, I have reduced its rates by Rs 1000 to 1500, you become a big boss, you will see 5 thousand people paying this rate, yes, only these are the ones who will take it.  And are they only from Delhi? They had to take it. How much is included in the product? When 900000 flats are launched, how many takers are there? The message reached them, it got a little cold, so a little, a little cold.  It is also important to come on time so that there is no fire like this. It cooled down a bit. Delhiites enjoyed it. Delhi is good. Metro will be available. Chaat Papdi will be available. Fees should be less. Mates and every buddy is less gentry as per his wish. Punjabi people can talk in Punjabi, Hindi people can talk in Punjabi, this people can do that without feeling, some hi-fi vehicles, no hassle of video, go out in your metro shuttle and at your comfort, no maintenance.  Do n't give anything brother, what is the money to give in your house, keep giving here 10 12 14 15 20 22 25, please tell me the identification, that is also very important, so we play chess from wherever the player wins, it is okay and play from any side.  Take it till you get checkmate, you will win from here also, you will win from here too, this is called higher order thinking, many people will think in this that you are the devil.  He is a manipulator and an influencer, whoever thinks whatever he wants to think, it is okay, there is no restriction on anyone's thinking, everyone has their own opinion, but these were seven practical points which were necessary to be told, children sometimes become educated, let's go to Gurgaon, heard earlier.  The slogan was, let's go to Delhi, now let's go to Gurgaon, these are the points and these are valid points. Cost of living in Gurgaon is very high.  Compared to Delhi and Delhi people, mostly those who do not have cash flows, especially those who are elderly, will find that spending money on ten things will pinch them, so they should be known, so its aim is also to give clarity to all of you on that topic.  If people get clarity then please let us know and share in the comment section. If you can join real estate webinars then we will give you opportunities through webinars.  Goes Pan India, it is said not only Delhi, Gurgaon, Pan India means top seven 10 cities of India, then if you have not joined that group yet, anyone is not on my ready group, tell me which point pinches you more, thank you.  Very Much"

    "title": "10 Factors To Be Considered In Property Purchase Decision [0U1-cwTOGbw].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, I have come up with 10 factors which are important in your property purchase decision. I am going to give a very good template which is applicable throughout the country. For the sake of simplicity, we will give equal weightage to everyone, however, when I do my reviews, I give a complicated version of it.  It has been prepared which I will not tell in this video because the weightage of each factor should be different.  I will give hints, there are 10 factors, you can give 10 numbers to each, so 10 * 10 or 100, then the total marks you can give out of that, the property reviews I will do for my subscribers will be for platinum members because it becomes price sensitive.  If the case is out of 100, then what is the topic? Those 10 things which are important to you, if you want to buy a property today, then first of all.  Coming for you is the brand. What is the brand of the thing you are taking? So brother, if you have to give marks out of 10, then for example, even if he is a listed player, his marks will be higher. Depending on how much of it he is, give marks from 9 to 10.  If you are not a listed player then it is less than that but if you are not then you can choose according to yourself, I have my own formula of seven or eight, my weightage is also different but I am not disclosing that, it will become complicated.  It will be very mathematical, the audience will not understand, okay, but I am bringing a simplistic for you people, once you understand it, decision making will become easier for you, when you pick up this car and roam around different products, so today I and the template  I am going to give my wife and you both together can give your numbers, in that way I am helping in that, brand is the first thing today which is very important that that Who is the player? Who is the builder? What is his brand? That is the first thing. Second thing is the location that we all know in real estate that his location is important in the city. Which city did he choose? Which is the location within the city? Is it the established location or  That location will become very established tomorrow, it will become bigger than established or it is a second- third level location but if it is useful for you, then you have to give that location, the third thing is important.  People don't give any value to it at all, but I value it on the third number. Everything is going on. It is not that the value of the third one is less than anyone else. I am going as per the order. Okay, so the site layout is the site layout of the project.  What is the shape, is it rectangular, square, quadrilateral or like burnt bread, is it Ada Tada Ada Tada type or some program of it, I don't know how is the site layout, is it important? What is touching, what is touching with the immediate project, that is important, okay, site layout is important, after that the fourth thing comes is the density, what is the density of the project, this is very important, how many flats are there in acre, how many units are there in acre, other wise you will never  Be Able to Compare: In the template that I am giving you, you can take 10 projects and write their answers and compare them like vehicles.  Let's not compare how much power is there, how much torque is there, what is KPL, what is the setting capacity, what are the safety features, vehicles are compared, mobiles are also compared in the same way, brother, how much RAM is there in it, how much is the memory. How much is the megapixel, what is the size, what is the screen size, I am bringing such 10 parameters for real estate, first of all I told you, brand, second is location, third is site layout, fourth is density, fifth is which. What is the layout of the unit you are buying? It is very important whether it has sunlight, is in the corner, is in the middle, is open from three sides or is open from only one side, from two sides like a builder floor.  If it is open from left or right, it is not open from the back. It is open from the front. So all that is important is how it is, on which side is the bathroom. There is something called efficiency of layout. I have made videos on this also. For platinum members, you can also take platinum membership if you want to understand things at a deeper level. Well, there is an efficiency of layout in the unit layout that every square foot is that space is being used or no furniture is being placed.  Is it or is it linking up the rest of the things? It did not stand in the design just like that, brother, I mean the gallery gallery is printed fine and there is loose space in it, that is not much, I have seen builders since 40's.  80 square feet is wasted just because they cut the design it is better some in cases upto 100 square feet is lost due to compulsion so that is very important because every square feet is being paid for ok unit layout after that in the project  What are the amenities? It is very important what kind of stuff you are getting, how is the club house, how are all the amenities and then type of construction.  Which one is my one construction, which is non my one construction, what kind is it, old, good, is it with AC blocks or ACC blocks, okay, what kind is it, that is very important, okay, then comes the next eighth point, payment.  What is the plan, what is the ease of buying what you are getting, whether you are comfortable with its payment plan, sometimes what happens with the payment plan, it is like this, I have understood everything but that is like money. You are being asked for, you cannot give some times, you are being asked for money, you can, it is so easy for you, the plan is such that you say, I will take it because I can actually buy some times, it comes down to payment  Plan only datchi release today the marketing going on it is really focused on payment plan because it is about ease of buying see whoever has full money in the bank is the one  On other things, he will throw complete tantrums that this is not right, that is not right, but what happens in the payment plan is that sometimes you cannot buy that thing and can buy this and it is better to buy something than not buying anything in a bullish market.  People get attracted to the payment plan and this payment plan now a days from the builder side has become the big because some times what happens they cannot control the site layout, the land found is looking the same, now the density in that site layout is  They can suck all the FR they get, they will take out all the density, they can't do anything, if they bought the site, then the builder can't do anything about the location. Look from the builder's point of view, it's his brand, brother, it's his brand, he can't do anything with it, okay.  The amenities can also be given as much as he can give in the project, he will not reduce more than that, he will have to give it with his own money, then the only thing which is in the hands of the builder, which he can use the most for marketing.  The payment plan is so datchy so this is something which I wanted to bring out. Okay, ninth point is this is very important. Don't take it in a classist way. It is very important to take it pragmatically. Who will be the gentry in that project? Is it the investor who is bearing the entire burden? Brother, then different types of people will come as tenants, end users should go more towards end users, many projects are only about air flow, like Great Noida, the entire urban air flow.  All the investors have come there and they are lying beaten up because of the rent and the person who had taken it by doing so, now the class social class economic status he used to belong to, people of different economic status are living there because of this.  The story of the city doesn't work out, it's a fact that you will collide with this point of identification, you will collide with them in the lobby, you have to live with them, they will be inside the RWA and the same people will not pay for the maintenance. People living with social status and mental mindset are important. It is very important. If a youngster enters a society where only uncles and aunties live, then brother, he may still not feel that comfortable. Perhaps the things he wants are not wanted by those people. They don't want the same end and they are sitting in RW, so no one thinks about this point. When I do the review, I definitely think to the end that this one is good for this one, this one is good for them, that one is good for them.  It's okay and nowadays products are made like this, it's okay so what is it because your status is here and it is like to be here and you buy a property at this status and may be slightly lower so when your status becomes this then you can't  Stay in this society, this is the truth of life, then sell again and you will end up paying GST registration cost, brokerage cost for selling, come home today, it will not happen that oh mistake  It's done, I took it, I didn't like it, sold it and bought it again, it's not like that, its fixed cost is very high, it's like buying a jewellery, now the gold is worth Rs 50,000, it may be worth Rs 60,000, but you have already paid the making charges, pay GST.  Gave it all, you got that 62,63,000 rupees, then you said oh, this is rubbish, brother, change it, now let's change it.  If you go then it will be exchanged according to gold worth Rs 50000 and even if Rs 55000 becomes gold then you are at a loss because you had got Rs 63, so people have to pay a lot of attention to this thing, this is the gentry of project and last but not the least one thing.  We Learned in Gujarat Price Bhava Bhagwan Ch heard everything, saw everything but finally price will decide and it is the maximum weightage you have to buy.  Something that is value for money you have to buy something which is a good project at a good price Steel price will not be available in the bullish market The thing with steel price will cost 100% It is not necessary that the thing which is available is expensive.  Is it good or is it value for money? It is not true but whatever you think is cheap, there are certain things which you are missing out. I am giving the template, there is something missing, it should strike you, how can it happen like this, how can it happen, you should strike again and again, it is not striking you, you are getting a plot of Rs 22000, so how is this?  It means that here the rate is not so much, brother, it is not RERA, it is RERA applied, it is RERA registered, meaning there is no certificate, if the application is registered in RERA, then it is written as RERA registered.  They do not write certificates, they have a scandal and the title is not clear, your money can be lost, so whenever you invest, remember this saying: When something is too good to be true, it is not true. I repeat again for the benefit of all if something sounds too good.  To Be True It Ai n't True Always Walk With the Bottom Line I hope this cute template helps you I will review using this template, you can also make your own private, in it I will tell you in how many marks is Line Buy, in what range is Good Buy, in what range is Can Buy, can you buy and if the number is below how much. So don't buy, I will make it very simple, I am not scientific like this, how is it, how is it good, brother, did you tell me the template, did you give numbers to everyone, did you give numbers to everyone and that price is also a lot, if you believe that the brand is fine.  The location is fine, the amenities are fine, the construction is with AC block, it is not clean, there is something else, there is something else, the numbers are normal, but the price is very good, now that is the algorithm that I have given, the weightage in it is my different kind.  It is complicated because I will not do it, okay, I will teach the platinum members and will give them the template in excel how to do it, okay but normal. I don't want to confuse the audience, okay, then you will know which thing has weightage in which project, because when I do paid consultation, when I charge money and it works, then I go to the first client who sits in front.  I decide on its weightage, for many the location weightage is too high, for many the brand is too high, for many the amenity is too high, so I decide that brother, nowadays you can do everything on a computer, right?  You go for it, many people are very price sensitive that for them price is everything, brother, I will compromise on location, I don't even care about the brand, I have so much money and I want three BHK because I have one.  Mom and Dad will live in one, my wife will live in one, children will live in one, so brother and I have so much money, so now what will be the biggest thing for him, weightage price, okay so this is an art, it is an art like cooking isn't it? How much salt is to be added, how much is to be added to the vegetable, how much is that eight, it means yes, it is written that 1/2 gram, 2 gram can be done like this, but as you practice that art, you become a master artist. Although I have written in that template that it is 1.5 grams of salt and 2.5 grams of chilli and after reading that template, you can do it, then you can go to that level, if you want, then share this video with people.  Have not subscribed the channel, please do so. Please like the video. Moral increases. This template is given to you in a one-by-one manner. Note down 10 things and now compare each one on this basis and from your side, every buddy is wise.  Enough to give marks and that they don't have to be in absolute year 70 can be excellent but then it is all relative when  You compare, when you give the number, you will automatically start giving it. You will see the brochure, its layout looks good, its number is more, this is less, this brand is good, its number is more, this is less, the location is looking good, its 60 meters.  Road is on 90, gave it more numbers, its here, do it like this, you start giving, after that when I will teach a little in the webinars, explain it, it will keep getting refined but a template.  So, you are roaming around like this, I am giving you a map, now you don't know where to go, you don't even have a map, so where do you want to reach or where do you want to go, you need something good, brother, what is your definition of good, you decide.  No, your definition of good is different for everyone, everyone wants the best, but what is the best in the best price, in the best amenities, in the best brand, in the best layout, because all the things will not be found to be the best, because if all the things are the best out of nine, then brother, the price will be thick, then the price will not be the best.  If the recipient is fine, then these are the 10 things which should be the best out of 10 out of 10. Projects do not exist like no one does a perfect spouse, a perfect man does not exist, but these are our parameters. What weightage do you have in this?  He will decide which of your orientation is more. I hope I have succeeded in explaining. If I am successful then please write successful. Do not write in full. If I am successful then I will like it.  2030 looks successful, doesn't it? In the comment section, it looks like 2030 has been successful. Thank you very much."

    "title": "A Big Clear Verdict Given On Gurgaon Real Estate ｜ Is It Time To Be Cautious ？ [l6fFyCUbzkY].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, Gurgaon Real Estate The Current Verdict Verdict Meaning, now I am going to tell you carefully, listen carefully, the elections are over, all the things have come, I had always told that there is a trend, many people used to say to me for three-four years, 'Hey fum fum, all the rates will increase'. So now I am coming and telling on Gurgaon Real Estate I am turning conscious from being bullish, those are the terms of stock market, okay, nothing goes till calm, many people like me.  Earlier they used to say, tell me, tell me, when I said, I will tell you when the time comes, I am going to tell you very clearly, here many of you are different types of subscribers, some have taken it, some have taken it long ago.  Someone wanted to sell the old one and buy something new, someone wanted to buy something new now, there must be many different types of things, many have taken it before, now they want to buy more, there are all types and there are many who have not taken it at all.  Those who could not take it and that sky  If you are waiting for Gira to fall, it will fall, then the prices will be ruined. Along with one flat, you will get another free and along with it, you will also get a trip to Paris. There are some percentages like this, so I will address everyone clearly, I will also tell the builders.  Also watch my videos and I will message them also and will make further predictions, this is a very important video, you have to share this video immediately and also write your opinion to everyone.  So the verdict is that the line of luxuries that was there in Gurgaon is still there, so a little stagnation has started in the luxury market. A little too much in 4BH, too much in something which is more than 3500 square.  Feet, the shop has become exactly like this and the builders did not understand, much indirectly, directly or whatever way the interaction takes place, what I told and now I am fully based on that opinion.  I am firm, I will tell you what will happen next, I will tell you, whoever has taken, have taken anything, be relaxed, smile, be happy, now what should I do, in my announcement, have taken, hold on, keep in Shobha, hold on, keep Meridian  I have taken it in the Go Darsh, hold it and keep it. I have taken the Go Darsh, keep it in the habitat. Shapar ji, keep it. Whatever you have taken, hold it, do not screw it. Earlier, I had done a video in which I had said that if anyone wants to resell.  tell me nowhere  So, I do n't know the rate but I have been saying this for the last four-five months, don't sell resale, the gap is closing in on the new ones, now cool down a bit, there are only two projects, there are a lot of out-of-pocket prices in the whole of Gurgaon.  There are more coming and they are in the pipeline on which I would use the word decently that I consider it as value for money and definitely good for use and also from investment point of view.  I feel juice only in those two, only in two and not in anyone else, now no one is listed, earlier I used to say listed player or nothing, now there is no need to worry about any listed wasted, the rate has been reduced to one and a quarter, many people have come and come.  They are delivering things even in the stipulated time, many people have not done it well, so there is a slight change in opinion, I cannot come here and take names for what ever reasons the market shakes, but I am telling about the general market. If you say that this is my stock market stock market, then you are not telling the specific stock in it but I am telling about conscious for noise shot, second of mine was one thing related to Vaastu where I used to tell, I had also made a video on four and eight.  Number, I am firm on that also, I am you know I am an astrologer, in fact, those who believe, those who don't believe then there is no problem, buy anything, if you believe then Mother Ganga, if you don't believe then there is flowing water, but there is one thing, go to those sectors and see.  Take a look at how many projects are already sitting with open mouths, not yet built, you just have to take a ride, I am not going to tell you which sector it is because even telling that becomes a market. I have not come here to kick anyone's stomach.  I have not come to take votes, neither am I a moral science teacher nor anyone's, nor do I have to reach a higher element that I am a Guruji, I am helping people, I am not of any help, I am just giving an opinion, my channel is ass for the informed investor.  The Smart Investor It is not for the Lemon Investor 50000 subscribers, thanks to you people and so many people watch Real Estate is a niche channel, getting so many hits on this channel is also considered a good number, increase the subscriber base a little more and increase the individual. I will again bring the videos of the projects which have been sold, small projects as well as big projects and will tell you exactly and you can watch them.  Write down the names of the projects. Don't ask the visitors again and again whether it is good or bad. I will never do anything bad to anyone, but if I am not covering it, then it is on my behalf and not about me, if I am speaking.  Even if this fig barfi is good and a cashew katli is good, then don't come and ask me what I say about this Gulab Jamun, how is this Rasgula, I am sitting with just these two, then understand that no, this is good, isn't it Gulab?  eat berries  Eat it, I will also bring info webinars, I will bring lunch for whatever project will be there, but from my side I will not say whether to buy or not to buy info, it is a woman, should be taken, now I will not say because when the price was right, the thing was fine, brother in the eyes. I am saying through my eyes, take it now people, what is there in it, now in time, I will talk openly with you, it is also a topic of discussion because after many days, I am making such a video with the subscribers, so one talks openly. thing one  What often comes, how does the matter come, because what happens in the market when builders approach you or someone approaches you and says Thanda Thanda Cool, say Navratan like Amitabh and you will get money and they can make a tree like you.  She is Kamiya Jani ji who has curly tails, she is making such videos in Dubai, she does things to make people eat but they call them integrated videos or dedicated videos, I go, I say brother, this is that.  Give the money and I will tell you, but what is the point of it, why am I not doing it? Am I a great man, I am a great man, my heart beats for you guys, no, it is not like that, basically, I am building a better brand for myself, why am I?  If I can say it like this, I know there are some issues there, there are different types of issues, so why should I say it is not good, but first you have seen that builder has one building, one is a clothes seller, one of his places was fine, the other one was fine.  there was clothes, now  The place is not right, the color is not right, I am not able to understand, I can speak a little on each and every thing, then what is the difference between you and others, here I will tell the fellow YouTubers, where the pricing is higher and you are feeling  If you have then you can call out, I am telling those YouTubers who sell products by name, they come with the name, I do not come with the name because if I come with the name, then I will tell the name only after taking a lot of money, right?  i am free  Like others, I will not say the name sometimes, sometimes sometimes, sometimes you say it directly or indirectly, it is okay, but now I am telling you this rule of mine from today onwards, it is said first, in old projects there is nothing to say because it is common.  A man has bought it. Now if I tell you something about Shobha City 108, then brother, Shobha has been sold and gone, now the rate will increase, it will decrease, then your name will decrease and the person who has bought it will increase, so things remain like this but many At this point of time, you have to be conscious, now everything cannot be sold or bought, no matter how far the sector is taken, it has also been taken out of control, brother, I want to give advice to the builders here and they listen.  You should stop bringing these sizes of 3500, 3600, 3700, 3800, 4000 square feet. It has become a luxury. Indians are not sitting with so much money in luxury.  It is done, now you should come up with the projects that will work according to me and suddenly see what you bring. Whoever is listening, whoever followed the advice, it will take three to four months to implement because RERA has to be taken and changes are also made.  You can if you follow me, you will have to bring 1200 square feet super area to 1800 square feet super area, something like Shaper ji was a product or Hero Homes and their pricing is also very diamond in that.  Put a pearl and do n't know what is falling from above or what is falling from below, is there no need to put a photo, take a decent price up to 15,000,000 feet which is a comfortable rate and make it small in size so that  That thing should be below 2.5 crores, this 5 sir 6 sir is too much, I know Gurgaon will become a city of rich and many products have come but now it will be a matter of selling further in resale and doing that.  No, it will be a matter of end use only. The builders will have to change the payment plan. It will definitely have to be changed. Those who take 70 rupees within a year by doing anything, now they will have to take this much, again they will have to go to relaxed payment plants. Pricing will have to be tightened and the most important sizes will have to be reduced. What is happening in reducing the sizes? What is the benefit of big? Today I will also reveal this secret. See what is there in big.  What did the government do? Let me tell you guys, understand carefully. The government has increased the FR which was earlier the allowed FR in the societies, it has been made almost double of that. Now increasing the FR means more square feet on the builder. Now he can build more square feet, so if he comes with a smaller ticket size, that is, if he brings smaller apartments, then his density will go up to P 200. Now he hesitates in making this because people like us  I have all this knowledge because the density of 150 flats per acre is affordable, so what would you say by increasing it to 175-180, then luxury will not be luxury. If someone says, then there is a lot of density. Look, in Pune side it is 200, in Mumbai it is 350-400.  In Noida side, it has always touched the figure of Rs 200, so the time has come, now in Gurgaon you can buy that flat.  I don't know, by increasing it to luxury by making it 3700, I don't know, by wasting all the stuff in other things, by making bulk of useless things in its balcony, its rate layout is coming so high, I have rejected many, I don't even feel like showing it.  They say, sister, look at the suit, how to show it, or now we are the suit people, let us show the suit, it is okay, whoever sits and eats the suit, madam, look at the suit, you also need some confidence to say how to show the poor suit.  It is good, that means there is a limit, even a little good, you can call it very good. Look madam, but friend, some of the eyes also have shame, this is the same thing, we have reached the stage of shame of the eyes, I believe, other fellows YouTube.  You will also agree with me that the value of this thing will be available in very different places pan India, there is a very limited thing in Gurgaon, whatever I do for the next four months, I am announcing for the next four months, I am announcing the three months of Gurgaon. Okay, maybe in October, after Diwali, there may be some more choice. If there is a small choice, then I am doing only two products in the big segment. Rest in the small segment, if you get something in resale, then take it, if you do not find anything in resale.  Who has been in resale, who has missed the bull run of Gurgaon real estate and did not even know about the cotton money, now he is coming to take it, so brother, start making efforts in resale, it will cost you a lot, no one is ready to sell.  Everyone is having fun and no middleman is interested in getting it done because everyone is having fun. No 10,000 phone calls and 25,000 visits for brokerage. You are assuming that your provider does not know because the customer is the customer for sure.  The buyer is sure that he is right but nothing is known about the seller because the sellers have put such a curb on the sellers like us that even I get painted as a villain, I know that I  What should I do, make one benefit, the other suffers loss, but I am telling from both the sides, I am saying here, if you get something in resale, it is available at a reasonable rate, wherever you get it, you should go ahead and just buy it.  Blind is my message, you should go and buy it. If you don't ask again and again, no, it is fine, you are getting it, then take it because you know the rates of new ones, what is there in resale, but the sellers in resale.  The message for all of them is for all of you do not sell specific project wise again I will bring the video. If you take the membership of the channel then also you will see the videos as per the target. The matter is going on exactly the same but which one are you?  They want review on the project in Gurgaon real estate, you tell me and I will tell them but they have to be popular and reasonable one's which I don't like as really I am not  Going to tell about them again, I am not going to talk, okay and in the market, I am definitely now. Now we have everything at every price, it was not sold, it is sold, it is not going to be sold, now it is like this, the project came, came came came, when did it come, what happened?  What happened? What happened? What happened? What happened? What happened? What happened? What happened? Will it happen like this? Earlier it used to be like this, news used to come sold out, confidence was like this, all the tubers also came like this and the goods were sold in one day, in two days, that one or two days of preparation.  It starts happening months in advance, but now you wo n't see sold out boards as if the condition of the movies has changed, it is not coming, you are watching any Bollywood movie, it is not coming, it is not being made, it is not being made, it is not happening. People are not even watching, it means it is a matter of mood, people are fine, so now the mood is coming out of luxury, builders should not have done so much out price, that party does not last forever, those who are smart keep it and see, then 3700  3800  The one of 3900 and 4000 square feet is 3500 also three, I am putting a cap on 2500 square feet here. My wisdom and conscience is that the matter below 2500 square feet is fine, take it because many people have requirements from 2200 to 2500. Practical size is above that, then that size seems more to you, if you look at its map then it is airy, it is foamy, okay 3200  If you look at the layout of 3400 and compare it with 2400, then how can you not see the difference of 1000 feet in the rooms? I am telling you this, look carefully, I am not going to do this work of a builder by taking each and every name, it is fine here in free funds, the world. For what, who has the benefit in this, in what is someone's benefit, it is not my benefit, if it is not the builder's benefit, then there is no public benefit, why is there no public benefit? Hey, you have given a clear cut to the public, you work hard, why should we do you?  You are buying a flat worth 8 crores. It's okay if you buy a flat worth 7 crores, you can't work so hard. Guruji has told me the formula. Hold the layout of 2400 square feet and 3400 square feet. There is a difference of 1000 square feet. Now see the size of the rooms. How much difference is there and how much is there in it and where is that size placed? You will automatically know which one is worth it because it is the difference of 100 square feet. Brothers and sisters, there is a difference of 45 per cent in pricing and if you calculate the difference of 45 per cent, then a thing like 4 CR can be bought with a lot of money, but if the same thing is of 5 CR then it becomes very tight. It is not.  Very easy and the advice for those NRIs who invest and take money is don't go for very big sizes now avoid them as their maintenance is very  Will give the one who sweeps, mops and does the utensils, now you will say, what are you talking about? I am buying a bag and then saying that the person who cleans and washes clothes will take more. Unfortunately, Indians think like this, it is okay, it is also okay, it is not normal to be.  You should have bought a Rolls Royce and the clothier will take Rs 2000. The driver will take Rs 0000. I don't know, you shouldn't think but that's what they think.  Those who are buying from unearned income, those who are buying from earned income, those who are buying from earned income, these are different concepts, I am also teaching these concepts in my real estate course, brothers and sisters, this is a rump course, who wants to join my real estate mentoring program.  There are classes where I give recordings and teach in great detail, there will be only a trailer here, there are two two hour classes, seven to eight classes are held on Saturdays, so in that you should understand that the unlearned.  He has the income to buy a floor by selling it in Rajendra Nagar or somewhere in Naraina. In Gurgaon, he will buy the capital, but brother, it is like father-in-law has given the car [Music] Money is not his, he has got it. Anyhow, now you think, okay, now he will think about all these things also, you understand my point, normally a person whose monthly income is so high will not think 10.  If those people think about the things of 20 Haj, then the market has now gone to that zone, it has gone to that territory, one has to be conscious, one should not take everything, one should not take it at all, there are some things, I am covering, okay, I am explaining and in that  I am also arguing that yes, there is something different in it, something different is coming in it, it is coming new, it is coming for the first time, it justifies the valuations and it does not do anything like this anywhere, I have been telling many places before.  Such  It was purchased where some other kind of things were to be made, it may be affordable through lets, now it has become so much of a luxury, it has run up, so even in such a place, if someone is bringing out an expensive thing, then you have to take a call or not. I am not going to tell you which place, brother, you have to do some homework. I am not going to take anyone's name here, neither for the good nor for the bad. This channel is for the informed investors and builders. This is a request, Lala. Your employees should not be in the land, your VP who takes salary from you, those who are your employees do not have the courage to come and guide you or say that Seth ji, don't do this work, now Holi party is over or if you want to take consultation then like us.  Take it from a consultation consultant, it is not that much fee as much as the salary, you are paying it to those who are just doing nothing but doing so great. If they were doing great then they would not have let you relax.  No, you just go there like this, what are you doing? Yes, it will not be sold, what is the waste of time? Then go to RERA again, change the maps, then reduce them, then you have told some units to the first ones. Brother, if you have sold some units in any project, then say this.  That it will be of this density and this size, but now if you go and get it changed, then you will be cheated by the earlier ones, you can get it smaller like this, you have to decide beforehand, otherwise the goods will not be sold or will be available later. Later  This too will not be sold because India is like I am saying that instead of buying one big one, it is better to buy two small ones because we cannot live together. Then again the matter of mother-in-law and daughter-in-law will come. Okay, so four BH's and five BH's. Whatever they are now, you will have to take a call beyond them, enjoy the earlier ones, if you had taken it, it was for Rs 12000-13000 and one and a half to two years have passed and now it is in that area.  If it is 18, 19, 20 then you are in a very safe zone. At the age of 35 or 40, you have made the payment. That thing is being made properly, it was fine but now you have to take a call as to what is included in these pricing and also the difference in pricing.  Builders are not doing it. If you have increased the ticket size, if the ticket size has increased, then reduce the square feet rate a little, give some relief, at least listen and I have to speak because even if I come, I cannot speak anyway. Many are listed.  He is a player, brother, we are shareholders, I would like that the company whose shares I have bought should reach the moon, then I will come and give so much knowledge, I will not lower myself by saying this, but I am talking logically and they  The owners of the company listen and I am talking very respectfully. You will not see arrogance anywhere. You will only see it in practice. It is only in practice that sometimes the time for course correction comes. On top of excise, what is the size of the thing?  The market is ready to accept and not for how much because it cannot have continuous run up. 1200 to 1800 square feet super area and carpet, you can do it. 800 to 1200, 800 to 1200 carpet and super 1200 to 1800 whatever will bring in Gurgaon real estate.  Will bring a ball park on 000 feet figure shows that it can also be 143  It can also be Rs 1530 but generally it will come at this costing and it will be a super hit project, this is my guarantee, it is a good builder, it is ok, these are the sizes that you have priced at Rs 16000 and Rs 3000 at Rs 17000, they are not the same because of inflation.  Will be sold as per the schedule, will be sold gradually, will be sold later, the last product that was sold now, the one with a good full house, was a peak hit in Gurgaon real estate.  I would say that in the time of March, in the end of March, from April, May to June, now the matter is going on smoothly, but in this also the valuations are good at some places, the proposition is good at some places, the location is good at some places, decent things are being available at some places and the goods are being sold.  But now you will not see that one like it used to happen earlier in Hindi movies like Diamond Jubilee, Silver Jubilee, Gold Jubilee, Diamond Platinum Jubilee, you will not see such super hits, you will see normal things, yes the picture came.  People saw it was okay, it is selling, let's go like this again in the next tie, if you will see like this then do not run away, be very critical, observe, observe, learn things, I am teaching you people in the comment section, you will get an info webinar on that.  You can join if you are already there, you have not joined beyond that because I was explaining these things to the people who have joined for two-three months anyway, today I have come and told it publicly, it is time to tell it publicly.  If it seems, there will be a little lag and after that there will be a core correction. I mean, within the advice I am giving, will the prices of Gurgaon real estate fall down? Nothing is falling down. Yes, holding power is there in everyone, there is a lot of holding power among the builders.  Builders are sitting there earning so much money, go and look at their balance sheets, see how good their share prices are, they can hold everything for 5 years, but what is there in it, then they will have to bleed, so builders don't want that.  If the inventory is sold then hold it but don't think that the builders are very poor. Look at the debt to equity ratio of all the listed firms. Loans are low. Free cash flow is high. If the goods are sold then now They should concentrate, they are also helpful to the builders in making the goods quickly and whatever new thing you are bringing in the market, please do it with people like us who deal with so many thousands of people on a daily basis on real estate.  Are you connected? Are you doing your own marketing? Yes, you can't do it. This is my channel. I ca n't do my own marketing. If I keep doing it for someone else, then I am telling the builders to pay consultation fees to people like us because a lot of people like me are doing it for free. Want to meet, I don't actually meet, I don't meet, I will meet only after taking money, I want to meet in Hi Hello, No, not in Hi Hello, this is your product professionally, beyond that I can give opinion as if I am making a picture of my own. Come and ask someone and many people ask, film star friend, how is this scene, how is this story, then tell your opinion, we are small leaders of real estate connected to the public, okay, if you are a leader of real estate, then you  Will give input as to what the public is thinking now, like the exit poll people were in bad shape but you should understand that people like me take public opinion in workshops and webinars every day and find out what is happening in the market.  connect to  And rate of concentration inventory is over hang rate of absorption of inventory, you don't have to do anything else, these are three-four tehsil offices, go there, spend some time and see how much crowd is there, now the crowd of BBA seems more, new registry.  And it is not his, this matter is going a little slowly and as soon as the goods are sold in March April and those whose BBA is happening now in June, I am predicting India number one real estate. Clarity Giver, go and see Neel Batte in July, you will see silence in the tehsils because the goods are not sold that much because there is a lag even in BBA, there is a lag of 70 60 70 80 90 days, when you take it, the allotment letter comes and then it comes.  If there is time, whatever goods were sold, now their BBA will be completed in June, then by June 30, all the goods that were sold in March will be done for everyone.  Was sold thick and thin, initially his BBA will be over in April, now you go in July, stand in the tehsil on a random day and ask the clerk or any other boy who hangs around in the lawyer's house, how is things going these days. You will get to know a little about this real estate and if you do not want to go there then there are their government sites, become a Jagga Jasoos there, details come there, how much has happened, they are supposed to tell also how much, I am teaching now.  I am teaching this for free, I will teach more in paid form, so those who want to attend Real Estate Mentoring Program, come there. Whatever work you are doing or want to do in real estate, definitely come and whatever you want.  If you want to reach a level, then those people can also come inside it. Rump, you can give me whatsapp-web on the number given, similarly, Gurgaon Caution is fine, Noida, Ultra Caution is fine and Greater Noda, brother, there is a lot of supply.  She is worth so many crores, okay, so be a little conscious, North India, we are entering it slowly, we can see the speck speckle territory, so stop yourself a bit, this is the message, there are very few, very few projects. According to me, there are only two others who are coming, I am doing this to someone from a distance, do n't even ask me how is the answer, it will be very good, take the free answer, it will be this only, okay, very good.  Take it, no, how is it that you come after a roundabout way? If everyone's mouth is wide open around your project that is getting delayed, then look at yourself, what happened there, look at Vastu, look at Numol, look at all this.  Things work, everyone believes them and they work in real life. Go and check for yourself. I hope I have managed to tell a lot without doing anything too much. Rest is also a request to YouTube as you genuinely feel from inside because I  at someone's discretion  Does n't ask questions, it's okay, but questions are raised many a times that you should not come and speak beyond the work you are doing, friend, if it is expensive, you will have to speak on a stage, won't you? Friend, till when will you speak, till when will you all keep singing praises even from YouTube? There comes a stage, sister, this suit is this one, let's see, now you understand that the suit which has to lose its color will definitely be beige, it will make it expensive, you know it, so calm down a bit, friend all.  Have come here, now it is too much, so relax a little, rains are coming in July, August, September, okay, it is from the Government of Haryana, I will tell you more in details, this video has already become long, there are many factors, I have included 1520 factors. Looking at what is going on in the future and now, what is the data saying, what is the trend of the people, what is the intention of the builder, I told everyone here that construction has not started anywhere. You have booked three-three-four-six months ago also, nothing has happened seven to eight months ago, environment clearance has not even come at many places, I am also telling you that some other people think like this, get it resold, now what does that mean?  So quickly and I will take it at 30, brother, these 30 people are in the danger zone, you are in the 30 zone here, you will buy three flats in the rest of the cities of India, the good one is Mavan, which is at 30 in Gurgaon, that is.  Gurgaon property can be bought at Rs 10 per kg in other cities too. We are telling and explaining the things there too. Do write in the comment section which cities you are interested in and how did you like the advice of this video. Do share it with everyone. Thank you very much"

    "content": "Hello friends, today I am going to give you a real estate tip, it is not very easy to find out but still you can find out through people like us or directly if you know the sign of a super hit project which is newly launched  What is happening is that there is a lot of potential in that project. It is seen what thing is available, where it is available, whose it is available and at what price it is available. By making a mix of all this, if the project has potential then it is its biggest sign.  When employees buy that company, recently I have seen a project of that company in Gurgaon and there is a discussion about another one as well, employees are buying it and that is becoming known, then it builds confidence as an investor and increases your confidence as an end user.  It is increasing that even the confectioner is ready to eat the sweets from his shop himself and is eating and feeding it to his relatives and friend circle, in fact recently it has been seen that a quota system has also been kept for his employees and friends in the market.  Till now no one has told this about Gurgaon market, this much is correct but this has also been kept  And apart from that the rest of the cake is like a cake, this much was cut and kept for them, this much was opened for the market, so this is a very healthy indication, if you can figure this out among your acquaintances, then this is a metric which  You have to follow and inside the comment section you will find a webinar info group, if you have not joined any of my webinar info groups yet, then please join by clicking on it.

    "title": "A Sign Of Bullish Real Estate Market ｜ Kya Apko Call Aaya？ [-YDpKAZWVGE].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, have you received or are you receiving a call? I am telling you the symptoms of Gurgaon real estate becoming hot and I am addressing this video to my fellow buyers, the buyers who are sitting on buying, not on reselling to you.  Have to sell, calls have increased, disperser calls do not come that much but if the whole thing is bought and these come only to those who sit after buying, do not know who gives the number and how, these people are fine, people give all the numbers, only then they call.  Come  If you are living then I get calls 10 times a day, brother, sell that there, sell it, especially where the payment of Rs 40 is going to come in the 30 40 30 plan or where the structure is ready or where the position is available.  It has come in eight months or where the position has come like mine from Shaper ji, as I tell, I get calls every day, it is yours, sell it, sell it, it is fine, good rent is going up, don't sell it.  Now we have to cross the limit, we have to increase the rates gradually, on Dwarka Expressway, I have been successful in slowing down, almost too many resales are fine, but now I am saying for the rest of the Gurgaon market also that you should not sell anything.  You don't have money, take a loan from your father, even if you sell half of that flat to someone else, you will earn more money on half of it. What I am trying to say is that you have been reselling like this because you are  For your own benefit, you would buy such a lot of chillies that not many people have bought in the market, if 100 people have bought something then a thousand people want to buy it, then there is a difference of 900, then of course they will come and write and say for their own benefit. Yes, I do it only for my own benefit. Why do I do it for my own benefit? Buyers cannot do that. Builders can do it for their own benefit. Politicians can do it for their own benefit. Businessman can do it for their own benefit. Anyone who does anything can do it for their own benefit. So why can't the buyer create his own benefit?  Keep your heart beating for that common Mussaddilal who did not wake up from sleep. Some Mussaddilals woke up from sleep. The office people who did something 3 years ago and 2 years ago took it away. Are you trying to sell and buy something else or do you have money?  You were not there or you did not have the strength or you did not have the conveyance, so now that the rates have increased, it seems that the sky will fall by doing this, not that some rates will fall, this is not right, the infrastructure is not right, everything is fine.  It's not air, it's a bubble, it's a bubble, sometimes it seems like it doesn't burst, sometimes it's not a balloon at all, it's something else and it doesn't burst, and you feel like it's a bubble, now the rates have to increase because the buyers are  It is more and the party in Delhi has not yet started that the things which the people of Delhi have seen and want to buy while walking on the expressway, when they will come back after selling and buy, then the rates will increase a lot because these rates are 10%.  For 12 years they were saying that we have to grow, due to various reasons we were not able to grow that much, so in two-three years, we showed you the run up of 10 years because nothing had happened in 7 years, so come on.  If you are getting calls right now, there is no use in holding it. Your nose will start watering if you are not holding it, then increase your height by 24 inches. Take someone's support. I am telling him to say more time bye.  The more time you buy, the more returns you will see. This is a noise shot. Now in the coming days, I am going to do webinars for the buyers. No one has done this. You have bought for the first time till date, I am not asking you to buy, you have bought. And if you belong to any project in Gurgaon, then which are the projects beyond which you would like to write in the comment section? Why is this only for exclusive buyers? What is its current resale price, target price?  You should not sell, for how much is the buyer ready, I will tell you everything, still if you want to sell then please tell us, we will sell, but the advice is that do not sell, the advice is that do not sell at all, there is no money, so bring anyone from anywhere as a partner.  Make it, do anything at home because the story has yet to progress, there is juice left in the sugarcane, it is okay now, once it is completely sucked, I will tell you, that too is okay, then you can comment on the real estate webinar group on Telegram, if you are already ready with me. If you are not on any group then you will get information about it and you will call it I will call the webinar as Gurgaon Real Estate Buyers Webinar for those who have bought or something like this so that you know that nothing new is being sold in it.  As for the old one which is sitting there, there is a discussion going on that you have bought that one, this one is at this rate, it is currently sold, it is currently sold for this much, it is ready to be sold for this much, don't sell your stock at that rate. Look at the price. Every person wants to know the price when he buys his stock. It is known every day in the stock exchange. Whenever you buy, look at the closing of any day and put the portfolio under money control. Look at it increasing and decreasing every day. Here it is like this.  No, here I am the only stock exchange, so wherever you have taken the products of Gurgaon real estate, I have taken them for 6 months or 12 months because one more problem has come, the builder's rate for people like buyers. See, it has become 2 crore 20 lakhs at one place. If you bought something at some time, then you are thinking that if I sell it for 220 rupees or 210 rupees, then you will also know the realistic figures that the builder's 22 rupees have become yours also at 210 rupees.  If it is not going to happen, why is it not going to happen, we will discuss it, so which are the projects, if we have the capacity to cover 10 to 12 in one webinar, then which are the top projects?  If you want to know what you have taken and who has taken it, then write in the comment section. Write the name of that project and it will be the off-course project of the sector. I am number one, so I should know from the name of the project. Maybe.  Wherever I am, I have complete knowledge about the good projects and what rates are going on, so I will do it whenever I do it, I will tell you all, feel free to join, listen comfortably, watch and join, thank you.  you very  If you have not subscribed the channel then please subscribe, thank you very much."

    "title": "A Unique Idea With Which You Can Easily Buy A Home [6BFXaSvr44g].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today we will discuss an idea or a method by which you can buy a house, especially the youth, so this is a practical idea, tell me how practical you found it, you can do it or not because in today's time, buying real estate is for everyone.  So it is very difficult, the Millennials are also born a little late. 92 93 1992 93 people, it is becoming a little difficult in the cities, so today I will take an example.  I will tell you that we can rent a property for one CR, although the prices have increased much more than this in many cities, but one CR is a very decent budget, even now many things can be purchased at many places, so I will take the example of one CR only.  I will try and tell you how you all can buy that property which is suitable for me. The target audience that I am seeing here is those who are between 27, 28 to 35 years of age and can also be older people.  These are the people who have got jobs, who have also got married, may be married to a girl who earns money, then I am telling you the best solution, I am telling you an SA template, what to do, any good under.  You have to book the construction of a good builder in a good location and the money will go to him in three to four years. Now you have to use your parents, use a little and use their money.  You have to go to your parents and say that we are buying this property, we need money, as you say, if you want money then it is an off course and no one is going to give it so soon, so today I am going to tell you the solution in practical, so listen to this video for that today, mother-  If father says why should we give it then he will take two-four-five-10 lakhs. If your mother or your father has made an FD of Rs. 20 lakhs then you tell them and the FD that I am renting you at Rs. 6.  I will give you interest on Rs. 6 and will also give you a share of Rs. 20, so now the parents have no reason to say no because they are also getting security. They are giving you a share of Rs. 20 in the property. I am telling you in the template form. It can be of 25 30 40 lakhs, it can be of 1515 lakhs, it can be of 15 lakhs, you can also put your wife's name in it, you can also put your mother's name in it, you can also put your name in it.  Now you have taken the loan, the down payment of Rs. 20 has also been arranged for you, you have to pay the money gradually at many places, the income tax benefit that you will get, your wife will get the same if you are at 30. Close to 11 to 12000 is within the slab, you will get interest on Rs 20 lakh per month which you have to pay on 6 till the position is not made because  After getting the position, the rent will also come or if you yourself will live in it, then only Rs. 000 will be left as rent. Let's calculate again that Rs. 20 lakhs will be 120000 by 6. When you divide 120000, then Rs. 000 will have to be given to your mother monthly. You gave me 20 rupees on The Rule and Law, you can also take income tax rebate of this money if you send it to them directly through cheque. You are giving another wise in the account with in the house. You can easily settle that you will pay the electricity bill and I will also pay the maid's money or add one more expense. Meaning of milk in India now.  Inflation has become so much that these three expenses mentioned by me become just Rs. 00. Okay, these three expenses will become Rs. 10000, so make such an arrangement or if you want to do it with income tax, then make it official.  Depending on whether your mother is not in the tax slab or whether your mother is not earning Rs 20 lakh per year, when you give her Rs 12-20, then tax will be levied on her. If she is not earning, then just give it to her officially. Deduct your income and give her the problem.  If not, then what is there in it? They have to show it to their parents too. I am telling all of you parents that the money you have invested in ₹ lakhs will turn into dust when you give it to your parents.  So you are getting only %, you are not eating the original anyway and your 20 lakhs are not becoming 21 lakhs. If you are taking 10000 per month and if you have to make 21 out of 20, then I am giving the address of the parents for 20 lakhs.  If you have to do 21, then you are not getting anything for the month, here your son or your daughter or son-in-law or son-in-law is giving you money, they are giving you monthly money, you can invest that money in mutual fund.  If you wish to put it in recurring account, add it or spend it depending on the situation. Your share of Rs 20 lakh which is invested in that house is increasing. If it is a pure investment then it is the same.  Brother, because after 2030 years you will leave behind something of worth in this place because many elders in their 60's, 62's, 65's think that they are going to deal with it.  Don't live in four-five years, you can live for 3035 years too. Deal with it quickly. Today's age is not a risk. Risk is living a long life. This is what I want to tell you. I am also giving you financial knowledge through the same video. Real Estate  I am also giving the knowledge of this to you people, you have to spread this knowledge very well, this is a video for youngsters, you should understand this thing very well because no financial influence can understand it. Here, the SIP of a mutual fund is open, brother, the asset is not being formed. Which mutual fund have your parents invested in it? They are making money in the coming time. Some banks may give % now.  I have calculated the pay at 6, but in the future, in the lower interest rate regime, we will go to pay at 55 5 45 4 and what is the benefit to you, son, daughter-in-law, daughter-in-law, what I told you.  Don't take 20 lakhs from them, no, we are not from them, but you get it from the bank at 85 %. If you are giving 6% to your parents, then you are saving. Give 65% to your parents, even then 2% is being saved and you have given them a share.  If you give it to me, then who will you cheat? Mom's name is written in the registry, you gave 20 lakhs and you are paying interest to her, if you don't trust your own blood relations so much then what is the use anyway and he says  that we leave  If you go then you can leave here also and go here, whoever wants to go, but the biggest thing is that it is said in a positive way, understand carefully what it is, I am addressing the parents, yes, the rental plan will start for you.  Pay at 4 I know such properties where rental starts at 6 and 7 but I only take it at four, you gave six and you are getting six from four, the day your rent starts coming.  The income tax of six which mother was giving to father becomes four by taking the benefit of becoming a riveter. In this case, if you give four to them then there will be cash flow and it will be free property but in eight years the rental yield will be four to eight and then in the next eight  It will further double in a year because I am calculating the price at which you had taken it, so your interest rates are not going to be like today's interest rate brothers and sisters, you were getting % on ₹ lakh.  So after 8 years and 9 years, it will start getting at 12. No, it is not increasing, nor is the interest rate, so it is not happening that the interest rate is increasing every year, but the rent will increase every year and will keep increasing, so if we plan for 30 years. Put it in Excel like Varaku ji does, I don't know, he is such an expert, why don't these people of Excel put all this in Excel after watching my video or they don't get anything from there, there is no money in giving this knowledge. And no one is going to give any money because the banks are facing a lot of trouble anyway, all the money has gone into the mutual funds, the banks are also struggling, the same banks are struggling, the public is not able to get their deposits, so you can math this thing. Understand the formula that I told you, brother, parents also benefit, you also benefit, there is rental income, there is passive income, there is safety security because we have given a share, in the same way from the wife also.  If you are taking money, then you can take it. Wife's parents can also be included. There is no specialty of parents or any boy. Property is related to blood relations. It has happened in many states in UP too, now it is in Haryana also, in other states you Check yourself, there blood relations, fresh registration cost in property transfer, do n't deny the cost of lawyer's paper, that's it, nothing will come, inflation will wipe out everything, as much inflation as you can see will happen.  It is explained that it is much more than that and add aspirational inflation and it is much more, so this is the best way because if I get that initial down payment money and the money for the next Rs. 10-20 is my money, then I get Rs. 30-35. But I have a solution, I do n't have to take a loan for about one and a half to two years, I do n't want to kick it, the house reaches a very advanced stage and this is also the payment plan builders come out with like this.  If you are living, then if your parents give Rs 101 and you are sitting on Rs 1015 and while the builder is taking Rs 30, in that time your Rs 101 has been further increased by doing savings, then you are sitting on Rs 50.  There is no need to take a loan yet, brother, you are sitting with 15 rupees from your parents and 15 rupees from your parents, and by the time this was consumed, you have made arrangements for another 1520 rupees. You have reached 50 just like that, then take a loan of 50 and then come to know that the rental yield is at 4 but since you have reached 50, you have become cash positive by the way, so it is not difficult.  It is very easy, when everyone in the family comes together then it can be taken care of very well. Utilize your parents, if not your parents then use your in-laws and father-in-law, if not theirs. Siblings can also take it together, sometimes it is okay, the parents are not rich, they are not wealthy, they can also be poor, no problem, two brothers can take it together, brother sister can take it together, two sisters can take it together, this is the same formula.  No no, then his cheating, I do n't know how cheating happens, friend, two people are taking the property, two sisters, brother or brother-sister, sister-in-law, in the name of both of them, what is the meaning of cheating, how can it happen, I am not able to understand, tell me, then how can it be a true cheating? in proportion  Give money and you can name it in the property in that ratio. No one said that 5050 is 40, 60 can also be 208, 30 can also be 7, rental props are investment properties and three or four people together can also buy them.  If there are two children and two parents, if there are two then four people can also take your name, mother's name, one brother's name, another brother's name, one sister's name, one brother's name.  Make any ratio of mom's dad's 25 25 25 30 30 30, not you, the younger brother is doing better, the elder is earning less in money or in the same way, put the years in the same ratio, put one on 20, one on 20. Put one in that ratio of 40 and then manage those things in the family. Many daughters-in-law are sitting comfortably in an empty house. Housewives will manage the rental.  It is okay with ease, everything is managed with ease, such a property is made, then make another property like this because a property worth Rs. 00 is to come, you will never have a Jugaad worth Rs. 100, so you make the first property like this, then the second one will be made and then  Third, fourth and then divide it later when I have three-four properties and there are such shares in all, one day we will sit together and divide, brother, this is yours, this is mine, this is my whole, in this I have to give 12 lakhs to you because that one. Its value has increased so much that we will revise the share holding according to the market value, which is called Restructuring of Assets. I explain all these things very well through the webinar. Please read my comment in the comment section.  There is a Real Estate Info Webinar Group. If you have not joined it already then please join it and by attending such webinars, you will get to know more. Thank you. Very Much"

    "title": "A Unique Thing Happening In Gurgaon Real Estate That Everybody Should Learn From [HmkL2t2EfqU].en",
    "content": "Hello friends a very unique thing is happening in Gurgaon real estate and this is a very positive thing which we have not witnessed normally what happens normally is when a property is bought and sold specially ready to move in which we talk of resale property  There is a unique thing happening in it that sellers from Gurgaon want full check deals, they want full check that you do not witness such things may happen in daily which is very very positive because the seller from Gurgaon or who was a while buyer who ever purchased  He is a very educated person, he knows about capital gains tax, he does not want to deal in any wrong way and he knows that today you will also get the knowledge of capital gains because everyone in Gurgaon knows it, so if you do not know  If it was Rs 2 crore, then you will know that capital gain tax of up to Rs 2 crore can be adjusted if you have held the asset for a long time. Secondly, if it is in the name of two people, then it will be Rs 2 plus two crore for that property.  Now you can buy and adjust in two properties by the government, earlier it was adjusted in one property, now with the changes in it, you can adjust in two properties, so very neat and clean, very good deals are happening  Yes it is a very very happy matter and what will be the benefit of this that the base rates of Gurgaon on which the deal will be done, if somebody has bought something worth Rs. 3 crores and the registry has been done for Rs. 3 crores, then if tomorrow he sells it for two, four, five, six or seven  If he sells it in next year then this becomes his base rate. Now even if he sells it for four to five years, he can still adjust it. And mostly the husband and wife are buying it together, so he gets even more profit when the individual name  You can adjust it to 2 CR, so what will happen is that it is becoming difficult for Delhiites to buy property in Gurgaon, what has happened to the properties of Gurgaon which are not of A list builders but of B list builders.  There is no C list builder's properties, their rates have started increasing  Yes, it is attracting the people of Delhi, so when the rates of C increase, then those of B will also increase because B is better than C and A is better than B, so this phenomenon has started, you will see this phenomenon in newspapers and on social media.  You will feel it after four to five months in the public domain in the media, you are feeling it yourself, so tell me, there are many positive things about it, it creates a lot of transparency and ease of buying and one gets a clear cut home loan, you have registered for Rs 2 crore. So you will get a clean loan of Rs 1 crore 60 lakh. So the customers and the gentry of Gurgaon are getting separated. It is a very long journey of a city in that journey, as it is said that one track has become very good.  Here you will find more of those people with double income and high loan taking capacity, those who work in full cheque deals, you will see them more, especially in the resale of flats of a top builder, this is the phenomenon which is playing  out then i thought i Let me tell you people and you should take cognizance of this thing, how it affects you, this is a reality and people are willing, yes, if I have to pay more for the registry, then I will have to pay, it is a very good thing, so this is something which  It is good for the country, good for the economy, good for the end user, people who want to stay for the seller also and for the subsequent buyer because the whole chain reaction happens once the mess is spread in the property of Delhi, you know what I am saying  I am telling you how buying and selling is correct, so here that is a better thing and a good thing, so I hope you guys enjoy knowing the trends first, subscribe to the channel, like it, take the membership of the channel, thank you very much"

    "title": "A Warning For Investors ： Don't Make This Mistake In Real Estate [8qc9hWCCkYY].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, a mistake which is being made by investors in real estate especially in Gurgaon market, I want to tell about the experience that I am having, many people have taken a lot, they have taken it well, they have also given money, they have also given it, but it is happening.  Now I am getting impatient, should I sell it and take it there? What is that one like? Why brother, what kind of thorns are there in it? It seems like I should earn money by selling it. Those of you who have money have taken it.  Sit down with whatever thing is coming out from a distance, it is useless from the first thing, but no one will say this because the new thing has to be sold, we too will not speak, no one will speak, but calm down this anger from within.  This EDC IDC GST will keep giving brokerage. Government will earn money. Middlemen will earn money. Look real estate is not your demat account where brokerage firms buy sell this set this target this don't take it like this.  Take it, sit peacefully, wherever you have taken it, there was a 30 40 30 payment plan, there was 25*4 or there was a construction link, whatever it was, within one two to three years some structure has been built there, that means a captive thing is being built, the execution risk has reduced.  There is a new pit in the air, sorry Gudda, a new pit has to be dug, there is still time left to dig and if its environment is not known then jump like this.  Don't go, if you have fresh money to buy then by all means the market is not forbidding people. Things are fine in the bull run. You can take it. No, it is fine but there is no use of buying by selling. I am telling you this, no one in the market will tell you.  Everyone will say this, Bhai Saheb, it is absolutely rubbish, whatever comes into position, it feels like this, every time it feels like this, doesn't marriage mean I am a marital consultant, marriage is happening, rounds are going on and rounds are happening like this.  are And you had selected a girl, then she is coming back, your third and fourth rounds have been done, then a girl looks like this. Boys and girls all come and get married, and she is throwing flowers on you like this and you feel like this.  I feel like man, why can't this happen? Now it's not like this, it won't happen like this, brother, I don't know anything about who he is, what he does, is this just an attraction? Did he show a brochure, if you see some smoothness in it, then just take this, oh brother, the rest.  Things are also there, isn't it? How was he marrying a girl, looking at his face, father, mother, behavior, cast, color, creed, everything is checked, money, wealth, nature, horoscope, 00 things, now wherever he has gone, everything has been checked, his builder's behavior, his behavior.  How much are you making? How do you feel? Everything is going well. But why do you have to do it just like this? Why do you have to take it just like this because its rate has increased? Brother, look, I had taken it from so much and now it has become so much.  sell it Why will we take this, then it will become from this much to this much, then it will become from this much to this much, then it will remain this much, this will also go further and every time you will pay the cost in between and brother, this is near your city center or city or location.  This is far away, this is the no kick of trading. Even in share market, people destroy money like this. Bought a stock worth Rs. 100, sold it for Rs. 1.25, now I will buy that for Rs. 200, it will become worth Rs. 250, then sell the one for Rs. 250. I will take that, then I will take this, then if you have taken a very good one and it is growing, then keep holding it, if you want to bring fresh capital, then you have to take one property, you have to diversify, you have to take two from BH.  Do you feel like taking it in this city or did you feel like taking it in this city, if you have all these things then it is understandable that this brother will keep coming forward every day in this jump, every day someone or the other will keep saying kill as I feel myself.  If I am also including you, then there is no need to wander around like a crazy butch. Marry someone with property. Do n't do it with stocks. If the performance of stocks is not going well then you can sell. There is liquidity, you can do it quickly and transaction cost is less in stocks. Brother, in property, there is registry on 78 rupees, GST on 5 rupees, IDC, EDC, then there is brokerage cost, then there is builder buyer agreement, if you sit and apply it.  If the rate goes to 15 so quickly, yes, think about it, don't jump like you took it here, you took it there, you took it all, if the rate increases then everyone's brother will increase and if it doesn't increase then brother will not increase again, remember this also. Yes, someone's 100 can be 120, someone's 100 can be 115, someone's 100 can be 125, it does not happen that one person's 100 becomes 200 and the other is like this.  No, it will not happen that those whose prices are lower, their appreciation has happened the same. I should not tell people but still I feel like it because no one comes and tells them that Dwarka Expressway was the most rubbish project, black and yellow taxis with non-my one sips.  There has been more appreciation in their prices because they had very, very distressed prices. Now this does not mean that you should go and buy and it also does not mean that you had to buy at that time but I am telling that the price Appreciation came the highest there, it was not to be taken even at that time, not to be taken even at this time, still there is a lot of difference in the price, it is bad, the thing is cheap, crying again and again is fine but now in that price point when people are going there they are saying that my Brother, if someone wants something for Rs 1.5 crore, then the prices of those things have increased, so the appreciation is there, but now no one can say whether it will come forward because someone's plaster is being stuck there, someone's seepage is visible, it does not look good.  stay somewhere else  View means whatever I put down, I do not take the name of the project but I am telling this practically that this has happened, so we have taken what I always say and you people can repeat after me and tell that.  Is this philosophy correct or not? Buy well, never sell, sleep well. If not, then what will be the profit? Meaning, whatever profit you make by buying and selling with the inheritance money is Rs 40 lakh, 60 lakh.  If he comes to you and suggests that you have to come back and then what will you do with that money, I will eat the profit, then that means you are living a measurable life, you are living a life with ease, if in your property, one crore becomes 20 and 20 lakhs.  If your house is running with a profit of Rs. 1000, then you are not doing any work. You are not going to go anyway, because sonorous and letter will come. When you go to such a place, you will get stuck. You will not get the thing there, or you will get it late, or you will get it very late. Or something else will happen because you actually don't have any other back. If a person is earning one and a half, two, three, four lakh rupees or income, then he is eating his bread from there, he should increase his assets and net worth, focus beyond that.  If you have bought a property from a good builder at a good location at a good price then the only thing left now is to have patience and get it delivered.  It is registered and stay there and put it on rent. Rent will be Rs 45, minimum of what you paid and current value will be 1 %. Hold on to the rent which is Rs 4 today, it will be Rs 5 in 8 years, capital appreciation will also be there.  It will happen but no one will tell, everyone will not say it. No brother, sell it and something good is coming and something else is bad and buy anything else if you feel like buying it.  And there is money, there is no use in buying by selling. The builder who had bought the floor is doing the same, let it hold on. Got it, no, no, no, we sell it because it does n't matter to me, the city is wrong, property prices are not increasing, others  By selling in the city, you are buying by all means. You have a property in a rotten street of Greater Noda. You are getting something by selling it. In Gurgaon, you are getting a down payment as a down payment and you can buy it further by adding something else. Buy by all means. But sell beans in the city  There is no point in buying it, so I am trying to tell you that there is no point in selling it in Greater NADA and buying it in Greater NADA, especially under construction anywhere because there must be some old property in Gurgaon which makes you feel that now I will not live here. And even if she is not going anywhere like this, still it is understandable that I am telling her exception that come on friend, this property must be old for me but brother, you had booked a place here 10 months ago, now it is in the market.  He is telling you that some of his premium is a little bit, so don't go and buy it because what you will end up buying will not be that much value for money because here it appears that if you buy something worth Rs 100, it will be worth Rs 120, but where the thing you are buying  Whether you are buying it for Rs 150, Rs 100 or Rs 120, are they worth that much? Was it not good enough? You have to think that all the new projects will be more danceable.  Than the previous ones, when they will be ready then you will understand the thing and why this is happening in Gurgaon market. Government has been increasing the fare. Before the last 10 years, the rate for high rise was 1.5-1.75, then they increased the rate for some area in between to 2.2.  After completing the tax, he said, 'Brother, if there is any utility corridor or any big road going on here, then the distance is 500 meters, then this is all.'  This is so much, then TD's FR has been further increased to 4.5, so the matter has become three times the density, so consider all this in valuations, keep sitting with the old one because a stage will come in 2025 26.  There is no supply, the ready to move in one will have more growth than the new one because the new one is being launched in 2024, go and see their certificate. You will get the date of 2031 2032, check it, you will get the loan in 2025, you will get it in 2033 34, see in RERA and practically too, work is done for six to seven months in a year, work is not being done in the rains, then NGT ban will be imposed, then that labor will run away.  And the labor will come after doing Chhath Puja and then there is pollution. Then the labor will run away due to pollution. If NGT bans it for 10 days then that  The laborer is not sitting there, he goes on his own, then it takes time to complete it, so the lot of people struggle to get it completed because that window is not there, so nothing is going to be done before seven years, if it is not going to be done then brother, when this is in between.  If you want a house then it is ready to move in, all these will increase only then the old taxes will also increase, so whoever is sitting with it, stay seated, the rent will increase in 2025 and the world will be ready in 2025.  To move in in 2025-26, don't sell for resale and buyers buy. There is a queue of buyers and five sellers, 50 buyers and sellers are not even selling. Everyone is having fun because everyone watches my video.  And it is good that you have fun, but sometimes you are having too much fun, so don't waste too much time, many people no, that is also happening, don't sell, then you know the rate and weight, just sit peacefully and follow. Keep doing it because why do you sell after knowing the rate, do you think that I will buy something else? Now the matter has gone to 141000 feet in Sector 93 and people queued up and bought it there too. Then brother, that is the nearby sector of Delhi.  How will they be less than that then if the goods are sold there then all that is like water, it has to be plain but once it is happening like this then you will feel a little bit like miss match other wise who is sitting with it where  Leke Baitha Hai Jitne Mein Leke Baitha Hai Baithe Raho It Will Do Very Well Thank You Very Much Subscribe to the channel Like Share You can also take membership by pressing the join button and you will find the webinar info group in the comment section if you have not already joined.

    "title": "Affordable Housing  Gurgaon FAQs Answered [Il1ChJ_X5E4].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, I have brought some information on affordable housing. Again there is a little confusion about affordable housing rates in Gurgaon. So I was already telling you that it is okay to grow up, which is a very good think. If anyone is thinking that this is the fault of the child.  Brother, if it is not affordable then Deendayal would not have come, anyway the government had made it affordable, if it is affordable then it is caste in Gurgaon. You didn't get anything below crores, so date it is a good think, the date is going on, after doing 5000, very good think, know what I want, you are oil people, this is what sister-in-law means, there has been a sudden change. If I do two, I will tell you five things.  I will tell you on priority three priority, some projects will also be coming in the coming time, I will tell you that if you are on the wait list in any project, then it is difficult. The wait list is clear, honey, why will it be cleared, brother? Projects have been launched, their rates are rising a bit, their rates will remain the same, so if you are waitlisted in that project whose multiples were removed, you had already canceled it in the first 15 days, so now it is up to you to remain waitlisted because Why would anyone cancel his ticket now and not the next one and the next one? Hey brother, if the rate is Rs 800 then it is already flooded, then it will be very difficult for you to move the wait list. Some are half defaulters and will not give anything.  If something happens, there is a separate chase, so if you are very low in the waitlisted category, very low, then now you can take a tomorrow. Of course, if you are not waitlisted one, three, five, then you can take a tomorrow because you are waitlisted.  I am feeling that according to me it will not be cleared. Okay, the second thing is that the new launches that you are coming up are not like there are some 200, 300 plants, there are some plants, but only priority three is there.  Practical chess is priority three, what is there in it, Haryana, because I am also from Haryana and the people of Delhi have a disadvantage, I had raised this issue earlier also that why are you doing this thing because if there is a family in Kaithal in Haryana in which  Those people who want to buy property but already have property in their name then it becomes priority four. If the residential property in your name in Haryana or in Delhi is in your current name then you have priority photo.  But the application will be included in the draw only when the priority three is less, if you have got 100 flats and priority three are those who do not have them in Haryana, Delhi and Chandigarh, now they have 150 properties in Gujarat, up to 5000 properties.  Even if there are 10,000 properties in Bihar, they are a priority. Those people from outside have been given advantage. When this policy was made in 2013, people lived there for 10 years.  People had not thought that the makers of this were thinking that only these people would apply, now it has become popular, I want to give myself a name in it, many people condemn me for this also, you tell the world.  Okay, okay, when people from outside come, the city does well. Also remember that a cosmopolitan city is divided only by the people of India, from the local people. The city may be within any province and it is doing very great and good.  his name  Tell me, where there are only local people, pick any big city, India is fine, people from Mumbai to all over the world have come to Delhi too, many refugees came to Delhi in 1947, I don't know from where and even now from where do those who are in Delhi come now. Many people live here and those who come here from Bihar, there are a lot of them, because it happens here, even if a few people came from there, no one accepted you, then no one in the country accepts you, welcome for anyone.  For everyone but this policy is as it is now I don't think there is much chase on priority in this, because now after 207 days, an extension for the project of 81 girls has come, in which the last non is the application of ₹ 8000 and no famous person has fallen, no one has made an announcement that brother, please do it. Nothing characters, nothing, silently 8000 applications will come. Okay, so in the coming time too, we can resume that if not more than the minimum, then at least five times that. If people do not advertise it and someone like us comes and says that brother, this is coming, it is good, take this, then it will become 10 times more. We have to make people aware because now when it is spreading from the middle of YouTube to the middle of social media.  This thing has come out that friend, you are from above, you are from Maharashtra, you are South Indian from Bangalore, still you can get free priority in affordable housing and here the level is 33 lakhs.  33 lakhs rate done 645 of 33 you are getting $645 carpet 100 feet balcony getting carpet which is 745 750 which is equivalent tu 1000 1100 square feet in super area which is com dr about 3000300 if rate the super area and me  One construction and there is no man who could not find it in the entire country.  If there is a place, tell me the story inside the city, also the story of which I have been, inside the village, inside the construction, in the forest construction, in any backward location in the entire country, everyone knows that subsidy is an investment, there is a benefit, there is a benefit, there is a lottery, so now Jin Jin  Has affordable housing on story also batch means Tulip Lemon you know how well she is doing which started with her apartments up to 435 450 500 square feet. Rent is going on, what are the valuations, Rakhi, whose affordable housing is there, don't sell, they will give you flats worth Rs. 1 crore, do it from today or in five years, this is your real estate clarity and number one promise, I am telling you that Dada's flats are coming out.  These are now available at very high rates and I do not see any such subsidy but let it be said that in Janakpuri side and many other places when Dada's flats were available at ₹200000 two and a half  1 lakh 3 lakh MIG licks were released like this, at that time, they were equal to today's affordable, no such great immunity, normal infrastructure, basic flat, basic layout, but were not very big like that and C der Journey D Se Journey Bill B Hill People with a salary of dead lakh rupees will live in these affordable housing. People with a salary of dead lakh rupees will live because the rents of others have gone from where to where. Gurgaon Haj scene is really a big jump in D.  Now people are not able to understand the rental market in the last six to eight months. Okay, so don't think that there is no gentry here that you do n't know who is living here, that situation will be fine, okay and now this is taking many  Many times people still ask like Ganga came how many months ago, did Ganga come five months ago? Oh, that is the height tension only in the middle, the story is going on, even now people are confused, oh no one half, hi. What difference does it make if only the tension is going? Hi tension, I told the video in the same way, the story of Scientific Indian Building Code is also going, there is no problem because the distance is divided according to the photo of the building, which is 6 times more than the distance allowed.  Leaving aside the entire Indian Building Code, then Haryana Building Code, Haryana Building Code has taken 6-7 times safety and what difference does it make to the people if something is going there, this Najafgarh drain is dirty.  Puri is going to Dwarka. Puri colony is situated on West Delhi. Everyone knows that there is a touching place on top of it. Even now if you ask that we should take an affordable one then you will get bored as soon as you ask for a date. If you ask for a D message then you will get an opportunity.  If you are from outside then take the dhaba. It is okay. Those from Haryana and Delhi who have their homes in Haryana and Delhi will apply, then this is a disadvantage, but the message to them too is that yours too.  There will be children above 18 years of age in the family who do not have any property in their name because normally there is no property in the name of an 18 year old child. So please apply after 18-19-20. For them, apply in their name. People of Haryana and Delhi.  This is the message for them, if they come in P3, if they come in P4 then you know that the game is different, okay then the rental will be good, the rate will be Rs 1 crore, in 5 years, in 4 years, in 5 years.  Those who have bought it for Rs 28 lakhs, have bought it last year and if they want to get a position in 3 years or 4 years, then this rate will touch them and the rental will be Rs 25-30 thousand. Just imagine, someone has bought a house worth Rs 28 lakhs. First you are getting Rs 33 lakhs and the rent is Rs 28-30 thousand. I am not telling today's rent, I am telling you the rent after 3 4 5 years from today. Already.  You look at the inflation and what happened to the rent and such a rent is not like you will become a tycoon but now it is being heard that it was a very good investment. Where can I get 12 tech care rent? Okay, so it is very good, now that.  If it will be worth Rs 1 crore, then how much will he get if he gets the rent on time? 3% is what financial institutions do in normal decision making. Brother, it is only 3% of Rs 1 crore.  So you are getting this is what we were paying for, hey uncle, when it was booked, according to that, it is 12%, right, capital appreciation has happened every time, d rent bill goes up, d capital value also goes up, so ratio remand three four three.  Four Three Four Three Four Five There is that much relief in Gurgaon, although the taxes are half the taxes because the rentals are a low because of being power of the public is more.  There is more money here, unlike Greater Noida, it is fine, unlike in Noida, it is fine, still a lot of men are being made, rain is of men and Gurgaon is yours, this is Noida, if you want a video on that, then tell me, rain is fine in Gurgaon, in that too, I will tell you the rate due to rain and Floods occur. It's okay due to spoilage, rates and floods occur. Both things have to be done separately. For me, the people of Noida are also connected, they keep climbing, I also tease.  If you want a video on that one, I will tell you, okay, it is not raining today, the weather is fine, but if he wants one, then I, I, never, that one, no Bhagat, no, I am fine with the debate, because if you have complete complete knowledge.  If you have, then you have, you stand, you screw, tell me what happened to you, now that I, that man, who will run away, then write to me in the comment area, now what happened, I will tell, okay, so Gurgaon rain is always my annual video relief.  Even before you guys  We will see on another channel, now this is a real estate channel from Explorer, if you want to make it on this also then I will make it, okay if you want, there is a popular demand, then tell me brother, please make Guru ji on rain, okay, we want to know, okay then what?  Is it okay because he is my own brother, isn't this Gurgaon News guy, he is so much water, he has votes sitting in it like this, where is he roaming now when the real me is filled and that water is like this, the road is like this, the vehicles from here are like this. His friend Mike is going  He is standing there writing, there is 6 inches of water in his own body, that is, there is only this much water from below and he is sitting in a boat lake, hey, today I make a video on Artificial Intelligence, okay, what is the program in it, how much is true, how much is false, how much is it?  Okay, so we will make it on this too, please tell me, but spread this affordable one to people, thank you."

    "title": "Affordable Housing Gurgaon Future Prospects [vLK3MFoKJ7o].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, many questions are asked on Affordable Housing Gurgaon, I will tell you some questions, I will tell you the phenomenon, how many excellent returns people have earned in the past, what should those who have bought now, what should they do, want to buy, some will come in the future, how many will come, we will discuss all those things. So let's start first of all, only those who are priority three can buy affordable housing in Gurgaon draw because only priority three gets oversubscribed.  Priority Three is a person who does not have any property in his or his wife's name in Delhi, Chandigarh or Haryana. If he already has property then he becomes Priority Four. In the draw, Priority Three mostly comes out first 5-7.  Years ago, so many people did not oversubscribe. People like us spread its awareness, then anyone started buying. Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, anyone can buy and an outsider can keep the property for as long as he wants, although earlier I  I had tried to raise this issue a lot with the government but I was told in an unofficial way and it was explained that Guruji, the most important thing is that if people from outside come and settle here then it will grow further, however for the people of the state it will be a little difficult.  It is bad because if you are from Jind, you have a small house, you have some house in the colony, you have some house in the authorized colony, then you cannot buy here whereas Gudga is Gudga, so it was a bit bad, but this.  Policy brother, it is like this, the people of Haryana did not oppose it anywhere, I tried a lot, once I made a video, the video got a lot of publicity, but that too, everyone wants someone else to fight our battles, that's nobody, everybody, nobody and that.  Same elder brother, you must have heard that in English it is okay, someone will do it, it should be done, yes yes, you do it, why do it, what do we say here, why should I become a leader, I am a Guruji, I can only give knowledge, brother.  it's like that I had recently told about the plots sold in the auction that they should be allowed because when they bought it, there were four allowed, so they had bid according to the money of four, people liked it very much.  It is logical that it will happen in the court of law also, so here no one has done anything, it is fine, but as the situation is now, I tell you that affordable housing is a gold mine, the rates have doubled to 75 lakhs wherever the position is.  Within Sector 71 of Signature, there are 2 BH's and around 85 90 90 Lakhs of 2 BH's and this much it has come up with and it is something between 60 Lakh to 1 Crore in its Gurgaon market, otherwise whatever affordable housing. That space occupation can't be something for not a crore, but a car worth ₹ lakh, now it will be worth ₹ 60 lakh, there is a lot of space.  It will be worth 70 lakhs, it will be worth 30 lakhs. The government has increased the rates from 5000 feet to 5000 feet or from 4000 carpets to 25, the government has increased the rates. If the rates of balconies have increased separately, then never think of selling whatever affordable housing you are sitting with which is outside.  People are cash hungry, their 2 BHK is fully furnished, rent is coming from Rs 20 to Rs 225000. Go and check in Lemon, there is another affordable housing which is doing very well. It is situated at 90 m 9 road. Come and see the rentals of that too in 102. Come and see how much are there. There is also a society in Sun City, in 102, come and see it now. So, it will still take a year for the Dwarka Expressway to become bright and beautiful, but it is Satya Satya High Mall, it has become famous, so 102 people have come out and there is one next to it.  If our mall is being built then it is not available in affordable housing for rent everywhere. You will see this in every house, not a single house will be seen where raw vests and clothes will not be found drying, that shows 100% occupancy and the rent is fully furnished. Rent is rental led where anyone who finds it is selling it for resale. Those who do not have knowledge, outsiders do not have knowledge. There are many people from outside.  Those who have bought it, they want to dispose of it, wherever they get it, they can get it as per their understanding, take 50 lakhs, 55 lakhs, 60 lakhs, it has to move further towards 1 crore and 1.25 crores will also go towards affordable housing.  Mark my words, some properties in a year, now beyond that, different videos, you would like me to make, like now MRG is Alti, its position is inside 90 sector etc. Your RV will come which is touching the hospital, there is an MRG balcony next to it and it is of the same sizes, what premium luxury, ultra luxury is branded in it, some carpets of those sizes 620, 640 of 2BH have been sold for 1.25 crores, so brother, this is proper. Why not parking in many of the three room houses, this one will be worth Rs 1 crore, this one will be worth Rs 2.5 crore but it is okay, it has a swimming pool, many of these too but this one is worth Rs 1 crore. And what is the benefit in it, and what I want to teach and explain in this is that it is also a learning experience that you cannot sell it as long as it is being formed, you cannot sell the position for one year, it takes time to be formed.  Normally it is said to be of 5 years to four years, but I don't think any one is made before one year, many of them take 6 years also, so some are made in 5 to 6 years, some are made in 5 years and one of them is  If we cannot sell till the year position, then due to this the property does not come in the market to be sold, only then we have got the real appreciation, things worth Rs 25 and 30 lakhs have gone for Rs 75,800 lakhs, if there has been three times appreciation, then the same thing I teach people is that  Even in Pune markets and other markets hold on to these properties and I will have to make a separate video in the future as to whether one of these ideas is visible to me.  The property prices are controlled by speculative builders. Do you know from where the rates have been taken? Well, to tighten the noose on these rates too, a government will not be formed right now. No, it means it will be formed again. I am not saying that it is changing, it is not changing.  But we have to give an idea to the government and I will give it through my video. If you support me then you can tell me that by implementing that idea we can raise the prices of a property and its direct relation is here. Genuine people are ours, come and those who have taken life long cash flow, this is mini pension, it is 20 to 22000 and fully furnished rent will be 27 to 28000 th BH, whose position is to be held next year, not telling yet, next year MRG Ultimus  As it is, another one is being built next to it where also 2 BH MRG Ultimus position is being built in 6 months January  Write 2025 and take 2000 rent from me for 2 BHK. If anyone has any doubt then write in the comment section. 614 620 carpet is good. No one can buy it off-course in BHK. All the goods are sold and cannot be bought even in resale.  Since the position itself will be in December and the position cannot be sold for one year, then write down the rate of MRG Ultimus for December 2025 somewhere and give it to me.  Crore rupees, brothers and sisters, one crore minimum, I will now make specific videos on affordable housing because where there is value, I have to talk about them and in the coming time, nothing is coming because the builders have now transferred five acres of land.  You are also seeing that the affordable ones have also come into luxury, many of you know the name is right because they are earning money in it, where will the money be left in the affordable one, he knows at 5000 feet.  What will he be left with? Look at the cost of land. Where will it come from? Cut Deendayal's plots. Let's not cut Deendayal's plots. Now what will be cut? If Deendayal's is also closed, now he will cut this luxury. He will build two more towers. Now he will build two and a half towers. Within an acre you will see one tower of luxury because the government has changed the policy, now you will see in the coming time on Dwarka Express, some famous listed player will come. In time, a tower of 22 to 000 square feet, a luxury tower will come on these two and a half acres, we will also sell, the world will also sell, the world will also buy, brother, then it is affordable, now it is not going to come anywhere, it is coming anywhere.  You are listening as if someone is coming by mistake. Something from the last time signature was released. Which project's name extension was released in 37D? 12000.  Applications had come for 200 units, meaning the ratio was 1:6. This much discovered project has been produced. If you do n't get anything then don't sell your affordable housing but still if people want to buy then buy in Sun City 102, buy RO 102, very good.  Nice rental yad has pricing there now like the video is made then the price has increased by Rs 10 lakh, the price of the big one and the small one BHK is Rs 35 4 lakh.  Rap rent will be around 17 18 00, you will get it fully furnished which is 350 square feet, you go and check and now their position is coming behind tha BH, the position of tha BH is coming and there was a lot of noise that hey.  There is some ground there, this is ground, that road has to be built, there is nothing there, what is there to create misconceptions, people are not interested in parking the vehicles, now go vehicles.  There are only 500 cars parked, there is plenty of space to park inside, you wo n't be able to play cricket there, the glass will break on their backs, there is a bad place to park the car, what other car do you need, where should you park your car worth Rs 4,5,6 lakhs? Bring it to us, that builder means he had sold one BH worth Rs 131 lakhs for one BH worth Rs lakhs, now his rent comes to Rs 161000. Who is this to Ankur Warik or this to Akshay Srivastava and tell them?  This is the rental allowance. Brothers and sisters, the rent of one BHK worth Rs 13 lakh is coming to Rs 177000. So tell me how much is the rental allowance. There is a rental allowance at 16. Tell them to the mutual fund people. And if I put this money in the mutual fund, it will last for the next 15 years.  And there also if you grow it at 14 then I am getting rental at 16 and I am selling it at 15.  If I grow, then brothers and sisters, how much return will I get and the capital appreciation is different. Small is good, small is big, small is the best thing, where are the affordable singhs, beyond that, if you want video then tell me the exact thing.  When will I give the position, what is the pricing, whatever rate I say here, it becomes the rate, you all know, many people feel this way. Hey, you are doing this to those who have bought. Those who have bought are also getting benefited. And this life is sometimes a zero sum game. Brother, one's gain will result in loss to the other. If you vote for one, you will vote for one.  We will not give it to the other one, one will form the government and the other will lose. If you cannot make both of them win, then it is the same, then why should those who have kept you there ever not be made win? Why should the mutual fund people who had bought so many years ago be made always win? Look, five to six years.  to hold Where are the rates going, they are going to triple and will increase further, they will increase from here also, this is the message please write in the comment section thank you"

    "title": "Affordable Housing Gurgaon ｜ All Important Queries Answered [GsM7Wzh8WgY].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, there are many questions on affordable housing in Gurgaon which people ask. I will try to answer two to four questions. You people have to understand them. The biggest problem I have seen is that construction in affordable housing has not been done and the demand has increased.  It has been given and specially those people who have to take loan are facing problem because the bank says that it has not been made yet, in which projects is it coming, please write in the comment section, I will tell you my take on this that  This thing is wrong but I feel that in affordable housing the builder is looking for excuses to cancel your allotment. I also see that he is looking for excuses and then if he gives some excuse, he will cancel your allotment because look this is worth Rs. 253 lakhs.  The thing has become worth crores of rupees in the resale in the market, you people can see this, okay, where the position has come, it is definitely worth 70800 lakhs, but that size was small because the size of the ones that came earlier is smaller, the current position  Come  The positions that are coming up now, in which you are facing this problem, brother, these are all 645 square feet plus 70, 80, 100, 150 square feet balcony, so their valuation is high, so be very aware of things because what  It happens that if the car meets with an accident, you do not look forward to every accident, you want that it should be mine only, then it is good, right? Or if you look forward to it, then the insurance person will give it, he will ask one and a half crore questions and then you will have to go through another process.  If you want to go then I am giving you a practical advice as well. I am not saying here that I am telling you that no, there is nothing, get it from your sources, get it from anywhere, tell them once and then send an email to that side, brother.  If something serious happens then take the help of RERA but they have not given it, whether I pay it or not, they will keep imposing penalty and then by the time you go, you will come to know that its construction is also done, we really do n't know what is happening  is asking for it first  It is not of your tower, he is asking as per the project, it has happened at many places in the project, it has not happened in your tower, it should have been done as per the tower, everyone should ask for it separately I really don't know, I too am the builder being abusive, I  There should be a complaint about it, but you should write in the comment section that if you are facing this problem then all of you get together and go somewhere, otherwise who will go for you, MLA, MP, Modi ji, Khattar ji, the urban housing person, or Guruji, why would anyone go, what is the benefit?  I have told him the issue, but why should I tell him who is getting the benefit in affordable housing, otherwise the one who is getting it, it is not even coming now, so I am talking a little heartlessly, but there is also some practicality in being heartless, so respect what  Ever you want to take it, it is a wrong thing, there is no doubt about it, you should call out, protest, sit down, protest somewhere, but be careful that you don't get to know about it, I did the same, why some people from NRIs etc. came to me,  He had gone out and his meaning became known unknowingly  It got cancelled and then they will tell you somewhere that we sent a reminder, you did not do it so we cancelled it, you were thinking here that I will save my interest of 10-20 thousand or it is still late or how is the bank then this  See, this is the problem that is happening. The second thing I want to tell you is that if you have already bought affordable housing and it is coming into position, then listen carefully. And you live outside Gurgaon, you have no idea why you bought a house worth Rs. 25 lakhs.  I had taken it and it was worth Rs. 25 lakhs only because this 000 feet was built later, the construction of which is still going on and will be in position in three to four years, the ones which are in position now are of small size and their price was around Rs. 25 lakhs  The rates have gone up to 75 lakh, 80 lakh, 85 lakh. That's how much the rent of fully furnished house is, 23, 24, 25 Haj is coming, there are many societies, I do n't know what the rates are in small, very small Tulip Lemon societies and  Was it of small size, then you should never sell them, it seems to be worth 50 lakhs, I do n't know what will happen to me with high profit, nothing will happen, you will not be able to buy anything in the entire country and then you will have to pay separate fees for registration, separate fees for GST, separate brokerage  You will pay and construction risk, execution risk is there in every project no matter what kind of builder or risk of delay, so if you have got one thing, then hold on to it and eat its rent, you brothers and sisters are getting rental property worth 25 lakhs  The rent is coming to Rs 25,000 and what else do you want? Now this Zara Roza people will get the position, I think, or it has happened to some people by making Lotus in 112, their position is now in 111, RO F Alias' position is now there, look at their rates friend.  Look at the position in Sun City 102, look at the rates, they will increase and increase because maintenance is there but in this way, maintenance is not there per month for Rs 100, everyone knows about affordable housing  It is one and a half, two and a half depending on whose size it is, but a lot of people will stay and the middle class will stay here because in the coming times the middle class is going to fall, not the middle class as we understand it, this is the middle class, so  Or this will also be middle class, okay then there will be a lot of demand for it in the future because the cheapest legal one where you can get a loan and a clean registry, that product is the same even today and it will be the same even after 10 years, below this in urban villages  Power of attorney and all those messed up scam games, who will get into that, so this is the cleanest thing, so whenever any person even after 5 years from today whose salary will be Rs. 1 lakh or 2 lakh, he too will be living here on rent and he  He would want to buy this, this will come within his budget, when I am saying that it will touch crores very soon in one year because whatever the position of some people is going to be in two-four months, then they cannot sell them for a year when they  If we sell it in a year then that brother 615 612 sq ft 80  90-100 sq ft balcony and those which are in very good location will cost crores, so even if you take a loan of Rs. 80 lakh to get a crore, then it will cost Rs. 75,000, 75,000 ee, only the one who earns more than one and a half lakh should pay, in fact only Rs. 2 lakh from him  If he is able to pay, then brother, people worth one and a half to two lakh will buy these things, so hold on to them and do not sell them in these cycles that I have to sell them. Then the third thing is the builders in position, the old ones, that is, the projects which have been built recently, the ones which were launched earlier.  The position of the loans which were launched seven years ago is coming now, in that, for electricity charges or for some other things, they are taking some things up to Rs. 50000, 80000, lakh, one and a quarter lakh, what should they take, what should they not take, why are they taking it, why before  Didn't you tell me what happened over a period of time? Safety rules and regulations have increased, including that the lift should not stop or the government has to add some additional requirements. So, this was not there when they launched it.  So the government has allowed them to take it, this is a legitimate thing from the government, now the question arises as to how much, what happens in how much, if one should take Rs. 100 and someone is taking Rs. 80,000 then you have to go to the court to save Rs. 20,000  So what people do many times is, they harm you so much by bullying that it will cost him a lot in the hearing and you pay it saying look I am not the builder's man, I know what the problem is, you should raise your voice, everybody should raise their voice  Make as much noise as you want that this is wrong because there should be electricity transformers which should be loaded, you have to understand that when this product was conceived in 2014, it was thought that these poor people will live here or they will not be that rich by doing affordable housing. One BH was launched for Rs 141 lakh, 13 lakh, 14 lakh and small TBH were launched for Rs 171 lakh, so people had never imagined that there would be two ACs here  The public will install them in the rooms and there are 800 units each and 1 1200 units each, so what will be the load of the AC in it? The wiring has not been done for the load of the AC, the system comes from outside, you must understand that the society also has a transformer. One is the wires which are coming and the switch is being installed, one is the load taking capacity of the whole system, so there was chaos in it because the earlier 61 sectors were given such a society that whatever was made  There was, take it, firecrackers used to be burst every day, we had done it 3 years ago, there is no youtube0, what did the builder do, this was the game, friend, the builder actually made it for the poor type, now it is affordable, those who have come of late, maavan vaavan  And all these good builders are making very good ones, Signature has made very good ones, other builders are also making good ones, many builders are making decent ones, so some people are asking for money for all these things in it, as far as  My guess is that if  It should be 100 so maybe some people are asking for 120-130, I am telling you as per percentage, now demand higher price from the one who wants to listen to you, bargain, if you want to complain, complain, if you want to pay, pay, it depends on me.  You are, it depends on who you are, but don't waste your blood on it, this is the question, you are looting like this, common man is being looted everywhere, there is looting here also, I believe that the builder feels that he cannot loot even Rs 400, what does it mean  I am thinking that I am not a friend of the builder, do n't mistake me for dust, Guruji, I am a man, the builder is thinking that brother it must be an item worth one crore, now he could not sell it for one crore, when he latched on to it, he is thinking of a running ghost  I should take something from the loincloth and the rest is sucked from the maintenance also because one of their companies does the maintenance, they all have strange names, it is the game of the builder, so the builder says I am there also because it is a cash cow for him, so brother  It is played This is going on, it is good or bad, RW has to put their money, RW has to do it with the builder, after positioning in the predicted affordable housing in every society, there is conflict for one to one and half years, after that when the matter gets settled, the builder gives up.  People get used to it, they become stubborn or everyone sits quietly, so my prediction in every position is that I am a real estate clarity giver, there will be stampede everywhere, not this or that, but I have told you that the rates will go up to crores, okay.  This is also a fact because no money is coming in. So these were your three or four things and if you have any affordable housing then tell me there is a builder or something brother 10000 applications for 800 something means 10 times over Subscribe Before that some signatures had come 100, 150, some units 25 times oh everyone has over subscription and there was a time it is funny that there was a time when people used to easily get out in the draw, seven, five, six, seven  A year ago, people used to throw tantrums in that too that I did not get a good unit and now all those who surrendered themselves in such tantrums must be regretting that this is good, this is bad because what is it, there is no reference point for someone to come and tell me.  It is not like that brother, a thing worth ₹1 is available for ₹25, people are more folks, the price of ₹25 is good and the price is bad, people were and there were YouTubers, I remember each and every name, because of the look of the YouTuber, now their subscribers have also increased.  The number of followers has also increased, okay, and if such people belong to only one community, in terms of authority, then why insult them by taking their names, but now those videos will not be there, you will not see them anywhere, but you people who are old followers, they used to make them at that time.  There is no parking, there is no car parking here, this would be a big problem, chawls are also sold at some rate, EWS flats are also sold, everything has a rate, brother, I am tired of talking about the rate, people are feeling shy, learn from Gujaratis  low price judge god how many  I am getting this thing, tell me, whatever amount you pay in EDC IDC GST, for that amount you can get this BH, in that EDC ID GST is more and then there is debate and look at the rent, which affordable housing is it  A fully furnished 2 BHK delivered house whose carpet area is more than 550 square feet and has a balcony of 1001 feet is earning from 25000 rupees, then write the name and at what price you bought it, that thing worth 23 24 25 lakhs, 23 24 25 lakhs  It was worth 75, 80, 85. Right now it is in sector 71 and separately the Signature projects which have come, are trading at 808 lakhs on delivery. One of Sun City has come in position 76 inside sector 70, check the resale, which means resale is open now.  It's been a year now, maybe I think they are right, 80 lakh, 85 lakh, 80, 85 lakh and that means people from better location are going to get the position.  And better things are about to come, so crores are not wrong in saying this. I am not wrong in saying crores. The position of the project which is coming in three months, write down its price after one year. It is one crore rupees. So whoever has got it, has kept it, please enjoy the appreciation.  Do not sell it, we will get it sold, after selling it we will get it for you one crore, that will then become 4 crores, it is not going to happen, just lie down like this, this is cash cow, it is a mini pension, old age will pass, I do n't know if something happened to the money, this might have happened.  It will keep paying the rent of these DDA flats in Janakpuri, which used to be worth one and a half, two and a half lakhs, these are worth one and a half crore, okay one crore 60 lakhs, it does not increase much, but brother, their rent comes to 40-45 lakh rupees, which only cost Rs 1 lakh  I had bought something worth two lakhs, think its rent is 40000 today, so sit tight, there is no benefit in selling these, I am saying this and if anybody in the family is selling it, then buy it from him because brother, there is someone If nobody needs them now  Do not play for capital appreciation, I am not saying at all that if these people become one crore rupees now, they will not become two crore rupees even in 5 years, a cap is imposed after going to a place, it is okay, but if you have cash  For 24 lakhs, no, it is like I have bought NHPC share for 141, it is now worth 90 or something, brother, I get dividend at 12, 133, 14, my people will say no, if yours is at 92, it becomes 2, so 2  But he said, why brother, my shares are bought for ₹, I am calculating on 14, that if someone has bought 1 lakh shares and gets ₹ per share, then he gets ₹ lakh and if he has bought 1 lakh shares for 14  It was for one lakh rupees, he is getting two lakhs for 14 lakhs, so he will calculate accordingly that I am getting it for 13 or 14, so now just hold me tight for my money  Those who are followers, subscribers, you write in the comment section, yes yes Guruji we have affordable housing and I will not sell it, then enjoy the fun and watch the game, do not sell it, you will be caught, give me a box of such sweets, then brother what should we do, passing the partial brother  Sir, what should we do now and brother, now you come to the commercial, your box of sweets is missing, you understood my point, now you have got the thing, for how much, what is it letting you do, the money is not being spent anywhere, it's an emergency  If any child wants to settle outside, the boy got selected in Harvard, so much is happening to you, they are saying brother give me one crore and sell it, okay, but such a situation should not arise that brother, selling it is enough  Bhaisahab this is not Bhaisahab, if you will not sell then write in the comment section, all the affordable housing will not be resold, we will do it, come live on rent, come live on rent, all the followers of Ankur Warku ji will live on rent, will do SIP in mutual funds in affordable housing I will stay, I will not buy a house I will not take a loan, I will do SIP, me and you who are my followers, sit tight and then see how wealth is created and what to do with the rent of that mutual fund, the Rs 25,000 that will come, invest that in the mutual fund, play Excel Excel and brothers and sisters, if  If you invest at 100% for 15 years, it becomes ₹ crore and if you invest 225000, it will become 1.75 crores. If you get returns on 15%, then brothers and sisters, invest in it and the rent will increase. The rent doubles in 9 years. Easily even a dead place gets sold in seven, a decent place gets sold in eight, a dead place gets sold in nine, so see how much the rent will be in 15 years and if you are investing all the rent in mutual funds, then  What will happen next, you should understand what you have to do. I have given you clarity on the entire affordable housing in Gurgaon, then everything will be frozen as soon as this video of mine goes and if it is frozen like this, then what will happen is that the rates will increase. Now, those who did not buy will abuse them, and those who bought will say thank you. You can see after three months how much the market will rise because you cannot buy half the things because the position will come in December or January.  You can buy them next December-January because for one year period I you cannot sell it and for the next one year whatever position comes, everyone will keep getting clarity like this, now this video also will be watched by at least 10-10000 people if they don't watch it  You have to show it to the people who have purchased, if you have formed groups, you have to show it to them, brothers and sisters, only then will the rates increase, this video has increased the rates of affordable housing, pan Gurgaon, this single video has increased the rates by 5%, did it increase it or not, it has increased it by 5%.  If you have not increased it then write it down, so whoever was listening at whatever rate, after this video, brothers and sisters, increase it to 5, the rate has to be increased gradually, if you have to cross the limit, it is very dirty, what will happen to me by saying dirty things  What happens if you buy it, you don't have any duty towards those who got it for you, is it only for the new ones who are coming?  Yes brothers and sisters, for the new ones there are 150 standing in the market who will take care of the old ones, so the old ones also have to be taken care of and when it was told then you should have bought the thing, buy it now also if you are getting it somewhere then there are still many value deals  It is available at some places, it is still available for 60 lakhs. According to me, the rate should not be less than 75-80 lakhs, somewhere it should be above 80 lakhs, but there are many hidden locations, if it is like that, then the matter is 55-60, which I am telling as 7580 that  I am telling you that this is an average location, good location is 95 lakh and crore, what is a good location which is on 80, 90 meter road because even ultra luxury is not coming on 90 meter road, even that is coming on 24 meter road We will not sell the place, we all should take a pledge, Amit Shah ji makes us do this, my first name is also the same, so everyone will take such a pledge, we are owners of affordable housing in Gurgaon, you will not sell it for anything cheaper than this  Neither is it there today nor will it be there and it can be sold anytime on three days' notice. Liquidity is like the stock market. Mutual fund money takes three days to come in the account whereas this one will come in two days. You can understand that if there is so much liquidity  We will not sell it, write everything in the comment section, only then there will be effectiveness, whoever has bought it and brother who has not bought it, we will keep bringing some value for money things for you as well because the story of what is value for money today will play the same way after 5 years I remember when I used to talk about affordable housing, then Thana was the only one and I am the one responsible for making other people discover it, people from other states used to think that only people from Haryana will take it and then they will say, well you are the one who  You did this, yes it is me, you can abuse him or love him or respect him, you can't love him, if it's a matter of love him, hate him, you ca n't ignore him, subscribe to the channel, like it, brother, nothing.  It doesn't matter that you bought it, I will explain you some good thing, you can take it, you will be benefited from that too, don't  Be in the rejection game Be in the selection game Many people play the rejection game Be in the selection game Like, share and subscribe to the channel There is a group in the comment section where information is given through webinar If you are already in a group  If I don't have it, then there will be duplication, but if it is not there, if someone has forwarded it for the first time, then you can join that group, then you will get the latest breaking news, thank you very much."

    "title": "All Investors Be Careful Before Investing In Such Projects [tSKEo4Bb6ew].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, be careful before investing in these projects or bull run. There is an advantage and also a disadvantage in a way. Explain these things very carefully and do not make this mistake. If you do not make this mistake and understand this then please. Write something good. It's fun, won't you? Learn to write something good so that I feel good in the report mark. One or two lines, whatever is fine and you were about to make this mistake, write it like you were saved or have made a mistake, write this is.  About Projects which  They were stalled, they were dead. When the real estate goes up, the land rates of those properties become so much that even the dead bodies become alive and become zombies. We recently saw the Supreme Court against the builders.  The ruling came that Unitech is also being liquidated, it is okay for their buyers, there is good news for them, there is no problem, something was stuck in yours, something will be done, brother, it is a good thing, this is the real estate cycle right now.  You are done and up and so many years have passed, this phenomenon is playing out even in Greater Noida, it was Amrapali's, it is being made by NBCC and it is from JP and after expiring, you are getting to know about these projects.  I don't want to buy fresh, I don't want to buy fresh Swami funds, Swami Swami, you can do it, brother, these are too many cooks, spoil the broth, it may seem cheap, but I don't know how long these have been here.  The mouths of the projects were open and no one has any idea of ​​their inner soul, they will give you lipstick and nail polish. When you do not require any place in 3BH, pan India, then suddenly when you get the budget which is the market rate.  If it is found much below then it attracts you, you say that it is the right thing, then these people are advertising it, it is backed by Government of India, it is Government of India backed, not Government of India.  The poor girl was robbed, beaten up, the one whose bones were broken, she is bringing him back to life by giving him crutches. That dozen means that project has become lucrative for the Amrak and I will tell you what is happening to the top firms. Now I will take the name.  That enmity will become big because the top people of the same group take advice from me and if he is a friend then I am not going to take his name. Okay, so now you will say no, no, you are afraid.  It's not like I don't take as much as I am telling you. Understand that no one is poking a gun in my head that I have to tell everything and for me, neither contesting elections nor being popular is the most important thing, so I don't want to be popular. I am for a sensible person, I want to make my impression.  I do n't want to be a social reformer socialist but what I want to tell you is that the big consultants who care about the property, the name itself means they are so big, they are taking up this poor project for the sake of marketing. Now if he doesn't pick it up for sales then the goods will not be sold. I also know because it is a stalled project, all those stalled projects were not sold even at that time when they were stuck, so if let's say 500 units, 500 units.  There was only 200, 250, 300 units sold in the project because if all had been sold then perhaps he would have made it or something else and he would have lost it, so the remaining units are and  What is happening in many cases, inside the same project, a half tower is made and a bonfire is made, fresh units are arrived, then brother, this is half garbage work, it is something like that if any vegetable was being made then now it is in it.  If there is something wrong, if there is too much salt in it, then you reduce it by adding potatoes or if it gets burnt from the bottom, you are correcting it, then do n't go, I am saying this, don't go because that or this, you will face later.  lost position  After and then the truth will be revealed, as it happens, first see, it is a product of company reject, the shoe is a little bit damaged, is the shoe worth Rs. 12000 from any firm and its lace was wrong, so it is available for Rs. 4.  So okay, that is not happening here, it is not available cheap here, you cannot say that it is a shoe worth Rs 12000, now there is so much wrong with it, so give it to me for Rs 1100, it is not for Rs 00.  Worth buying that in Rs 000, it is not worth it. Yes, if you are actually getting it for Rs 4000, then buy it because Bhava Bhagwan, I am also giving clarity to this, Bhava Bhagwan, so the one who had stuck 4 ₹ for his own and he was losing his money now.  Even by giving him Rs. 000 more, he can complete his work and its market value should actually be Rs. 88000, that's fine, even then he still has a profit.  Also 4000 was mine, I was stuck with 000, I took more, got something worth 8000, I am fine, I do n't have any problem with that, but take something fresh for 121000, I am telling this as an example, consider it as absolute rate but consider it as square feet rate.  Take it psychologically, that is your point because many people do not know that this is the work of this builder and the builder has gone to jail.  There has been no change in the management either, which means leave this kind of bigoted brother here, you have to get a fresh one, you are from a good new builder with new technology, according to this, say according to that, is this a project or a red brick project, brother, this is a red brick.  Do n't take the cement ones or others that came later, the AAC slabs etc., this is also okay, this is also relatively okay, now the technology has come very good, but I do n't know how many contractors are there in their case.  The contractor was changed, the contractor was not getting the money, what would the contractor have put in, what would the new one have put in, no one knows anything, neither am I taking the name of any project or the project is infamous, nor am I taking the name of any other builder or anyone else. I am taking the name of the thing in this way, whatever case is being made, look at it as per your convenience and I am talking about Pan India, do n't just call it North India before going to something, before taking it in any project, wherever.  Do n't you see Swami Funds SWAM  I H is probably mostly this, if I am not right, then brother, leave it, pass it, tell me pass it, you take it, I am not going to take it, I am not going to take it, because what is this now, is it being pasted in the bullish market and  Very big people are saying this in English with a straight face, wearing a shirt and tie like me, but still my job is not to show that I am a great person and people are not bad. I don't want to spoil the market.  I am realistic, this is happening and in other places you have to see where the valuations are right for me, look quality will come at a price, it will not be cheap but yes expensive, you can also be sold poor quality goods and good goods will definitely be sold expensive.  If there is a bullish market, then you will find something that is cheaper somewhere else and something that is not available anywhere else, that seems cheap, then check it out, it is cheap, no, because if you find the pricing also less in this, then all your money is wasted. run in one go  Because they are coming on these positions, they are coming on all the positions, your money will be gone in one go and in many cities like Greater Noida, there is a lot of supply there, that amount of 35,40,50 thousand flats will come together.  Yogi ji and by holding all those meetings, they are doing a good job, it is a very good thing for the flat owners who are stuck, they get their flats, they get a roof, they get the money to whom they had given it. They should get it but brother it's all a game of valuations, look no matter how even junk is sold, the price in India is for everything but the main thing is the price, what price you are getting, you have to be careful, sometimes what?  The thing taken worth Rs. is a complete waste of thing and the thing taken worth Rs. 00 is worth it. I want to tell you that these flats are attracting money because of two-three reasons.  So there is openness, there is openness, I also agree that the sizes of the flats have also increased because what has happened over the period time, the sizes of the flats have become smaller, so what I am saying is that do your due diligence carefully and think carefully. Understand it well and go and physically see this Swami Fund, wherever it is. Check how many times the contractor has changed, how many times the builder has changed, which one tower was built, who built the other, there is a synergy among them.  It happens in a project that there is a project which is visible to you with the eyes, there is something which is not visible to the eyes which is the soul of a project, just like a car also has a soul, the car which you see is from outside.  The seats are visible, the belts are visible, the music system is visible inside, but the engine is not visible, the transmission line is going from below the engine, how will the steering work, how will it work, that is the soul of the car, in the same way the soul is projected, where is the sewerage? going from  How is the sewerage treatment plant built, how will the things go from inside, seepage etc. will it not come, if it has been messed up originally, the chances are very high because over period of time, we don't know who all messed up in that project.  -Who turned out to be that when it was not the intention of that builder and that builder himself moved away, so now the one who has taken over is going and making it from the beginning, he is like lipstick and nail polish.  If you are trying to sell then this awareness is very big, this video will also not last long because of this awareness, there is pressure on me too not to spread it too much because and I demand the right to that pressure, I also consider that pressure as the right. Yes friend, because these things also have to be sold but I am saying that those who are associated with me should listen, there is no need to forward this video in everyone's mass awareness because if you watch and customers do not come then the old ones will not be able to make it.  The old ones will not get any exit, the old ones will remain stuck, so I am not here, but look at this, doing good to one person is also kicking the stomach of two because I am an astrologer also, I understand that I cannot do this like this, brother, the goods also need to be sold.  But it is also important to explain, it is the fate of everyone else, who got this knowledge and did not get it, that is also luck, who did not understand even after getting this knowledge, that is also luck, man can tell, right?  Normal man, you say, don't smoke, don't drink alcohol, keep your health good, wake up on time in the morning, eat good food, but not everyone agrees, because if everyone agrees, then the work of doctors will go on with yes, hospitals will go on with yes, it's fine.  So that also works, only that awareness is given that as much as you tell, you will get irritated, people will get irritated if you tell too much, they will get irritated and even enmity occurs and who are you to tell that eating Vitamin B daily means some kind of disease.  No  It will come and the nutrients in the body are fine and get yourself checked. It is necessary to get Vitamin D (B12) checked. Many times the weakness is coming from that. The test is only 1200, but if you tell me this, only the medical people know it. Why doesn't the government come and tell everyone about this, why doesn't the government make the tests for Vitamin B12, which is deficient in many people in India and Vitamin D is very low, and make it mandatory that brother, get his levels checked.  Do it, other issues are coming in the body because of these and you are going to incur huge expenses but you are not told because everyone knows, those who know, but a different economy is going on, it is necessary to run that too, I am aware of this thing.  I have a feeling and I am speaking under this feeling that I am here to become a social reformer, it is not my aim to become some kind of hero who is my subscriber, such videos will come and will last for a few days, in two-four-five days, as many as  The target is my views, after showing that many, I will stop it so that if you want to give it to someone in your close circle that my brother is my son, my son is my father, if I have seen it then do it to them but there is no need for mass sharing because in the mass  Once the thing is known then that thing will be made, otherwise there will be loss, there is loss to the economy too, then this is the agenda of the government, if it is completed and sold, then it will not pay money from the pocket, ultimately it will also be given to NBCC. So you have to sell the flats, only then someone will buy the goods and only then the loop will be complete, so the whole game is over, at how much are you getting that shoe? I told you, brother, if you are getting that shoe at that much price and there is that much discount, then then.  It is worth it but if you are being given the thing at that price then you are getting the new thing at 10 15 20 per cost, everything is fresh, new, this old is like this at 85 per cost.  If it is worth buying at 85, if it is available at 50 then it is okay, 60 is also okay at 65, it starts becoming if and but and p * r * t up to 100 is equal to ama, people do not apply that formula at all.  Brother, I have to give something worth Rs. 00 today and something worth Rs. 10 has to be given in 3 years. Which one is cheaper and 120 will go to me by doing 40 40 40 and now my 100 is going here? Try it, put it in the collection and calculate it, you also know, just put it in and see, you will get to know on your own, people don't do that.  Only and this is the sixth class math which I am telling but people are not able to do this sixth class math, I am not showing it below but basically I am reminding them to do this math.  Then you will know which thing you should take and which you should not take. Thank you very much."

    "title": "An Affordable Housing Project In Sector 92 Which Will Do Well [MaCCC20fFHE].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today the position of Affordable Housing is being announced, it will come in five months by Diwali, the hope is looking very high, which I have come to cover for you guys, if you are in it, then please tell me its name is G RO Amaltas Sector 92, its position.  It is going to have three BHK and a one BHK tower. I will tell you the target price of both and I will tell you the rental of both. If it is yours, then clap it like this to make a video.  Otherwise, who talks about all the projects that have been sold and are about to be built? If no one does, then listen carefully and those who want to listen to the video for awareness, how far will affordable housing go, what will be the rates, what will happen and If you get a chance in between, then according to the rules you cannot sell the position for one year, but you have to keep it in the back of mind. Okay, so let's start. Its location is so wonderful, it is so wonderful, it is on 84 meter road.  This area of ​​DLF with 60 meter road, 12 meter 12 meter service lane is absolutely bang on and its fate is such that it has a touching mall and not just one but two, one is a Betak mall, another mall and two malls.  There are two malls here and this is our ROF. It is okay and there will be a 24 meter road behind it too, it is probably not built yet but the entry is bang on from 84 meter road and such a big meter road. Similarly, the premium kicks in at the entry and the entire area is a posh area, there are also low rises of DLF in front and here on this road, this is the area which is your general area. If I tell you, you will get a little further back. Signature 93 Ashiana at its distance These are our popular projects which you might have heard the names of, all of them are within the vicinity, RV Hospital is within the vicinity, DLF projects are within the vicinity, all of them are of DLF which are in the vicinity.  The floors were sold, builder floors were found, it is there, it looks absolutely wonderful while standing on the road, there is a working school opposite to it, there is a petrol pump, there is also a school, so the location is very good, those who are in it now, so pay attention.  Listen, there is one 1 BHK and one 3 BHK. The target of this BHK is November 25 because I feel that its position should be done by November. What is your information, if anyone is inside this project, your information is something else.  If yes, then please tell me that a gas pipeline is also being installed inside it. The gas pipeline which is yellow is also being installed. Okay, so write down the rate of the one BH which is inside it and take it now.  ₹ lakh of November 2025, whoever it is, it has to be sold for more than this, I am telling the minimum rate only, now people will not ask on what basis, the basis is very simple, it is fully furnished, fully furnished,  The rent for 161000 BHK will be fully furnished, which means you have included TV, fridge, AC, bed, cupboard and seating area in one BHK, sofa, sofa and other such items, which comes to one and a half to two lakh rupees, okay, it is easily available.  If you have invested that then you will get rent of Rs 16,1000 lakh on Rs 40 lakh, rental lead on Rs 5, this is also based on Rs 5, normally do you know how much is the rent?  The properties that are available are two and a half grand, hit the limit, if 1.25 more magic has happened, then it is fine on 4, so now you can say in this, when I have calculated on 5, then it can be, if 177000 is true then maybe.  It may not be 40 lakhs, 44 may go towards 45 or it is possible that if it is not 17 then the rent may become 15. It is also possible that the rent may go from 15 to 17.  And the price is between 38 to 44 lakhs depending on what kind of frills you have in it, this price point, it is only one tower, inside it there is only 1 BHK and it will do very well, so the people with one BHK will not have to sell it for the whole life because  Brother, nothing is going to come in 40 lakhs, nothing is going to come in India itself, it is going to come somewhere after one and a half years from today, so tell me, when you can't buy a property anywhere in 40 lakhs, somehow.  If you ca n't buy in some useless town in the city, then never sell it and go, this is also an advice and that rent will keep increasing gradually, put it in a mutual fund and make it a SIP, it will do a lot of good and talking about BHK.  Here you can buy a big BHK, you can buy a big three BHK here, 0 lakhs minimum, 85 to 90 lakhs minimum, I am not going to touch it in crores or above 400 lakhs.  I don't get the feeling that after crossing 400 I said that he went away. If I am not saying after crossing 400, then I am saying that I have stopped it at 8590 only. If you want to do its reverse engineering, then you should think that it is approximately 1100 square feet.  If there is something equivalent to super area, can a valuation of 8000 square feet be imposed in that area? I am calculating it according to the super area.  8 lakhs can be made into 8000 because things are easily being sold for Rs. 151000. The new launches coming at Rs. 15-1 are costlier than that, so I remove the premium of Rs. 50 from it because there is affordable housing in it.  There is no swimming pool, but the ticket size on pay per ticket has also reduced. Due to reduction in the ticket size of many things, the square feet rate increases. Do you know now when 2  If a thing of 3000 square feet is going up to Rs 171000-19000, then why not for such a small thing? You are understanding that formula and its rent will be minimum ₹ 25 to ₹ 77000 for fully furnished. I am not telling you today's price.  I am telling you, look at the position for almost a year, if OC Vasi comes in December, then to get the position, wood work will have to be done in the society.  It takes six months to furnish the position. Means rent for November will increase only in June because the position will be there. The builder will say come, then people will come. It is taken slowly. It also takes time to brighten up the society. These are the attractive rates.  These are not the first day rates, if you pay them on the first day, then it will be a little different. You know, there is a difference of Rs 5000 in rent between the rates of an empty society and the rates of a filled society. 000, if I take its value as 25 to 27, then it is now at 35. I did the reverse calculation of rental values ​​and I put the price at 8588 lakhs because only the rent decides the valuation of the property in the long term. When things are ready, then  If you have taken it here, then what do you have to do? You have to enjoy it, you have to offer it only after fully furnishing it, its appreciation has become so much. People are so skimpy on furnishing when the rent will come from them only. Sometimes I teach these things in my real estate mentoring course. If you want to join it then you can contact me. The course is on, you will also get recording of all those things.  So in that too, I have lost all my weight because I am going to get a position soon, all the structure is there, all the people of you who are here, please write in the comment section so that I can like that the athlete has come.  Could reach out to ROF Amaltas people are fine and no one told them too otherwise many people don't know how much it is, don't be in a hurry to sell it, you will get a lot of calls to sell, I am telling you to sell, sell, sell, sell.  There is no need to sell, nothing can be bought for lakhs, nothing can be bought in Gurgaon, even today it can be bought for crores, so why do you have to sell something worth lakhs, eat the rent for it, eat the rent for the rest of your life, thank you very much.  mech"

    "title": "An Affordable Housing Project On Dwarka Expressway Which Will Touch 75 Lakhs Plus [XF7al4CdYH8].en",
    "content": "One second Hello friends, today we will discuss about an affordable housing near Dwarka Expressway which will cost 75 to 80 lakhs. Which affordable housing is this? This is Ji Om Parna Apartment Sector 112. If you have bought it then do let us know for other wise information.  This is for all the remaining subscribers because what is affordable housing has been sold and no one is discussing now the affordable housing positions that are going to come near.  In 67 months in the future, in three to six months, I will launch a small series on them. You watch this video till the end so that you can get the correct perspective. This five was launched a year ago and in between, the time of Corona also came for this affordable housing.  Inside are of BH and there are four towers, normally there are eight, there are four of them, there is an open area of ​​2 acres inside it and it is in the best location of sector 112. According to me, it is being built by Mavan Construction.  The position should come in 6 months, by December. If you as a subscriber have better information than this, then please write in the comment section. Firstly, who holds the flats in it, whose flats they belong to, please do tell that yes, it is ours, it is what is in it.  The bigger one is of 2 BH and its price is Rs. 605 or a few square feet. We cannot sell it for a year after the position is in place, so there is no need to tell its price in January, let's say if the position is in December.  There is no price in January because it cannot be sold. According to the rules, you can sell the position only after 1 year, so its December 25. Suppose if the position is in December 24, then the target of December 25 is 85 lakhs for a big 2 BHK and  The smaller one which will be of 2 BH which is around 570 square feet, you can set a target for it which will be around 76 to 77 lakhs, it will be around 75 to 75 lakhs.  You take a figure between 80 and the figure of the older one. You take the figure of the one who is between 85 and 90. How much will be the rental? The rental will be fully furnished. The older one has invested ₹ 2500000 and a bare minimum sofa etc. which they do and  If you have set the cupboard etc. then it has almost come out as a four bagger for those who took it in because at that time  Well, you know that affordable housing used to be built at 4000 feet, now the government has rated it at 5000 feet, so the four bagger returns in six years teach us that if we had not sold the property in between, where would have been the hit. Many people will say to me, no, no, 85 lakhs is too much, listen, there is carpet of 600 square feet and if we add the balcony, then  If it becomes a 1000 sq ft super area equivalent apartment then I am quoting only 8500. Do n't be like that and I am not quoting today's price, I am not quoting December 24th, I am quoting 25th December, I am quoting only 8500. Luxury there is now 20000.  If it is a luxury then it is being sold at such a high price of Rs 20000, 21000, 22000. Brother, why won't it be sold for Rs. 830? It doesn't have a swimming pool and a car parking. Car parking is separate and builder allowed. The government's scheme for selling it will be available because it has a separate land of two acres.  If it is coming out, then whoever has taken part in it, how is the performance of each builder, then I will tell on this that there are builders of A, B and C grade in affordable housing.  So it absolutely means that you should not buy their product, if you are famous and etc. in A grade then I will put it in B grade that yes, it makes it, it makes it well, okay, there are many builders like this.  Whatever you make on time, location is good and hold on to all such videos and updates to you, which other societies of yours are coming and are going to be formed as per my knowledge, what am I starting to make in the series?  these are not to be sold What are you talking about friend? Bought it for 23-24 lakhs. Bought it for 25 lakhs. 24 Lakhs for 25. This much has become three and a half to four times. So why not sell, because after selling for Rs 85, nothing will come after one and a half year.  You will not leave this city in Gurgaon, but still brother, we have made a profit of 60 65 lakhs. Yes, even 60 65 lakhs will not bring anything.  Inflation is the only thing in life, do n't be so happy, treat it as a cash cow, live a long life, live a mini pension, you will see it crossing two crores, you will also see it becoming 1.25 crores, now I am not giving such further targets which are clearly visible in the target.  He is giving further, I am not giving when, I am not telling so many stories about whom, but here Dwarka Expressway has already been built, service lanes will also be built, a 24 meter road has to be built.  It is okay from here, there is a separate launch of an MR next to it. It is okay inside the same area, SO plots of end commercial are to come. Those sectors which are 114 115 will become institutional like sectors 29 and 44, then those stories will be played out.  It will take 5 to 7 more years but given the targets given here, it will be a mature location. Bang on Dwarka Expressway. You can call it Dwarka Expressway.  It is just two-three minutes away from Dwarka Expressway. It can be called Dwarka Expressway. There is no residential area directly above the flyover of this expressway. It is a little far away, so it is near Delhi border, so technically it is zero kilometers from here.  There is a hold on this from the project because whatever execution risk there is, how much time will it take to get it built, it is for you to see and from this we have to learn that where we are not able to sell the property and we have to  You have to keep it, the real benefit lies there, so if you have kept it here, then please write in the comment section and share. Those who have kept it here, if you have any group, then share beyond that, many of my words will be accepted.  It's like I said if you don't resell then it is not getting reselled, I had recently made a video, if anyone wants to resell then tell me, my video gets a lot of views, 10 15 20 thousand views.  We easily reach 50,000 subscribers. Thank you very much. Even if you did it, no one came much. If two or three small quantities came, people are following the advice that there is no market for resale. This is not the time to sell.  What is left is that my video will come that what is the condition of the market now but which is so executed because in future brothers and sisters it will be difficult to make environmental ban NGT's ban.  Sometimes of water, sometimes of pollution, sometimes of any other problem, it is not easy to build a house, there is a problem of labor, there will be wage inflation, limited bars, it will be expensive, take it wherever it is built, in the future, such an environment will not be built by builders, it is not easy, there is no land.  The land to be acquired was not given, land was not used, then license problem, then that clearance, then make it, then ban, then no money, then not this now brother, there was execution risk, here there is one execution in every project.  There is a risk, you know that it will not be made, it will not be made, it will not be made, then the risk has almost been mitigated, if you have to come to the position within six months, then after a year you can technically sell it, but you will not get anything by selling it.  I am telling you that you will keep it for life long, invest that money in mutual fund because I am Shio, if someone has borrowed even Rs. ₹ lakh and has also taken a loan then the limit is Rs 20 lakh.  You must have taken a loan of Rs. 20 lakhs and if 18000 EE is released then the rent here is more than that. If it is a cash flow positive property then please do so. It proved to be a multi bagger for you. Many congratulations to all those who visited here and remember these rates.  Keep it because after 6 months, it is possible that not everyone watches this video. Even the people who have rented here may not watch it. It is possible that they may be ready to sell you a small apartment for Rs. 65 lakhs. Then take it.  If someone is ready to sell, however, it will not happen because you cannot sell it for a year and this video has been made for a year and many more will be made in the future also because I will make you aware, it may not be till the time this video is made.  If the position is after a month, I too have got lakhs of subscribers and the reach has increased. Okay, so I guide people from both the sides. Those who have bought, they also get guidance. Those who have bought, they get very good returns and  The funny thing is that  It was available from a draw plot, its three draws were broken, people threw tantrums because there was a high tension cable in one or two acres of it, oh this is not good, that high tension cable which should be as far as it should be as per the law.  It is that far away and beyond that where the rates have increased so much, it has come out in a draw, the first draw took place, many people surrendered, many people and I am not feeling good, my floor is not good, has my floor become the top floor or is this?  It's time people started doing seconds like this too  Even in the first draw, people have got the ticket here. Even in the third draw, people have got the ticket here. That is also one thing that many people will be regretting now, but there is very good news for those people who got the ticket.  Please spread this news, thank you very much"

    "title": "An Idea which Can Reduce Speculation In Real Estate [XjXl-G6H0MI].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today I want to share an idea, if it is implemented, then wherever it goes into speculative, then I would like to give two-three suggestions, please tell me what kind of suggestion it is so that the prices can be controlled because the prices are increasing on one page.  It is healthy for the market, so I am telling that idea, it is the election season, you can create a stir, there are elections in the future also, it can be Gurgaon specific or any other state.  Wherever the specific is, let's start first of all, you book the under construction property, if there is a new launch, what happens when the new launch is booked, you have to pay Rs. 20 in two-three months, then you have to pay that in 6 months and like that.  There is a construction link payment plan and the position is 4 to 6. In the next 6 years, many investors come to play the game that they will take the exit, so many will take the exit and this is what is called speculative.  The agreement should be made at the same time, the property should be registered at the same time and the property should be taken from you at Rs. 85. The government has the advantage because it got the money first. Now since your registration money has become so big, now that speculating is happening there, hence the money is there.  Market you will see that the prices are very realistic because the rental is very high there and this is the thing we want, I want maybe you people also want that the prices should not go up like this, it is a lot of trouble, it happens many times.  Now look at the investment overall, pick any city of your choice, the top city, the slowest moving city which people thought was there and which is not and I will bring products from there too for you people on Kolkata, if you look at its last 10 years.  Will extract the data, it has performed very well, Kolkata and Hyderabad have performed, what happens to them, some don't work for two-three years, then they rocket, then stagnate or the prices go out of hand, then  That of resale remains on that also on resale. If you want video then I am talking about what is going wrong in Gurgaon market. In a way, it is not a good situation for everyone. If you want video then Gurgaon Resale you can comment section.  The second thing I want to write in is that it is very important for the builders themselves that you should not make any bonfire until the structure is ready.  Do not make a bonfire until the structure is ready because many builders make a bonfire out of compulsion that once the goods are sold, if you have gathered many investors and everyone wants to exit and then if they do not have the money and if most of the  Although the builders have done the checkup because OI is taken very much, people have also checked the profile and entered it, so there are listed players, there are big players like your DLF is done, signature is done, some They had done it when they were launched, those people, the level of UI itself has become so high that serious people will come, that is a filter, but I am saying that a filter will have to be put in the market now, what will happen to your sales.  The velocity will definitely reduce, I agree that it will definitely reduce, but I want to tell the builders, brother, why are you in a hurry? Are you in a hurry that the project will be built in 6 years? People, this cannot be done before 6 years.  4 years tell stories of 4 years, no construction can be done in 4 years, NGT ban is imposed for three months, it rains for two months, construction does not happen in November, December and January, so when the window of construction is only seven-eight months, then at least 6 years.  It is possible that two towers can be built in four years, but the entire project is yet to be completed. There was no one in Gurgaon who could build it faster than Shahpur ji Palau ji. The project was released in January 2019.  It is March 2024, it is still being built, it will still take one and a half or two years, the fastest Pandha of India is taking 6 years, you check how many years it has taken for Godrej Meridian to be built, Shobha is 108 years old.  How much time has it taken, I can tell you more like this. To be completely complete means all the towers have been handed over and all the builder's goods have been sold and everybody has to take out all the goods, then it is like Shobha's if I  Talking about it, I feel like the builder's management must be thinking that we have spent Rs. 000, it would have been resale in less than a year, it would have been Rs. 21, so brother, they should have kept a little, they should have kept a little, they should have thought about it, no one had told me now.  The rest of the projects in 106, like announcements etc., they are running wisely and I feel that it is easy to ripen, it is sweet, it is easy to sell, it is easy to sell to investors, not too much, not too much.  It should be attractive and speculative, it should be such that one can keep and keep and keep and keep, it is a timeless property, some of them are new coming after doing FR, so the builder should also be charged first by the government, once your registration is done then at 85.  But sorry, 7% of the money is gone, then you become calm, then what else is there, then you have to pay money to the builder because he wants to sell it to people at that time, so this is the registry.  Can another builder put this one, then we will be successful and the price will remain realistic, otherwise this time it will cross 20000, 21000, 22, now brother, at 23, at 24, we will keep hearing this and this will take us to some level now there.  There are people like me and there must be many of you who are already invested, if not till this far, then till this point then many people are invested, okay now more  If you can't do it, then in a way it is very good for us that if we reach the moon and get the rate of 0000 feet, it sounds good but it is not good for the market and the thing which is not good for the market is the one who  I have invested money, it will not be good for that also, I also want a common man to buy a mango in Gurgaon real estate, what can I say, mangoes are not able to buy at all, but there are some special people, at least special people should buy, why Gurgaon?  real estate of  So it is going on in such a way that even a special person will not be able to buy it. Don't know which one will have to be brought from where. To invest here, you spread this thing a little and take it towards the government. The government is also watching. The government has done something.  Things like telling about Gurgaon real estate which probably should not have happened and a separate video will have to be made on it during the elections. Still on Plus 4, if you want, then write in the comment section, that's it.  Also has been responsible for quite an extent because of supply constraints which have been cost other wise if such run up does not happen so quickly then that is also one thing that brother you try to do something about that too and I will tell people now if  You want to invest in real estate, which if you have not done and you have money, then you have to do it. So brother, any amount from 50 lakh to 90 95 lakh.  Property 3 to 4 years payment plan in a big city is a good buy just because you are in a city Speculative city where rates are very high If you are not getting anything below 2-3-4 crores then there may be a time to look  Left and Right, this cannot happen in our own country that the rate of gold is increasing but you have to buy it only for 10 tola. Brother, if you don't have the option of 10 tola, then take it for five, two tola or three tola.  If gold is not bought then it means that if gold is not bought, then gold is going to increase. If you do not want to own an asset class, then there are no ETFs or CTFs. There is no gold bundle like this. In real estate, you don't want to buy reets or you are stuck inside the commercial. I have to make a video on that reets also, you tell me, it's okay, then you have to get into this because you Income tax rebate, interest rates will reduce in future, real estate is running up, maybe some announcements like this will come after the elections, this is a time that you have to be, yes, you will have to take a plane and go there.  You will have to take some trouble to get the Bar Builder Buyer Agreement done, but you cannot earn money without any trouble. You work from morning to evening, you work for 30 days, then you get paid, you work for the whole year. If you get 510 days leave, then you earn money, then what will happen that you have to become a laat saab in real estate investment, where will I go on my own, why won't you go brother, which country has such a place than Delhi, if you live in North India? Maybe we can't reach in two and a half hours, left in two and a half hours, came in two and a half hours, stayed for one night, got our photos taken, got our work done, toured the city, saw places, took photos, stayed for one more day There Now, who will invest like this in India, it is a relative off because when you can do a job somewhere, you can also buy a property somewhere, otherwise who will take care of it? Who will take care of it? Agencies are coming in.  There are many builders, there are listed builders, they have to open their verticals, they will work as property dealers there, they will take rent for 15 days, just like the world takes and will give and take your fares and they will have a department there, so don't miss out. Understand that we will have to follow this thing and if both these things are done then I feel that there will be some control on the prices, otherwise if it runs up too quickly then it will be stagnant for two to three years.  We will see when I tell you the time correction, you will get to see it. Thank you very much."

    "title": "An Update On REITs [BtnRqXnNPAA].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, I want to give an information on Reits, people invest in Reits, Real Estate Investment Trust, I am not making any positive or negative comments about it. These videos are based on a news item which judge is one of the Reits Embassy Group.  What remains is that there are some stakeholders who are mutual funds, two-three of them have raised the objection that it may raise some thousand crores of its own Rs. 3000 crores. These people have been thinking that 'to buy their own' means something, property, so now they are feeling that they are the owners of mutual funds because we can also be owners, you can also be theirs and that is the rule of voting rights, this rule is  It happens that if anything has to be done or money has to be raised, then if 100 people are opposing it, then 150 people are needed to support it. For this thing to go, this is the rule that  Meaning, if one person is voting against it, then one and a half people are needed to vote for him. The government has made very good rules and safety mechanism, but people should know that yes brother, this can also happen, but it is not like this.  That is, in Real Estate Investment Trust, what he is doing is that he is raising money and buying some other things of his own and then how much he will withdraw, you research on this, I have seen many times what happens through my video medium.  Now I am not able to make videos like Dhruv Rathi that from here Shi Shik Shik is a team of 10 people, I am not able to do that work but I still want to make the public aware that there is something like this, study beyond this, write in the comment section crowd.  Let the source of funding be that yes, we also read this, brother, it can happen like this, it can also happen because the reason I am telling you is that now you will get a lot of REITs in the next one, two, three years because a new thing has come out, now 50  Ten million  You can make even up to Rs 500 crore from Rs. 500 crores, you can also make residential ones, so you should know who is managing, what is being done, what is being spent on money, how is he making money. I have always seen practically that in my family.  It is better if you type Reed, take property with your parents or father-in-law or brother-sister, this will also be a Reet, okay, in a small town such a big thing worth 60-70 lakhs is coming 20 20  After spending lakhs, the money was gone in one and a half years, everyone put it in the name of three people, what is the problem, formed your own company, what do you do, you buy real estate, everyone put the money in it, partnership.  You can also sell that partnership, check it, do due diligence, ask a chartered accountant, someone from corporate affairs, although this chartered accountant will not tell you whether it is possible or not.  There is a company, you can transfer your share here and there, you father gives it to me at Rs. 4, now what does that company do, it holds four properties worth Rs. 10 crores, different types of Bhati Mati, so you always do exit entry on valuations.  If you can give it to yourself, then check it. This is all intelligence. Real estate is something which needs to be learned, what can be done in it. It is beyond this and this project. This is the layout that is coming, this is how we will give this much discount, this is how we will do this, this is not a payment plan, no, this is a very, very small level thing, I teach you big level things, if you want to learn, then in the comment section you can find a real estate webinar group.  You will get it, please click on it and you can join it. If you are not already connected with me, then whenever such webinars happen, you can join them. Thank you very much."

    "title": "At Last Report On Commercial Real Estate Has Come ｜ What Is In Store ？ [5W_GdqCKf0w].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, at last a report came, finally, I was working hard for 2 years, I was telling people, I got trolled a lot, you people who are following me would also know that I was against commercial, I used to say that there is nothing commercial.  Taking nowhere, taking Daily NCR, Knight Frank's report has recently come and given some figures of 59, which means malls are empty, many things are empty, don't get trapped in commercials, many people get trapped, especially inheritance. Money is earned, isn't it money? Can't money be earned in commercial? Yes, it can be earned but it is like playing future and options in the stock market. The game that a common man plays in future and options in the market is brother's money. Do some traders, do some smart people, do some people earn one and a half or two percent? Yes, they earn, but many people say that I earn, I will teach you how to earn.  By saying that they are earning more money, they make 50 trades in futures and options and out of them, 5, 10, 15 get hit, they give screenshots of them, they create a telegram group, this is a different game, the stock market is going on.  At the end of it you become like wow wow wow wow and keep playing that, money is being lost in it overall but money is being taken for sharing knowledge to new people, play all those games with that money for how long?  Keep playing, then other people will come, if I am in a commercial, suppose I have bought 10 commercials in my life, out of which four of mine have been beaten, three or four are doing average and three or two will be hits, I will come and show only those who will be hits. Look, brothers and sisters, I took this here in 1998. I took this in old times, but it still worked because it was commercial. Today's advice is that it is grossly over supplied. People's taste is not known.  I do n't know about technology, I will get something like J's etc. These days, I have netfx3 through mobile, so I wandered around in the shops, if I was in a mood, I bought something, but people were seen roaming around in other places, most of the malls except one half mall.  Like CBSE Mall, the mall which is always well run will not be sold by the builder, like Emmons Mall is fine and the rest of the brothers are selling it, they have no interest in it, don't buy this, the mall is not a commercial space, no, we will benefit from it. Had taken it in 2004, had taken it at 10, had taken it at 12, must have been beneficial, today I am giving advice for 2024, the landscape is very changing, earlier boys and girls used to go to Coffee Day, used to go to Pizza Hut, used to meet at Loveratri, youngsters are not going.  The old people are not able to go and those in the middle don't have time for life, raise children, do a job, have trouble, sleep and then go, who has time to go commercial? Look at the banks you own. When did you go inside the banks? When did my subscribers last go? There is an elderly section of people who go to get their passbooks updated. Are there any FDs in government banks? Do they go to see their FDs again and again? Other wise, when this  Generation In 5 10 years, when it will not be able to exist or will it exist? The requirement of banks is physical. Today banks are hiring more engineers to manage their back end and server space and technology thing.  Then the front, Kotak was banned because their technology part was not doing well. You must have heard in the news etc. that the bank is becoming very technical oriented. If the bank is available in your mobile, then what do you have to do after going to the bank and ATM?  These days, UPI transactions will become so much that the requirement of ATM will become so low. In my opinion, no bank is increasing the number of ATMs, they are only decreasing, so this is the minimum requirement of the banks.  It is a requirement because what happens is, why am I banking again and again? What happens to the bank is that the bank comes to one place and then all the other things start coming. Okay, because the bank has come there, these things will also be seen reducing in the bank.  The branches that are there will become smaller because less employees will be required and less people will come. You see this in the bank, if suppose Haj people are coming or 100 are coming or only 10 are coming, will make a  What should be the size of difference on key? So I can manage even from a small branch. I am a bank manager, there is a teller, there is a security guard, there are two-three people and one or two of them are on leave, that means I am with seven people.  I will run the branch. Out of them, two people are always on sales, have gone on leave, have gone to open D-mats, are roaming outside, wearing a tie, keep saying, because at any time, not more than five or ten people will come to me. climb up  No, why do I need to keep so much, so I took the example of just one bank. In other things too, people go and try the shoe, look at it, note down the number, come and order it at home, savings of Rs 500000.  Then the matter is becoming very tight because if that much of his goods are not being sold then he will not pay more rent. If he does not pay more rent then the prices will not increase because everything is related to the rent and what happens is there is no  Also, if there is a new office space or commercial or anything new, then what is there in it, it says 1 lakh family staying around, people get very impressed after hearing the story of 1 lakh, then the next launch is also happening there, its also the same.  There are 1 lakh families, now how many of those 1 lakh families will go to them and how much time do the families have, so whenever a commercial comes, be happy that there is someone who is investing so much in something, at least for us.  You will have fun and don't go and buy it. Go there, enjoy, eat, drink, enjoy, do all the work, but there you don't buy, don't buy land, don't buy space. Many people say, Guruji, no, I have to do my work, so I have to buy.  Hey, their advice is also to be asset light because if you want to start your own business, then what place will you buy first because it is possible that your business may not start there but it will do well somewhere else. Where will you buy it when you become mature because what is it with people, this one stool moves, then another one comes, then attention is diverted from that one, we go to that one, we start liking one space better, then we go to another one, people When people are getting a lot of choices, brothers and sisters, then the risk ratio increases and then the matter of timing comes into play because people also enter into the matter of color of the money left and right. What happens in the cycle is that you bought something, then it started working, it got set, then you sold it, but at some point of time, someone or the other gets trapped in it. Now, most of the people I have seen trapped in commercials are those who are called inheritance. Money is roaming around in the lake which has not been earned. No one is investing self-earned money in commercial, it is being invested in residential but you have bought some asset and got a lot of profit in it. You had bought a shop somewhere.  For how much was it sold, then your experience of the shop was very good, then you say that you can buy a house from the shop, you have made up some proverbs, all the proverbs have an expiry date, they are not valid for all the times, it will start in 2025 next.  If 24 years are going on then be very careful do not invest in any kind of commercial and if the need comes to do so then there are rules of commercial which are made in the office.  They are running spaces which are at a very good level and there is rental income and there is no construction risk, there is no execution risk because they can put 90% of their construction space which has been constructed and the position has been done there and they can give you more rent than that.  Even if they give it at Rs 90, then see why don't I buy stake in 25 different projects in five cities instead of taking one commercial, through rights that is better if  I have to play commercial only. In the coming time, soon after the elections, the policy has already been made. Reits worth Rs 50 crore to Rs 500 crore are coming in the residential sector, so they will also do well. Rental price will be like dividend at Rs 45. And apart from that there will also be capital appreciation and you will get that 100% food, clothing and housing items. The number of commercial comes very late because how people  I buy it in case I need more warehouse space because I need something in my home. Within Gurgaon, if I think of something in my mind that I need, then it comes to my home in 15 to 20 minutes, within 25 minutes.  She goes to the shop, why should I go to the shop, does anyone need things like pencil eraser, they also come so quickly, brother, yes, they will be kept, I don't know, it is kept in someone's basement, it is coming from somewhere else, where is it coming from the shop to me?  What to do, these are mom and pop stores, they will also struggle in the physical space in the coming time. There is one thing in big cities, this can be completely avoided. Those who have bought off-course will feel very bad, what are you spreading? Our rates are there and it will bring everything down, but this is what people have said about the plots, I will not be surprised by one thing, it has already been done in many places in Gurgaon, the square feet on residential is coster than commercial.  It may sound very strange but it has happened in many places, it has happened in many places and you will see in the future and I am predicting that in the coming time, you will see many of the commercial spaces that have been razed getting converted into residential, but it will be a big surprise to hear this. You see, a stage will come when all that will be broken and something like this will be formed, the government has to change the land use, has to take money, that will happen, you will see wasteful lunches everywhere.  This could be possible if the people there come together and decide because it is not working, especially if they are doing it, especially when you look at the area, these SCO plots are lying scattered at so many places, I don't think they are going anywhere.  They are in Gurgaon because there is no space for car parking. Till date, no one has calculated that all the plots for cars parked here have been cut. Who will allow you to park your car on Dwarka Expressway? When the shopping experience is not the same, yours is good.  Hey brother, if you are making an office there, are making a shop or are doing something, then you definitely need a place to park the vehicles. How many builders have made it, how many have been made, check it whenever all the works are done, then you will know the rate. I believe it is two and a half.  It was Rs 3 lakh and it has increased by Rs 4.5 lakh 5 lakh. I am not denying that the rates have not increased. In India, rates also increase for garbage, even for scrap. There is no issue of rates in India.  No, the question is whether I will buy that thing after doing due diligence, then yes, commercial people will take exposure in it, they can play the game of 5, 10, 20 crores, but the one who is getting the money in inheritance and directly invests it in the child that I will get %.  If it goes away then your basic income will also be reduced. I am trying to tell you that be very pragmatic. Now that the report has come, please read the report as well. Thank you very much."

    "title": "Breaking News On Stilt Plus 4 ｜ Effect On Gurgaon Real Estate [YNNH37A71zo].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, I want to tell you about Stilt Plus 4. Press note which has been issued, construction of Stilt Plus four floors will be allowed in residential plots located in colonia sectors whose layout plan is approved with four residential units per plot. Read in Hindi  I am feeling scared, so I read the lines and then I will try to explain. Second A +. Permission for construction of 4 floors will also be given in already licensed DDJ colony if there are four residents per plot.  If the service plan for the works is approved, then it is modified, that is, see it thickly, and the third line ahead is of 10 meter road, so understand in short and crisp, whatever DDJY plots were there, where the matter was initially of four floors.  There will be four floors continuously. Brothers and sisters, the criteria of 10 meter road has become because why did people use the criterion of 10 meter road because in Hooda and all these colonies there are mostly 9 meter roads, so nine  More than 10 meters of road has been covered, after that she goes to PDR and gets more confused. If the matter is fine then thick soil, we will see about it. Thick soil, thick soil should be more than 10 meters of road. One thing should come out in front of your house.  It is fine now, and wherever Deendayal was, what will be the ripper cushion beyond that? The supply in the market is still not increasing much. The supply in the market is still not increasing much and this is my decision which  Just now I am getting to know about the rough meaning, it is quite fair and seems fine to me, the rates of Deendayal will increase, it is okay for the plots because now the stamp has been put on it that brother, when it was launched, there were four, those who were heard, there were four.  You can make it because it was initially modified in the map and you must have put the services in that way, then today the rates of plots in Godre Sonipat have increased from Rs 5 to Rs 7000 due to this decision. If you have made it then it is very good, I said that because  I immediately remembered that, it is okay, Godrej of Kurukshetra, yours have increased, your Deendayal's Jha case is also here, okay, there is a plot in front of AIIMS, brother, that too has increased by Rs 5,000, okay, and who is sitting with a plot somewhere in his gold.  Those plots have also increased and the ones which are on 12 meter roads because roads are not 10 meter roads, my house is 9 meters and then it is 12 meters, so these are the 12 meter plots where they are built. Where it will be allowed, these can also be increased, the rest will be discussed as the details come, beyond that, analysis will be done as to how much supply is there, but it is a fact that the decision has come today and even tomorrow if we start building houses in these Brothers and sisters, no one is coming to the inventory market before two to two and a half years because it is raining now, then there will be pollution on Diwali, laborers will go away on Chhath Puja.  Those gram norms will remain for two-three months, anyway till February nothing is happening, so now people will see and understand the decision, rough initial trends will come, deals of plots will be seen in a month, some trend will be seen, right now we can only speculate.  This will happen here, that will happen, it will happen like this, you can guess, I have set some rates somewhere, my job is to increase the rates, remember, many people get irritated with me because of this, I am Rakesh.  Jhunjhunwala ji's model is the same for me, I am bullish, I have to increase the rate, you have taken it, it is very good, you want to take it, it is very good, I do not do any reducing work, I will definitely put reducing pressure, I can also speak against the builder and against the system. I can speak and show general displeasure, but the point is that we have to cross the limits, we have to increase the rate gradually, okay, it is clear to me, be it from Gurgaon or Haryana, whatever it may be, because this  Asset, some day I will also teach economics, normally I teach on Clarity for Youth, but now the rest of us do not teach economics much, they all talk like this about real estate, so I will teach what I want with some flavor of webinar.  I will give you people that why I am like this and why I am telling all others, there is a solid economic reasoning behind it. If you want that video then economic reasoning is there.  Write to ER and tell me, this is good news for many people who are sitting on 9 meters, there will be no noise next to their houses, no construction will be done on 9 meter road, so people can sit peacefully because many people  There were also people against it, so I think that the government has done a good job, it has not caused much harm to anyone and it means the public, because the public had a divided opinion on this, when the voting took place that someone was saying one thing and someone else was saying something else.  Saying  So I feel that all the stakeholders should be satisfied. According to me, is there any resentment or is there something else or you have a different understanding. Look, I am refreshed now, the mobile page is so small that even in reading, the meaning is the same, isn't it?  That you should write such good Hindi in Hindi or if you had written English it would have been even better and that would have been done but right now the trend is to understand something better. If you have understood something better then write it in the comment section then it is good news.  Atlist was a hangover, it is done, it has come, it is very good for real estate so that means otherwise the sword was hanging, what to do, what to do, now some economic activity will increase Rohtak Jind Hisar Fatehabad Sirsa, now there will be some activity, these children  There too they make and sell floor balls, if there is some system then there is some economic activity, the kiln was sitting at a standstill, the matter was kept then there is some economic activity.  Plot plot will increase, someone will sell, someone will buy, there will be some activity, it is good, it is good for the economy, it is good for the economy of Haryana, it is good for the GDP of Haryana, and no one else, the decision has been taken in the run up to the elections, otherwise this decision is such a rocket.  There was no science and it took one and a half year, this decision could have been taken a year earlier also, I am telling this, only Khattar ji could have taken it, it is not that Naib Saini ji had to wait and  Finally, if the credit for this is going to any politician, then in the meeting that was held, it is the MP of his Faridabad, Gurjar ji who raised that brother, do this, it is good that some leader is connected to the land because this problem is in Gurgaon Faridabad.  There are more off-courses in it, so thanks to him too that whatever meeting of BJP was related to politics, he said, brother, he raised this issue and it is a good thing that  We should also raise the issues in such a way that any grassroots leader would listen to them and go to a meeting and tell them and the decision would be taken within a week. Then in the same meeting, Naib Singh Saini Sahib said that yes, we will do so within a week.  We will do it no problem and if it is done in a week then it is a good thing, but why do we have to wait for elections? Cleaning Gurgaon by imposing Disaster Management Act first created a disaster.  10 years later, now you are doing it under the management act, now you don't understand, praise or criticize, but keep saying, whoever is doing good work, my job is not to spread positivity, brother is giving, get well, you are doing good, do anything good.  You are clapping it, no problem, okay, you will do good work now, that is from Bandhwa, we will do it to NTPC, we will do it, we will do all the songs of the wedding, Sache na hua karte, hume haryana mein bera hai, woh bayah ho jaa  And true songs came out - We will wait but if you want to do it, then brother, you could have done it six months or a year ago, but now what do you do before the elections, if you had done it, then we would have given you this one, which is this one, which is now, this one then.  By giving it, now what is the matter in the air, but come on, still the matter of plus four will be confirmed here and clarity has come on this. Those who want to loot the plot, take it. Big meter roads are seen increasing.  are from 10 At Rs 15, because you can make an extra floor, it will not increase till Rs 33, everyone takes some margin, but at Rs 10 to Rs 15, it is certain that the rate will increase across Haryana. Whatever rate was there today, it will be Rs 10 to Rs 15 in the next 10 to 15 days.  If it increases, then whoever wants to take his plot by jumping, has to do it with great effort, till the time this word spreads, if you understand it enough, then do it as your own and whatever you were sitting with.  Brother, then you know, at 15, I told you, Guruji from Gurugram, at 15, if your yard was worth lakhs of rupees in some city, then it has become 000 yards, okay if you have seen this video, it is okay if yours is 12 meters above the road.  And for those who were sitting with Deendayal, clapping is a good thing because you already had it. Like the channel and subscribe.

    "title": "Car Parking Issue In Affordable Housing Gurgaon Discussed [PyqUEwdtTlw].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, this is a very important topic, there are many questions on it, tax on parking in affordable housing, if you want to know about this then please watch the video carefully, there are some awkward videos like this, it will not make any sense for me too, write this note right here.  Still, to give a little hint to the public to understand, I want to tell you some things and in the middle of this video, I want you to reach out to the government employees, official scenery officers and also politicians.  I want to reach out to those who know and recognize all these things. It is not that my reaching out has not made an impact. Those who have been following me for two and a half years, videos have been made earlier also, you know they have made a difference.  It was read positively and the advisor was taken and those who have been following for two and a half years know this but this video will also make a difference, your sharing will make more difference with the people now, listen and talk as per the parking of affordable housing, let's talk to the government. According to Bhai, it is worth 1.25 lakh rupees, but for how much, you all also know, Bhai Sahib, someone can buy a lesson for three lakhs, three lakhs and a half lakhs, like a dark account, everyone knows, now if you ask Guruji, Guruji.  It's like asking, Guruji, if I go to get a slip in the exam, what will a person say if I cheat? You should not do that. Then everyone takes a slip in the exam and everyone cheats. Nothing happens to anyone.  And after that, the person who gave the advice that do not take the slip, eats the code and if someone gives the advice that yes, take everything, the world is a caste, the world is a caste, the world is doing something wrong with you, then he takes it out.  Lal ji gives me who is the promoter, he says brother, I will send it for 3 lakhs, whatever is the rate, I will tell you what is wrong and I am neither from the government nor from the general public, I am from the builder's side, I am an independent person.  thinking I am telling the analysts what is wrong with it, what is wrong with it, the parking rate of Rs. 1 lakh, which is the travel rate, is a wrong rate, it has been set wrong, these poor people are taking the parking tax, oh brother, tell me, this flat is less.  It is cheap, you are paying Rs 25 lakhs, you are paying tax of Rs 26 lakhs for parking, the land is being occupied by that much, they are opening the parking too, so the land is taking the same tax, the power society is also charging the same amount and so on. in this one too  If you are charging that much, then you question that the rate itself is wrong and I am going to give a logical suggestion, as much as anyone agrees, tell me this question, your rate should be increased to a realistic rate of Rs 3 lakh so that these 3:  30 3:45 4:30 Whatever scan type is going on till five, it should be banded and it should be attacked with drop lot, at this time, parking brother, you spend your edition money.  Pay extra as per 10% tax on parking and you will be alerted there about the tax on parking. This will not be a private limited because I feel that the question is that it is your official thing, it is running in black or there is no figure of it. Can do anything and then I am most interested in this brother, the story is not like that in a parking lot, two people, three people are killed in the middle, is anyone checking its accounts, whether and when will its rules be saved, then someone should check to find out the rules.  Government Look into tax parking and tax parking, it is a good thing, no one is following the advice, if you get tax parking, then now I will do some calculations and tell you after doing some calculations, you have bought tax for 3 lakhs.  If we buy parking or tax, then we go with two figures because there is a game going on between three and tax in the market. If I bought Rs 3 lakh and taxed it, then after 4 years and 5 years, after buying the parking, my position will be reduced.  ₹ 2000 rent came extra because of the man's ability to bear the tax, so if I can pay 24000 rupees from 3 lakhs then it is 8% on my investment and if I bought even after tax and only 2 thousand came, I am running on it. Please note that this is ₹  After 4 years in 2000, I am saying to people, don't look at it as per today's value, even after 4 years, the value of 2000 is still less, you know due to inflation. 6  If it is 60% then if you hit within that then the value of today's Rs 2000 will be equal to today's Rs 1314. After 4 years it is ok then it is an investment opportunity. If I do it in 3 to 4 years then I will take 6 to 8%, then it will be calculated according to mathematics.  If you look at it logically then it is fine but according to the rules and regulations what works is that you should not be cheated, you should not get messed up, you should not be made a fool of that paper.  This is not right, what is the thing you are writing on and giving it to you, what is its meaning, what are its rules, here is the gray area, this is the gray area here, my mother, my request to the government is to please make a realistic figure because when you ask a question, your figure will be made.  Brother, that is not realistic, see how many people will be like this, no no, give a free card of Rs 25000 and you are with their builder, listen brother, when you question your figure, people will 4:30  Will sell even for lakhs and nothing else can be uprooted, you can make the figure of 3 lakhs and 3 lakhs will not go to one rupee, only 3 lakhs will go, only ₹ 3 lakhs will go and link it with the draw and the allotment decision will be taken on the spot.  No one can do anything wrong, even the builder ca n't cry too much. There is a little profit for the builder of Rs 3 lakh, which I have calculated, there is no loss on Rs 1 lakh, there is definitely a loss on Rs 1 lakh, so do some kind of calculation.  Friend, look at the rate of land, what is the land tax? Grab an auto, you will get it in a small car, it is fine in the market too, Nano will be a bunny band, Grab an auto, grab an auto, Nano auto also needs eight yards of land, brother 5  It is 5 feet wide, 5 feet is a few inches, if you make it 5 feet then you need 6 feet space from the door to open, 6 feet in this length too, you need 11-12 feet space to stand, so if you calculate that So 11 yards of land is needed or 99, then this is the list. If Honda City is parked here and Creta is made longer, then I do n't know how much space it needs, then this one thing is included in it, which is free parking for two wheelers. According to me, polish them, take out parking in its place, take out some covered and take out some open ones, you can give 3.5 lakhs to the covered one, you can give 2.5 lakhs to the open one, so that an average of three lakhs.  The reason is that one has to pay for the scooter, according to the free scooter, divide the parking in half and remove the parking from that half, he will get 50% covered parking and the remaining 50 will be open. How did you guys think of the idea, will you guys do this? But then it is not black, it can be done very expensive but in my opinion the figure of 2.5 lakh to 3:30 lakh for covered and uncovered is fine, the builder will get profit in 3 lakh. Definitely, he will get some profit because till he does not get profit, he will keep playing the game and in this matter, I want to tell the government about a product which should come in Gurgaon in the coming time and what is missing, I want the support of the public and that product.  I don't have it yet, I want to introduce it in the market because affordable housing is getting exhausted because there is not much back in it and even the commercial one which the builder was in the middle of.  There is a shop worth Rs 40-50 lakhs, that is not a workout, our Jason told us, take the blame or whatever, but the fact is that it is a camera worth Rs 600000 which is being sold in a shop worth Rs 60 lakhs. Its actual price is Rs 6-7 lakhs honey.  Want to buy a beach for 10 lakhs, beat your hands but it is being sold for 7 lakhs because there are not that many shops, they are rooms, they are not shops, the story does not work by picking up the shops but everyone knows this. They are among the buyers, it is okay to buy whatever is going on, as long as it is going on, it is fine, but when they do the calculations, when the bank is ready, then they will know what figure I was giving. It is better than this, so I am working at those places.  Make parking between the buildings by making up and down parking. Make a small tax of Rs. 3-3-4-4 lakhs between the buildings and make the parking. Is it more practical or give a better idea to the builder then make the parking and make the car.  but car's take builder  I am also giving the idea to others because you will build 600 shops. They will not see your 600 shops. If a builder goes to a project, then Bhaiya Bikini Shakti should take out some rates because awareness is coming among the people. Will I take the shop? Will I open 600 shops?  Lee, you have 600, 600 shops inside a society. Can you believe it? These big societies are so expensive, there are expensive societies. There are five shops, six shops, eight shops, 10 shops.  Grocery's new trailer, weller, some food items, bread, eggs, milk, that much is needed, a shop on 80 flat top, like this good shop, also on this like very good and good shop, lotus planted, even people do not have it on 60 flat top. Shop is like luxury but de residence's yes, I have the choice, get eggs cooked from here, buy bread from here, do it away from here, get the choice, caste is 60 in 60, you are in one and if  Brother, if the ratio is 6:1, then what is there? Video and tax. Buy parking. If you take care of your safety, there is no benefit in becoming an active waste here. Simply tell the government that this is also happening. You tell me what to do because if you say too much then it will speak.  Don't buy Terraco, it is a problem, don't pay three lakh rupees for a new one, but you have benefit in buying the address. Now I have calculated and told you that ₹ 2000 will make a difference in the rent, won't it?  There will be no difference in the parking with tax of ₹ 2000. Tell me, either tell me that the rent is not ₹ 2000, but not ₹ 2000. After four-five years from today, he will pay ₹ 2000. If he has tax on parking, then you will get 6 to 8%.  There is a return and it will also move forward in the coming time, but in the process, I feel that there is something wrong in it. Brother, ask the builder of Kant government, how many people will be born later, they are parking the tax.  In the beginning it is written inside the RERA map, how much is the parking, then do trophy timing for it, if you are not interested in it, many a times you would turn a blind eye then do it, now the affordable housing back has gone down, the upcoming 345 is some girl.  I don't know whether they will come or not but if they come then implement it now and do the rest with some transparency. I also want to accept the idea. Please send a batch of Rs 3 lakh at the judge rate.  How do you like the idea of ​​2.5 lakhs open and 3.5 lakhs internal tax? It can be 25-30 thousand more or less. If you are more interested, you will argue for a personal matter, make it for 2 lakhs, everything can make a slight difference. You can do that by sitting and defending on location builder and if the situation is fine then please join the awareness group which you will find in the comment area because there you can talk openly, it is okay, not openly everywhere. Kari Ja Shakti Par Vativer reasons are fine but it can be explained a little better. Thank you very match."

    "title": "Curious  Case Of Gurgaon Resale Market [hDzTl4s86p8].en",
    "content": "Hello friends A Pickler Case of Gurgaon Real Estate Market Why I am using this word picker because I recently made a video when I took the names of three-four projects, I said if anyone wants to sell then tell me if anyone wants to buy.  Tell me ok and people contacted on the number 95 people and buyers the seller is only on 5 and later on that 5 also I checked the result and there was no silence to sell  No one is ready, it's a picky case, many people feel that the run up in the primary market has become too much, then the secondary market is also rising and I make a challenge and you write to me in your comment section about your project.  Tell me the name of and you tell me whether I have a seller or a seller ready to give so on, there is no deal happening, it's very sad, it's sad, there is a lot of resale deal, what is called, someone is in urgent need.  Or he wants to sell, this is what is happening inside the market and it is very very pickler, now if you see people, not many fresh launches are coming in Gurgaon in the last six months, not many launches have come, now the government has not come. And it is election time too, so the off-course comes a little from that, but the names of the upcoming products that we have heard, seen and understood, the rates are at a different level than 20000 square feet.  At some places it is more. Recently, it is a listed player. It is the number two company in real estate in India. Probably, it is okay that they have acquired two land parcels, one of 550 crores, one of two acres, maybe some three acres, small means 100 crores.  The price of above acre has gone up to Rs 100-11 crore. They have taken it in the auction. Okay, if the acre goes up to Rs 100.25 crore, then the goods that will be made on it. Just think at what rate will it come out because the builder should also earn profit, he will have luxury, ultra luxury, although he will do magic, people don't know, they will build one tower and two towers because now that is another thing, now niche products will come in very mature markets like golf course road.  But nothing has ever happened since so many years, so you will find middle like it will also come near Hooda City Centre. Another name change player has expensive goods in quarter four.  Will go for resale. If someone is selling something in the market, then take one more update. Recently there is another listed player whose product has just launched a new tower and some towers. A lot of goods have been sold. Yes, some are left, good units are left.  But the release of so many units at such a price shows genuine demand. Only one thing is that that FOMO thing is not helpful. People can understand it by seeing it, they can sit and watch it satisfactorily, it is not so.  Is it that he has just left, just like he says, go for darshan and there is a crowd and that Pandit ji keeps saying hurry up, next next next, if he is not there, then you need to understand with some peace, it is time to think that we are here again.  Good times and take it after thinking about it, whatever inventory is there, I am saying this, find out the rates today, you will get higher rates in Navratri, there are still 10-12 days, after that then Shraddha.  The time of Pitru Paksha will start, which will be a time of 15 days, Fort Night, after that you have Navratri and then there are the results of elections, then you will again see things being created which will be called I will not use the word frenzy, frenzy is quite.  An extreme term but whatever happens below that, we will look at it and then we will see a bullish niche in the market and I will also tell you the time from 15-20 October.  You will see a lot of bullishness till December. You will see it again inside the market. And still there is a lot of bullishness but it is quiet because no one is shutting over the roof. I am just asking you to do your homework. All of you try to check by pretending to be buyers.  Check whether anyone is ready to sell something or not and I have an open offer again because there will be some sellers. I had 5 sellers come to me. If you want to sell something in a good project in a good project then you can contact.  The genuine price which is the market price will be explained to you and you will be told that brother, there are many people who are sellers in resale and are sitting with very unrealistic expectations. I would like to guide them with one basic thing that you should consider the price of the new builder.  Can't match in resale because your money has gone at 60-70 and there he is getting a little easy payment plan, there he will pay the money in 5 years, here at 6 8 10 12  If you have to pay in 14 months, then you cannot command that much price. You will have to calculate the interest by just doing p * r * t / 100 and reduce the interest a little that your principal which you are taking now and he is not paying there.  The only difference is that in which of the other rate projects you are running, what rate weight is going on, if you want to know about it, then in short videos I will tell you that according to the current time and date, whether it is going on time and  This rate is approximately going on and my guess is that it will go up to here and what should you do strategically, if they want then those videos will be made, you must write in the comment section, like the channel, subscribe and share.  Do it and if you want to take membership of the channel because a lot of good content has been posted on it, reviews of many projects have been posted exactly, then you can go and see that also and take membership of the channel.  You are also added to a special group where the opportunity is told first. First of all, after a stage in the market, everyone comes to know, but in the beginning, hot oil pakodas, whatever the opportunity is, whether it is in the resale market.  Whether it is of primary market or market of any other city, then you will get some benefit in it. If you take membership, you will also get the link of membership in the comment section. Those who have Android, they will get the join button.  You will be able to take membership of the channel by pressing the join button. Thank you very much."

    "content": "Hello friends, many queries come from the subscribers about these two places. According to me, you should not buy real estate right now. These are the names of both the places. First of all Ayodhya ji is in Ayodhya and second is Goa. Let us discuss both of them. First of all Ayodhya ji.  They pay too much, they might have got off-course benefits but now there is a lot of run up as far as tourist data is concerned, I don't make it political because nowadays elections.  Now you are going through Google 2 yourself, it is always over the edge in such a place, it is so much that sometimes they overdo it, okay, and what about a tourist place, what is the biggest thing about a tourist? Tourists will come and go, no tourist settles down and the same thing is for Goa. Local politics in Goa will also not sustain the real estate there in the future because there have been too many outsiders. This air bnb is being built again and again.  Air BnB has become so much that it is no longer sustainable because there are so many hotels that you can't go and stay in Air BnB on a long vacation because cooking, your own services etc. are required in Air BnB.  Swimming pool facilities are not entertainment facilities normally, they are not very close to you when now the people who want to go in the future are youngsters and leisure.  He wants to go for that, he wants to go for his peace and comfort, he is not a budget traveller, earlier people used to take all these things as a family but now it has become too much and too many flats are being built.  I am saying this because every day since I also work in real estate, I get pressure from there every day that yes, promote the project there, promote Air BnB, there is a lot of pressure there, it means a lot there.  If the matter is coming up then I will only give a guidance where there is no end result because tomorrow when Lakshmideep gets developed and becomes of Nde Mani Cobar then there will be a lot of choices in India itself plus Goa is very very expensive and you agree with me.  Please type yes, traveling to Thailand is cheaper in a five star and air tickets are available daily than what Goa is, so one is tempted to travel abroad too, so there is a lot of money there.  The spaces have become crowded, the beaches have become very crowded, the properties which are equivalent to five star hotels have become very expensive, in general the entire ecosystem is expensive, right from the taxes, there they say that when their tourists come, then a  There is that feeling that there is too much of that and the North Indians have also reached a lot, I am also telling this that I am talking more about the North Indians only, a lot of property has been taken speculatively. If you are watching my video then please do write in the comment section that what else do you have to add in Phenomena? What are you watching? Gonas are themselves fed up.  Are you going to Bhar or somewhere else? Okay, so this one is a I will say risk reward ratio is not favorable extreme supply and  No one will ever stay in Goa, it will never be permanent. How much tourism can happen, people feel like coming. Most of the time, July, August, September, humidity is there, April, May, June is very hot. You can see right now when the video is being shot.  There are a lot of those in the season that comes in the month of December, January is the peak and you add November and February, just brother, it is a program of four months, after that there is not much, there is over supply, the occupancy rates will be low, many people come and do their calculations.  Of course, those who have to sell will show theirs and that calculation is fine for them because simple things, if the rate has almost doubled from the rate at which they bought the thing, then whatever returns will be there will automatically be halved. Then the risk reward ratio is favorable otherwise please spread this video and do not invest in any kind of these properties in these two places. Advice on property is currently being given till May 2024. Don't do it in future. Mark this video and you will see the returns. There is gross over supply. Somewhere it will not be able to be resold and somewhere else nothing can be done better than that. So if anyone of yours  If you want to do commercial work, if you want to do it somewhere here and there, then do it as per the rental yield issue, then check it. However, there are many other places too where the fare is Rs. 7.  Rental yield is available in residential. I will keep bringing value for money to the city. At the end of the time, give food, clothes and house. These are the basic three businesses. Catch those who run around. In residential, a person needs to sleep at night.  There is no idea how much supply there is of tourist places. A lot is being done in Dekha Dekha, so please be careful about it in the comment section.

    "title": "Do Not Buy This Product In Gurgaon Real Estate [7jbwaQO8Ohc].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, do not buy this product in Gurgaon real estate, I get big queries, so today I made a video, but there is no need to forward this video, so I did not even write on the topic, what is this because in reality I will kick someone in the stomach.  There is no need to kill, to tell only those people who are connected, who understand, this work has to be done with great responsibility. It is a very thin balance. Come here and raise your voice and become a social reformer. Oh my brother!  Look, I am doing great good, fools do this, there is no benefit, no one does any good to anyone, they can definitely do other things, so this is a product, it is Affordable Housing Shops Affordable Housing Shops 42 Lakh 40 Lakh 45 48 50 40  It is being sold between Rs. 52 lakhs in different places, no need to buy anywhere in Gurgaon, no need to buy any on this message.  There is no need to spread the message, why there is no need, because this is the profit of the builder, if his shops are not sold, he will not make profit, then why will he build the work, so I am telling you with responsibility, there are very few people who  This is how everyone makes videos here, it means that I am the Batman, I am the Superman, I am the only one for you, otherwise the government has increased the market from 4 to 8 to sell commercials, but why not you?  Buying because the ratio of shops to flats which is generally seen in normal societies is 1:8. Historically, there was one shop for 80 flats, so if there are 800 flats then there should be 10 shops. This is a good ratio. It is fine, but if  If there are a little more shops, people used to accept even 1:6 from the lets, saying that it is okay, it is 900 flats, if you build 15 shops then it will be 900 flats.  If there are 15 shops, then Rs. 60 will be taken out from the house because ultimately it has to be released. If someone is buying that shop at some rate, then it will have a rental value after purchasing it. If he is also operating it himself, then there would be an opportunity cost.  Okay, how much am I buying? I have to sell some vegetables, I have to cut hair, okay, I have to sell some eggs, bread, I have to sell some groceries, I have to work as a tailor.  If I want to do anything like this, then I have some income, I have some sales, I have some profit from the sale, with the profit I can pay the rent of the shop, okay, so they back the rent of the shop from it, here it is affordable.  Can you people believe it, I mean no, will it not be needed here, people will not talk about math, the ratio is 1:6, the ratio is 1:5, it turned out to be an affordable one, 183 in 106 sector.  How many shops and flats are there? 1100 flats, 1000 or 1100 flats and 183 shops. Wherever these shops are coming up, you ask, how many flats, how many shops, the ratio is 1:5, 1:6, 17, 1:8, 1:9, I am saying.  I am 1:0 ideal, you can go upto 60, if you go below 150 then that value is nothing in the shop.  If you because the sales of the shop cannot be that much and the profit is only on the sales of 10 15 20 25, you know, try any calculation and the people who are living here in affordable housing, they will have the rent.  Well, he is not that extremely rich, and secondly, he is not sitting at the same shops for shopping. These days, your friend brings everything from Zomato to his home, so what does he need from the same shop anyway?  Everything will be brought to his house in the same way, he can bring it from somewhere else and if he is also taking it from that shop like a hair cutting shop, then it is okay, let us take it from the barber shop, then let's go.  Those who will pass will go to that one but perhaps not all of them will go beyond that but even if all go then do some math and see how many shops are there, how will they run, how much rent will they pay because so many shops have come up and out of them six-seven are worth the property.  Will you not sit with me if you have hired me?  Even if a person sits with a property shop, then do the math friend, what kind of shops will there be, how much work will be done, 150 can go down to 1:4, if you are very depressed, no, I want commercial only, but where 1:6 is.  Just think there, my friend, even Rs. 000 will be spent on six houses and on your shop. Now, no, will people from outside also come? Will only people from the society come? Well, this is the affordable housing at the bottom of the pyramid.  The people of their society who will come do not have a shop in their society. Will it ever happen that a couple in Gurgaon will wake up in the morning and say darling, today we will go to have breakfast in shop number 63 of Affordable Housing in Sector 83. It will be a very nice outing. Will the complexion be made Affordable Housing?  My heart becomes happy, Hey brother, you will go, some will go to cyber hub, some will go to established mall, some will go to watch a movie, some will go to some decent place, some will go to affordable housing.  Few people have to come to the affordable housing shop. No one is ever going to come. You can say that it is a facility and shops have been built for the people living there. It is a good thing but the shop as an investment is not good, it will remain beaten up is the message.  Better than that, you should buy affordable housing only, or buy that one in resale only. If you buy it in resale also, then that share shot in affordable housing of 2-3 BH will cost you Rs. 20.  2. He is paying Rs 25000 rent and the shop will not give. The shop may remain vacant. The flat of the affordable one will not remain vacant. The position for which the position has been made, assume that the position for an affordable housing has been made for six months because the position is being made slowly for six months. Affordable housing in Gurgaon in which the position has been held for six months. If any flat is vacant, please tell me the name of the society for rent that you have been living in for one and a half years.  And people do not keep coming here, no, it is not so, but go to the shops and check whether the rent is available. Do you want to buy a shop? Go and check the math that I have told you, whether this math is correct or not.  Don't buy it, don't buy it in affordable housing. Anyway, I keep on forbidding, but now I am not refusing much because the whole lobby is mine and builders are sitting, why should I go and spread so much awareness that I will spoil people's stomachs.  One should not give so much knowledge and I never show any hypocrisy. There is a lot of credibility here for being a social reformer. In the market, many people listen to you, not people listen to you, builders also listen to you, top consultants also listen to you, you yourself are a top consultant.  If yes, then the responsibility increases, brother, you have to bat in every way, do n't you come to the market just like that and indulge in it because you need things in every way, but I was coming too much for something that is related to me, so I told you it is affordable.  Do not buy from any shop, anywhere else. Before buying, check the calculation given by me, whether it is working or not. You will spend Rs 15000 on one shop, even if the ratio is 1:6, it will still be Rs 90000.  Sales of Rs. 90000, if sales are worth Rs. 90000, then his profit will be Rs. 25300, how will he pay your rent of Rs. 18-20 Rs. What is it and how will you give it? Do the calculations yourself. What is he selling? Stationary is selling anything. Do the calculations. Check the ratio. Every person from any society is not going to accept anyone from outside. Even commercial ones are being sold everywhere.  There are shops everywhere and they are selling, so there is a lot of supply. If you want to see its calculation, look inside the HUDA sectors. There are big sectors on every floor. There are three to four floors built everywhere and there  The population is so much and when you count the shops there and do the ratio, only then those shops run so much, then you think that commercial is like this everywhere else, look at the ratio, in Hooda sector the ratio is 1,150, Hooda is 1,200.  In the sector, there are 200 floors on one shop, the house is not speaking because every house has three or four floors, if we do the ratio of floors then there are 50 houses, 50 houses.  But a shop was set up, whatever was set up, there were 50 houses, today there are 150 floors, there are three and in many places there are even four, so the work is going well there, the work is going on absolutely well, but there it is going well.  So the rate is also good, the rate is not cheap but I am saying again and again about affordable housing, you do not need to buy it at all but there is no need to spread this video because if it goes viral then no one will buy.  so builders What incentive will they get if they get kicked in the stomach? There is a little danger in making it because many people have already bought it. It is good but there is no need to buy any more. There is no need to buy in resale.  There is no need to buy even a car, you cannot consider it as a normal shop, the affordable one has only a room and not a shop, it would be better in my opinion that the builder would have sold the covered car parking for 6 to 8 lakhs instead and would have given it in a smaller size as per the car.  Tax If it is done like this then it is better because that car parking needs covered car parking. Okay, he can do that kind of thing or can give it on rent. Okay, if this shop was so good, so much space would have been taken out, then the builder would have done it.  He would have kept the whole thing and would have rented it out. Why is he selling it? It is absolutely grossly overpriced. According to me, if you ask, it is Rs 12 to 15 lakh in this quantity and this is at least four times the price. So this much mismatch is so much mismatch, if it is 12 to 15, then you can say, okay friend, if I get 8 Haj then I will get the rent, I will get this much and if I get this much, then it is okay, I am getting 6 Haj but he is getting it.  But the calculation of 45-50 lakhs cannot be done anywhere. That much business cannot be done from anywhere. Do reverse engineering from anywhere. If you are okay then please do not share this.

    "title": "Do You Dislike High  Maintenence Fees In High Rise Premium Projects ？ [54qjGswN4rM].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today we will discuss the maintenance in a high rise society or the new condos as they are called in English, which is the new world going on these days. HiFi societies are being built in which the maintenance will go up to Rs. 5. Luxury, ultra luxury can even go up to Rs. 88 in many cases.  And according to the super area, suppose your flat is 2000 square feet, then your maintenance will be Rs 12,14,000, in many cases it will be around 4,5000 square feet.  Have lived there and if you put 8, then you may have to pay ₹ Haj for the maintenance of your own house, which is a very luxurious flat, so we will discuss about it because it pinches many people, if it pinches you, then pause the video here.  By doing this you can write PINCH so that I can get the idea that he pinches the people in the audience. Okay, so you have done that he pinches everyone. Now let's move ahead. If he pinches you then watch this video.  I would like to tell you through this that you should not pinch because if you want to live in a good place, what is happening people are becoming penny wise pound fools, I am also seeing something in Gurgaon, I will also tell you with examples, it will be a very easy learning video. Seeing it peacefully will complete the learning. I want to say what the poet is trying to say because this is how people do it. Maintenance is a bar for getting something particular, not getting something particular.  Kind of people and only getting some particular kind of people may sound a bit classist but it is very important it is as if someone sees normal society also ₹ to ₹ to sabhi leti hai ti and ₹ mein ₹ wala what is the difference  If you have to pay Rs. 000 more for 2000 square feet, then you are paying Rs. 4000 more i.e. you are paying Rs. 0000 extra per year for maintenance, which I think.  People's lives will cost Rs 50,000 extra. I am saying that giving total maintenance is also costing their lives. If 50,000 extra will cost even more then that 50,000 will be spent even if you give it for 10 years then it will be ₹ lakh. But the difference in capital appreciation of the society which is well maintained. Which is there becomes more than 20 30 40 lakhs between two societies which are old  So there is a big difference, let me explain it again with the help of an example. There is a society in Dwarka which was handed over in the late 90's where the flats were priced at Rs 6 to Rs 8 lakh. There were single digit flats which were bought by some and some had bought them.  The meaning of his life was that at that time he was turning 60 or 55 or 60 years of age and somehow after his death he tried everything to get people's loans.  Somehow, by investing the FD, PFF retirement fund, he took it from his family, if his children have not done much good, or the person is an old man even today, at the age of 78, 80, 82, 83 or 76, whatever you put it, at that time he was at the age of 50, 55, 60.  It must be okay from him that 00 maintenance is not being given, I am telling about Dwarka, I have taken RW there for my consultation many times when there were fights. Now half of the residents there are pilots of your airlines because that airport is nearby, now their salary is Rs. 578 lakhs, now for them there is a proposal of increasing the maintenance from Rs. 1900 to Rs. 2500.  If we make Rs 2500 then there is a fight about whether it is Rs 2500 or not, Rs 00 has to be made, reduce it by Rs 400, why do this then people are getting upset there.  I am talking about the society of Dwarka because now there is a mismatch in the gentry there, everyone is living in the same place, I assume the rate of flats is around two crores, so two and a half to two and a half depending on the size of three BH, four BH.  How much is it? Now someone has bought it for Rs. 2.25 crores. A pilot who flies a plane has bought it and someone has bought it for Rs. 78 lakhs. He has been living there for 25 years. There is a mismatch between the two.  It is very big, now the way they are coming in the societies of Gurgaon, and the maintenance is high in Gurgaon, I am going to tell this to the people of Delhi, so this is one way to take things up, now what is there in this that if some builders themselves Maintenance is done by some very high maintenance, good firms like CC CRB, CBRE, sorry CBRE etc. There are some more, two-four more names, you write down the ones which are top notch, there is money there.  We go more but brother we enjoy there, residents do not face any problem, many places take RWAs, where these RWs are taken, there is local petty politics, fights happen, Gurgaon is also getting to see this, so you should see this.  You have to go to the middle class society, you have to go to the ultra luxury, you have to go to the higher, you have to go to the lower middle class, which one is the gentry, this will decide the future of the society because when the people of the society themselves  If we file a case against someone else, it is published in the newspaper, what news will be published in the newspaper locally? Nowadays brother, so and so society went there, went to the side of DTCP, they gave it to us, they did not ask and then outsiders would come to know about the troubles in the society.  If tenants do not come or people come for resale, they say that there is a Kalesh society, there is so much foolishness in the matter of twenty-four-eighths, I mean, this is not ours, many people in India are suffering from diseases.  Wise pound foolishness is fine, you are ready to lose Rs 100,200,500 in order to save Rs 24,000, then why are you playing politics with your society as to who will become the President and who will look after the fund, so this is a little bit.  If there are like minded people then only they say that when there is such a rich society, now we never hear these fights and fights, these rich people never have basements here in the society of the rich.  If water enters inside, then they don't cry, they don't cry, they quietly get out, they manage themselves well, and wherever they are, they will be like this, so people will know by saying, oh, oh, okay, you. Brother, this society did not take it, it went straight to your rate of 10, 15, 20 lakh rupees, but it has nothing to do with it. They have to take revenge from the builder or from the Dal President or from whom they have to take revenge. This is very funny.  thing is that  Friend, why do they do this, the thing does not belong to the builder, once he has given it to you, it will be yours, now it is your advantage to make your thing shine and say good. If there are some issues, then sit and resolve them instead of creating noise. What do you think that you are?  If you go to the government, the government has so much time to come and do the flats worth two, five, five crore or three crores each, or do it for the poor or do vote bank politics wherever it is. Actually, these people need the government, they need the government. You people will have to resolve it yourself. If any issue comes up, you will have to do it openly. I do not want to take the name of the society whose name came out of one of my videos in the newspaper. Meaning, if I take the name of Gurgaon, I will take the name of Delhi, the rate of that society will be Rs 10 lakh less if I come here and its rent will be Rs 000 less because if your society is well. You are paying Rs 000 extra for maintenance, brother, you will get good rental there, tenants will also want to come there, resale will also be good there, you will feel like living there too, [ __ ] and span things will be installed, these are big builders like Apna D Se Dilwale.  What are the builders in Delhi, the top builders, even if they take maintenance of them, they keep their entire ecosystem shining, even outside the society, now they do it all out of someone's pocket.  Do you know that the expenditure on water will ultimately be added to the cost of the flat or will be added to the maintenance? Milder will not add to the pocket because he protects his margin and even more if his product is sold at a very high rate. If you have rent at any place, let's say this is expensive, we hear 25 crores 50 crores, let's say the maintenance here is 20 30 25 500.  No matter how much money is being paid for Haj, the rent is coming in the same amount. If the rent is two and a half, three or three or four lakh rupees, then these people of middle class and middle class societies should learn something from this that brother, if I give a rent of Rs 5 lakh.  Also gave sorry maintenance extra, gave 5 lakhs, gave it in 10 years, 12 years, if it is ok, then my capital appreciation will increase by 25,30,35 lakhs and from that  I will also get more rent of Rs. 10-12 lakhs, so this is an investment, many people consider it as an expense and what people are not able to understand is that if you live on four floors with a lift, then that is your security.  The cost of MC of lift is 10 to 12000, to maintain it everyone will have to spend Rs 200 there and if you also hire a security guard who does only one shift. Brother, whatever you do from 6:00 in the evening to 6:00 in the morning, that too will cost Rs. 12,14,000. If you have four floors, then you have to pay ₹ 4000 rent there, then your lift and rent together would be ₹ 5000.  If you are normal and live in these sectors as your HSVP Hooda says, then somewhere else if you pay this much or 500 Hajj more, you can get cleanliness also. Lifts are also operational, security is also available, amenities are also available, you are getting to see flowers, you are also getting to roam, you are getting cleanliness, you are getting all the luxuries, people come on call, all this, all this.  If anything goes wrong with you, then brother, it is worth it, where is the problem, try doing this work in your private and see how much it is, which is a small garden, right in the green belt, I am telling people whose  How much will it be? 15 feet by 5 feet i.e. approximately eight yards, which is the green garden type people keep in front of their house. That too, a gardener will be required today to repair the grass and plant four saplings within a month.  00 takes or does n't take then you tell me you don't give and those who say no you leave three or four days and then come back and just do it sometimes, if they are also giving then they are paying only that much.  and many more people are giving  I know that those who are paying Rs 500-800 for the maintenance of 10 pots, if they ever come and do something, then all these things will become even more costly in the future. Okay, so you should not consider this maintenance as a bad thing, do not consider it a pinch.  That is an overall experience of yours, this is what we do when we go outside in a resort, so what is there in it, that is, it is the mountain, the forest and everything, whatever is there, whatever is there.  There is a lot of frills for one day 12 15 20 22 25 30 I don't know how many thousand the room rates are depending on the season, so brother, if you are looking for mountains then you are not able to see that atmosphere in Gurgaon these days, efforts are being made to create such a resort type in the future. Brother, if you become one, you will have to bear this expense. Be mentally prepared. If you have to come to Gurgaon and have something of 18 to 2000 square feet, then brother.  Mentally prepare from Rs to Rs. Depending on which one you are taking, the life length will increase by Rs. If you start from four then do this caterer, many people say that it is too much, it is looting, don't do it, then when RW comes, she will want to stop it, reduce it.  If the society wants then it will become shabby, just like that society becomes shabby, similarly the rates of that society start falling, the rents start falling, so it is up to the people to see that we maintain it, we just have to see that it is well maintained or not. Even if you take a four-part certificate and if those things are not correct in it, then you have to pay this maintenance as a flat owner, as a tenant or whoever is living in that society, you just have to get insured.  What has to be done is that things are correct, the accountability of money, you can check that yes, it seems to be fine, but on account of accounting, you cannot wish that if one and a half becomes two and a half rupees, then one and a half is not going to be reduced because the cost of labor has increased. Everything has to grow. Everything has to grow in the coming time. If there is no incident, then this one has taste in living. And those who have taste, who are cash flow, who are actual rich, only they will be able to live. There are many people who want money in Delhi.  They are roaming around with CR, the salary is Rs 1 lakh, the money is Rs 5, because something has been sold in Delhi, so they will have problem in coming here and staying in such condos because they do not have cash flows. When the monthly salary comes, the salary is very high.  Cash comes, money comes, your income is very high then you do n't feel much pressure to pay 8 thousand per month otherwise you would have given 8 thousand, people will feel stressed about the maintenance of their house and even if it feels so, this issue will remain in future.  This will progress further if you keep this thing catered because whenever people come up with a new project, I conduct webinars or something. Tell me, how much will be the maintenance. It will be very high. Just think that it will be so high that it will cost you your life to give it. Just have this mindset that the person speaking will say anything. It is not written anywhere that it will not be less, it will not be less, brother, I am saying that two to three rupees more have been kept inside affordable housing, so there is nothing in it below that.  There is only one lift for maintenance and what else is there inside it, there will be a little cleaning work, not too much work, it does not mean that there are not many such things like flower garden, golf course, providing water etc. But if you are taking it there also, then the amount of money you will get at the place and the amount you will get out of your pocket, then that is your experience of living in a good place, you can think of this and this you have to be mentally ready and before buying be ready that which you will get.  Pa  You will get the things of sir, you will get the things of four, all this will happen there, all this will happen in the future, all this is going on, you understand what happens, I hope I am myself getting the pronunciation right, so the driver is coming on call, the food provider is coming on call.  Some press person is coming, all this Shosha, see this, when old age comes, I am telling this for the rich people, or even the upper middle class, now they do not want to be so dependent on anyone.  In the future, someone should either make such things for senior citizens or like Ashiana like the one made in Bhiwani or if they have to live in big cities then everyone will enjoy all these facilities and there are people who can do all this.  The builders know that they want to pay and are bringing only these projects that brother, you will not have any problem in old age, the doctor will also be on call, you will sneeze, the doctor will come, if anyone comes, the food will come.  The washerman will come, any service you can think of, you need a driver, you need a hair cut person, you need a hair cut person, whatever you want in the house, you will get everything, you will have to pay for the phone call, yes, you will also have to pay for the service, you will have to pay separately for the service and the service.  To make them available, they will have to be paid separately, so it does not mean that you will pay money to the haircutter who is cutting the hair for free during the maintenance, but all this arrangement has been done and the tab has been done, apart from this, whatever else is there, I hope.  you get the larger  The message is that the moment you get in to something called condos and this luxury and after doing all this, brother, the expenses here are water, you think this BMW1000RR I am the number one real estate with clarity, I have told you, so be mentally prepared as much as I can.

    "title": "First Affordable Housing Project Of Gurgaon Which Has Potential To Touch 1 Crore Price [vpMdrlweOdo].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today we will discuss about an affordable housing project whose name is MRG Ultimus. It is also expected to come up within 6 months. The construction has reached a very advanced stage. Its location is very good. If you have an affordable flat in it, So please write in the comment section and if not then the video will be good for you for information and pricing. Its location is on Bang Oran 90 meter road which is on the way from Rampura Chowk.  That road which connects to Pataudi Road, incidentally is being made as a model road and the news that is coming now, I think will come to fruition in a few days, the initial news came that a flyover worth Rs 59 crore is also being built on Dadi Sati Chowk.  There is a university place opposite to it and if you go right from here, at a distance of 3 to 4 minutes you will find the biggest mall of that area. There are many malls coming up and many more malls are also coming up.  There are a lot of commercial buildings and there are more to come, the location is very good, those who have it here, I would call it wonderful, its target is one seer, the only affordable housing, which immediately I feel will hit one CR here.  The size of BHK is 614. Well, the sizes of 2 BHK were quite open as far as I remember. Apart from carpet plus balcony, it is 614, 620, 625. 700 plus was coming out, so this is going to hit crores and the rate I am telling is not the December rate because if you have a position in December then you cannot sell it, it takes one more year to sell. So that means I am telling the rates for one year ahead, so whoever is paying here, they have to keep it here, you will see the rent of 25 to 27000 for a very comfortably and fully furnished BHK from today. After 10-12 months they will say, position is happening in 6-7 months. Gradually people take position, get wood work done, then look for tenants, so think about the rent target I am telling you, I am telling you for the first of June because it is possible.  By the time the position is made, it may be two to four months from January to February. You know, NGT's ban, this or that, something or the other keeps happening, so generally the target price here is 25% of the rent.  ₹ 27000 for a fully furnished BHK apartment, remember that there is a gap of 4 to 5000 rupees between fully furnished and non-fully furnished, so everyone should spend ₹ lakh. According to me, only fully furnished apartments should be given, RV hospital is touching this.  Is that true a big thing because I feel that for the staff of RV Hospital, living here on rent is too much.  It will be convenient because you know the doctors and nurses and all these people, especially the lower staff, which means it takes a lot of time to travel, it takes money, it takes effort and the working hours also go up and down, night duties, you know.  If it happens in hospitals, then the staff of RV Hospital is quite big, it is a 400 bed hospital, probably RV Hospital, you tell me how many beds it has, I may be right and on color, as far as I know, it is a very big hospital.  If it is touching it, if it has a common wall, then they will have a lot of staff, there will be admin staff too, NursesLabs, someone will be earning Rs. 5 lakh, a doctor, he will live here in an affordable way, but if you know about all kinds of people, then he will do very well in this.  Swimming pool etc. and all these facilities are also there, there is the club house and that cricket pitch, all these frills are also there because it was the first one to introduce all those things and its room sizes are huge.  The meaning of flat is good, earlier you know in affordable housing, 300-400 square feet used to be defined as affordable, then it was changed from 450 square feet to 650, the government limits it to 645, that 60 square meter is the criteria, earlier it was 45 square meter.  Criteria Which Used To Be Like I Think 490 Square Feet Then It Becomes 645  So in this you will get big open ones, in fact the size of them is 2 BH, at a distance from this there is a product which was from a big builder and belonged to the luxury segment of the listed player, it was sold for Rs. 2.25 crores, the same, the same, the same carpet area, yes, that and more.  It has a lot of frills, it has gold, silver, diamonds and pearls but it is sold for Rs. 2 crores plus, its location has increased and its own commercial is very good. Off course, it would have been sold. Anyway, I never talk about affordable to buy a commercial because a little is too much, but the residents here will get a lot of facilities because that commercial is also bang on 90 meter road, so everyday things will be available. As soon as you come out, you will go to the left. So SO plots are being made of RO F and then of Best Tech. Go further to the right and as you go a little further, SO plots of MR will come to the right.  If you go a little or two minutes ahead of Dadi Sati Chowki, you will come across malls, some are being built, some have already been built, so the commercial is complete there and there is a lot of excitement and another very good development has taken place which is that  There was a dividing road of Sector 88 and 9, there was also a 100 90 meter span, if that too is built then the traffic load which was increasing on this road will also reduce.  And if it is being made then don't sell it here, this is the message whose message is, Congratulations to you guys that it proved to be a 3.5 bagger for you, a four bagger, a 3.5 bagger, 26 27 28 I touched a thing worth crores for the first time in something affordable.  So you don't have to leave it, you have to hold on to it, you have to hold on to your life, many people have benefited from it and maybe if you get less than the target price I told you.  If you are getting 5, 10, 15 lakhs then take it because these people are not going to stop at these crores, things will become expensive, there will be inflation, there will be no alternative choices, but those who have it, there is no need to sell them because you will not get anything by selling in the market. Now brothers and sisters, things worth Rs. 678 crores are available on 24 meter road of listed players of big builders and this is your chance. Lottery is open on 90 meter road. As for affordable housing, 90 meters of affordable housing is not sold, it is maintained, maintained, decorated and kept for life time. At least keep half of the property which can be passed on to the family. Why don't people know how to dispose of everything?  It is fast, especially those who are from outside, they do not have any idea, what is it, your child can also live, there is such a job for the poor, which seems psychological and is affordable, poor people are poor, only Gurgaon is there.  No, no one will live here, like they say many times, there are less poor people in America, meaning something like that brother, he will not live here, this poor person does not pay so much rent here, so sometimes people feel like this, sometimes people from outside or  Some people confuse affordable with EWS or not, why did they use the word affordable? A thing worth Rs 1 crore is affordable. It is okay if you take a loan of Rs 80 lakh and buy it yourself for Rs 20 lakh.  If you put it in your pocket, it will cost you 75000 EMI, then this will not be such a thing, now it is fine and a good thing, keep it on hold, something will come for public transport too, there is still a journey for this area which will develop in the next three to four years because You cannot sell it for one and a half years, you have a position in 6 months and if you cannot sell the position for one year, then 18 months from now, you probably cannot sell the thing and 18 months from now.  If there will be more brightness in the month, then do not think that these are the targets of 18 months, these are the targets after two months, it has matured in 18 months, as of today there is no valuation for it because you cannot buy it, nothing is available.  And if no one can sell it in the market, then no one is there, but after 18 months, when the window opens, then this is the rate that I have told you. Tell me how did you like the video. Happy Birthday to MRG Ultimus people.  The execution risk is over, it's ok and it's very good and congratulations to all, hold on to this thing, thank you very much."

    "title": "Five Types Of Customer  In Real Estate  Market [Dagi4yqRpRk].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, there are five types of people in the real estate market. Which one are you? Tell me, I will tell you five types of 12345. Okay, on Pan India basis, the matter is going on now and I will tell you the size of each one. And you are the one who is among these five.  Out of these, I will tell you what you should do in the Johnson one, so yes, there are five, first of all, let's start with the thumb, this one is needed and is a user, he needs something, he is searching for it, he found it, so he bought it, this is an investor.  Has always been investing, knows everything, can be a new investor too, has money, wants to invest, space for it, size, asset class, plot, flat, small, big, don't want to keep anything main, city, investor, needs capital appreciation and rent.  Now these A's go, the remaining three A's go. Yes, in my window shop, you understand that women are a caste, you do not have to buy things at the shop, but there are three ways to find out the rate and weight. These are very interesting, three ways. Six months, one year, dead, two years ago, he has bought something and now after monitoring the rate, he has taken it at the right rate. In the increased retro, he has a smile on his face and he wants to know and understand everything, but he cannot buy, hence window shop.  But this is coming, seeing, understanding, feeling happy, but there is one at the window shop, this is one, okay, this is one, there is another one at the window shop, this is brother, there is no money, now if something is expensive then what to see Brother, even after seeing the mother, she  It is said that there is no cost for seeing mehendi at a shop, so there is no cost for seeing mehndi in absentia, and if there is money, then it is better to see it, so this is the one in the window shop. This youngster may be there, when will Papa ji agree that he is from Greater Kailash.  We have a floor of 100 yards, he will give the middle, then we will buy it in Gurgaon, I do n't have money but I am already preparing that when Papa gets in the mood, something like this will happen, then that one will be in the window shop.  That is, today there is no money, most of the youngsters are in this category who do not even have money in 2030 and early 30, they are playing mutual fund mutual fund. Veriku ji has given the lesson that by selling mutual fund, millionaires are becoming by selling it on excel 5000.  Those people are the ones who ship money, they don't have money and they are waiting, okay and they can also be like this, if you can't buy then this rate is flood.  There is a bubble, it is like this, it is like that, it becomes a little tricky at the third window shop, now who is the third, you can tell by posing, which one can it be? Think, the first one is sitting, can buy, he has bought whatever you want to buy, you have to break so much money that  Will buy every day in six-six years but he is enjoying, he has a smile on his face, the second one cannot take it to the window shop, there is no money, there are not many people, what to do with the money now, what is the third one, he has money. Decision making is not happening, I don't know what to take, six rupees and the second thing is whether he is roaming around with one crore rupees or one hundred and twenty crore rupees, the third one and he had heard a dead year ago that brother, there is something in one hundred and twenty crore rupees.  It is a good race, now that good thing is not coming, even the bad thing is not coming. In many lions, now whatever appreciation has happened, they are not able to digest this thing because they may have died a year or two ago and left something behind.  Di ho and ji  You have given up on that rate, now that rate has gone up so much that it is unbelievable and they are getting inferior products at a further location and at a more expensive rate than they were getting, so now it is something.  Like this one, the situation is like that of a girl when she was 23-24 years old, she looked very beautiful and was having a lot of relationships, so she was rejecting him on time. She is on a dead lakh salary.  The one with a salary of Rs. 1 lakh will get more money and the one with good height will get more relationships. Is it okay now when she is 28-29 years old? Look, I am giving an example, don't get sexist, you can do it the other way around and this is also the reality of life, this is for women.  There is a lot of pain and under these examples, if someone's daughter is doing this, sister is doing this, then you can also wake up to my awareness in the society at every level. You know, I have other channels also. What am I saying there, what should I say, then everything is linked up, it is a relief, you cannot do it in isolation, but the example is that when the person who has a good car is Chhath Jati, now he does not want to sit in the second car, especially the ticket price.  It's done brother, the second ticket was for Rs 1500 and there was a vacant seat and I was getting the one lower down, I did not catch it, now I am getting 3 seats for one, it is taking a lot of effort to board the train.  The story of 'If the next one doesn't come, in which I get the same seat, then the answer is this no, the time truth will never come, if you don't speak like this now, otherwise it will fall, now it doesn't happen by speaking like this, I do n't remember and don't know the drum from that.  mare to what is d saying ok please you can write below ok always on everybody you be dead but everybody DOES N'T just because of these vultures and crows ok r  Wanting people and situated means other animals, you have dick so that they can feed, it does not happen like this, now there is no fun in speaking in English and in Hindi, five lines are not remembered many times because it is not written in any prepaid script, I am not right.  So if it is written, then do n't read it after looking at it, some story is not written, okay, the condition of Windows Offer Three is the worst, everything else is clear, he is an investor, he knows where there is opportunity, there is money too.  There is famine too, he just asks, brother, tell me the operation, where he embraces, he hits the target like this, whether such marks are like holes or not, then he dies by doing this, and the user is an innocent person, he does not know.  I want to buy a house, brother, I have it today itself, I have come to my senses, today itself I am getting the money properly, brother, yes, I am getting this, take that, that is also fine, Windows offer one is also absolutely fine, that too, I have taken it.  I  I can't take it but I am watching the show at this very good window shop, you are also very good, I can't take it, I don't have money, but it doesn't cost money to watch, it does n't feel like life, that too at the window shop, three such D men who  Women who are in trouble, under which category do you fall? You have to tell me and if there is any other category apart from these five, then tell me. You will have to fit in these five. Brother, Kahani Na Kahani, you cannot do this, no, no.  we are  Brother, there are some more categories and there is no category, you are within these categories, tell me which category is it, Sher Karo and in every webinar I conduct in this category, I normally do this check in it and also check the trends.  The trade has become 50-50% in many markets, 45% in many, 50 in many, 55 in many, which is a trade in real estate which I will call 8085.  After hitting 90 then he will start plateauing out. Now that journey from 50 to 85 happens in the next 10 months. It happens in 12. When will it happen? He will weigh the micro market and the micro market. I am not able to understand what he is saying.  I understand the thing and all those who are connected are understanding. Please write in the comment area. Yes, we are understanding. Rest of you are fully invited to that telegram group. You will get my real estate thing there.  And explain it well. Weaving is a caste. You can also take membership of the channel. Those trees and towers will be free for you. Off course will be done. There will be free workshops. There will be reviews and projectors will be viewed. And if you ask some questions in Wegener then the tree will be there. Then there will be answers to some questions and you will get a chance to understand things better and do calculations. So subscribe and share. Thank you very much."

    "title": "Game Changer Policy For Middle Class Buyers In Gurgaon Real Estate [8fmRiMzYM3w].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, what is this can be a game changer in Gurgaon real estate? We will discuss beyond that, perhaps it has not been discussed yet in the public domain. Yes, we know that Deendayal has ended in Gurgaon, so there is nothing left for Deendayal.  This builder floor stall plus 4 and this stall plus is hanging there, you know it has been more than a year and the market is growing so much and big projects are coming up 2400  2500 2800 3500 square feet 18000 19000 20000 21000 25000 or whatever thousand you know, it is a matter of how many crores, so what should a common man, who is middle class, understand and what should he take? This is a retirement home policy.  There are some things which are old but now action is starting to take place beyond this. Will you see it in the future? Understand this, the policy says that brother, you can build a society on a few acres of land, i.e. half a fort, i.e. half a fort, i.e. around 2420 yards, you can build a society on less than 2500 yards of land, its FR will be 2.25 and that which is one unit.  In this, you can withdraw up to 30 square meters. Now in affordable housing, you know there was a program for up to 60 square meters. In this, the lower limit was kept at Rs. 30, there was no cap on the rate.  If not, then this is not affordable housing, it can also be worth crores, then this will be a product through which a vacuum has been created in the market, a vacuum of Rs 1.5 CR has been created. Just now I am telling you all.  I would like to tell my viewers that the affordable housing societies will be priced from Rs 75 lakh to Rs 1 crore when they are sold, when the position is made and after a year, which society will be sold.  It is dependent on the location, builder quality and various other things, the price will range from 75 to lakh to 1 crore. Now those who had bought it for 25 to 30 lakh, it is a multibagger stock, so it will be between 75 to 1 crore. Depending on 3 BH is open, what is the size of 2 BH, so it has a cap on it, is it that much, now from where it ends, it will take over from there.  There will be some similar sizes, according to me, the density will be even higher but it will be on small land parcels, like even for affordable housing, the minimum land parcel required was 5 acres, if 5 acres was required then it can come on half an acre also.  If one and a half acres can be found, then these land parcels will also be utilized. Some Khichdi food can also be had. A 12 meter road is needed, the rate is very high just for this. Now we will discount the land again because somewhere there is land of one acre and somewhere there is land of one and a half. I was not able to understand what to do with it. Many people have it. Just think what is half an acre? What is a plot of 2000 yards and a plot of 500 yards? You understand that your society has become a yard plot and through this video now people will know that they are sitting on half and a quarter acre, somewhere in Gurgaon there is a 12 meter road on the left.  There are many places where there is a 12 meter road, where there is a 12 meter road and if this is the case, there will be a boom there, be mentally prepared, there is an opportunity too, but what will happen in it, we will provide car parking, this is the basic le deen deel high rise will come to you.  You can also think about this or affordable high rise affordable which is with club house and with car parking because what is affordable today and that is 75 lakh 1 crore.  So I told that if that will also be done, then we will make a good deal of what is inside it, we will make a good brochure, it will not be done through draw of lot, anyone can come and buy it anytime and we will just add some theta in it that it should be an elderly person because asking.  There is a hold on retirement homes, it is not that young people will not be able to buy, but you should have an elderly person in your family to show that something like this can happen in the coming time, so we will look forward to know when it is coming.  how are you coming  If there is a lot of happiness then the land parcels will be released because what will be the issues of fresh land parcels, there will be a separate video beyond that. Thank you very much."

    "title": "Godrej Group Split And Its Effect On Real Estate [1srtZMUMfAk].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, you must have got information about the split of Godrej Group, what is its impact on real estate, what is its impact on Godrej Properties, there will be a short discussion on it till today, if you remember, in 10, 20, 30 years, such a good thing has happened in any group. We have not seen the separation peacefully, we have seen it at many places, but with so much grace, this group has separated its verticals and handed it over to the next generation, Godrej Properties Pirojsha Godrej Ji.  The plus will be the same, there will be another benefit in that their sister firm, they have the land back of 3000 land acres in Vikhroli, they will also have the marketing rights of it in Mumbai and will take the management fee and this land will be theirs, if the project comes to them, there will be an additional benefit.  It will remain and you must have seen all this good news reflected in the share price. Look where the share price of Godrej Properties has gone in the last 510 days while this video is being made. 2800 Bookings have crossed the figure of 23000 crores last year. Sales bookings of Godrej Property have been done. And I am telling this video from the point of view of real estate, not according to the share market, which is the interview of Piroz Shah ji. In that he has talked about bookings worth Rs 30,000 crore, so there is a bansi in the real estate market, yes right now the election takes a little breather in June 4, as if it is breathing after that. Tukdo ji has been divided very amicably in a very good way. We should also learn in our family that those who have properties worth lakhs of crores i.e. businesses and are so much inter-winded, that is, there were listed firms as well as unlisted firms, how well they were divided. Even cousins ​​have been separated, this time after so many years, it means separation of only brothers is not a separate vertical, even cousins were evolved and if there is no issue then  It is a great learning for everyone, I hope you all will learn like this in your family too. In the comment section, you will find a Real Estate Info Webinar Group, you can join it, you can attend the webinars live. If you are not already connected, you are very tired."

    "title": "Godrej Nature Plus And Ashiana Anmol ｜ Know The Sohna Story [XsnmtB7_Zq4].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, now the position of Godrej Nature Plus is going to come, a lot of queries are coming in few months, so in this way I will keep telling about the projects whose queries will come, if you have it or are thinking of buying there, Sona's story too.  I will try to tell a little through this video. Like the video, share and subscribe the channel. And if yours is in Nature Plus and has already been purchased then please write and if it is in Godre SAT because it is the same project.  The towers which are coming in position are built first, this one is named Nature Plus, the other ones are d1 d2 c1 c2 b1, they are Serenity and the position of the other towers which is going to come soon is Nature Plus, so let's start. If you see the site layout of this project, it is rectangular, it is very good, there is central greens of 55 acres, so many projects come in these nowadays, its density is low, 60.  It is less than 55 56 There is some density Bang on Sona Road Beyond the expressway Bang on Delhi is only a minute or two away from the Mumbai Industrial Corridor The man reaches the Thak Thak flyover in Rajiv Chowk Do two Hindi films  Before the song ends i.e. in 910 minutes, GD Goenka is here, Kumar Mangalam University is here, the price is around 9250, I am saying that it should be less than 10000.  Not possible if you are here then if you are getting less than Rs 10000 then don't ask whether I will buy it or whether they will get registered at Rs 8. In the tehsil it is around Rs 7, it is fine, nowadays they say five to seven but at Rs 1.  And there is also the expense of water, I am giving a rough estimate, so to save their seven lakh rupees, they are giving the call that if the rate increases, I am getting so much money, then should I go out or my last  If I don't pay the installment money, take the premium and withdraw it, then the advice to you people who want to sell this project is that please do not do it because you cannot sell in this project and buy anywhere else in Gurgaon. Yes, at Rs. 20  You will be able to make money by selling this much but you will not be able to buy it and then it will not be sold for Rs 20 more from you and if you do not have further money then please do not get trapped because its target is 3 years.  It is close to Rs 13500 which is minimum 50 up from the current price, so in 3 years now after you have the position, the rent will also kick in which will make your rental lead minimum even if you are taking 2 BH, three whatever is at 4. You will get 45 and I am telling you that if there is an increase in it at 50 then if you do CAGR at 50 then it will come out to be 17 at 15.  It does not come out to be 17 17 51, it comes out to be close to 15, it comes out to be 15 there and four and a half here, so tell me where are you getting the returns of 20, there is no risk of any execution here, now there is no such risk when the same happens.  After this, there will be a risk whether it will be made or not. You have got it, why do you want to sell the thing which you have got, now there is another touching project in Sona, I will tell you about that also today. It is a very beautiful and good project in which we can buy it in resale, where people are living by becoming an assistant, the rest of their towers are being built, that is Ashiana, it is a priceless and absolutely competitive project, there will be a difference of Rs 19 and 20 in this.  When this Godrej one will be a little more premium and will be more than that but that project is also very good then its price may be 500 1000 00 feet difference in its price today and in the coming time, now if you feel like going there.  If you are living there, it is also ready to move in. You can buy it there also, but there is a request to the people who own the house that they should not sell it. This is your project of opportunity. It is a very open project. It is very good for children. It is low density. There is no time right now.  The story of selling gold is yet to be played out. No one is talking about it because there is no project to sell, hence it is not being mentioned. It is a simple thing. Why do you blame anyone for this? Why talk about those things now?  go watch this video  What is the benefit of making, what is there to sell, I am telling the seller not to sell, I am telling the buyer to buy it, if you can get it now, don't throw tantrums, anywhere in Gurgaon, things are sold as per super area, anywhere for four. If you are getting something in digits but less than Rs 10000 then pick it up because whatever is there for resale in the coming time, it is going to cost your pocket in the next six months.  If you will see the increase soon in the things that are going to be ready to move in, then it is possible. I have given the target of 3 years as Rs 13500. Why did I take Horizon 3 of Nature Plus because it will take three and a half years for Serenity to be completely completed and the entire project to be built?  It will take that much time, but it is possible that you will see the immediate jump of 1100 square feet only by this November, so if you understand the point of seven to eight lakhs in it. So it is only a matter of 100 square feet, if you have a 2BH of 1400 square feet, then the cost is the same, 1000 to 14 lakh, 500 to 7 lakh, so you absorb that to save that 7 lakh. Don't sell things out of greed is the message and similarly the other projects which are coming up, which are your projects, what information do you want about them please. Write in the comment section and I want to tell you one more thing, I had just told about the time limit of two hours, I had told about something but now maybe who watches such a long video of two hours or what was told in 40 minutes.  If you have n't seen it then it was great to watch, it has got a lot of views, a lot of people have joined it, it has got a lot of likes, it has uploaded that video recently on Sunday, okay watch it on 23rd June, you will get a lot of it on the channel.  There are insights in this I want to tell you a secret which will not remain a secret even if I tell it now, that is that I tell you two or four things in Sona. One, if you read it and check the master layout here in the comparison of Open Spaces Gurgaon.  There are a lot of public spaces, the government's open spaces have a better layout, but right now we don't get to think about it because now when we talk about gold, we only see the road and when we see the road, we say gold, then we  Do we say that if you buy it in gold then gold is nothing. It is a matter of 10 minutes from Rajiv Chowk. When we go to New Gurgaon from Rajiv Shock, it takes us 20 minutes to reach anywhere from Khirdi Daula and in those locations 93 95 Look at how much goods are being sold and according to that, if I consider Rajiv Chowk as the center and Nav Center of Gurgaon, then you can reach there in 10 minutes, but whenever I talk about this area, what do you think? Central Park comes to mind, then Ashiana Anmol comes Aldeco's project, now Godrej is about to come, then you understand the plots of ROF, Signature's low rises and Kumar Mangalam University comes GD Goenka University.  The bus comes to an end, ahead of it comes the tehsil square, there is only one square and we go here to the bus stand where she is the wife, so that's all yours, but now you don't know that there will be a lot of space behind here, big arrangement.  Where will those sectors be cut, sector four, sector five and that, you see the layout of it all, look at those roads where affordable housing is available, some are of GS, some are of some more, some more plots are being cut, I will not talk about many of their plots.  If there are RERA and its issues, I will not go into them in detail but in general, the product projects I cover, the issue arises that the Central Park has become very expensive. You know, now a road has to be built from the Central Park, which is a project of Godrej.  is central  There is a park and you can reach the meaning of everything. You will have to do some research. No, Guruji, you yourself show it. All the other people or all the rest who show drone shots, will they ever show the useful thing like gold? These are the suits that are made.  Why would you tell these secret things? If any user brother is watching this, then brother, you have great technology, what I am saying is, make a video on this, teach people well, master ji, we are guruji, we will not be able to do the work of master ji, ok.  If there is then a road will be built which will be golf  The course will go for extension, it looks ready made to you, it is not aligned like clay and what else it is, there has to be some acquisition in it and then it has to be built, but there is no hurry in it because if it is built then it will be 22000 23000 224000  On golf course extension, things are being built and launched. If you know the names of 20000 21 projects then their scene will be like this, if you take this here then here.  They have to grow by showing such smoothness to those people over there that the goods are being sold at a very expensive price. Which is okay? Why should I say? I should say that this should become Rs 1 crore per square feet. I am speaking very powerfully, but I don't like it.  I am not interested in doing this, I am interested in telling you the story of this place, this something is smooth, okay and these things are built on this smooth road, Golf Course, now if I connect with this road from here and I get this toll  If I don't have to come by train and it takes time for me to go through this road and to Vatika Chowk and take a right turn from there, then I will reach here in six to seven minutes, which currently takes me 18, 20, 22, 24 minutes.  This will reduce the time of 12, 14, 15 minutes, will not interfere with traffic, will not have to be paid in toll tax, so suddenly with the construction of this thing, the rate will increase here. Brother, I don't know in how many years will this thing be available.  It will happen in two, it will happen in three, it will happen in four, I ca n't say, it is the work of the government, the public will create an uproar, if you share the video, it will be built, but right now, because many people have to acquire the land, the builders have, so if this road is built first, then  If the farmer or any local person is sitting with the land, the rate of his fort has tripled, then this is why it is not being done, it is possible that this may not be done even in the next 4 years, but when all that  someone big  The player will take it, then the road will be built, then the rate will increase, then I have told you this. Okay, so if you are taking it then keep sitting, if you have a view of five to seven years, then you will get very good returns. I want to tell you this.  And if the person who is watching the video has not bought but wants to buy then buy, nothing can be wrong. The targets I have told are there and even after that you will get it because these are the trigger points wherever there is an increase in connectivity.  he grows And it is going to increase, what you see in the sectors of 63a, the road ends as you go ahead, you will reach here by Google 2 road, we do not know that there can be more connectivity and a lot of industry will already come here in Sona.  IMT etc. will come and big players will also come and inside Sona, these are also visible from the office suite on Sona Road and if anything happens to this safari jungle safari, there are a lot of rumors only.  But if something happens to the government, because the land is not to be acquired, it is such an open area, if someone takes it towards jungle safari, then that story will also play out well, but generally there is open work there. Meaning, if you are in a flat, then like I have seen some videos, some were sent by someone, I don't know, if I am there, then I will integrate it, look around, it seems like it is open, the view comes, Pahari Puri looks like this.  feels like Hey, it is a nice place, that means it is not seen in Gurgaon right now, here one can only see high rises after high rises, it looks like this from far and wide, the cost of living there will also be relatively less in future.  The ecosystem of Made and Weds and the way of living and movement of people should also be relatively fine and the value at the price point is high, the big thing is that if you say no, it should be better than Golf Course Road.  So, I am not claiming that it is better than 111 112 13 14 Dwarka Express, it is better than Delhi. I am not claiming at all, I am just saying that it is value for money.  You have taken up this project, this project is also very value for money, your Godrej Nature Plus is very good, there will be open area in it, 1500 trees will come out, these people are going to plant all around and only then the name is Nature Plus.  And if all this has been maintained, it will be very good, let it be built, such clean land parcels of 18 acres are not available these days and there is so much open work, because if we check according to today's rules which the government has made in FR.  If rules have been made, here more than double flats are being built, two and a half times more flats are being built than double, and it will be like this in future, so hold on to these things, don't go by selling them, there is bound to be an increase in them.  It may be too much, but whatever I am telling you is appropriate because your rental aid will kick in immediately, you will get income tax rebate because the property is positioned at interest rate and then your capital appreciation. I have targeted for 3 years. Given that this is a target of 3 years, it may be achieved in one and a half years and then the rates may not increase much for another year and a half, this is the last one year.  I ca n't tell the exact date when this thing is going to happen, but I feel that after the position, when there is excitement, people start staying, get wood work done, gradually take the position for a year, society.  I think you should hold the time for a year because once you have got the registration done, the decision making is now here whether to register or not because once you have got it done, then hold on to it, then why such a hurry?  It is being sold that it has been registered today, I will sell it in three months, I would have sold it first because it does not cost you, the buyer would also be happy that he has incurred the cost, meaning he would have had to get the registration done, but you would have got the benefit, okay, so I hope this.  Like and share the type of videos you like and subscribe to the channel. And these yellow and blue videos of mine may not be around for long because my m is actually very marketable.  It is not my intention to influence. Here, I have to give more information to those who are related to me and those who have bought it, because if I make something here, then the same thing will happen again, it will not take long, you are trying to sell it here, you are the rate of it.  Wanting to increase, I am telling the buyer that he is getting it for this much, take it, it is value for money and I am telling the seller, don't be foolish, don't sell, both the advices are so confusing.  He will understand that there is benefit in selling it, there is benefit in buying it and if someone has to sell under compulsion, then take yours, how many deals you get by bargaining, that is your one on one, which is the rate of one discussion.  This is going on where deals have been made for people and the rate is Rs 9250, but looking at today's market I am saying, brother, it is definitely Rs 0000, it is in Rs 10, so where is any new thing ready to move coming?  If you are coming somewhere then please tell me where exactly the position has been. Now I have always been guiding my subscribers and that prediction has always been correct. Now my prediction is that it is ready to move or ready to move. You will see a lot of increase in the number of products coming to you because the demand is very high and there is no supply. I am telling you this, you will come to know yourself, now that focus was here, wasn't it? 18  20000 22000 sold out in one day, in four days the focus of the entire market was here, now I am telling the market will go here, now in general people should consider the whole market as one, Gurgaon market is doing very well, oh yes, it was doing good brother.  These rates are still there, even today the market is full, isn't it? In the stock market, if 20 large cap stocks are rising and the rest of the market is cold, then you can say something like this.  The whole market is doing well, it always happens like this in the market, sometimes the banks will run away, sometimes the big companies will run away, the large caps will run away, sometimes the mid caps will come, sometimes the small caps will go crazy, then the whole market will go up, then the whole will correct, then the whole  It will go up slowly and then gradually also the leaders will emerge that these people will do better and we as investors always feel this, the same story plays out in real estate but it happens very slowly and is not visible so quickly.  There  We are not able to see the pattern but we are seeing this pattern that now suddenly people will be like, I want a house, I do not want execution risk, I have money, take this and give me a house, I will start living, if my rent will not go then which is now?  You are sitting on rent or live on your own or take rent and do not sell it because it will become very difficult to execute these flats in the future and now there is a warning and also a device that such builders will come who are not able to build now.  Neither do I want to get into trouble with anyone by taking his name, nor do I want to enter into that trap. Okay, but I am just saying that you should see, now the matter will be like this because in six-seven years they will make it at a lower rate and at a higher rate.  It is true that if you give a higher rate to you, it may be profitable or not, but the thing will be made because it is worth it, because when a builder makes goods in seven years, when he buys from you on the first day, he does all the catering.  This much cement will be used, this much labor will be required.  So much will be done that they put it all as their own and yet one walks away with his own profit, so today we feel that we are being taken very expensive. We do not care that our money will be gone in six to seven years. I am repeating the word seven again and again. I am using the year now, just get ready mentally, no position will be available before the year, full position of the project and now all these projects which have been sold one by one in one lump sum, are going to be sold in one lump sum.  The handover of the projects will also come in a similar manner, they were sold slowly, first phase one happened and then it got a bit past, so it is bound to take so much time. Does anyone have any doubt? No, not in seven, but in five because seven years is enough.  Actually four and half years only because brother, at some percentage of 25-30, construction does not happen, go to the last year in November, December, January, the Supreme Court did not allow construction to happen again in the rains.  Issues happen, then there are labor issues on Diwali, Chhat Puja labor goes away, we have to struggle a lot and so much construction has started, not enough labor force has come, skid labor force has not come, if today  If you want to build your own house, then do you think that when the car or truck used to run, there was a cleaner, he used to clean his hands in between, the master used to get all these things done on the road in between. Now they are building houses because all the masters have gone to the builders, all the good mason technicians have been absorbed, all the good mason technicians have gone to them because the work here is regular, the money is big, it is regular and looks tall, he is the one.  It is difficult to work with the owner, so now he is trying to build a house in your house, he will learn from you, Chhotu, it is okay to install it there at your cost, the condition of the plumber is the same, the electrician is the same. Any plumber, electrician, carpenter or painter who is of any level has got attached with them, now the rest of the tile installers, stonemasons, etc., now you will have to struggle and it will become difficult to build your own house in the future, there are no builders on that.  Sometimes I will make a good video on Phenomena and sometimes again. I have started a real estate mentoring program of mine. Right now there is only one class for it. If you want to join that course also, then join it. You can do so by giving the details given below.  Rump on number WhatsApp2 will be available to learn. Take advantage of the learning that is not being taught anywhere. You can also become a consultant. You can earn money directly and indirectly from real estate because real estate is worth 330 billion dollars, it will not touch trillion dollars again. Within 2030, there is a lot of growth here and there is no talent, there is no knowledge because there is no entry barrier, there is no IIT IM exam to come here.  Have to give NEET exam, don't give the papers which get leaked like do n't do anything here, anybody can do less since anybody can do less, the quality is not that much, if you improve a little quality then you will do very well, there are many people who are real. Those who work in the estate are also joining. You all are also joining. Those who want actual knowledge should join. You will get to learn a lot of insights and understanding. You do not speak as if many people are coming here.  We are coming there only, you will get techniques, you will get to learn many things, so please join that course, thank you very much."

    "title": "Gold Membership Details And Benefits Explained [xqb-GoQNRlQ].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, I want to tell you the details of the golden membership of the channel, what will be the benefit for you, there is only one golden membership in the channel which you can take, the immediate benefit will be that I conduct real estate workshops once a month, three  There are four very interesting topics when I teach real estate, so that workshop is of 777, so you will get complimentary access to it. One will be one but it can be one or two, it can be more.  But one thing is that if there are more, then there are more benefits. Secondly, whenever you join, you will get access to all the old videos, so it is not that there is only one old video recording, even if you are not there, you will be able to watch it.  So you will get the recording, this is one advantage for you, the second advantage is that you will be the witness of 100 crore property transactions in your life if your age is less than 30 35 years, in the next 40 years even if you are 40 years old.  If you have, then in the next 40 years, in 80 years, there will be 100 witnesses. You will think, what nonsense is he saying, just take a look at me, you will understand that if your ₹ lakh is in the bank and is in D-mat, then you can do trading worth 10 crores. Trading is your father 's inheritance, father's is grandfather's, your brother-in-law is taking something, your brother is taking something, sister is taking something, brother-in-law is taking, you yourself are taking, father is taking in- laws.  Those who are taking it, you are becoming a witness of the transaction, so if you are intelligent in that witness, then its value in your house would increase that this one Ravi uncle ji, Ashok uncle ji is ok, some uncle ji, some sister in law, whatever your relations.  You will seem like the most intelligent person in the world. Take advice from them. In this, the man feels very good that he knows everything. No one teaches real estate like I teach 360 degrees.  If you have perspective then you will sound intelligent in the world. Take the third practice and you will understand about property for yourself, which property should I buy, when should I buy it, when should I sell it, which one should I not buy, which one should I not get trapped in, this will be beneficial. Fourth, you will come to review projects, I will start live webinars every month, opportunities come in real estate in Gurgaon, Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Kolkata, Pune and to some extent in Mumbai in these cities.  I will cover and I will also cover small parts of Haryana, then you will be able to understand the project by watching it in live time. If any live opportunity comes in the Rs 15-2 lakh segment or in the Rs 510 crore segment, it will be covered live for you, first of all for you.  If you have some queries related to that project only, then they will be told. Don't think about consultation. My consultation fee is 30 times your membership is even more than that. 33 p 35  Times, so do n't get confused with him, he is very high, he is one on one different, don't get confused with him, Apna is fine, the point here is that if you remain in the membership for 6 to 10 months, then you will get one next benefit which I want to tell you.  You can become a consultant yourself. Even if you want to work in real estate, membership will help you a lot because it will help you understand real estate that well is inside your body. In Kosi University, they do not teach anywhere in any college, some random articles come, every article has an agenda, there is no clear and confusing information, some will say that this city is good, some will say that flat is good, some will say that plot is good, some will say that it is commercial.  It is good, no one will say, commercial mall is not good, SEO plot is good, no one will say, it is good in this city, no one will say, it is good there, no one will say, this is my experience only.  There will be confusion in a structured way in 2023, as I am making a video right now, what is to happen in May and in the future, what are the trends, what are the changes, how is life happening, I have to tell because investment is forward looking, it is not backward looking in 2004.  What happened in real estate and who made money from it is not going to work in 2023 because now children are coming into the market and are coming into jobs.  The economy that is going on is completely different from what it was 20 years back, so we will understand every type of product, you can attend webinars, workshops, you can attend, whoever takes membership, gold membership, you can join the below given whatsapp.app groups.  Which will be of Gold Members so that I can provide the ethics on it and at a close level and I can send the things quickly because sometimes an opportunity comes within half an hour.  If it comes on a notice of two hours, then it cannot be told four days in advance, then even that very handy thing has not come for that, if something has come somewhere and had to be shared, then beyond that the information comes quickly because  This route takes some time, okay, so please join, it will be a small investment which will give you very long lasting benefits and whoever joins can connect, thank you very much which is not visible.  Other wise, you have to take it from join button only, your payment will be done through Visa card and some people also do it through jeepney."

    "title": "Gurgaon Mein Itni Mehengi Property Kharid Kaun Raha Hai ？ [OPfVFRewRBc].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, there is a disbelief among many people in Gurgaon real estate that who is buying this means that the news comes in the newspaper, it is sold, it is sold there too, so many are sold, who is this before, who is this before, I would like to analyze this psychology. Why is there a feeling of irritation in this? People are earning ₹ 4 lakh a month in Gurgaon, that is like a very good amount. ₹ 4 lakh a month.  This is a very high amount, if even husband is earning 2 lakhs, wife is earning 1 and half lakhs then it becomes 35 lakhs or two more 2 lakhs become 4 lakhs or if someone is earning three and a half lakhs then that person is also earning 3.35 lakhs. Even a person earning Rs 4 lakh cannot buy these flats that are coming up in Gurgaon because brothers and sisters, if you take a loan of Rs 3 crore then it will be Rs 5 lakh.  If the EMI goes away then how will we survive? 35 lakhs will be taxed and if the rest goes away then it doesn't make sense that even those with 3.5 lakhs and 4 lakhs are not able to buy it, then a question comes up a lot which many people write.  That when there are not so many people with this much income and we could not buy those with less or that much, then who is buying, then it is a matter of pain. Let us analyze psychology. Those who are suffering from this.  If there is situation and disbelief, then please type DP. DP means D is for disbelief, what is happening brother and P means pain or both are emotions, most like, both are fine. Whoever has this is pain too, if there is anger too, then DP.  If you write down then what is there in it that you studied somewhere, you were very good in studies, you took exams in life, passed exams, went to a good college, got placements, got good salary.  You found a good girl, you also found a good worker, you found lovely parents too, your praises are sung in your family, that Rohit bhaiya works in Gurgaon, he had gone from Haldwani, he had done engineering from there. And that Neha Bhabhi is ours here, she also works, but even when Rohit and Neha Bhabhi are not able to buy a house flat together, they feel disbelief, they do not have the realization that Rohit and Neha have the same eco system.  He is the king, he considers himself an ecosystem and there is much more, do you think that in the merit list of the rich, it is your progress in the merit list that India is progressing, the families which are one generation behind you, one generation behind or say?  Say further, meaning the previous generation, for example, whatever you achieved, the family whose father and mother achieved it 25 years ago, are buying it. Things are being bought in the right way in Gurgaon. You need five things to buy a property in Gurgaon, which is now available: 4, 5, 6 Cr. Support of father, mother, own good job, wife 's job and support, small blessings from mother-in-law and father-in-law.  And your accumulated wealth which you have earned after earning for 510 years, your mutual fund and all this and a loan, your loan, these five things, when your fist is made then the property comes which is sitting with only these three things.  He is not able to buy these five and one sixth also, I told him that these five or six things are good salary, good wife's salary, father's support, father-in- law's support, I have given these as down payment on Rs. 510, I will take a little loan, a little something, you have given Rs. 510.  Years ago I had bought a property somewhere in a small city or a small plot, I will dispose of that too. Now you cannot buy anything in Gurgaon without settling the property. You cannot buy it without the support of these four or five things, but these five things. In the lives of many people, children with a salary of Rs 1.5 lakh are buying property in Gurgaon comfortably for three to four rupees, but they are not buying it on their own, then those who have a salary of Rs 4 lakh, they look at it like this, you have it, where can I get it?  I have a father, those were the people from the wall picture, I have a mother, what car do you have? Baba, I have a balance, I have a bungalow, I have a car, I have a father, the one who has a rich father is buying, the children of rich fathers are buying, how many rich fathers they have.  a lot is a lot  Yes, it means that the father gives the money. Yes, there are many givers. There are many who give during their lifetime because those who have come from a typical middle class feel that they have achieved everything but father does not have money.  If money is not received then it is not bought from you because it is old money, it is accumulated wealth which is wealth due to increase in assets. Even today, by selling any builder floor in Delhi, 200 yards of land anywhere in Rajendra Nagar is as decent as your Karol Bagh, Punjabi Bagh. You get to buy things by selling something, especially when the child's salary is covered by the loan and the initial down payment is made. Some of them are available in this color and then in another color. Today,  Those colors are not visible to me, maybe it is this one and this one, so by mismatching it, they are coming and taking families and those who are just thinking that no, how can this be possible, then Delhi is very big, it definitely belongs to NRIs.  program which is NRI is doing well but NRI is at 15 20 25. What is the story of 7580? So the normal common man is not able to take the pensioner right now but you do not need to worry, in the coming time I may have made a video earlier as well.  If you would have seen, there will be something for the middle class also, again one and a half, why now these four, five, six CR are also middle class, hi how, how can middle class.  Buy four CR's Hey brother, he is middle class by cash flow wise, he is rich by asset. You can be middle class by cash flow wise, you want metro but you are sitting in asset. If you sell the asset, you become rich and then you are buying.  So you understand middle class with middle class values buying assets for 45c by booking them and not paying the amount in the same time and selling their things taking the  Support of father, mother, your own or your wife's, so this is the Gurgaon story for you, so if you are missing it, then it is okay, there are many other cities in the world, it is still fine, so give a status in the comment section. A whatsapp.in India just because of your Gurgaon story, your budget itself brother is of 60 70 80 90 lakhs which is the budget of many people and it is a very sweet.  Budget anything between 70 to 95 lakh is a very very sweet budget for middle class working couples. Okay brother, you can buy this thing on your own, you do not need much help from anyone, so these properties are also and hedging.  It may be that what is meant by hedging is that you live somewhere on rent and you keep moving from one place to another, so if you buy something in one city, then if you stay in that city.  So you will live in it and even if you don't live there, you will get its rent. If you pay rent in this city, if you get rent from that city, it will be slightly subsidized. This is indirectly way of owning property. You have a long life to go ahead professional life 30  If you are 25-30 years old then you have 30-35 years left then you will go somewhere, finally when you  If your assets are settled somewhere then it is not necessary that you grow them. Brother, if three CR is not being taken, four CR is not being taken. If mother and father do not have money or if they do not give, then this is the reason.  It does not mean that you will not buy anything worth lakhs for 60, 70, 80 years or else I will stay here all the time or if I want this one then you can explore other big good cities and there is a person like me here.  Is getting options for you, so come join and understand, thank you very much, subscribe to the channel and comment on the groups posted in the comment section because all the information is on a daily basis, there is pan India, no city is on top.  Whatever is left in it, whatever you understand, whatever suits your budget, whatever you like, whatever suits your budget, you can buy it because those things are also becoming expensive. I believe that Top India  In the next five months, nothing worth less than Rs. 1 crore will be available in the seven cities of India. Just like nothing is available in Gurgaon, if any of these things are available in Gurgaon, please tell me. In the fresh launch, it is not available even at one and a half, it is not available even below that, it is not available here either, so at least get hold of it somewhere, it is something like a gold set of 10 tola, I am not able to understand, it is not being bought.  If you don't have money then take it for four tolas. If gold as an asset class is doing well then take four. If you don't like it, I also know it's worth Rs. 10 but take it for four because today the budget is four tolas, so four.  Just take away the burden by taking four, then if you get another chance later, see, life will go ahead, but if you did not take it and that asset class increased too much, then you did not take anything, then you just remained sitting and a  If you take it like astrology  I teach that the fourth house gets activated. It is okay as soon as the property is bought, the fourth house is also the house of happiness. If there is a house of property, then the fourth house is the center place of the horoscope by taking property. If you buy it then you will get as much as you can in the budget.  You can join, thank you very much"

    "content": "[Music] Hello friends, I make a video once every year and last year I was feeling that I might not have to make a video again but if I get a chance, I have to make it. This video is again about Gurgaon Metro. Okay, so what you did about me. I have been following for many years. I have been telling this for four-five years that metro will not come in Gurgaon, it is okay, I think so, do I want it to come, do I want it not to come, it is a simple thing. Neither Gurugram works because of my wishes nor anything else. If only my own house works because of my wishes, I will be very happy. Okay, so I have no misunderstanding on that, but what I wanted to bring to the notice of.  All the investors and all the people who live in Gurgaon all the people who want to live in Gurgaon and all the people who are investing in Gurgaon are all I am addressing those who want to invest in Gurgaon and I have always said before that there is some or the other invisible force which does not want to invest here and I am saying that the region for growth in real estate of Gurgaon is very big.  This is because the people of Delhi have more requirement of metro inside Gurgaon, the people of Gurgaon do not have it. Come, Gurgaon should become very big, population should be 50 lakhs, it should be here in 10 years. Yes, it will be done by then, maybe it will come by then, but now again the issues of alignment will go from here to RRTS. There will be change in what I am trying to do. Metro is not being built on paper. Now who is this now?  If people talk beyond this then it will become political. This is a political channel. My Guruji from Gurugram joins it. Here I will talk only as an investor. Okay, as someone who is real estate very well and what happens next.  If I talk according to that then I am not coming Datchi, that is happening now, you will see the upcoming projects, the office below or the office next door and the house there, then you come, why do you have to come from Delhi, you have to come from Pritampura every day with your Narayana or from anywhere. Why do you have to come from any corner of Delhi i.e. Rohini to Gurgaon? Why do you need metro to go up and down everyday? Gurgaon people will give you metro here, then why will you Delhi people come here? That's why it feels good to talk about metro.  That's why there is talk of metro, now soil testing has been done every six months, now this has happened, now this route changes again, then some changes like this, then let's know whether there is a government change or I don't know, then it becomes political.  If you give then only change happens, till now I used to troll me every time. Look, we are like this. Brother, listen, I tell myself so openly and there is such a half percent that some people feel arrogance and other wise people.  It seems cutely arrogant and not arrogant, I will tell you that you will cheat, you will also adopt your own cards, the metro will come, you will eat its bread, the metro will come, the metro will come, the property will increase, the metro will come, let me tell you the reason why the metro did not come.  I give it because wherever the metro goes, there is a poverty class which means that it will not rise above it because now the person traveling in the metro does not earn Rs 10 lakh, but the person who earns Rs 10 lakh per month is not sure.  I go to a man, don't argue, very rich people do not travel in the metro, the big thing is that when the metro does not come, a gentry starts coming there on its own and it becomes a rich boys club, I am the first person who started traveling in the rich boys.  Club Rich Boy Club Rich Boy Club is nothing but your four wall quote, this rate is so high, there is no justification where flats worth Rs 100 crores are being sold, the flats are hanging in the air, how can you justify, it is just like this  A walled man said that this is a builder, it is 100 crores to enter here, just all those kind of people have come, now since those kind of people have come, then its value has increased further, first 50, then 60, then 70, then 100, so if Middle of Nowhere.  Also, if someone makes all the film stars in Rajasthan, now we saw this kind of crowd in Anant Ambani ji's wedding, all this crowd stayed in one place and said, yes here, like Dubai too.  This is how Dubai has been maintained. If you want a video on real estate, please write in the comment section. What you have to understand is that Metro is not coming any time in the future. Even if Abi Raazi Khushi starts being built, it will take time to be built.  It also takes three to four years but I am saying this, Raji Khushi, nothing is visible anywhere now and 2024 is also more than half gone and still their alignment is not being set that it will never happen.  RRTS is sometimes here, sometimes it will go there, sometimes it will go there. Haryana Government has given it here, it should not be there, it should not be there, don't discuss it, think beyond what is happening, it should be there, only then there will be some public transport in any city. But Gurgaon has been rejecting its public transport, GMDA etc. did not run buses etc., the system is different here because the region, when I checked it and I told you.  Reasoning: Watch the video carefully. Look at the thought process level. You see a boy and a girl who work in a corporate in Gurgaon and a power dresser. Girls wear heels. Boys also wear certain types of clothes. They travel in public transport. They do not have the same sanity because public transport will not take you to the basement of the office from where you will take the lift and reach there with your knock knock knock. You can imagine that your body will smell that much.  Like you, I do a lot of things, so I approach real estate from a different dimension. No one makes videos, thinks, or approaches like me, so I consider myself the number one clarity giver. I have another course going on, Real  There is a course in estate mentoring program, it is a good, quite expensive course, it is not cheap, if you want to understand real estate at that deep level, then you can join Rump, I am fine and some of the recordings will be good to join live also because the query  There are a lot of sessions so understand that a boy or a girl comes wearing some clothes which will get spoiled if he goes in public transport. People are very conscious of this kind of image because here it is not labor class as much as anywhere else.  All the big wants to reach a reach office are coming in a particular way so that it looks like that, but because of this there is no demand, I will just tell the people who are making metro. Do a good survey, I do n't see any demand coming in Gurgaon, air pod taxis and things like this will definitely work here, which is very futuristic, Nitin Gadkari ji keeps talking and that for short distance, 3 kms.  4 kilometers more and Gurgaon will work very well, I am saying that Gurgaon has brought that direct technology from Delhi to Gurgaon, now there is no need to do anything else, according to me if  We have to make Gurgaon separately. Global city is coming in Sector 36 side, which is being said on the lines of Singapore, city within city and all these, there should be all these frills there, that same ray means this travel means trouble travel anywhere.  Doing too much in any city or coming from outside the city, means garbage problem, there is a lot of traffic due to these things because the people of Delhi who work a lot, still I think it is wrong to make a rough estimate, it is not wrong.  It would be that every day one and a half lakh people come from Delhi to work in Gurgaon. What is your estimate? Because no scientific survey has been done on this, these one and a half lakh people can live comfortably in Gurgaon and can live on rent.  Or you can buy it or tell your father and mother, then why travel every day in a clutch car? I am saying this because you probably don't want to use public transport, it is not available.  And the alignment is not made at all, you have to come from Delhi, ideally you should have made it from the front of Tos, it is not made on the metro, it is made from somewhere else, Arjungarh and it is not known from where Dronacharya stay, that is a different alignment.  How will you come from there, you will not want to come so much to Rajiv Chowk and you are talking about Dwarka Expressway, it will be built, brother, I had raised the question on Dwarka Expressway earlier also and it was a logical question that  If Dwarka Expressway has been built with Rs. 12000 crores, then will the government collect its toll tax? If the metro is built there quickly, then everyone will travel there. If everyone will travel there, then how will the people of Delhi stay ahead in Gurgaon?  The office space that will come up now on Dwarka Expressway, in the next three to four years, you will see a ruckus, it is better if the people working there stay there, everything is being built there and  You have to live in an ecosystem. The concept of walk to work should be started. The concept of cycle to work should be started. According to me, if I want my personal wish, I can keep it. Whether it is fulfilled or not is a different matter. My personal wish and wish will remain the same.  That metro in Gurgaon, I had told earlier also on recording that many people troll it, it is very good because if you think the way you think then there is no problem in doing it that way, if you do then no one will do it.  There is no problem, it is ok, but according to what I am saying, he said, I always give an example again and again, if a metro station is built in front of Shahrukh Khan's Mannat, then his property value will be reduced. Let me give you an extreme example. I am very good, it is very good, the metro station coming there means a kind of poverty and rush coming and it becoming a common area. Yes, for the common man, my heart does not beat for you. For whom does my heart beat?  It beats, where will the investment go, where will the money go and what is the logic, if my heart beats, it does not mean that for Asian Paint, the share of Indigo Paint will not increase. My heart beats, nothing happens, my heart is okay, my my heart is okay.  If you beat for Kajariya Saram, even Sumani's lion can increase. Nothing is done by beating of heart, it happens to whom and what happens to whom. Here you have to watch Edge as an Investor without emotions, this is the requirement.  There is a lot of traveling to go out every day and there should be something, very poor people have a requirement to go, rich people do not have this, rich people will go when they have to go, now we saw Anant Ambani ji's wedding, it was Mukesh ji.  Had opened an auto expo, it seemed like a car expo is going on, this Maybach Rg, which one is your B.Ed. Okay, so these are very minute and practical things which I also teach, okay after telling.  So it seems very practical, but no one thinks of real estate in this way, so right now I am watching this metro story, the story is fine and this metro has come and gone, the decision of many Delhiites is still pending, elder father says, hey.  Metro will come and go instead of sitting, if there was an accelerator then now more metro has come, I want to tell this to the people of Delhi, I do not think that it will come. Yes, for six months, we will keep telling stories every month. How many years have passed, how many years have passed, now that next one.  which opposition  They are saying that we will make it till Manesar, we will do it, yes make it, we will also wait for you, if you are in power then it is okay to make it till the moon, it is okay to make the metro, if it will not come then I am saying.  If the rates are increasing then will the rates decrease with the arrival of Metro? No, it will not decrease. Then with the arrival of Metro, the rates will increase. Look, the rates have to be increased, it is okay to increase them by making any suggestion, I just say it out of the blue, it is okay, many people feel like this.  No, it's the project that makes the difference.  If you catch a good thing and explain it logically, then the rates increase and if you do popular vote for the things, then what I have explained comes out, then the metro will come, then no one can stop it, like if it is raining, then how will you stop it?  But the fact is that its planning was not completed on paper itself, it got sanctioned, the tender was issued, the tender was made, every time I came, people used to troll me, then I get a chance. I  Then I believe that for the benefit of the general public, if they think in this way that I may not get a chance to make this video again, normally I make a video every six months to a year, that brother, we do n't feel that the metro is coming.  And this metro is not coming, that is why we are seeing the rates increasing. What do you have to say on this? Please tell me, in the places where the metro will not go, the rates will increase more. Remember, no, but that one is a bit difficult to understand if it is a luxury project.  Affordable housing and premium projects  Whoever comes to the market, yes, it will increase there, it is not an easy thing, it is not a one line, the rates increase with the arrival of metro, the rates increase with the arrival of airport, these come, it is not like this, it is a one line, the rates of Gurgaon have increased due to the arrival of airport, hey, it is an airport. Gurgaon has been in Delhi for 80 years, no one even asked about it. No, brothers and sisters, subscribe to the channel. Info webinar group will be available on the comment section. If you have not already joined, then go to it. Because there all these things will be explained in a better way and will be explained in a soothing manner because here you cannot ask me questions, you will feel like I asked this but someone should answer my question, there the answer to the question will also be given in the webinar, ask me something.  Also, how do you feel that your belief system will be shaken a bit regarding the real estate that is yours, how it increases, how it is shown, how it actually increases, then it is a game, then I am still very, I am not, it will sound sadistic, I am very  Satisfied that the metro is still not coming, till the time the metro comes, the people of Delhi will buy the house, after that there is no incentive, after that the father will not sell his house in flat floor Delhi, he will ask to shift something for his child. Now the metro has come, which one should you drive to go, if you reach in 00 then this thing is the biggest thing, you agree with it, this is a theory and thesis, it is a theory of thesis as they say Khayali.  Pulao, but do you agree with this? Yes, it seems so to me, keep your desires away, no, what you want is a different matter, if you come, you want, there are so many things that you do n't know what will happen, okay, but what is happening.  And what effect is it having on us when we are detached from emotions and when we analyze or analyze, still the analysis is correct. You tell me do you agree with this then type agree if.  If you disagree then type disagreement, please write A if complete agree is not written or write D if disagree is not written so that I can also know so that I can also know yes that was the theory, nothing disagrees with you, no one disagrees.  If everyone disagrees then I can't be alone Shana because any theory to work out in larger thing many people should agree with it so like subscribe the channel Thank you very much i"

    "title": "Gurgaon Real Estate Market Is In  Bull Run ｜ Understand And Know [OjInEameKCE].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, since a few days ago, the videos of some YouTubers are being posted, the market is slow right now, Gurgaon market is slow, it is you know saying like Hussein Bolt has come down from 9.79 to 9.9 seconds and it has slowed down, it is not 90 seconds, brother, that point is of something.  So now this is the breaking news for you guys brothers and sisters a project is sold out in fc ars of course already checked you guys know what the system is they are collected but it is completely sold out which project is it about  We will discuss the studio apartments of Godre Zenith. Only 130 apartments came and close to double of that many people did not get it. If you have got it, then write in the comment section that yes, I have got it. Listen carefully and many who did not get it,  Write it down, let's discuss it further. Now you will say friend this stuff gets sold, yes the stuff gets sold, no one does anything about it, everybody tells stories about it or people will tell stories that don't buy this society, it is useless.  You should never do this Because it has been bought by someone, late people discover some useless thing, no useless thing, I came and told them that elections are coming, but whose good do you want to do, you have to do good for yourself and your followers, that's all, everyone should be like this, okay then  Let's start with Godre Zenith, I had bought it from my side, I had cleaned and told you guys about this project but the good news is that they have given it much below the rate that was told, there was a discount of ₹ 100 even on the last day, you should understand that  If you get something below 1.5 CR, then the smaller one would probably go for Rs. 1.25 crore, so if the rate for all inclusive 000 feet was quoted, according to me the legitimate rate was 000, which is my calculation, which is my calculation, the payment plan is like 20 to five  And those who were offering fully loaded, they were getting first of their studio apartments, they were not very sure of the price, now I am telling you earlier, it would have been wrong, I would have kicked the public in the stomach  If it had fallen, then now I am telling the builder that you gave a cheap base, now it is not your fault or the builder's because this was your first product, if it was DLF, it would have been different or if it was Central Park or these brands, then they would have sold it for less than Rs. 26,000.  I did not want to sell this thing, it was an opportunity because it is one of the rare products which is 150 meters away on the road and what mistakes people have made in it, they just kept thinking and love is love  It's done, no, the goods got sold, okay, we kept thinking and the goods got sold, so the people who took the leap that yes, they want the thing and in that, many people in small things, they become like this, oh I am not able to find car parking, oh this  This is done on car parking, understand the concept here, brothers and sisters, the person who will stay here will pay rent of Rs. 1000 per day after 5 years from today, even today Rs. 1000 is not much rent in hotels, if you go today, I am talking about five star hotels  I am not doing it, go to a normal four star or  It is a little better than three, okay, go for four star type, your rental is 89000, but today the rental for five star is even more, there is an epidemic of hotels, which means there is so much problem, see the price of hotel shares from where  Where have the meetings gone, the coming and going of the people, this product was so fine that if a boy is coming from Bangalore to Gurgaon for internship for three months, then he will be eating for three months, he can stay in a hotel, is it so expensive  And who will pay the rent, his security will be taken away or a six month clause will be put, he is not getting fully furnished, he is not getting that location, there is a complete commercial system here, Cyber ​​Hub 2 is going to be built behind, there is a good road, food and drink upstairs, club and lab  Everything is well taken care of and the person who is staying here is coming with his car, you come from Bangalore to Gurgaon for three months, will you get your car cleaned, and if you do, there is a fee for it like in a commercial building and Even if someone charges that monthly fee, then the maximum figure would be two and a half rupees.  It is a three Haj, two and a half, three and four Haj, he has reduced the rates by that much, so now there are some people left just for car parking, whoever might have come for 200-250 rupees, but those who focused on the main thing that what is its layout  It's cool, the room is so big, the bathroom is good, the view shoe is good to see everything and the kitchen too is totally decent, it is fully loaded, just like when we go to big five star hotels, there is a suite even bigger than that  And that layout is exactly the same, how to do it, so one had to move in it and I am telling you as I am telling you, take the name of a company, let's take the name of any company, which one, Indigo, Indigo has 8000 pilots.  By the time this project is completed, there will be 12-14000 pilots. So sorry, there are 8000 pilots in the whole of India. Indigo has maybe 5000 of them, so it will be 6-7000. Lot of pilots come to Gurgaon for  Simulator training and medicals and everybody, so 130 apartments are enough for a company because only 130 people will stay in 130 apartments, if you add single occupancy and occupancy then 250 people are not 100% occupied all the time, two people do not stay 100%, sometimes one, sometimes two  So, I am talking about such a magnificent tower for 200, 150 to 200 people and the rate is only Rs. 1,000, not today, not next year, not the next year, not the next year, not the next year, not the next year, not the next year, after 5 years, what will come of the money, it will keep on rising and capital appreciation will take minimum 5 years.  It is going to be worth 1 crore, so whoever has bought it for 1.3, brother you should think of 2.3, don't sell the one worth 1.45 for 2.45, your money will be saved easily, it is a plan of 20/5 and it has been brought out at a cheaper rate, the rates should have been higher, it could have been a little lower  But it was announced and it was sold, so those who were left thinking, if the ticket size is right, there are many buyers in the market I want to tell you one thing in The Pricing, I had also done a very iconic and my master class, if you want to see it, then press the join button in the comment section, take the membership of the channel and you will get it, it was a very good class, explained a lot, just recently Haj  People had joined in that, 850-900 of Hajj are okay but there are some members in platinum etc., I mean 1200-1500 people have seen that class, 1500 you can say have seen that class live, around 800-850 were there on the channel  If you take membership of Rs. 2000 then you will see that recording, I explained it in a very nice way, see if something of 3600, 4000 square feet is coming in any size and if there is any other thing then that ticket size becomes a CR, so the moment I get ticket size to CR 2.3  2.4 1.5 If you see anything, if a set of 10 tolas is not selling and a set of 4 tolas is selling, then it does not mean that  The rate of gold has gone down because the rate of gold is per gram but it is per tola, so here the rate of square footage is not going down, the latest update is second, you guys again the Gurgaon market is on fire, Region Max project has come, Rs 4100 crore  The property worth Rs. 10 lakh has been booked, the news has just come in the newspaper, he has acquired another 18 acre land parcel, he is saying that next year he will sell shares worth Rs. 9100 crore, just look at the price of Max in the last 15 days, where the price has gone from one and a half crores  In the month since their project was launched, whatever activity happened, RERA, Share came in the month of August, in the last two months, look at the share price of Max in these two and a half months, what news is coming, is the share price being sold So it is being sold in the market now only the people are saying that the mall has not been sold. Hey brother if the product will be ready in 6 years, it will be ready in a year, then who is crazy to sell it all, why will he sell it all, right now that is the decent rate for everything.  These Godrej guys might have just sold everything Even if 10-12 units are left, how do we know all these things because the videos will tell any story that so much of the goods have been sold and then all of BH is left. You can go and check on RERA's site, you will get the exact details on RERA's site.  It is known how much is left, but who will do that much hard work; no, you do it and tell me why should I tell you, why do I have to give you knowledge for free, I will give it to you for money, you go, you are curious, I am just telling you, the goods have been sold, no, no  There is still some left, yes, if the remaining will be sold, it will be sold next year, otherwise it will be sold next year, otherwise it will be sold next year, otherwise it will be sold next year, there are so many years left, you go to a shop  Hey, you have gone to a rental shop, some other clothes shop, or an expensive one, or a gold shop, and they say like this, brother, there is so much stuff, has it not been sold, I will not buy it, he says like this, he says, brother, the stuff is sold, the stuff comes  Goods are sold, goods come in, go out, sometimes it happens that there is no goods in the shop, if there is goods then we will keep selling it  When all the goods were sold out, some more goods arrived. It happens that jewellery is being sold every day from Tanish's showroom and even then when you go there, it does not end and you get it again, so now you will say no, I am seeing so much, I am looking at only one  Only two sets should be visible or go to buy sweets at the sweet shop, brother, you have kept so much sweets, they are not selling, I don't know sir, there is a sale every day, they are selling or not, but I don't think there is so much left, you will never know friend, what is happening Till the time you take pence and pence, you have to take it. If you are curious then it is written in RERA every three months that yes people do speculating but then watch for the next quarter. Watch for the next quarter to see how many cancellations are coming because they are listed.  Brother, it is a firm, so calculations will have to be done, like Lala ji, you can say this month's, next month's, next month's, this quarter's, next quarter's, this six months', I agree with what you are saying, I am a confectioner myself, I understand dishes.  How is it made, but brother no one can do it for one and a half years  The year comes, the audit comes, there are auditors, there are Big Four, there is a lot, there is a lot, you can go and read the annual report of the listed ones, then the truth will be revealed in a minute, yes, for the ones which are not listed, it takes some time.  But the fact is that I want to ask one more thing that if good units get sold then the remaining happiness is complete then the remaining happiness will go like fairies, for that people should be a little more hungry. No otherwise the man waits and the whole thing is coming, this is not done in weddings and the one which remains a little broken at the end is the one who is hungry and only he has eaten, otherwise bring me one more in the market  It is a bull run, it is secular, it will remain in the market, it makes a lot of this thing because you become popular, but what is the problem in being popular, Modi ji, I also feel that you will be popular.  But how did you gather followers?  Now those followers are such, they are not worthy of anything, they do not have intelligence, discretion and consciousness, now they create a ruckus and bring about your downfall, so when it does not happen so soon in life, the force is run, one has to be cautious many times in between 44000 square feet Projects of 3600 sq. ft. were told to the builders that brother don't delay so much, you can delay 1800 sq. ft. in Gurgaon in the ultra luxury segment, luxury a little above premium, delay 18000 sq. ft. somewhere, meaning in some depressed location  It will be sold, I will sell it myself, if the builder is good then I am saying so myself, but if someone brings it then it is 1800 sq ft, brother, we do not get it for 1800 from anywhere and if the location is good, very good then brother it will be sold for 20, this is the current rate.  I will give you another example, there is a project Shapar ji Palan ji, it is a famous project, it has a very good name, its rate there is 15000 square feet  The deal is done upto Rs.14750, a thing of 1850 sq ft is available for Rs.2.75, now we will put a variation of Rs.10 lakh, PLC lsi location, front, back, bottom, top, so much variation in the market, at 5 to 7, there will definitely be variation in the unit, so I have kept a rough rate  So brother I told you that if I am buying it today and all the money is going in one go, then if someone gives me the position in 7 years, it will take only 7 years because the RERA date is the same for me till date. No one has given anything before the date of RERA, it has been given only after the RERA date, so the builder who has taken the RERA date can take that much time, and the NGT ban, rains, excessive sunshine, saving of labour, all this happens  Yes, builders have to struggle with it and such construction of any project is half- barring and half-thing in which two-three towers were being built, projects are not available so quickly, even Shaper ji which was launched in 2019, whose phase one they took exactly four years  I gave you that it will also take time to get its last phase, so the builder latches on to the phases and gradually releases the rates of Aashiya Amara, you saw from where and how slowly, hey, not all of its stock is completely sold, whatever is left will be sold later.  It will happen after that, the position is of four years now, why sell it all today, all of it is not sold, if the goods are sold at 20, then the builder can do construction, he can open champagne at 40, he can send his employees to Switzerland at 50 He can buy a land parcel at 60, can make an announcement in real estate and his share price can rise to 50 if the goods are sold at 60, these people's goods are sold at 70, on an average, what rate did I tell you that what  Construction will not stop at 20, it will start at 40, the party will tell everyone, they are sitting with an average of 70, so on an average, at 30 on an average, if someone's inventory is left, then what happened, who committed a sin, got sold He will take the entire RERA once, many people take RERA separately, what's the problem, what's the problem, it seems the government will not come, we do n't shy away from talking about politics in Haryana, my channel itself is a political one  So brothers and sisters, now it can be said that there is a change in the government of Haryana, it is not like that, the BJP government has done very good batting, it has run a very good and great government, so if you get tired, then they will take rest for 5 years now.  Let's see brother, what will the rest of the people do? Now you will see such rising players, new players as well, old players will come again, okay, and there will be a buzz in the market, what is the reason brother, C I am not the only one who is Hitesh from Gurgaon, okay  Here all of you have also taken it, it is not like that half of Gurgaon's Rishi is in my name and I am not like that, you all have also taken it, you are interested, you have to understand this, people in the market write that if the rains stop now then Gurgaon will be  It will not set now, Navratri is coming, the sun is shining for the next four months, at least for six months  If it does not sink, then what stories will we tell? Now the one who will tell the stories will come. This government which is going away, has not told any stories for the last 10 months. Goods are sold through stories. Some stories are true, some are false, some are fruitful, some do not.  Some are false from the first day, some become false with time, like the metro will come, the metro is coming, the lion is coming, the lion has come, the lion has come, so 181 such metros have been coming to Gurgaon in the last 10 years. Like the leaders, big leaders of Congress say that these people did not install a single pillar, I am very happy that they did not install a single pillar, due to which the price of real estate increased further, I explained to myself why it is good for me, I was the only one.  In this way the metro will not come, the metro should not come and the metro did not come and the maximum benefit happened but people know that this is what has benefited, if the metro comes then we will eat bread even after the metro comes that it will come, now the rates will increase but the metro  Now the metro government has not come, so what about them earlier?  As soon as the day comes, work will be done to build the metro. On the first day itself will the metro be built in Gurgaon or will 2000 money be deposited in the accounts of women, they will do recruitments quickly, will take care of the farmers, Gurgaon 's number will come in 68 out of 10, okay so when that time comes then  And I will end the video by telling you just one thing, brothers and sisters, the infrastructure is bad, water gets filled, boats get built up, all this happens, it happens and even then the rate is this, the day all this stops happening, what will happen then, think about this  Don't think that oh yuck yuck and it is so expensive, think about it yuck yuck and so much yuck yuck has been removed because a project is being made which will take the water of Aravali to Badshahpur drain, about which there is no fuss, it is a 30 meter wide drain  When it happens that the water does not fill up, what will you do now, where will you go? This year, water did not fill up in Gurgaon. The year in which water does not fill up in Gurgaon, we will increase the rate by 20 rupees because look, from July to September, we have to be humiliated.  Do people like us also cry and abuse, we have another channel for abusing, Guruji from Gurugram does not give Politan here, I am fine, I will give Badhari Chikke there, okay so it is not that those markets are different, but here  I am telling you brother, there is a flat worth 100 crores, Kamaliya, water accumulates there also, water accumulates in front of poor people's houses also, this is democracy, Lavasa was a city of rich people, the government did not allow it to settle, this is India, it is not like this, Italy, France there  The rich have established big cities in Europe, cities are for the rich, this is not India, in India you can become Mukesh Ambani, your house may be worth 15000 crores but outside, I am the one who explains and teaches real estate in India.  That person is not doing it, I am the only one doing it, so write your questions in the comment section which you have in mind, there is no reduction in square feet at any price in Gurgaon, the ticket size will definitely be reduced by increasing the FR and breaking the size They  The dish has been put on the stove, it will take three, four or five months to cook. In the future, you will see projects coming but it's not happening right now. There's a dialogue in Top Gun in which he says that 'Mike his kids are headed for extinction'. Extinction: Okay, he says maybe  Sir yes but today is not the day, so today is not the day for Gurgaon, no correction is coming, no correction will come, they will not let it come and those who will not let it come, who are they, how are they, rest brother, the crow curses the drum and you complete the proverb  There is a Haryana saying, what does it mean, the vultures and the crows will want everyone to die but do everyone die just because vultures and crows are thinking like that, then the choice is yours, you become a peacock, and you become a vulture, and the crow will think that everyone will die  It will go and it will be mine. Now DLF Arbor will be sold at half the rate because right now it is not getting sold in resale at that rate. If any city in India can ever go on the lines of Singapore, then that city will be born  It has happened, I am not saying that the city is Gurgaon but that city has already come into existence, it is not as if it has to go and dig a pit now, so check the assisting cities where there are gentry jobs and money and FY 500 companies and all this.  Where is it already because it takes a lot of effort to bring them, it is very easy to build it, it can be built in 5, 10, 15 years, Greater Noda cannot be built, you do not hear the name of Greater Noda from my mouth, that is why from where will you bring the gentry, from where will you bring the people  Any city is as good as the people there and it is very difficult to bring people. Add subscribers. My quality of subscribers is very good and my quality of subscribers are playing the selection game, not the rejection game. I always tell people that they should get married.  One should have children, buy a house, respect the family, should not think beyond the family, should think about oneself, just enrich yourself and it definitely feels good to write some stories, I also criticize, it is fun, I also criticize guruji says so  I am myself, I am also there but you can't keep the same face all the time because there are 10 things to do, it is a lot of fun to criticize but criticism does not take you anywhere, it is a truth, you do not reach anywhere, you criticize others  I also criticize Modi ji, it's okay but I don't become Modi ji. It's not that if I criticize the Prime Minister, I would have won the councillor's election, I was the PM. By criticizing the PM, I did n't reach anywhere as a councillor.  If you enjoyed it then it's fine. For fun, people drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes, do drugs too. Many people do drugs and remain intoxicated. It's fine; many people enjoy it and that's why they do it, but somewhere  If we don't reach then we have to be practical, what has to happen will happen, we can't stop it and whatever 100 bagger stock happens, whatever we buy, I am lucky to have few multi 100 baggers in my portfolio and Poly Medicar is one of them.  Pola is one of them and which one is 100 bagger or not 10  It is somewhere without any reason, it's okay, don't buy the jam, I am telling you as I am, I am teaching something, I am not trying to impress, I am trying to teach that because if it were so much then I do n't know how many posts I would have made  There was not so much in it, it happened by chance, it is fine, it happened with knowledge, it just happened like this that it was increasing, it was not sold, if any 10 bagger became 10 times it and you sold it, then it became 100 bagger sometime  No, but we have seen that, there are 100 baggers as well, we have also seen 1000 baggers, look at the PD light, how much did it cost, look at the Titan, Rakesh bought the Ti Ch, now it is for Rs. 3800, look at the trend, those are my just my fa sen  Baggers is fine but friend now sell Trent at 7600, it is too much, it has become very expensive friend, what happens in very expensive, I will try to explain by giving some knowledge of stock market as well, there is something called Piva ratio so  What happens in P is that price is above and earnings are below and P- By ratio of many stocks and things remains high. Similarly, P-By ratio of many cities will remain high because their potential is high. So, Asian Paints will always trade at high P Buy you will release lots of good shares will always trade DMA ka kabhi PI buy dekhi lo trend ka dekhi lo tell me trend ka PIVA kya hai and bulk buying is happening all these shares are for information it's a real estate ka clarity this thing  I am not telling you to buy any share but I am just giving you a contactloader listener who is following a share since 1200 rupees so he did not buy it at 2000, nor at two and a half, nor at three rupees, how will he buy it at 7600, he cannot buy it  He can only abuse, how is it like this, will there be so much growth, it is trading at 200 p 200 years, how can this happen, will there be a correction in the stock market, shares  There can be a time correction in the real estate market because people have invested money here, what about the shares, outsiders sell them, some sell them, retailers sit idle many times, so what you have to realise is all of you that  The land parcels that are being bought in Gurgaon by builders are already very expensive, so their end product, if this is a shirt, then let's say the branded type, what else is it, it is readymade, it is not made using cloth, but if it had been made using cloth, then it would have been made using cloth  If these shirts are made and the rate of the cloth increases, then brother, the rate of readymade shirts will also increase. If a tailor charges Rs. 1000 for making a shirt, then he will charge Rs. 1500-2000, then the shirt will become expensive. The supply of cloth will decrease. Cotton Egypt  If people stop coming in, farming in Maharashtra gets ruined, farming in Gujarat gets ruined, cotton prices increase, labor rates increase, something will definitely become expensive, if it is getting expensive, the demand is very high, supply is limited because of the real estate Supply Is Limited Real Estate  The supply is not like Maggi. There was a very good article on this in the Economic Times once, in which they have tried to do something with China. Indian real estate has not been completed properly. It is a bit immature but it suits the people.  After reading that article, I want to give very good knowledge beyond that. I want to prove to you people that when I say I am the number one clarity giver on real estate, I want to prove that sometimes it happens that no  It doesn't happen by speaking, they will say that you are self-styled brother, in this world everything is self-styled, you have to speak for yourself, 56 inch chest is a big leader whose stomach is 56 inches and his chest is not even 44 inches but he is 56  They talk about inches and nobody has gone and measured it, they say it themselves, they have to say it themselves, so don't feel bad about this thing, I am saying here that I want to prove it, I want to give a test to you subscribers, so do you want  That I should discuss that article that brother this is the most  Intellectuals, I don't know what all researchers in the newspaper, Economic Times is a very strong newspaper, they have written English in it, I will read that English and would like to discuss on it and then you people have to decide whether it is self-styled or has some power, okay then you  Tell people if anyone else has the courage, brother, do this test of yourself, come, come to the field, the day the other one comes, I will speak less, I will do less, it is absolutely right and that should also happen, this  No, you have to put yourself for what do you say in appraisal, that brother do the appraisal, it is not, I am the only one saying for the last four years and people who have not listened and have listened to others, they are crying but what will you say when they come  You are saying buy it, buy it, the weather is fine, the weather is fine, it will rain, it will rain, it will rain, it will happen one day, in July-August, yes, it is happening, then it will stop in October, so what if it rained, didn't it?  So people had umbrellas, cars, houses, they did not go and there was also rainy day  We enjoy and we also like pakodas, so what if the share market will fall, fall, fall, two world wars in the last 100 years, Holi 106 years, if we count then I don't know how many crises there have been in the world, Holi Cube Crisis, this Crisis, Nuclear Nuclear  1945 Hiroshima, yes, everything is increasing, the matter will move forward as well, the question is that people have a lot of uncertainty in life and there is anxiety, many people play on this anxiety, I alone say that in my Take constants in life, somehow by crying and crying get a house from anywhere, by begging, parents who give mother-in-law, mother-in-law, father-in-law, he should be a good son-in-law, take care of the daughter, they will give it to you after all, friend, father is your poor  Yes, that is destiny, but father-in-law is freewill, right? Father-in- law is also destiny, is it not destiny?  Is freewill your choice, get a good in-law, spend less on marriage, buy a house, even now in 1.5-2 years, after that no one will be able to buy it in big cities and then those who have bought it will have to pay rent for life, I am telling you and one more generation  Those who are from 1970 will be cut and those who are smart, those of 60-50 are bitter, those of 1970 who earn good money, even those of early 1980 who have figured out, they are the ones who do financially very well, the poor people of Janji will be in trouble.  It is like they are not able to do any work, they are getting more work and they are not getting parent support also because their parents are from 1960, so that problem is big and they will tell you on some other channel, the video is definitely long, they will take you somewhere else  More good videos will come on real estate, like the channel and subscribe it and I am assigning a duty to all of you that two or three people from your family should subscribe to my channel because until the family does not come together and think intelligently,  There is no use of you taking the knowledge alone, give the video to father, give it to mother, give it to wife, give it to sibling, give it to brother-in-law, yes brother we can take it together, if three-four people can also take it together then  Divide it into three close relatives, you cannot trust them. Hey, if the registry is being done in your wife's name, then which one will get the trust? Do you want to trust him? You have to trust him. You have to trust two houses at different times.  But you took it, then divide it. One of them bought a house worth one crore, the payment plan was for 4 years, he gave 50 lakhs each, then after three-four years when things got a little better, after two-three years, he was not willing to take one crore, then take it together.  Now the first one has become one crore rupee, its rent is coming to Rs. 1.6-1.7, the second one also gets a position, then divide it, then you take this or that, there is a difference of 20 lakhs in the valuation of both, you give me 20 lakhs  Give it to me, I will give it to you, it is equal, what a great idea you told me  And instead of two, you can get three as well, people take the maximum of three, otherwise it remains that two or three people will cheat their parents, cheat their mother-in-law and father-in-law, cheat their brother-in-law and sister-in-law and cheat their brother-in-law and sister-in-law.  If you give it to me then you are anyway living a miraculous life, if you have nurtured such a relationship and how will you cheat me, I want to know how you cheated me, you took a loan of 80 lakhs, there is a liability of 40 lakhs and you are giving 20 lakhs to both of you  The down payment was of Rs. 10 you gave 10 he gave 10 it is in both names, tell me how will I get cheated, I want to know how will you cheat even if you want to, yes you bought the gold and put it in his locker, you have the receipt, no you don't have the proof  He said that this is mine, I have accepted this as a fraud, I am asking you to buy gold because what should I do with it now, but brother how can there be fraud in this, tell me, wake up customer, wake up, buy a house, get married, you already want this, there is benefit for you  You are ready to ruin your life in jealousy for my benefit. All the people are ready, those humans, only one work is left for me to do, selling wood for the cremation ground and I will start that too, then how will you stop my benefits, the chat is also mine, the pat is also my obstacle, so headon talen in case of the coin like this  You belong to Papa Ji, what is the benefit of trolling, so that Mukesh Ambani does not get any benefit, I will consume less Jio data, Mukesh Ambani will also be laughing, don't be laughing brother, you will fill petrol in the car and will not do any other work, everything will be in the breath  Even if they take any action, Adani or Ambani will benefit. In India, if you even breathe, Adani and Ambani benefit. Now we have to boycott them and make them look like their eyes, as it is said in Haryana language, Adani and Ambani's eyes.  Many people stopped breathing due to this. I don't know whether their components might be there in the air purifiers as well, they have also sold air purifiers. I will not go to Adani's hospital, if it is opened, I will not go to it. It will benefit from this hospital. I will not go to Narayana Hrudayalaya, they will benefit from it.  I will not go to the field because I have seen its lion You have bought it, if your father does not get the surgery done in the hospital then I will benefit from it, hey brother who is an investor which I also am and you people are also smart then there is benefit in everything, when you travel sitting inside Indigo  Even if you do n't want to travel, you have still bought lions. Suppose someone is giving the example of Indigo. I do n't want to reveal my portfolio much, so what will you do now? You have bought Indigo's lions. If you do n't become rich, we will not travel by Indigo, we will travel by Air India.  We will go away brother, that is all for you, now see what advantage the creator has, just like the creator can troll, the subscribers or the audience cannot do that many times because we have the platform, hello friends, we have it, you will write one line in the comment section I answer all of them at once, why do I have to do it again and again because our subscribers who are loyal and who enjoy it, they should also see it, right? When these questions are asked, why are they written in the comment section?  There are many people on YouTube who only write their comments section They close it, they open it selectively for one or two videos, okay so I just write whatever you want to write, I say understand how the game is played and play the game, don't become a random real estate, there is no problem in this  No, but you cannot stop yourself from doing good in real estate. You can avail indirect benefits of doing good in real estate. I will tell you about five-seven stocks. You can check their returns in five months because they are directly linked to real estate. The construction has just been completed.  The tiles are yet to be laid, the plywood boards are yet to be laid, but they are first seeing a surge. Look at the share of Kajaria Ceramics, how it has performed, look at Century Plyboard, look at Green Panel, look at Green Plywood, even look at Havells, this electricity, vidyut and this  He puts everything, look at this indirect Cera sanitary ware, further you check which one you want to buy, see which valuations of Astral Poly seem right to you, all this stuff has to be put which stuff has been sold where construction is going on  Now so many houses are being built on Dwarka Expressway, in Gurgaon and in other places, so brother, they will be painted someday, mirrors will also be installed, fans will be installed, people will also live here, look at the washing machines, look at the stock price of WAF  Where has it gone from here to there, so do n't cry, first of all stop crying and look at the share of the enterprise, now you have to open a finance channel in real estate as well, but many times it happens that you are remembering the wisdom, give it to me, look at the share of the enterprise in the last one year  What is it, what product does it make, check the voltage, if so many houses are built, will ACs be made, which AC is listed with where, what is the share price, what all things need to be installed in this house, tiles will be laid, fans will be installed, wood work will be done  If the public will not get it done then which good plywood are these, there is also a company which paints wood, do research on that, Sirka Paints is from Kirti Nagar, what is its price, they are not asking anyone to buy it, they are saying to put it on the watch list  Do your due diligence and don't abuse the fact that real estate will fall to very high prices  I understand that votes are not bought but it is not within everyone's reach because the main thing is leverage. If you buy all these shares that I mentioned for Rs 10 lakh, what will happen, they will become 20 lakhs but if the property is worth two crores and that share is worth 10 lakhs  Even if it increases, it increases by Rs 20 lakh. Your property worth Rs 2 crore increases by only 10 lakh. And to buy a property worth Rs 2 crore today, you don't need to have Rs 2 crore, but to buy shares worth Rs 10 lakh, you need a demat account of Rs 10 lakh.  I want you to understand what I am saying but what is the use of explaining when there is more benefit in misleading and cajoling there is more benefit in scaring when you get lashed for explaining and get views by cajoling then what will the people do most of the YouTubers in India  Fresh buddhu banana word is actually more vulgar but I am a guruji so I don't use vulgar words, if I want to I can do it okay and I know how to do it but still you use the word buddhu or something else  I don't use the words that Pankaj Tripathi ji uses in Mirzapur, he doesn't use those words that brothers and sisters, making you a fresh fool is much easier than convincing you, what has happened is when fear has been instilled in you and the fear goes away with knowledge, clarity comes with knowledge What do they say in astrology that shows the light of God, the moment light comes, you get clarity and fear goes away and remember that thing in life, always remember this thing, always go for adding value and increasing your net worth and money and Wealth or simply say in Hindi, Lakshmi ji why because it is written in Lakshmi ji's aarti, Diwali is about to come, everyone will read this line, everyone knows this line anyway, everything becomes possible, if the mind does not get nervous, then those whose mind gets nervous, it means the mind is nervous Lakshmi ji will not come to you because where Lakshmi ji is, the mind does not get scared, so first of all the mind is fickle, Pushpa, Rajesh Khanna had said this many years ago, reduce the fickleness of the mind, stay away from those who scare you, come to those who give you clarity and  Any man who is strong It will not always be available for free and attitude will also be visible, so brothers and sisters, I finish this video, I hope it was well utilized 40 minutes of your life, don't be afraid, in real estate India no one teaches or explains and the biggest ticket size of your life  Ticket purchase is done. Even in the life of a rich man like Mukesh Ambani, the most expensive purchase is his house and I know he owns jets, aircrafts also and he owns diamonds and money is also spent on the marriage of his children but if there is any one thing which is the most expensive  He has spent money and bought assets, so it is his Antilia which has the highest value in his life, the rest are shares, reliance1, be it a big man, whether he lives in a slum, or EWS, or affordable, or poor, or rich.  Real Estate is Something You Can't Get Away With Without Learning and I've Taught It Beautifully in a Course Rump Course Real Estate Mentoring Program If You're Listening Till Now and You Want  To enroll for that there is a Navratri discount for that now and you must definitely look at it and buy it during the Navratris itself and it will start from Navratris itself, enroll now at a discount, you will get excellent recordings of two and a half hours each, if you want to start your life in real estate  In it is super knowledge, so what do you have to do for that, you need to ramp up, you need to ramp up to me and after that we will see to it and I am not getting any certificate, knowledge is knowledge, Ramdev ji  You have n't got the yoga certificate yet, so get the knowledge, apply it in your life, have fun and with that you can become rich immediately in two months, how much, that depends on you, I am not making any claim, okay  if yes then please do thank you very much"

    "title": "Gurgaon Real Estate ： What Potential Buyers And Investors Should Do Now ？ [7nDmeTceC5c].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, I am bringing the latest update of Gurgaon real estate, what is happening because what is fast, what is cold, whether investors have fled, whether there is FOMO or not, whether builders are tired, these questions will be there for all of you, is it ok, are the rates low?  What will happen, will the rates increase, will the property increase, what will decrease, what will come, so I am telling you the information about the cycle and that trend which has now changed after 15th August, I am telling a lodger. This festive season has started, it is raining, Shirad will come again, it is Navratri, so I am telling you about the next two to four months, do not miss out, take take away from it, it will not be a simple one or this because come like this and tell me. Oh rate, it will go 500 feet, this is stupid, tell me it will crash, this is stupid, then understand exactly what is happening, perhaps no one has made such a video, this can happen on videos, these days I watch more videos of others.  I do n't watch it because I do n't have five channels of my own but I can handle it. Okay, so if someone else has created this like me and has given this messaging, then write down his name and I will follow him too. Listen carefully and understand carefully. Gurgaon Real Estate.  There is one primary market. What is the primary market? The fresh thing comes and is launched fresh. Beyond which the world goes crazy. All the promotions take place. That is the primary market. There is one secondary market. The secondary market is the goods.  It is available in resale, it is ready to move in and is in advanced stage of construction and is also under construction. This is called secondary market which is where you make a one on one deal with a buyer or seller who has taken the original. Primary market. When the builder issues the allotment letter directly in your name, then you have understood what is happening in the primary market. If you look at the period from April, May, June to July-August, there are so many losses.  Not so many have come, but not so many have come and those who have come have 50 plus bookings, none of the projects will be built before six to seven years, I have explained this earlier because it will take three to four months for construction.  If it is not there, then the one which is taken for 4 years will be six to seven and I am giving another big proof of it. You can see the deadline of every project in the RERA certificate which the builder has taken from the government, then if the builder has  If he has 100 days, he can make it in 99 days and if he can't make it in 100 days, he can take 110 days from the government, so he is in no hurry to make a lot and give it to you in two years, he will make it as per his own and  Will sell as per his wish. Same thing happens in Mumbai too, so the thing that was there has changed that 100% projects are not being sold out nor builders are leaving because they are not reducing the rates. There is something good in the payment plan.  The time has come to do it, but the builders are still showing their strength or not, we will remain in this construction gender but we will take it in two years, then we will keep positioning it in the next year, this is going on now, this is going on, this dilemma.  Things are going well right now, Lo Rice's arrival was certain, a big listed player's arrival in Haryana does not mean in Gurgaon and he is still in the plus four page, again he got stuck in the court, date after date is going on, so you are getting delayed. But brother, that too if you see, it was a thing which was priced at Rs 1.92 Cr, now you are not getting any of that at the price at which it was being priced, so there are some projects now which are very value for money, which will become three from today. After four months, this is my complete practical analysis for you. Sometimes what happens is that we look at this thing, it seems expensive, I don't know, the rate has increased a lot, then suddenly some other segment comes which is cheaper in rate.  It is 50-60 lakhs but brother, if we look at the value for money then it seems to be more value for money. I want to tell you this, the second thing that surprised me and you may think that my prediction was a little wrong but  Now, that thing I believed in resale was that there would be a slight cooling in the primary market and the resale market would become hot and many things were sold in the resale, so The Correct Current News to  All of you who are listening is that nothing is happening in the resale market, then you will say, hey, even resale is not being sold, so the primary is cooling down a bit, so no, the market itself is cooling, no, no, no, many buyers are coming in resale.  There are many who want to buy, many queries are coming but sales are not happening, the sellers are sitting tight, the main reason for this is that whatever launches were done and the people who are looking forward for resale, their payment plan is something like this.  It is said that the payment is not coming in 2024. I researched 15 projects which are in different stages of construction. Well, in my research I came to the conclusion that in the next three to five months, put the athletics up till the end of this year in 2024. Lo, if no payment is coming, then no payment is coming, then the customer who sells the seller has no gun on his shoulder, he is thinking that a new government will come, the atmosphere in the country is also a little like this, elections will be fine.  Results will come, rains are falling, Sarad Raad will come, this festival will come, the weather will get better, after that, Karva Chaut will come, then one by one, first Dussehra, then all of them, Bhai Dooj, in between, Diwali, then you know, festivals will open all over India.  When marriages take place, the atmosphere changes, the position of the Sun changes and a lot of things also change astrologically, then people are willing to wait.  And those videos were made of people like us and I said, don't sell now, when you are not asking for your money then why are you selling, brother, you don't have money, you are getting very high premium in the market because you are looking for resale deals in the market.  Hey buyer, he wants a distress sale of Rs 1.5 crore whatsapp2 and he laughs like me because if it is an item worth ₹ 1 and it has been called a distress sale at a price of ₹ 110, then people's attention goes to the distress sale, they do not realize that  100 has been changed to 110 and it is not a distress sale. Brother, it is more than a normal sale and then you will sell it for ₹ 1 and call it a distress sale. Now it has many subscribers from you. The world is a part of these groups, so when that distress  If the cell sees too much distress then the mind feels that it is distressed. Okay stress and distress are okay then there is a lot of distress. So brother hey brother.  Look at the rate of distress. If something is worth Rs 2 crore and is being sold for Rs 1.5 crore then it is distress. If it is being sold for Rs 80 then it is still distress. A thing worth Rs 2 crore is being sold for Rs 2 crore 10 but distress is written on it.  I do n't get distressed by this, okay, who told me this thing is okay, those are the sellers who want me to sell it, I had just bought it and they ask questions about some broker and some anthia too.  He doesn't have to do that because he feels it or he is asking the rate because he knows that in Gurgaon market Guru ji has told that there is no need to sell, so everyone is enjoying the rate and he is asking the rate and I am calling him a customer.  I will put it, then he will say no thank you, so this is a strange thing, in a way, no one is doing anything, neither is anyone facilitating these deals, nor is the seller very determined. Everybody 's year is number eight.  This is just the way the matter is going on, no one can say at all whether real estate is cold or real estate is very hot right now, but where is the advice, what is it now, after making so many videos, you are getting something in resale brother.  If someone else is ready to sell then take it brother, don't throw tantrums because the rates have to increase further, the density has to increase and people are not focusing on density. If the same unit of the same size is available at the same rate then more density.  If it is three times, brother, the previous one was good, if he had taken it then understand this thing, you all are here in Gurgaon real estate, those who want to buy or sell, then there are three to four projects in them, if you want to sell then you want to buy.  So let me tell you that if you want to sell or buy something in these four projects Godrej Meridian Shahpur JI 102 Shobha 108 and Lan 106, then you can connect on the given number. I am a buyer here and I am a seller here so that is the best what ever is and first of all I am giving advice. If the seller has no compulsion at all then don't sell, don't sell even now. This is the advice for the buyer, brother, take it.  If you are a buyer then you can register now, if yes, if you find anything then please let me know and the seller can also change the price of what will be sold, it will not be a distress sale.  Definitely, it will not be like that if your project is 2 years old or a new project which is launched now, then you get something at the rate of new project or new tower, you are able to sell it in resale, this is a wrong thing, isn't it that you pay more money to him? Construction is too much, it will go soon, the payment plan is different, so if the builder is offering this rate now, then you will not get that rate, so you will also have to be wise, how much will you get, we will tell you, it is a dynamic situation, that week.  It changes according to the real estate, not according to the day, but the rate changes every week, depending on the sales. If a deal is done so much, then it becomes firm, then the rate becomes the same at which a deal is made.  If it is done and one deal is being done every week, for sure the market knows that yes, if it is done in this much time then that much is done, then it will not be beneficial to quote some rate today and with a project also, you know that people  PLCs are given in a project, the rate varies from 5 to 10, you know, depending on the floor, what is the facing, what is the sunlight, what is the shade, do you know that people have also paid that much, so 5 Q.  Very easily, if there is a variation of up to 100% in other wise even cases, then it cannot be called a standard rate. An item worth ₹ can be available for ₹ 105-110 and it can also be worth buying.  And there is that much difference in the rent too, it can vary up to 5 rupees, it does not matter more than 5 rupees, but if you are interested, you can do it on the given number for awareness about it and what strategy to follow.  I will do a webinar this week. When you are listening to this video, give a webinar info [music] in the comment section. You have to do this, who has to take what, how to take it, but I am definitely telling you a secret, brothers and sisters.  I will close the end by speaking, I deliberately tell it at the end of the video so that only those who watch till the end with full faith can benefit and if you have heard this then please write the secret of the end in the end. Have you heard what is the secret which no one has told.  It has not been told that for the last 10 years in Gurgaon, from 2014 to 2024, which is the last 10 years, even one acre of land in Gurgaon has been changed by a big builder or nothing has happened, all the land has been purchased. This builder with the previous license has sold it, he has sold it, he has sold it. Whenever you see that this builder has bought the land, then from whom did he buy it? Very little has been done by this builder to go to the farmers and transfer their land. So if one acre is an exaggeration, then I can say that brother, out of 100 projects, 98 projects and 99 projects have not had any fresh change land use. In the last 10 years, you understand, in the luxury segment.  In the luxury segment, in the premium segment, if 300 projects have come up with lets in Gurgaon in the last 10 years, then 290 plus were already licensed. If it does not seem to be new, then it is licensed because many times when I do comparison, people ask, Gurgaon, Mumbai. No, there is no Mumbai. What is the sea in Mumbai? There is a sea, so a man cannot go into the sea here. Okay, so there is a limit in Gurgaon as well.  There is a limit in Gurgaon too, from Dwarka Expressway it becomes Delhi, if you go here, you will go to Jhajjar, if you go down, you will get drunk and if you go further east, then you will come to UP, Palwal, Balwal will come and that means there is a limit in its geography, if you go here, then there is a limit. Then he will come to Delhi, okay, the limit is fine, but despite that, now a farmer is sitting with the land parcel of one acre or two acres, no one is ready to consolidate it.  Some are not ready to sell, some are factory type C, some have made it from unauthorized houses, some are not consolidating, land S is not really available, I am giving the best example of this, the best builder is one off.  The best builder Shahpur ji Shahpur ji Very nice project in 102 sector Good project Timely delivery Good vibes Everything good happened The builder people are also happy This builder last  Have they not been able to buy any land in 4 years? Do they not have the intention to build? Do they not feel like expanding? Brother, a builder has launched a project. He has a good name and has done a good job in the market. So he should have brought more.  They could not find it because their criteria are a bit strict. The land parcel should be like that of Bombay's best. It should be like this here. They could not even type it because the rest of the North Indian builders have a difference of sixty percent among themselves. They have to sit and do it every day, they have already taken everything and made arrangements among themselves and made them do that because what many people do is they take his loan, a little bit remains in the deal.  Taking this type of deal, taking over a person's land which is mortgaged at six places, how developed is the legality in it? The bank also has someone else's share, a builder also comes in it and you have seen the shoes of these builders also ringing.  are newspapers  You have seen that this builder filed a case against him, that builder did the same, issues are still going on with the land, some listed players are also having issues, you write in the comment section in the comment section with whom he had made it in collaboration, so many people Many people do not want to purchase outright land. If it is okay in their name, then this is the reality of Gurgaon. The land is not available so much, so do not think that something cheaper is going to come for those who did not buy.  No, he is waiting, there will be a crash, crash, crash, what will happen, the thing of 00 will become 99, this will be the crash, what else will crash, and this also does not seem to be happening, for me, the thing of 00 is seen becoming 120, for sure shot him.  You will not realize that it is a 120 bus, it will change its size, it will provide amenities, it will tell stories, it will do something, all these means, there are many people with clear brains who will do all this. Increase the tax on a thing and you don't even know whether it is ghee or ghee or any liquid, it is sold on litre, it is sold on kg, there is 91 kg in 1 litre, it has to be sold as per kg, you don't know that.  Will work Square meter Square feet Square yard Can curdle your mind Carpet area Exclusive area Balcony area Brother, they are all limited, you will never know how much the property was taken by the person and what rate he got, only the builder is there When the buyer gets the agreement done in the tehsil, then it is realized that this is the truth of life, I am definitely laughing, it is a matter of pain and this is the thing that people come to know, brother, this is this, we will give you this, this is the plan.  This is PLC, this is this plan, like this, okay, okay, there is so much crowd in the allotment and I become so knowledgeable myself, or I also go there and come to know about the exact rate of the units I have bought and sold.  According to carpet area carpet, that area is the actual carpet and there is no exclusive area in it, then you get worried if the rate is so high, then he is told that brother, the balcony is not counted in this, then add both and reduce both of them by 1.4.  After doing this, your super area is obtained. Yes, and by dividing it, the thing which is sold at 18000 feet, 20000 feet, 16000 feet, is a super area, but the super area is only a mansion.  If it is not there then that rate is not even mentioned anywhere, it comes out of the mouth somewhere, that rate is not written anywhere, something different will be written in the paper, now we do not have to worry about this, we have to learn, brother, it is like this, this is how gold is.  Rate per gram, this is OK but rest of the charges GST making charges, all these charges are interesting, be a little proactive, those who have not bought, have not bought, do not keep waiting, now is the time to buy, only in the rainy season is the time to buy, nothing is cheap.  It must be getting expensive. Everyone is sitting like this after October 4th. What is happening on October 4th? Numol ji also does great work. There is a lot of love for October 4th. Who is the second leader of India? What is his date of birth?  Numol ji let's add 4th October 2024, we will calculate 4th October char and one pa and 2024 kitna aa aa and pa 13 amazing this also becomes four only, the result came on 4th June, now come on 4th October  There is four numbered sector, eight numbered sector, my videos were also posted on the head, four numbered flat unit, eight numbered unit, the world does not work without the number four, it is the number of Rahu, brother, it is the number of Rahu, okay, learn about the number four, understand that we are one of our precious ones.  A course is also going on, if you want to join then you can also write to me Newmol ji. If you want to join the course, if you are ok then like the channel and share. Thank you very much."

    "title": "How Haryana Election Result Will Affect Real Estate In Haryana Now ？ [p-zDbasgft0].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, it will be a very good video to watch in its entirety. There will be a tailed analysis. Impact of Haryana's elections on real estate. I will discuss the impact in many places within Haryana. Where should you invest, where will the rates increase, I will tell the names of two, four, five, six cities. I will tell the reasoning. Off course video.  It will be political but you know there is no point in talking about all this because no real estate channel will talk like this to explain, okay so I am explaining, you try to understand first of all in Haryana.  BJP government has come, if 48 MLS and Independents also support then there will be a very stable government of 50 years. There is a double engine government, that is one aspect but now we will have to understand the politics for what will happen on real estate in this election.  Those who used to speak historically in Stronghold used to speak in English or used to speak Garh in Hindi and those of Congress have reduced or ended, one perhaps Rohtak is left, a little or the other wise Sonipat. Rest of BJP's strongholds have also emerged and South Haryana has emerged in it, so first of all I will cover for outside investors, for those from Haryana, I will cover four five six cities, so your city can also be in it. And there will be complete advice as to who has to do what, share and like the video and whatever reasoning is being given, you want to question it, if you agree to question then you want to counter it.  So please tell us in the comment section so that our knowledge increases together. Okay, so first of all I am extremely now bullish on Gurgaon, otherwise it was there before also, it was there before, but now it is clear cut, you see this, 2024 is completely almost October is here and completely gone.  Is without any much thing from the government when Khattar ji changed and after that Haryana is running in election mode now go to government  The formation is a breath, from November onwards we will start seeing the truth to an extent that the same stilted plus four issue is pending, now again the High Court has asked the government what will the government do, now that the government has come, it will also take a decision, you see.  The policy was going on for one and a half years and then the High Court was formed, so all those things which are bottle necks, you will see them getting fixed. The second biggest thing is the good news. I feel that Rao from Gurugram.  Narbir ji seems to me to be taking a good portfolio, becoming a minister for the last time, there was no mattress leader on that post like this, I am here, now what will happen to me, but you all will also support me, those who are interested in athlete Gurgaon.  It is in my opinion that Rao Narbir ji should be made the Deputy CM because South Haryana deserves this athlete because in 2014 it was given to BJP again in 19th and in 24th then that much. BJP will also have to maintain loyalty now that there is a leader here who lives with a good margin and that is also the internal politics of BJP, from Amit Shah ji to Narveer ji, which is known to all of us in the newspaper and this is the demand.  This is an open domain thing and I am not giving any such secret out, we all know it, so if it is so, then we real estate people can also speak for the real estate because if the waste management is good.  If the infrastructure side of Gaya gets fixed then the rates of Gurgaon which have increased so much that they always say that they have increased, if all this other stuff gets fixed then you will see where Sohna will go. Will do very well. Job creation will happen in Gurgaon and  Gold rates are increasing on which lines from here? Now you see, nothing has come there but someone is sitting with land. What can happen to Rewari?  The highway through Pataudi will open in four-five-six months. There is a lot of attention of builders there too. I am telling you that there also you will see 11,122,000 square feet of lakes and they will attract many people, which is today called New Gurgaon and where  Have you seen the rates increasing? Do you know the rates of this area of ​​Sector 89, Sector 90, 91, 92, 93 and if you see them increasing then all this is also zoomed.  It will become Gurgaon, meaning it will not be called New Gurgaon. This story will continue further. If Pataudi moves towards Rewa also, this area will become more mature because a lot of vote bank has come from there, many MLAs have come from there too and we will have to sleep everywhere. Now I am seeing more businesses coming in Sona. This attraction is bound to come because for the last one and a half year and a quarter it was feeling that the government will change, the government will change and that peak.  By this time, everyone was surprised, so beyond that, I made my detail video on the political channel. If you guys are not a subscriber of Guruji from Gurugram channel, then please go and make a detail video on that channel. Haar Haar and Seven Reasons End. Takeaways are a completely different political thing but here I would like to put it on real estate, so this is Gurgaon, I am very bullish and the region I want to tell is I see next in Gurgaon. In five years, because now the government is for 5 years, then write the IC minimum in five years, somewhere 20 lakh new people coming to Gurgaon, Gurga is already worth 23 24 25 lakh, 20 lakh people are coming, I can see clear cut, who are these people?  So there are those from Delhi who will come, one is from Rest of the India and one is from Haryana, so there are three types of people, one is from Delhi, one is from Haryana and one is from Haryana.  Rest of the India Rest of the India, the businesses that are attracted are the normal population, IT space is the coming and going business, those from Delhi who already worked here will come physically and now I will appeal to the people from Haryana, I am saying that  If one lakh people of Haryana will come to Gurgaon in 5 years, 8.5 lakh i.e. one and a half lakh people will come here, who will come here, how will they come, I am telling you, one and a half lakh people will come here i.e. only  12 Saaj people per month i.e. 300-400 per day. In the next one and a half to two years, I alone will settle four-five people in Gurgaon, Haryana through my videos and they are not saying that no good is happening in this, it is good for everyone, good for the people.  It is good for the city, it is good for the government, it is good for the society, because this has to happen because I can see it, because the settlement of Agniveer has been done because there is noise beyond that.  There was a ruckus, now the election has happened, after the election, now people will not go to Agniveer, those who used to go to Historic earlier because even now it was feeling that maybe something will happen, something will happen, the government will come, some issue will arise, it is never going to happen now, so the Historic in Agniveer. Many youths from Haryana used to go, they will not go. Haryana Government's employees should not lose so many jobs because H HR KM, which skill scheme is going on? Sorry, 1.8 lakh people have been recruited, so out of 1.8 lakh, there is no scope for making new recruitments, we will definitely appoint only those people because they have also contributed a lot to BJP in winning the elections because there was a danger of losing their jobs if  2 lakh new recruitment was to be done which was announced by Congress, then they could have kept only 1.8 lakh, then there was danger even beyond this, common people should not analyze all EVMs.  These 1.8 lakh people are creating ruckus by using EVMs. Now this is settled, the young man will not have a choice because brother, there is no farming, this is a fact, these people do not have to work so hard, they are busy in mobile phones. They are cutting the milk of buffalo, that too Bihari labor has been kept, so many people have remained clean, now I do not want to talk about community, caste, caste and caste because I also  Belong to this belt only, it is okay so people get angry in their own way and the rest are all our own but those people are ok you are here, you are here, you are here after doing a lot to me, that does n't seem good to me, come explain and Even if there is a troll, there is no use, but I have to tell the trend, we are another channel for Rath Saptami, it is okay, so he has to come, otherwise you will die of hunger, nobody is bad, he did not come on the cot, son, eat the roti, meaning.  When those parents grow old, it will have to happen, the government will also facilitate it and anyway, there is a job, if you come here, you will get 30-40 Haj, then someday it will be worth 50, 60, 700 thousand, without coming, nothing is going to happen, so many people will come. Population will increase, the requirement of houses will increase from below, all these children can't come and buy a house, they will live on rent here, so that value chain will be from below.  These affordable housing positions will start to increase and you will see the rents for these fully furnished 25,27,28,000 in the coming years, beginning next year only today, I am telling you that it gives a trend towards bull run, gold will do very good.  Will do well, after that I am bullish on Sonipat, now in Kharkhoda, Asha Hooda ji, Deependra ji's mother is from there.  And if they lost the election there too, then losing there means that whenever the fort falls there, it consolidates. This is my thinking. Yes, okay, now we will not do politics in this, why should you enjoy it?  He is taking it like this, he used to say like this earlier, he is not beyond what has happened, we have to talk beyond that, we have to move ourselves forward, we politicians are sad, Congress has lost, they are sad, so we have spent our life in their indifference.  No  There is no problem, okay, we have to move ahead, brother, he is still an MP, he will become an MP from here, otherwise he will become a member of the Rajya Sabha, his life will continue, the house in Delhi will be empty, otherwise if you do this with him, then you will get it.  What to look forward to is that something good will happen in Kharkhoda, its spillover will be found in Sonipat, Vande Bharat's already big scale factory in Sonipat and all that is about to come, incentive has arrived.  The government was already seeing it politically, the BJP government was seeing the potential of Sonipat, now it has been stamped beyond that because the people of Sonipat have given so much and if you are a Sonipat person, then good days are going to come for you, I am real.  Estate Analyst Political Analyst Investment Analyst I am taking out all the juice and telling the reasoning, I am telling how its trend is visible now and in the whole of Gurgaon, listen carefully, we listen to the names of each and every authority, right?  GMDA Gurgaon Metro Pat Development Authority GMDA Second is Faridabad where the authority is only city in Gurgaon Third is where this authority is, that is Sonipat Now it will be active There will be stories from there also, what exactly will happen, how it will happen and we will see, I am telling you, so Gurgaon is gold.  Balle bate, in the beginning I told about Gurgaon Sona, bate bate, I am telling about every place which is coming in my mind. Gurgaon Sona Balle Balle Every resident of Haryana who does not have a house and has money, then brother, you can buy in Gurgaon, buy something, you can buy gold side, New Gurgaon, where you can buy whatever you can buy, you can buy by selling, you can invest and buy together.  If you can, then after these three Sonipat, let's go to Karnal. I haven't bothered much, he keeps walking on an old world path. Okay, there is not much in politics, Panipat is better but Sonipat.  Is the main, Kurukshetra is fine because CM sir looks like he is from there and something or the other will be better there and otherwise tourism will be better and recitation of Gita ji and development by doing that and increasing employment by listening to some stories, that will continue to be done.  One half builder listed player had got plots there. I can see the rates increasing there. Kurukshetra can be bought for atlist Kurukshetra but I am not buying it from any other resident of Haryana.  I would say that it is too much to invest in Kurukshetra, if you are not from there, then the first priority is Gurgaon because if you buy in Gurgaon today, you can sell Gurgaon tomorrow and buy anywhere in Haryana, but if you miss Gurgaon today, then go to Goa tomorrow.  Gun, that was such a mixture, it would be like that, so I started from there, first let's rewind Gurgaon Sona Sonipat, I know Kurukshetra, fifth city I will say in Hisar, what in Hisar?  It has happened because of Savitri Jindal ji, Naveen Jindal is there, he is an expert, he is one, but from the news of Hisar airport, there are things to tell stories. If it is ready, there are chances of becoming a logistics hub.  If you are from there, then Hisar is also on my radar, I am putting it in the priority list which I have told you as a priority, so if you are a resident of that place then you have to think about something or the other, people of Hisar.  There is good news for this but do not overleverage too much. The parents' house is already installed, this is the priority, this is Gurgaon, Gurgaon is holistic, it is fine and the politics that will happen here will also be delimited here in the coming times. Gurgaon will become a bigger stronghold in Haryana. Brothers and sisters, there are 90 assembly seats. BJP has formed the government by winning 48. In the future, when delimitation or delimitation will happen.  If we say that the number of assembly seats will increase and it will increase to 124 in Haryana, to reach 124, 34 more assembly constituencies will increase, then these 34 will increase on the basis of population, so in the next one or two years, the population of Gurgaon and Faridabad is already more. Plus and the population has to come here, then it is out of 34 seats in 182 seats. I am seeing a lot of growth in these two areas, especially Gurgaon is going to get lion share like Badshahpur assembly segment is the biggest, meaning here maybe Rao Narvi ji won by 700 thousand votes, by some 60 700 thousand votes, how many others too?  The candidate was Goyal ji, Vardhan Yadav and all these were there, they have also taken Bhateri votes and after that the lead is so much, then the total votes, you can see the cast.  How many are there and if the caste is at 62 then how many total voters are there and how many voters are there? The voters who are not here will come forward and are coming, so many assembly seats will emerge from here, so now when politics comes behind.  So that would be the cleanliness of the things of the local people, cleanliness of the infrastructure because look at the filling of water, look at five or six things, filling of water during the rains, second garbage, these two landfills with waste management.  Landfill will come here, these two issues will come there, okay, what is the third issue? Tell me, I think these are the two biggest issues in Gurgaon. Okay, third, you can do something about the traffic, but it is linked to these things. Otherwise, when it rains.  If there is no water and no filling, then there is not much issue of traffic. On a normal day, maybe during peak timings, they are bottle necks. Underpasses should also be made on Dwarka Expressway. And there is a railway line in between and this is Gurgaon, so it is connecting at three, four, five places, so two-four more places have been added, railway over bridges have been removed, something has to be done because the sanctions have to be done there by Wars ji and he is the Railway Minister.  This is BJP's, so it can be showcased by doing something. Gurgaon has such a potential that by doing a little more work beyond that, it can be completely brightened because the potential is there and then it can be shown and a model can be made.  Can go and beyond that, politics can be done for many years and it can be made a stronghold and when this entire South Haryana here has 2528 seats, I see it increasing and going closer to 45. 45 48 seats in this  If in the area, out of 124 seats, only 45-48 seats will be here, which even in 2528, BJP has won a lot in a clean manner, then this government will always be here.  The key here will come to South Haryana and the power dynamics of Haryana's politics will shift for a long time. Look, no one knows that there was a time when Hisar's politics was under the control of Devi Lal ji.  I used to live in Sirsa and that area. Okay, after shifting from Sirsa, I came to Hisar, after shifting from Hisar, I came to Ro, meaning it is moving east. In words, that was the old politics and in between, there was also the politics of Bhiwani when Bansi Lal was there.  So they used to call it Bagad Belt, which is the dynamics has shifted in Haryana. If you see, Sirsa has come here from that side, Bhiwani, Rohtak or Haryana has come here, then here also 1015 years are quite visible because there was no center of power in the last 10 years.  There was no center of power because when BJP came for the first 5 years, it seemed as if it has come, it will come out next time, then it came to 40 seats, then it felt like, oh man, we have won again, what happened in Pulwama?  When BJP was crossing 75, even after ruling for 10 years, it did not seem that it would last, it seemed that it would go away and this time it would be too much, this time it was like, yes brother, it is a very good thing, it is BJP's brother.  When it could not be done this time, now BJP is that student, now they will plant their roots and there is a lot of incentive to plant them because till now they were doing one thing or another, in 5 years they will also go away.  BJP got the idea that they have destroyed the Jat politics, that is, they have destroyed those areas which were strong holds, which are the strong holds of Congress today, where Congress can speak, there was a sweat in Kalanaur, Rohtak. Bibi Batra ji had lost her sweat. She won the Rohtak seat by 1200 votes. It is better than Manish Grover ji, so Geeta had lost her sweat in Rohtak too.  Bhukkal ji, look at how many votes she has won with difficulty. So, this Jhajjar-Bajjar, which was considered to be the stronghold of Congress, is also a shaky place, but I say this, let's accept that it is the stronghold of Rot. After that, if Sonipat collapses, it will become the stronghold of BJP.  Gaya Sonipat, when Sonipat became a fort, now you will have to make your fort there, you will have to build moats so that the crocodiles do not come back with water in the morning, like the old kings used to do once.  Once captured, now you make it strong. In the same way, Gurgaon has been built, now it has been stamped, so canal crossing, Faridabad and all those things will remain stories, that too will be fine, but Gurgaon will do very well, tell me the option in Hisar.  I gave you I am bullish in Sonipat, of course that sentiment will remain in Kurukshetra, CM Saheb is from there, so all this was real estate in Haryana for you, Haryana Pradesh will remain on progress.  The people here have to leave their laziness and leave their village, now they have to go abroad, whoever has the power can get a good job or come to Gurgaon because I say that if you want to try any big city in India and  You live in Haryana. Haryanvi is your surname. If you belong to any of the 36 communities, then Gurugram is from your province. Is your natural call? Why will you go to Bangalore? Why will you go?  To Mumbai, Pune, Hyderabad, don't look at it, if you are well educated, you can go there, but brother, if you are less than that, you can do the same work here as you do there, you will also stay close to home and this way it looks very good to me. And I personally will explain this logic to the youth through my social media and we will consolidate the real estate. Many times many people feel that the rates have increased due to the pricing. Now I feel like this. That the supply will have to be brought at different rates brother, if you want cheaper then brother, come to Pataudi Rewari highway and go further 10 km, there is infrastructure here, stay in Ghadai center, then you will get higher rates, if you want Delhi border then also 18 thousand.  Give it to me, if you want ultra luxury then brother, it will be 20000-18000, now the builders will come for less, now the builders will also have stability, otherwise the builders will also be in trouble.  It remains like this, getting license, applying for RERA, do it now, don't do it, land use, CLU PL, you know that was overhang and what is the biggest thing, when the government comes, only then the government tells the biggest stories, now those stories are again Aravali. This Global City of Wildlife Century Sona is to be built here, the area of ​​Sector 3637 is fine, all this will be revived because now by doing something  If you want to show it, otherwise what will you do? You have to do something and why not? If you have come into politics then you will increase the economic activity. Because by increasing the economic activity everyone will benefit. The opposition will also benefit and the government will also benefit.  Now it will happen to the leader, it will happen to you, it will happen to me, it will happen to the villagers too, it will happen to everyone, whoever has the wisdom, intelligence, consciousness, mind can use it, now we are hearing that 100,100 crores will happen in Gurgaon. DLF is going to loot 100 crore flats by doing Dhaliya, it is the most expensive project in the whole of India. So brother, now you have understood what Gurgaon is. Brothers and sisters, if Gurgaon has been brightened by the BJP government and there is also hope in it.  Rao Narveer ji, because brother is the representative here, we will keep him in high regard, plus if he gets a good one, then I will also pray, recommend him and it is also our benefit. Even if he gets a very good portfolio because it has not been distributed yet, till the time this video is being made, I don't know if he becomes Deputy CM. My demand is for Deputy CM, otherwise brother, then Home Ministry or which other good one is Finance. Not at all less than that or if TCM is fine, then no more than that because the body language is good, he is a hardworking man, so he too will make it, why can't I make it, maybe I will talk much further, if not this then this.  Who knows if the next CM comes from here, I don't know, but this fort is being built, so to me, 152 years of Bolar Gurgaon real estate is looking very clean, without any interruption, the knock and knock is clear, so that if and but system has been removed, angel.  Seeman, I told that the people of Delhi will come. What is the result of Aam Aadmi Party? The elections in 2025 will also reveal soon how soon the people of Delhi will come. My target is to increase the population.  I tell you the target is 20 lakh people, hey 20 lakh, don't think that all 20 lakh will do the job, there will be brothers and father in it, there will be mothers too, there will be wives, there will be children too, there will be jobs, maybe only 5 lakh, then one lakh i.e. a year.  1 lakh job per year is nothing for an economy like Gurgaon, you will have to pay this much, 1 lakh job, growth of 1 lakh job means different things because one direct job is 1 lakh.  Job means only 25000 direct jobs because for every one direct job, there are three indirect jobs and indirect jobs to sustain them. These are also the things of economics. I can explain them separately some other time but I have told you the figures and if  If 20 lakh people are coming, then 5 lakh units are needed. For four people to live in a house, 4 lakh units are needed. How much is the supply? Can be counted because brother, in the next 5 years.  If I want 4 lakh units, then if I launch something today, it will be available in the sixth year, so count the programs that have been launched till now, what I have counted is not even 1 lakh units for you people.  I have counted all the affordable housing, I have found out the rule of stilt plus 4 and it will be built in that too and how can it be built in how many, I have counted that too and it does not look like luxury, it is worth five, five, six, seven, seven crores. Man gets scared, he doesn't know how many, count them in quantity, count them in quantity, count them in quantity, count them in quantity, rents will increase, when rents will increase, property rates will also increase, those who have taken it, many people in Gurgaon want to sell it in resale.  If it is for resale, I will make a separate video. We are busy in the projects. Brother, if you want to sell then tell me. There are only buyers and now what I told Femina, if you wait for six to eight months. So, whatever has just come out of my mouth, it will start getting published in the newspapers. You people know that whatever comes out of my mouth, when I tell you further, it comes out and you see that thing happening that yes brother, this or that thing would have happened.  It looks fine, this is just for Congress to win, there is some mistake in this, the world has made a mistake including BJP, them themselves, so they can't do anything on this thing, but then it is very good, it is extremely good for real.  Estate in Gurgaon, what is the harm to the people of Gurgaon, there is direct benefit from the arrival of BJP, the people here have won the people here, they are becoming ministers, the same government is a double engine government and I forgot to tell you one more thing further.  I will tell you in the video because for so long, no new thing will come in Gurgaon. Gadkari ji, if he introduces airport taxi, then the airport taxi will not reach till Bahadurgarh 2nd row, it will be from Delhi to Gurgaon only. You will be lucky, Sirsa airport is not going to come to Fatehabad now because things will be expensive, any new thing, new technology, any new thing will come here only, so I am extremely extremely bullish and bullish, look at the rates.  What is available in FD at 6, 7, if you invest in mutual fund at 9, 10, 11, then brother in absolute sense, if the rate is increasing at 10, 12.  But if you are giving the year and money slowly, then you are getting 151 in it, this is the bullish run, it will increase by 100%, double double double, Babu Bhai, the money will triple in 21 days, this scheme is not telling, I have come up with the scheme.  No, I am telling you that the rate which is currently sitting will increase further. Already the rate has increased a lot, so in absolute sense, 10-12% of the money will gradually go up by 15%.  Don't dream more than this, it is okay and this is it, maybe some year it may be less, some year it may be more, those returns are spread out, sometimes earlier you get it, many later, but the rough mathematics, I told you guys. How did you like the given video, tell me, subscribe to the channel and this is my second great channel, in which politics is discussed openly and beyond, many people are appreciating it with Googlegroups.com, with political party, with political leader, with them. more love  Don't get carried away in love, love for your wife, love for your children, respect for your parents, focus more on these and what is your own progress because the politician sees his progress very accurately in what I benefit from and we are with him.  By getting involved in their progress, we forget our own, so now we have been given a chance and here, those who want to invest in Gurgaon are people from Haryana or they are, so I will not use the word.  Why pressure, pressure, now a new government has come, they also get a chance for six months, there is a honeymoon period, but they should say that we are trying like this, brother, increase the rates of our properties. What happens in increasing the rates of properties?  We grow only when things become good, when your water will not be filled, there will be no garbage, the red light system will be removed, people will move from up and down, there will be no jam, law and order will be good, people will feel safe and all.  Something good will happen, public transport will be better, something like metro will be done, now there was a person like me in Gurgaon earlier, but if the population of Gurgaon seems to be going towards 45 lakhs, then brother, we need metro now, the time has come till now. So it was not included, now if you start doing something else like laying pillars of metro then start doing all those things because this city has a lot of potential, Gurgaon itself will be worth one crore in 15 years. Because of the population, I had just told you that it will increase by 20 lakhs in the next five years, it will increase further as the jobs keep coming and then it will keep running, so that infrastructure and that work will remain a work in progress. I also want to tell you, the people of Gurgaon, that for the next 10-12 years you will see things being built, you will keep seeing things being built, so don't be sad in that too, it is being built well, so it has great potential.  Real estate will do very well. Subscribe to the channel, like it, write in the comment section, tell me how to make the video. We will keep bringing projects now, which ones will come and how, if you"

    "title": "How New Long Term Capital Gain Tax Rule Will Benefit Real Estate ？ [eVcdprzPPsI].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, long term capital gain tax on real estate indexation benefit has been removed. Beyond this, I have come to give clarity to you that this is very good for real estate, brothers and sisters, not bad, higher order thinking has to be done, not first order, I am India's.  Number One Real Estate Clarity Giver I am going to explain this to you very well, it will not be difficult to understand carefully, but let me explain simple mathematics. What is indexation benefit? There is an index by which you  The acquisition cost, which is incurred on multiple sales of your property, increases more after adjusting for inflation. I will tell you as an example that 20 years ago, you bought a flat on lets for Rs 20 lakhs and today you sold it for Rs 1 crore. Brothers and sisters, how many?  If you bought for Rs 20 lakhs and sold it for Rs 1 crore, then we will calculate what was the situation before this rule came. The situation was that your acquisition of Rs 20 lakhs.  The cost is 20 lakhs, it will not be considered, an index formula will be used in it, today that index was running at 363 per cent, it started from 2000, that index has increased from 100 to 363 per cent, today it is around 3,363 per cent, so approximately it was 117, 20 years ago.  Three times the cost can be considered as its acquisition cost. If the price is Rs 60 lakh then the acquisition cost is Rs 60 lakh. Suppose you sold Rs 1 Crore and got a profit of Rs 40 Lakhs. According to the tax on this Rs 40 at Rs 20, you would have had to pay tax of Rs 8 Lakhs, then this figure would be Rs 8 Lakhs. Remember what has happened now, all this mathematics has been removed and it was said that it is easy.  Off that is, what is that, I will tell you that the real estate will be boosted, the maximum benefit of the government is due to the real estate boost, that is what I will tell you, so what is the law now, this is the law that you have taken the thing worth Rs. 20 lakhs.  If it was sold for one crore then the profit was 80 lakhs, all the goals are missing, now you have to pay 80 lakhs at 125, then 80 lakhs off at 125, if you calculate then how much will be the profit. If it comes close to 10 lakhs then it will be 2 lakh rupees.  There is a gain, there is a gain in the sense that you will have to pay more or you can call it a loss, you should know the rough mathematics. First of all, before crying, you should know the rough mathematics that if it is worth one crore rupees.  If I take the same thing for example, if you had bought it 5 years ago, you would have bought it in 2000 20, like its indexation benefit was very less and there was not that much appreciation, in so many years the number was 301, so it was a very high number, the older the property.  There had to be more benefit in that amount, so now it has been understood that if the property is 20 years old and is worth Rs. 20 lakhs and if it is worth Rs. 1 crore then  If it makes a difference of Rs 2 lakh then extrapolate beyond this x2 - But still it is beneficial, I will explain how. Now understand carefully, even if you have to pay more tax, there is a provision to save long term capital gain tax. We have Rs 2 crore, so if I invest Rs 80 lakh in fresh property.  If I give what is my capital gain, then my capital gain tax will be adjusted and it will become zero. How else do I benefit from this and how can I take benefits one on one? Let me explain whether this is a limit of Rs 2 crore or make it Rs 4 crore.  Can something else be done? How can it be played? Before crying which is the habit of the middle class, move ahead in everything, understand that now there is no choice but people will reinvent at least the Gains: If someone wants to marry his daughter by selling his property, everyone knows that a person either buys a property or maybe he is sending his child to a foreign country, it could be a huge expense or if he is marrying a child, then everyone  There is no need to get married. Brother, if you invest the capital gain that has been made in the property, then that tax will be saved and you can spend as much as you had on the property. If you have told me a very easy method then the person will buy the property only.  sell property  Will buy only property and tax can be zero then what is the problem because now real estate will be better than long term equity because there is a provision to save, there is no saving, according to me the prediction is also that all these rates  Will also gradually increase, one day everyone's rate will be 30, but as the middle class gets a little richer, the load will come beyond that, this is the truth of life, many people write 'my' like this, oh this is very bad.  five crores Yes, the property is so expensive, should I get a Dubai visa, should I get a golden visa, then why don't I go, it is not easy to go, brother, what will I do after going there? People are happy and want to know about Dubai.  So I will give you clarity about Dubai also, there were big options, I also used to think like this, the only difference between me and you is that whatever you think today and I used to think 5 years ago, I can only claim a little.  all human  Beings go by these emotions and if something was so easy to do then many people would have done it. What are the conditions, what are the benefits, what are the benefits, will tax be saved, is tax really saved? If the income is being generated from India, then what from Dubai?  Jax is saved, can I save my friends, what happens, yes, you can go and do it, there is some problem, it is not that easy, so I hope you understand in this thing that how much difference it has made, the difference is big, paying tax but like this  Not there.  That someone is a game changer, brother, two and a half percent has increased there, if yours was at 10, if 10 is in the equity market then it has increased at a clean rate, here also the same percentage is coming as per the calculation which I told you, the same % is that of 20.  But I told this with the help of this example but why would I give it if I can adjust it, at 99% of the price of property purchase, people buy property only after selling it and if no one feels like selling it, then it is in the market.  This means that the supply is not coming. Brother, he will say no, I do not sell. If I have to pay so much tax, I keep it. So, such supply is not coming in the market. How will it become cheaper for the buyer. Tell me how to reduce the price of the property.  The property will become anything. We say that there is a negative in real estate. Where is the negative? Brother, I am saying that there is no negative for the equity market too, that too by the time the market gets closed, once it falls, we would have digested this much.  Let's do it gradually, this is called Boyle Frog Syndrome, gradually we will adjust, increase it to 2.5, then 2, then one, then take half, they will take the complete details on my Guruji from Gurugram channel, this is what I told 20 things.  If you were wondering what are the take aways, subscribe to that channel also. If you have n't done so, then read the other wise comment section on Real Estate Webinar Info Group, which is now an opportunity that has arisen.  It is clear that real estate is emerging as a go to investment from the government side also but the market is for the aware investor. You cannot blindly decide where to buy something and at what rate. It is a pick and choose market. Location specific city specific builder specific asset size specific payment plan specific ticket size specific demand supply specific local gentry  Specific, now people like us are feeling very good because now people like us will be respected a little because now guidance will be needed in the market, he is another wise, so I told Nana, in one year it turned out that donkeys, horses, lame, donkeys are lame, sir.  I didn't know who was there, there was so much dust flying, you couldn't distinguish but now you have to know, you have to know, this is the thing I teach to you people who want to learn. You join the Real Estate Webinar Info Group. Real Estate Mentoring Program is also going on. That is a paid course of Real Estate. If you want to join then short form of Rump Real Estate Mating Program is available on the given number. Now you can  People have the clarity that they do not need to worry about it because all the tax can be saved, like in the equity market, capital gain of Rs. 1.25 lakh can be saved, there is nothing to be done for that.  The government said, come on, what is the capital gain of a common man, he will not have to pay up to Rs. 1.25 lakh, if he has long term gain in equity up to Rs. 1.25 lakh in a particular year, if it is up to Rs. 2 lakh then he will have to pay tax.  You will have to pay more than that 1.25 lakh, so I hope you have understood that there is a limit there, here the limit is Rs 2 crore, so the real estate is Rs 2 crore versus Rs 1.25 lakh. The winner brothers and sisters, real estate is the winner because for a common man, Rs 2 crore is a lot of capital gain adjustment, so I hope and after that, the quantity tax is to be paid on Rs 125, beyond that, I have cleared this thing.

Names can be there, we can take names, what can I say if it is not their name, it is their washerman's name, it is their milkman's, it is their cart driver's name or any other name, if it sounds like a bad name, then brother, its intentions are very bad and many more like this.

    "title": "If Delhiwallas Are Buying In Gurgaon Then Who Is Buying In Delhi ？ [QOP6n9eg-54].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, If Delhi Wallas is buying in Gurgaon and due to which the real estate of Gurgaon is running away since last one and a half year then I am buying in Delhi, this question will be answered, under this video everyone will get to know who are interested in Gurgaon real estate, Delhi.  Those who are looking for end use or investment in this region, please share this video, like the channel and subscribe.  Let's start in Delhi, you know that when any property is sold, the buyer's compulsion is more important than the seller's compulsion and what is that compulsion? Okay, today I may not be wearing anything of that color, but you guys can visualize that color.  It 's okay, only my eyebrows will be visible, that's okay, so that one is a limitation, so that limitation is when the people of Delhi used to sell things earlier, two-three years ago, they used to buy builder floors, now that builder floor issue.  be cool Since the time the policy has been implemented, it has been hanging in the balance for the last one and a quarter year and I am looking forward to it for the next one and a half year and even when it comes, even if it comes, it will take two-three years for the house to be built.  Even if it takes 2 years to 2.5 years from today, you cannot buy a new builder floor even if you want. Even if the policy changes today and you start building a house the day after tomorrow, it will still take one and a half years for the supply to reach the market and this is like this.  yes  If not, then this matter has been put aside. Now the people of Delhi also buy it in that color. They are chasing the resale stuff. Like the pace of yours, there is a lot of growth in some projects on Dwarka Expressway which is nearing completion. Now I will tell you who is buying and the topic is the same but what is happening, I am telling you that these people are those who are coming to Gurgaon, these are those people whose children or  Is there any link of Next Generation to Gurgaon? First of all, these are those who have got something in Delhi through inheritance and after getting half of it or cannot buy anything in Delhi now, so they are moving into it, so these are two types of people.  B. Old people who have been living in Delhi for 40-50 years and their age should be 55-70. C. Those who are not selling are still being taken by their children whose parents agree. Even if they go to 75, 80, 85, 90, then those who are 50, 55 are left who are working themselves or their children are going to do it or are doing it, sons and daughters-in-law are working, those people are coming, then those who buy property from them inside Delhi. Yes, it is only the Delhi resident who is buying, not the outsider who is buying Delhi or Delhi property. Now who is the Delhi resident who is buying? Now we will talk a little about economics on this, all the businesses that are done inside Delhi. Sunset industry will be called just selling goods, there is no such manufacturing, there is no such great services, there is no IT, there is no sunrise sector which is there in the next 30, 40, 50 years, the jobs, where there will be money, all those things are not there in Delhi. Yes, restaurants are running, hotels are running, goods are being sold in Chavadi market, there is a wholesale market, yes, this is Chandni Chowk, this one is money, now you know which money is.  So this person whose business is running so much in Delhi, now this person settles the money in Delhi only because now he is not able to settle it in Gurgaon or his desire is so close to his heart that his everything is in Delhi.  So when he upgrades, let's say someone is living in Uttam Nagar or I am taking all the names, he does not want to create a stir in Delhi that this is low Delhi, this is high Delhi, but you understand that.  Who wants to go to a better place in Delhi  The one who was living in 150 yard floor, the one who was living in 130 yard floor, the one who wants to go to 200-250 yard floor, the one who wants to take two floors, the one who wants to do better, he buys from them and they are buying here.  So this passing the parcel is going on, the rest of the Lutyens' Delhi is an expensive Delhi where things worth Rs 17,100 crore, 150 crore are taken by a different gentry, that is from outside.  They need an address in Delhi and the big money earned in the equity market. The company will be listed, it will be D-listed or whatever this type of system is, the people are different but within Delhi, only the people of Delhi are taking it and the people of Delhi are the population of Delhi.  If it is Rs 2.5 crores, then this is the purchase that happens in Delhi, which is called the 'Pudiya' which revolves around the one who bought from this, bought from this and one person went out, one person went out and the other one is about inheritance, which is also done by the people of Delhi.  kids out  They have settled in America or anywhere else. When their property in Delhi is sold, then naturally, if they want to buy it in India after selling the property in Delhi, then they are buying it in Gurgaon, 15-20 kilometers away.  Again, I will repeat, Delhi's property is being bought by the one from Delhi and it is being upgraded from below, it is getting upgraded like this, what is a small loan, sometimes you take that money, you take 40 rupees to upgrade a little.  There is a shortfall of Rs 50-60 lakh and many a times someone takes a loan to complete it. These things are also happening, so we should not get confused that everyone is going to Gurgaon, so Delhi, there are many people in Delhi, Baba. Your only Dwarka is 2.5 crores. Dwarka has a population of 18 lakh 20 lakhs. There is a Dwarka which is a separate area of ​​Delhi, so out of Dwarka 18 20 lakhs, if 5 people are of 1 lakh people.  If you want to come near Dwarka Expressway, then you need 25000 units of flats. What happens many times is that people go in cars, there are many mummies who are showing children. Hey brother, these flats are coming like matchboxes, how much will they fill?  This is how I have heard people raising questions, whether all the mothers are mothers or those who are our elders as parents, the question remains that when they do it like this, they cannot count while standing there looking at it. Do it brother, there is a project, 500 is flat, 1000 is flat, 1500 is flat, 600 is 700, 800 is 300, 500 is like that, okay, multiply it by four, then when you add all the things and multiply them all by four, it will still be worth lakhs.  If you need 25000 flats to get the figure then you will see 3040 projects if you have 25000 flats.  You will see that I am asking you to count the affordable housing also, do it somehow, however, the people of Delhi are not buying the affordable housing by selling the property in Delhi. There is a different crowd of affordable housing, okay, the people of Delhi are expensive things.  We are only buying it because in Delhi it is sold at a decent place for 150-200 yards and you can easily buy it in Gurgaon for so much money, it is okay, so this one from Delhi is in the market right now.  The system has started, this is what I want to say, Delhi is worth 2.5 crore Delhi. Brothers and sisters, if Delhi on 4 wants to come to Gurgaon in the next 4 years, then Delhi on 4 means 10 lakh people, 10 lakh people i.e.  If divided by 4 then 2.5 lakh units are required and at 4 it means that every year only 1 person will come to Delhi. At just 1, out of every 100 people will want to come to Gurgaon, although the number may be more but  If a person wants to come then only one out of 100 and if only four people want to go in the next 4 years, then lakhs of units are required, there is no supply, there will be a lot more boom in 2025 and 26, if you will see ready to move in real estate, then it will be available anywhere right now.  It seems that you are getting tired but once you let the Dwarka Expressway connect with the Delhi side, then you will know more because the people of Delhi who have to sell their property will still have to buy it.  There is no pain, maybe he could have sold his property and bought a flat of 2500 square feet and he kept sleeping. I don't know that now after selling it, even if the property has increased to 25 in Gurgaon, then he is still holding 2000 square feet.  If he takes it further then he will take hold of 1800 square feet, he will take hold of 1800 square feet, the products will keep coming here in those sizes, so he is not giving much thought to it, nor is he following it, just like there is any stock, now it is available from ₹ 1.  It is going towards 500, once it was 100, now it has become 350, it is going towards 500, so now you see it at 350 for the first time and you analyze it, you think that it will go to 500, so you buy it, you are not. Badarda and I have become worth ₹ 1000000, sometimes it was worth 100, 200, 300 too, if you did not buy it, then what happened?  If I am talking about taking an example, there are buyers at every point and a fresh supply is coming, but the window shopper, as I say in the webinars, is my window shopper, the window shopper who stays for a long time, brother, the world is not bought. What are you saying, I am telling you my own meaning, suppose a project has been taken and that project is doing very well and the rates have increased a lot and there seems to be an insistence on taking the increased rates, this is also a fact.  The one who has bought an ADAC 0 p now thinks, should I buy something else? This is psychology. However, the investor should have only one criterion that how much strength is there in the thing I am buying and what is its future potential.  He should not think about how much I had taken earlier and this is how I take the second one but it is very difficult to execute in real life so I also tell the window shoppers.  I am saying that now is the time for action, if you are sitting with money and are on the sidelines then you should choose something as per the requirement and take the plea because people are saying like what is happening, I will give you an example.  I tell you under this, it will be fun, many people are eating puris, it is okay that the puris are being fried, and the people making puris are tired, okay, the fryers are tired, the oil is running out, so some people will feel that that's it, man.  This is about to end, that's it, the program is fine and right now it is crowded, that means this is a program for those who do not know how much flour is still left and 20 fresh people are sitting and what is this langar, I will tell us.  It seems that I too was very evolved in all these things or I am a little bit. Well, it seems like this to everyone, then those who knead the dough change, the oil barrels do not come, the eaters do not come, the people who celebrate do not come.  do not come And the program keeps going on, it does not stop, we feel that we have been standing here for a long time, we have seen so many people eating, we have seen so much being prepared, now this should be stopped, neither the eaters nor the cooks will come.  They will come and this food will also be finished, it doesn't happen, the program keeps going on, you are like these people have changed, the shift will change, the goods have changed, okay, the dish has changed or it will continue because who can see ahead?  You can also see supplies like mine  You can also see the demand, you are seeing both the things, the party has not started yet, the people from Delhi have yet to come, they have started coming now, only the very smartest of the smartest Delhi people have made that call, now even the normal Delhi people have made that call. So the story has not reached, okay it will reach him then it will happen and that exchange will happen and only Delhiites will buy it in Delhi. There is a population of 2.5 crores in Delhi. So tell us how you liked the video. You can get one in the comment section. Please join by clicking on it. Thank you very much, Yuri!"

    "content": "Hello friends, there is an advice to the builders in Gurga real estate about pricing and the public also has to support in this and the public will also understand what is the matter. Builders also watch my videos, all their employees watch it, fellow tubers also watch it and me.  It feels good to get feedback and also understand things because no one in India explains the things like I explain, that is why I am India's number one clarity giver. Start on this topic now.  Let's do this and you tell whether you got clarity or not and let's start talking about Gurgaon real estate. Recently, for the last two to four months, not even two to four, two to two and a half months, the projects have become expensive and all of them are not being sold and all of them are  No, it is being shown like this, I mean, what is being shown like this, it is being felt by all including the builders that they have come down a bit in real estate, I am going to tell you the psychological phenomenon of this. I am going to ask questions, I am going to talk about pricing in a very deep and intelligent manner, which you will not be able to teach even in Harwada, I am giving this knowledge here, so listen to it and all the salespeople and all the builders who decide the pricing.  All the big names out there, listen to what I am going to talk about and you will understand a lot and if it is your Lalaji's company, then you can tell Lalaji, if you are a listed player, then your listed CFO.  Or explain to whoever is your CEO and MD through this video. Let's start the discussion. The bike comes down a bit. Yes, let's talk about the pricing. The slogan of crossing 400 was given by Modi ji and Seat came in 240 240.  It is a very great seat, the government has been formed, it is fine and will run smoothly. Before this, Atal ji has run the government with 182 MPOs. Manmohan Singh has done the first task with 145 MPOs and the second one has done 206.  Why I am talking of politics because of perception, I am talking about 400 was 240 looks like a failure, meaning actually if you see the face of BJP people, see that of ministers, see that of ND people, then their moral is low and those Congress people are like that. Like we have won, we are seeing this, I also have a separate political channel, I tell different things there, but I am trying to connect it with real estate, try this.  I am telling you that if you have done that then I am guiding the builder that please go back to the drawing board. Go back 3 for five years in Gurgaon real estate history. You have launched a project, in this you will go through five, six and seven phases.  You can also latch it and it is not built at once, all the towers are not erected at once, the pricing you are doing by selling it at one time, then you are taking a middle pricing which is high and people also  It seems high and I know that because I also do the calculations that if the guy makes it in 7 years then the pricing is not much. I also know because cement bars are cheap after 4 years and what will happen after 6 years because you have  If all the towers are to be built together, then the builder does this by insuring his profit and ensuring that there is no loss. You can also call the average unit rate as to how much average is to be taken, then here is the advice to the builders. And the public is also advised to put pressure on the builders that brother, when you have seven towers, 10 towers, 12 towers, you have to launch at different times and I will also show examples of projects which have been very successful here and people  I liked it very much and every buddy is happy and I will also tell you what are its benefits and you tell me whether this thing is playing out like I am telling you or not.  I am thinking that if the first phase is launched at one price, then if I have to get an average of 18000 feet, I am telling the builders, then initially I should launch 16000 feet and then launch it at 15-16 feet and they will feel that yes, the rate is fine.  And if I don't sell the entire stock, then I will take it to 7:5, then to 18, 183, 19, 20. My case is from 16 to 20.  When I took the case, the average came out to be 18, but all the time the person who was buying saw the price increasing, the trigger was visible, there was a satisfaction. If you remove this 18, then whoever is coming in the beginning, it starts increasing.  It doesn't look like it happened in one year or two. Then he starts dreaming of resale and selling the goods in the market because his value is fair and if he had left some juice it was Rs 16000 in 18 years. He is not going to suffer any loss, I am also telling him about it.  I am telling you but because by the time that thing is ready its rate would have increased but there is no such patience in the market now to release this after 3 years and the builders are making mess here because they are not giving you the trigger here Shahpur.  Yes, this is a project, Shobha in 102, in 108, those people gave it at different times and at different prices, it kept getting sold slowly, it got cooked easily, so that means Khichdi Birbal's Khichdi is still being made.  If you are not ready then why are you so greedy so soon? Sell all the builder's property. Expand the land. Become a tycoon now. Beat DLF and make market cap of Rs. 18 lakh crore. Brother, be satisfied with Rs. 18000 crore, 200 thousand crore. Now will you speak? Who is cheating which company is that Bizarre Market, you can go to Jagga, even those worth Rs 50,000 crores are doing the same, even the unlisted ones are doing the same.  As if there is no tomorrow, sell the goods here immediately, book ahead, now people will say that when you sell one, the goods go to the escrow account, you cannot buy another land with that money, I call myself the number one clarity giver, so that is very true.  If it is one and a half, two or two and a half, they will write, 'Hey, this is how it becomes small, listen, no, I cannot take that money, but if my sales are this much, then my market cap increases, then by increasing the debt to equity ratio, I can get more money.  So I can take it, right now I am a person worth Rs 10 crores. Suppose a person can take a loan of Rs 4 crores from LETS, then if he becomes worth Rs 20 crores then he will take Rs 8 crores. You understand my point, sales will increase.  And with your sales booking, your reputation in the market increases. If he has sold it, then it is okay. In fact, your cost of funds goes down. Your rating increases. Borong Rating knows BBB Plus a P  a - A+ You will know all about how the cost of funds is found, so the builder keeps expanding, doesn't the builder keep taking more loans as if he thinks that if my goods are sold then he will get money for this, so this is his money. I will come soon. If you take the money of many investors and bite more than chew, then you may vomit because they cannot eat. If my mouth is only this much, then there is a limit to everyone's mouth. If you put more than that then you will have to chew.  For  You need some space to chew the cud, if you are understanding then many builders are trying to do this, if there is something then they have guidance brother, yes you will go, by doing it all in such a hurry, you will spoil the environment, now you cannot complete the project at one go.  If you meet then it becomes like a failure in the market. Come YouTube and other YouTubers also, who are fellow YouTubers, I am teaching economics. Come, don't directly say that the market is cold, the market is not cold, it is just that if all the goods are not sold.  It will be sold but the problem is that it will be sold, that rate should have been Rs 16000, it should have been sold gradually, one tower and two towers were sold, then in 6 or 10 months, two towers and the house which is ours is fine.  They are following this and their work is going well. Those who bought in the first phase are so happy. The one who bought it has a smile on his face. He is watching the price rise. When you have sold all the goods in one go, then no one can  There is no tagger, no one is asking, someone says, 'Guruji, what do you say? We have to sell within two six months. I said, your pit is not God's, it is not bricked, all the goods have been sold. Now look, if there are 10, 15, 20, 25 units left, they have got all the goods.  It is said that it is sold, some are upstairs units, some are eight room units, some are here on the top floor, some are facing messing here, some are left, that is a different matter, no one understood that.  The units will be sold, they will be sold even after 10-15 months, but a huge amount of goods have been sold, so how can anyone buy from you, how will you justify to a person that why should you pay such a premium here because till now nothing has been done, there is all the goods.  It has been sold, where is the trigger, is there any trigger that yes, this tower was priced at Rs 16000, it is ok, now after so many days, it is being launched at Rs 1730, it is being launched at Rs 18.  So if this much payment has been made, then come on, do something for Rs. 165/16800/- 177000. Now what will the builder do? He can come up with a sexy payment plan for this one so that it is not resold because the next person will get it, so much money will go into it and the builder will have to pay it.  This should always be done in the beginning, do more construction, do it quickly, and what will happen with it, whoever is your contractor, whatever agreements are made with the builder, if that is your time frame.  If it is kept small then there is not much market fluctuation, then you can reduce the pricing because take the cement bars and all the other stuff in it, it is installed late in 2024, it has to be installed in 2026 and it has to be installed in 2028, so brother, their rates are  It may be different if the inflation increases, what have you done, what are the builders doing, which is wrong according to me, out of greed, they sell everything by keeping a big account of it all.  So the person who is taking this in the beginning is giving this rate and then he is taking this rate, then here you will see the market becoming stagnant, this is the message to every buddy, I hope I was able to explain it right by doing this.  If not then people explain it step by step, but then my channel is for two people, those who understand all the things, those who do n't, brother, you understand the payment plan, you understand the discount, you understand this for them. Stories will be told in future. If there is any builder who is very intelligent and is watching my video, bring the goods from 10 to 11000 feet, there is no need to sell everything, it is okay and keep the density a little more. These are the dreams of Hero Hiralal, not here.  People will come outside to shower flowers, reduce it a bit, this is not true anyway, it's useless, I will make a club house, brother of 2 lakhs worth 3 lakhs, everyone did not want it, it is not everyone's business. Play for 6.5 crores, do the work that has to be done, people with 5 crores have to pay two rupees, brother, everyone does not want a Land Rover, people are sitting in karetta too, want Desire also, if you want every kind of material, then any builder will come in 101 thousand feet.  For me, I will support him. From my side, if you have taken the price around 11000, then you cannot go below that. I do not see the rate going below 1112. Whatever the builder does, increase the density.  Do this, do that, do anything, it doesn't seem to go less than 111, but if the builders are listening to me, bring it in 1112 as per the payment plan, don't do it all at once and do it at different times and your  Take out the average of Rs 1415, any project worth Rs 111, brothers and sisters, listen carefully, it is not going to be built before seven to eight years, all the material has been sold, go to their RERA and check the projects in RERA. I have seen the date of 2031, it can also be 32 for some people, but I have seen for many projects, RERA date is 2031, it is RERA date, that is, he is making it till then, so no one can say anything to him. Why are you delaying till 31st, there is RERA due even after that, you have seen that if we increase everything then 31st of 31st can become 32nd 33rd and that will affect the market here.  They are saying like this, a lot of Loach are coming, but the positions are not coming, my brother, Loach and Loach are also not much, if you actually count, it is a different matter that Loach comes in that budget segment, where perhaps there is not so much demand now, no.  There is a big demand for every but that means there are many people who are saying that only these big puris are coming, some want small ones, some don't want big ones, okay, so I am saying give me a small one.  Give me brother, give me something small, it is not small, this one is coming, this one is also going, but these people are sitting like this, in this city, there is no city left for us, that is, a middle class man whose budget is one and a half and a half  Even if he is earning Rs 2.5 crores, he is not getting anything. He has gone into affordable housing and increased the rates of affordable housing where he has a position, meaning the rate is Rs 7580-85 lakh and this is for those flats which are  Those with 600 sq ft have not yet come in the market. I think there is a position in affordable housing with 645 sq ft. I am not aware of it. If you have any information, please write in the comment section. Other wise, whatever the position is.  525 35 40 types have come and they have become so expensive, so when they bring 645, the affordable housing will become 1.25 crores, so now  If you are looking at where the rate is going, then you see this in the rate, the per square feet rate of affordable housing has been eaten up in resale, so I am thinking very thoughtfully and saying 111000 square feet, no matter who launches it, you will get 11000 all inclusive rate.  I am saying that in 1112, don't ask me to add PLC again, GST is fine, I am doing GST and PST by combining everything. Builders listen to me a lot, understand and see, some even agree.  If you have then give a rate of 11 to 12 brothers and don't sell the goods in one go. Are you in a hurry by selling all the goods in one go? Shaper ji's goods were sold in 5 years. It is a great hit project. Rose also increase the rate gradually.  Have to cross the limit, see at what rate did they have lunch at four BH and at what rate did they have lunch at the first T BH and it is still going very well. Okay Shobha, see at what rate did they take lunch first.  And how did the rates increase there? How did the rates increase there? Okay, so those who took it in all the projects are very happy because those who took it in the last one too, like in Shobha, Vista wale, 000 probably came out okay, 15,16,000 and that too.  We are sitting at 21 22. Okay, so every buddy is very happy, the builder is happy, the buyers are happy, even like this, the goods are sold.  It is possible that I don't want to take the names of the rest of the projects which are all sold out. Now there is no trigger in them, no one will buy or say that when they are made then they will see the trigger like lan is lan is giving trigger, lan has made some goods, has made its own.  Meaning, some goods have been sold, now RERA will bring another one, then it will separate it, then separate it again, then it will say 'iconic tower', finally, by doing something like this, and who knows for how much will it sell these 35000 after four, five, six years, what will be the designing, what will be the calculation.  if it happens  There is a smile on the face of those who have bought it from the beginning. In the announcement, resale is not available even after asking. And there is an announcement for you all, if you people are interested, all the people who are subscribers, announcement in Shobha and Godrej Meridian, if you want to buy in resale.  If you are interested in selling, then you can connect on the given number. My advice will be this, do not sell to the sellers, but brother, still someone in the house needs money and has to sell or money.  If you do n't have it, then it is a compulsion. It is okay to sell out of compulsion. This is what I am saying. If there is no compulsion among the three, then don't sell. But if there is, then connect so that you can get the right rate. You and those who want to buy, brothers and sisters, buyers.  There are many people who want to buy whatever they want, meaning what is the situation today in resale, there are 10 sellers, 100 buyers and even that 10 is not being dealt with, the truth is that if there are 100 buyers and  If there are 10 sellers, then 10 should be sold, no, they are not being sold for 10, because there is so much space available, and when you go to sell in resale, someone quotes some rate and then the buyer says, but now the market is down, why not? Because why did he say that because brother, if it has not crossed 400 yet then it is down to 240, hey, the government is formed, what is down, what is down, if a builder sells his goods even at 30.  There is a lot of inventory, friend, after that every month I have to sell the inventory on 1st and the project will be ready in 70 months, that is, it takes 6 years and seven years, when is the last position of Shaper ji to come, count, work has been done even in Covid.  Worked the fastest, I have been given the position of four towers, the one who is the fastest, the best is the topper student, the rest are all behind him, if Shaper ji is taking seven years to hand over.  The full project than others will take 8 9 10 years Even in affordable housing only, no one has taken care of me by building it in 5 years. Right now it is okay, there is no affordable housing, there is nothing in it, I don't know if there is a swimming pool.  And isn't there a club house? There are three basements dug up and their car parking is nothing. This is a normal thing, brother, it takes five years of time. People have to release brother.  There are NGT bans, there are labor issues, there are rain issues, there is no end, the goods are made as quickly as people are thinking, so be pragmatic in life and in 2025 26, I experienced a huge boom in real estate again in Gurgaon, which I cannot explain.  But to do that, the builders will have to focus their mind a little on the right things, this ultra luxury, this six seven aa yaar reduce it a little, not more, it reduces a little, it becomes too much, too much.  There are not so many rich people in the whole of India as you mean, maybe you are a seller, then you say like this, put it in my account, then how will that brother who sells in Punjabi Bagh pay for you? Understand this thing, no, not Delhi.  There are many people who want to take it here, there will be demand and user demand, so if someone can give it in the account, it is a very good thing, the Delhi person will come to take it from you, when he is in the position, then the bull run is clear to me.  Bun Run looks like 6 years old in Gurgaon real estate because of demand supply. I am seeing it very clearly. Brothers and sisters, it is very clearly visible that the ruling of your Stale Plus 4 has come. Nothing is going to be created by this, there is no demand or supply, this much rule is like this.  He fired me saying that it would have been better if he had said that he couldn't make it, meaning he didn't just say, ok, take permission from him, take permission from him, and the people in the dub are still saying that we should not make it.  So neither the left one nor the right one will give permission, so leave 6 feet here, leave 6 feet here, will it be made in your 18 feet, will it be 18 in 200 yards, will you make a front of 18 feet, will the front of 18 feet become 100 yards? Make a mess like 100 yards, will you say, friend, if I leave one floor, then I make stall plus 3, then two and a half floors are still there, so now  Will the arrow come out by doing stalk plus 3, meaning what will be the benefit, the rate of the plot is not known to me, what are you saying that if the rate of my plot becomes like this then what is the result or nothing is happening, okay then these people who  Are you happy or not? Maybe the rates will come down. You have to see that the supply is not coming and you cannot do anything until the supply comes, that is, till then the rates will be fixed, if not today then this is the example that I have given. Example: I told that the middle rate is also being taken, here the rate for the third and fourth year is being taken. In order to sell all the goods before the builder, the builder has to keep his rate the same. Many people are following my advice and this is the thing.  Are we doing it or are we rewriting it or changing the payment plan? In the future, the payment plan will be sold. Once again that time will come to sell the payment plan, so the builder should now concentrate on that especially the one who is cash.  Rich who have not yet availed the loan amount can fund the cost as per their plan then do it as per the payment plan. If anyone needs consultation on these things then you can reach out to the builder on how exactly to plan the launch of your product.  What rate to pay, what payment plan to make, I give this guidance and do not call builders among my employees, believe me, your employees do not know, they have come here after doing MBA, children do not have that much knowledge. As much knowledge as I have, I am sitting with number one clarity about what exactly is happening in the market. Whatever he tells you, he will tell you by looking at the past. I am telling you by looking ahead, so I do my consultation by looking at the future, not by seeing this.  His has been sold, his has been sold, ours will also be sold, ours will be sold, no, have you ever seen the train gate, sometimes F, sometimes it closes, have n't you seen the red light and the green light, green green green green green  Green will be red on your time, so I am telling you that it is red on your time, don't try to run away, tell the rate according to the green light. By the time you reached, you had a rare conversation, then your red light came.  So this Guruji will tell you in advance that brother, your red light is about to come on so drive smoothly, why are you bothering, you will get only red light, drive smoothly, wait there for 40 seconds, better than this, slow down the speed a bit so that it stays there for 10 seconds.  hee  You have to wait, it's just right, it was told so simply and all these employees of yours who make so much money, now I don't want to let them down but this is the truth brother, if this is not there then how can this fiasco happen?  You have determined the rate and then you are sitting again because once you have determined the rate and then reducing it, it is as if the market has fallen. Brother, you have missed the price, you have over-anticipated. Ask once what price will be released in the market. We  If you ask such people, we will tell you that our M is also everyone's M. In the market, the buyer's M is buying, the seller 's M is buying, the builder's M is selling, my goods are sold, then an equation can be made between all three things. Isn't it yes brother, this is fine for me, for you, for you too, let's do it right now, let me explain it in detail very well, I will bring the end opportunity if you  Have not joined that group, there are some 599 people in it, you will get a lot of reviews, you will get content, you will get to learn a lot and you will also get access to my paid webinars for free, both for those who have already done it and for those who are about to do so, definitely try the membership of Atletist Special.  If you work in real estate then do this so that you know and if you want to buy assets in real estate then do thank you very much."

    "title": "Is Real Estate A Scam In India ？ Must Watch Video [4GEc0Zj2Ffw].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, recently you must have seen that there was a tweet about real estate, there were many memes made by someone and it got forwarded a lot and beyond that it was real estate in India is a scam and a photo has been shown in it, there is a property by Magnolia. 25  Having bought a flat worth crores in Gurgaon and an inn worth Rs. 25 crores, it is close to $ million dollars and has become a topic of discussion. I am the number one clarity giver on real estate and other topics.  I am telling you something above because look, when you come and tell me about these things, it is fun only when you hit a six on Sho Bakhtar's ball, it is fun, is n't it? There is a good yorker, earlier Waqar used to say yes etc. You have written which Magnolia will you take?  Before that people do like this, my dear Akshay Srivastava ji is from Dubai who shows that it is better to take this than taking it here, take it there, it is like this in Dubai, after doing like that, in this much time, this can come there, you are taking this much.  So much so that I am batting straight from the front foot, the simple thing is that brother, this is worth 25 crores and it is Matton, so I want to put certain things in perspective and you have to listen because see, who will doubt what I say? So you yourself check the most expensive properties and most expensive flats in New York by typing 2 million dollars i.e. 20 crore dollars, that is 3384 dollars.  1600 1700 crore flats 1600 1700 1600 1700 crore flats are expensive and people bought them in 2019 not now 5 years ago 55 million 60 million dollars Here we are talking about 3 million dollars To compare both, they are 202 times more expensive  Flat is a normal thing. What they have done with this flat is I will tell you.  You hold a small city, hold Kota, you hold someone of yours, whatever type, Udaipur, okay, hold Rohtak, my favorite city, Rot, okay, these cities are not some big city, a small city, okay, hold Hisar, okay.  There will be some property there too which will be worth Rs. 2.5 crores. There will be decent good property in these cities. Someone will have built a house of 200-250 yards, this much will be the same. Now someone will say that you are buying here, it would be better than this on Golf Course Road. Nagan worth 2.5 crores is available in Sukhdev apartments. Golf course road is available in Gurgaon. If I am telling you the rates then the road which is the cheapest thing in the place, compare it with the most expensive thing in any city and make nonsense of it. How much will it cost?  It's amazing, what a wonderful thing he did, how fun he did, these are the questions of the middle class, they feel that he is a human being, he has only 25 crores and instead of taking it here, he should take it there in the US. Citizenship is being given by someone's father, what is it, who is giving it to you and what is the property tax there, what is the inheritance tax, what is the maintenance, do you have any idea, don't know how you will buy it, brokerage is charged there in India.  1 But we give up our lives, we do the work, we know that for a flat worth Rs. 100 crores, you will have to pay Rs. 5 crores and there it is not whitey, it is okay, the whole matter is as it is, so say and view very good.  This is not a special view, the smell of Magnolia is there in New York, the view of Magnolia is better, the greenery is looking better, it is better any day, you have thought like this that America is good and India is bad, now what can be treated for it, someone might think like this that  You write the most posh area of ​​Hisar. If there is a good Kothi built inside Bron Nagar of Pathankot, then that person is getting the same respect in that setup as you do when you live in Magnolia.  In India and in Gurgaon, you are in the top point 01 of the country. The same is not true when you stay in the 3 million dollar thing. For example, if you drive a car worth 50 lakhs in India, then you are considered to be Man, he is a nice guy and is driving a car. I am not talking about a very expensive car, but the same cars are very cheap in America and there are many people driving them for Rs. 50 lakhs. They are not considered to be an arrow in a pumpkin, so let me try to explain it with a different example. There are many African countries whose capitals you type, the property inside their capitals is very expensive and 30 kilometers away from the capital city, Zingala is very tribal. What do you mean by property? It is lying there; no one will go there because there they will spear your jhinga lala hur hur and the airport in the capital city. And there are big buildings and expensive ones, very expensive ones, now I am not the one who takes everyone's example and curdled your brains, you people, you yourself, then said to him, it is better to go to that country and take everything from its capital.  Take it in Manhattan, it is a matter of demand and supply, the people who have to go to the mines there and extract diamonds will not live in Manhattan, brother, they will have to live there, the five to six to seven people of Services India.  I am taking the example of Gurgaon in CR flats where you get the same in flats worth Rs 70 to 80 to 90 crores which are not available in America, be it concussion services or your facility even like swimming pool. What are you saying? Yes, go check out their density.  Check the facilities, check the new societies of Gurgaon which have been launched in the last two-four-five years, they are the best in the world, what nonsense are you talking PK?  Made Bhang Hey, I am not talking about the infrastructure of Gurgaon, I am not talking about the city, I am not talking about the country, I am talking about the openness, the greenery, the landscape, the construction, the layout within those 20 acres, 30 acres.  I am talking about the density and facilities, I understand what we do, we get confused with the city and Greater Noida, so take Greater Noida and look at the society.  What is the condition of the people? What is the condition of the people? There is no infrastructure there. Infrastructure is very good in Neemrana, so go and live there. Infrastructure is in Bangalore and Mumbai. Just what has happened in the property that Mukesh Ambani ji bought in Antilia for Rs. 1 crore.  Now its valuation has been made, it doesn't have to be sold, but with that much I had made, after melting it, see, Fay has bought it for 200 million dollars seven years ago. I would say better than that in Manhattan, our Antilia has 28 floors. In Mumbai, we have a 28 storey Antilia in South Mumbai. I bought an apartment in it for the same amount, facing the Central Park. Look at their Central Park property. You can see an example of a property there in New York. That is not even verified. Magnolia is verified for Rs. 25 crores but it is not verified. Plus even if it is, I am saying that after doing it, see who is the most expensive property there.  It's something like It's something like that yours is a very small town Hold it, you are from Sagar district Okay, somewhere in Sagar district, you are very good in studies and you have topped Sagar district May be I am from Sagar district  He is 12th in a school in Delhi, so who are you comparing with that number? You and I, who are the topper student here, are below him.  Fair enough friend, when a rich person lives here, then the address is what he wants to become. Everyone's address is now closed, this will stop like this, when this news will come in December, if not 100 then around 75, 75 flats will be sold on Golf Course Road. Buy DLF in Gurgaon for Rs 100 crores. When Camellia sells Rs 100 crores, it is sold once or twice a year and it becomes news and beyond.  People, how come it is so expensive, now when 75 will be sold, then you tell me, there are 400 more flats which will be sold in the next four years and by the time the last one is sold, you will have made Rs. 1.25 crores for it. You see, then I will not use the word that it is slap but brother.  This is demand and supply. What does every middle class man think about this lady? She is carrying a Louis Vuitton bag. She is carrying a bag worth 35 lakhs. Brother, it is better than this. Take alt, at least you will sit and go. Hey my brother, the one who is taking a flat of Rs. 35 lakhs, has a backlog. If not, then at least she is roaming in the next Q7, she must be roaming in welfare, is it ok for her? Everything is there in the cars and in the house too and I have come to get everything only there, but what does a middle class man do, if I have so much, then I should do this. If you ask a middle class man this, brother, this is Bajaj, Housing is this Bajaj.  from france Brother, why doesn't he take Rs 20000 worth Rs. 1300? Why doesn't he become a tycoon like this by putting Rs. 1300 in Ankur Warku ji's SIP? No, my. You feel good that you are taking the loan which you cannot afford and he is taking it anyway, so you are telling him that no, you should not take it, that it is better than taking so much money.  You buy a house here, he has 100 houses, then go and get a yacht, then his turn comes, no, what is the use of buying this Rolex watch worth 50 lakhs, the watch is made on hand, what is the use of an expensive watch? Hey brother, a watch tells the time, a watch tells the time of a person, so the person who wants to show his time to the world wears an expensive watch so that he can see his time, you all have your own friends who are roaming around wearing Rolex, now they are wearing Rolex.  in the show  If you go to the shop, you don't get it, they say, yes, this is what you have to buy, book it, there is time, there is waiting, everything is happening in life, it is just that the middle class will come and always do this, why to buy this Rolex at 50 lakhs because to make 50 lakhs you will have to earn 80 lakhs because 30 lakhs will go to your tax then you will buy it instead if you had not bought it and had you put it in mutual fund then after so many years  This much happens, after a few years the uncle has already made 100 times of what he is going to spend and his 100 times will become 10,000 times and he is spending it. This middle class is consuming information about things that are happening but they do not understand it.  They are not doing it because what they are doing is looking at it with their software, they are wearing green glasses and if something is happening then they have to beat everyone.  It seems that they will have to make themselves transparent. Brother, the one who is taking it is not taking it with AI. Now at Ambani ji's wedding, his guests were given watches worth two crores. I am not able to understand what is the implication of those taxes.  Would he have had to pay gift tax? Would he have given it? I don't know but he has given it. It is okay. It is possible that a rich man may pay tax but he would have paid tax and then he would have to pay tax on tax because he also gifted it. Don't know his chartered.  go to accountant  What did they do, but brother, if so much is given as a gift, then you have to understand that there will always be a situation where in this is a road, this is a road, on this road, like a golf course here, there is a property worth Rs. 100 crores and here  Sukhdev Apartment Nagina Nagna Apartment is a CGHS society worth two and a half crores. Then here Vipul will become Monte, here he will become Randa, everyone has different rates, new latches of Godrej are coming here. 66000 will come, 35000 will come, everyone has their own ecosystem, all the goods will be sold, all the rates are justified, it is something like that the watches are kept, this one is worth 50 lakhs, this one is worth 5 lakhs, what is the difference, both show the correct time and also for 5000.  There are all kinds of watches, wherever you go, watches worth Rs 50 lakh will be kept, while those worth Rs 5000 will not be kept.  But even if it is worth Rs 5000, it is sold in the same way as are the shoes, now on the same road you do not have the road rate. Now on that road, this is our diamond, this is our gold, this is our silver, this is our copper, this is our soil.  Okay, so if we understand the rate in this way, then earlier people used to say that, this is the average rate, average rate has no meaning, project is rich boys club, brother, we have considered it as circle, now this is the rate, take it. Lo and then many buyers come and say yes, how come these Rolex cars are being sold, how are the watches being sold, how are the Rolex watches being sold so much, these rates have become double, they have become double the rates in the last 2 years. Inside, the rate has gone up to one and a half times, the room rents are priced at Rs 50-60, meaning less than five digits, meaning what used to happen earlier, you could get rooms for Rs 78,000, book on time.  Take a look at a good five star hotel in a good hotel. 17 18 20 22 25 If you cook something for food, then go now in winter. Brother, you say 000000, friend, in this time, I can get cheaper abroad. Keep saying then immediately.  Okay, so this has become a fact, now India has something to say in this, so tell me, look at the share price, where have the luxury brands gone from the hotels and  Who is catering for luxury, where have we gone? So what happens in these comparisons? We can never think of our country that we can also sit on the high table, how expensive it is here, there in America, let's go to New York.  Go there too, homeless people are roaming around, there is a lot of smell of sewerage, there is a lot of smell of weed, I have not been to New York myself, but I get a lot of consultation from New York and at the end of the consultation, when the work is over.  If there is, then I can also have a friendly talk for 5-10 minutes. Yes, if you give some knowledge, then everyone will tell and the people there will not go and do all the rice themselves, they will tell you everything, this is an advantage, they will tell you good things as well as bad things, it is good.  It is not a big deal because reaching there is a good thing. It is good for the one who reaches there and has his own house. It is better for the one who cannot take it. If I had it with me, I would have taken it there, then how would we live.  you have got your visa You have got citizenship, nothing is happening to you, you don't get golden visa in New York, I have bought a house worth Rs. 20 crores, they will let me live there, there is no such concept of golden visa as in other countries, so in other countries, you can get your country so soon.  Don't write off why this happens here yes now Rs 100 crore will come and yes Gurgaon headlines will beat Mumbai and you have to understand why that is cut daily also for that  Sometime a separate video will be made, I hope you guys wanted to give me this clarity, you guys got it, I want to take all the questions head on. Whatever you guys feel, it seems like the whole game is like Apple to Apple comparison.  It will not be made to turn apple to orange and she is not an expert eye, she is a normal eye who sees, oh man, it is amazing, look what a wonderful penthouse you are getting there and  What is available, how is it available and see what is available here, what is the size, what is the size, how many square feet are there here and there, what are the facilities here and there, every buddy who is a foreign traveler also.  It is spoken to us that the facilities which are available in Indian five star hotels are not available there, they have very less facilities here, man power is still cheap and we are giving better services than that.  What can they give in that kind of money which gives the feeling in a flat worth Rs 5 crore here? Brother, I am giving the example of Gurgaon in India which gives the feeling in a flat worth Rs 5 crore or seven crore in Gurgaon. What is the fuss there? 70 80  90 crores are needed for equivalent feeling, this should be known and who are as many foreigners as me and who have or will have this thing as a coincidence because my well research  If so, please write in the comment section, this is fine and yes you will soon hear 100 crore flats being sold in Guga not one now not two not 10 not 20 not 30 but more than that and in the next four years the project will  There are around 400 flats sold out, we will do well there, and now the people of Gurgaon are  It has selected a government for the third time. It is a double engine government and it will do very well. I hope it will do well. It's okay. Politicians are also waking up to some extent. Here we are slowly watching carefully what happens.

    "title": "Kachhe Baniyan Ka Real Estate  Se Link [BPhQLVWKIeE].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, I had promised a video which is beyond your imagination and related to real estate, so today that video is Kachhe Baniyan and Real Estate, I am going to link up Kachhe Baniyan Sales and Real Estate, this is one of mine.  This is not original research. Original research was done in the US where it was told that when the sales of underwear and vests are low then real estate does well and this thing I Indians have to prove to you all.  I have been wanting for the last two years, you know, real estate has been doing very well for the last two and a half years, so how will you check the Kachha Baniyan page, we have a company called Industries, which makes the Kachchha Baniyan for jockeys, they have a license and have got a franchise.  Yes, Page Industries is in Hosur, it is a company in Bangalore area, so the stock price of Page Industries is currently hovering around ₹ 7000, I think it had hit its peak two and a half years ago.  If you go and check its stock worth Rs. 53000 and see the results of the last eight quarters i.e. two years, you will get D growth. Now you people will say, what is the link in this, I mean the link is strong, man decides, man decides to buy a house.  The main woman also has a role in it and the man is very unique. Now you will say, friend, how much do the underwear and vest cost, how many will you buy for Hajj for Rs 2000-5000 in a year?  And real estate is so expensive, so what is it that real estate is being bought with the savings of 5000 kachch-baniyaan, it means that real estate is getting expensive, it is doing well, it is psychology, yes, a man buys less kachch-baniyan when real estate increases.  It's a matter of laughing, it's a matter of laughing, but this is a very strong collation, many people will not even understand it. I know that whatever you see, all this is not a bit Harvard Harvard and it is all up and down talk that research.  And who has so much time? Normal first order thinking will say that Bedi is a thing. I also explained that how many underwear and vest can a man buy? If he has bought a house, the EMI is increasing, the interest rate is increasing or the property is expensive.  Is the property getting expensive? Is the property doing well? Is it worth buying? It means basically the ticket price is high. Real estate is high ticket purchase. 50 lakhs, 1 crore, 1.5 crores. Real estate is worth Rs. 2 crores and 3 crores, the minimum is ok, so where is this rate here and where is this Kachcha Bania but their direct, so next time, now this is going on, now when the real estate or page industry will start doing very well, now half of it is now.  You have already heard the story that Guruji is telling that the number one clarity giver is telling that suppose you are this then what to do next, now what you have to see next is that now you should keep the share of page industry in your watch list, buy and sell.  not speaking to  I am not recommending him, I am holding on to real estate. Whenever you see page industry running, real estate will stagnate, see and whatever trend I am telling is the trend of the day.  Is n't it that today the stock price page of the industry will increase at 5 and real estate will go down at 2, there is no relation to anyone, whatever is the relation or trend, there is any trend, it takes time to form it, to see it, to understand it, to study it.  feels like a lot  They are born and are caught in six months. If a trend does not develop in three months, then how will it be caught? It takes time to develop. Today you people can catch it in one or two years. Today, I have told you only this much, so keep your interest in it.  Lo declares the results of every quarter in every quarter. Page Industry Page Industry is a default setting Kachchhe Baniyaan of India, others are also local Kachche Baniyan is also there, Rupa's company is also there, others are also listed players, dollar wallers, those  I am saying that you should hold the page industry, hold one, otherwise you can relate it to the others too, but you should do the page industry, assume the share of the page industry is 37000, something is going on, it has sales because the share price will go up.  Follow the sales and the growth and the profit and everything so just follow it and see if you can find any relation, neither is it amazing nor is it fun. If you enjoyed it then tell those who felt like it. Friend, yes or without studying, you cannot speak without studying, you will have to work so hard, and if someone works harder, he can go further behind, then see, now I am not going to work so hard after studying, that I will not even gain knowledge.  Save me and give me something from my paid consultation and also work hard to prove him to come, he doesn't do it because this is my channel and all my channels and my attitude is that you should also work hard, okay, I am not the proof here.  I will keep doing it, I have proven this, I have shown that, go on doing it, do some hard work, you too, why don't you believe me? The one who did it definitely enjoyed it, yes, you will see from the next time, but who  There are no shares, those are skeptical people, so you work hard, I will do all the hard work for your skepticism, do it and note down now and see further also, half of the prediction will happen, half of the story will be played out, so be very very.  Careful about Kachhe Baniyan Kitne Ba Kare Desh Mein It is judge gut direct link with this because it is a psychology when there is a husband, a father, a man, it is psychology that he does his Kachhe Baniyan Kitne Ba Kare, it comes to him, you must have seen the underpants of many fathers which  Meaning, the holes and holes dry up, meaning you understand what I am saying, who will see the mind from the type, who will see the mind, above that you wear good clothes, this is psychology, yes, it is very big.  You can consume, okay but this is how it is happening, okay, some people will link it with just pure inflation also but it is linked with real estate for sure, you see, if the other way is, look at the stock prices of real estate, see historically.  Take all the data, brother, the reflection of the price of real estate will also be visible in the stock price of real estate, so the number of listed players of the last one year is theirs.  Look at the stock price, you are fine, Shobha, DLF, Godrej Property, and Industry's page, you will get Ivers Corelli, you will also get And Going Forward, check this, I don't know why I told you, I had promised last time, so that's why I told you.

    "title": "Let Us Standardize This One Thing In Real Estate For Ease Of Understanding [lV_Mkzjn5kg].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, let us standardize one thing in Gurgaon real estate because there is a lot of confusion especially in the resale market and I will explain it to people in a very good way in this video so that you people do not get confused in knowing and identifying the rates of Gurgaon.  There are many options in the resale market and the prices are quoted, but the square feet rate quoted in the resale market is the all-inclusive rate. This is the confusion.  Don't do that now I will impose GST on it then I IDC EDC PLC no other position you have to do how to do I try to explain to everyone you have got the cost sheet you have bought the house suppose someone else has some project in which 000  Its rate was around Rs 500-600, it had PLC, then there were GST charges around Rs 700-750 and there were some other charges, so all the charges were the total Mugam rate.  Had let's get 4 crores, some got 3 crores or 2 crores, then whatever crores he got, give him directly from the super areas from which he had told the stories, do it everywhere in BBA and cost sheets and carpets at that place.  This is talked about especially in BBA but right now in Gurgaon market they don't talk about carpet. There is confusion that by talking about carpet, the higher rate seems to be higher because the balcony is not counted inside the carpet.  If we talk about exclusive area then there is confusion as to what is happening in Mumbai market. If there is no balcony then carpet area is carpet area. Do you know that there is no balcony? It is only 510 feet. Okay, so what is going on here now. So to understand, we will have to do some form, it is clear to those who are selling the property in the market but those who are selling i.e. those who want to buy, there is confusion and the sellers are confused and that is this. When you sit, there is confusion, it means everything will be discussed, it means there is confusion in understanding the rate, so let me explain again how to do it carefully, watch the whole video, spread it, you got something in total worth ₹ crore, the basic selling price of it will be something.  There will be some PLC, some car, they have made the rate by charging 50 tons, there will be GST, whatever tax they have done, the total rate is 3 crores and the carpet was 2000 square feet super area. 1400 will not be written, its carpet will be most like 1200, 1250 and 150 feet, the balcony will be 150 feet, including the carpet area inside the balcony and the carpet area should be 70, the super area will be at many places, I will also tell you the formula to calculate the super area, which is the carpet area for you.  Add the two balconies and multiply them both by 1.4. To get more pressa, multiply them by 1.42.  Two, your exact car super area will come, this is rare on this edge, no one will explain, people will make videos that the loading is more here, they will tell such stories, both these things are bound to happen, only variation can happen now for the inside and outside balcony.  Just understand this, if it seems like a lot of information in the area, then write in the comment section, I will tell you sometime live or through workshop webinars. So now the super area that you had taken, let us assume it is 000 square feet.  The area is 2000 square feet and the thing is worth 3 crores, then I will divide 3 crores by 2000, then the rate will be 15000. If someone in your resale market says 16500, then brother, multiply 16500 by 2000, that will be your rate, simple.  C So you mean your premium is Rs 30 lakhs i.e. your all inclusive rate per square feet.  And minus the rate which is being charged in the market, finish it like now there is some announcement, there is Shobha, there is Shaper ji, there is Godrej, Meridian, some of their rates are going on, okay in resale, that is the resale rate of all their projects which are the flats of that.  You have to multiply by super area, Shapur ji has big 3 BH, make it 18520, Shobha has someone with 2 3 43 square feet, multiply by that, ok, your meridian is the same. Now when you tell him that I am quoting at ₹ 177000 or whatever rate, then do not go to him and ask him to give my GST also, give this, I will do the basic selling price.  What I am telling you is that it is not that people do not know, many people know this but many do not know, many do not know, so those who do not know are being told and those who are  If you know, please spread this thing so that you can have clarity as to what is the rate of my project. Once it is ready, the same formula will be applied in the places where people are living. Now, what has happened to the supper area?  The rate itself has been missed, like if you buy in Dwarka or in Delhi, now you don't know how much it is, you don't even know the carpet, you do n't know how it is, what is built up, whether there is carpet, whether it is this, then the best rates are prevailing there.  There  So go brother, take a tape measure, take your measurements, take out the carpet of the room, take out the balcony, add both, multiply them by 1.42, get an area, what will happen to you, will it be a comparison that I am also getting this thing in Dwarka Expressway.  This is this firm, this is my formula, I am extracting all this from the paid content and telling you all that there are many places where you do n't even know that there is a super super within a few yards.  It is also written many times that there are such old flats where the games are kept in the yards, now they are built up, there are carpets, they are super, I don't know anything, there is no problem, the flat is aging, there are walls, it will take 15 minutes for the painter to come. Even after painting, the walls are measured to see how much rate will I charge per square feet. The tile dealer also looks at how much it is, it is very easy, you can measure, two feet of tiles are installed, three feet are installed, count like this.  By doing means you can do it like that and with a tape, it takes two to three minutes in a room, if there are two people, it happens quickly, if there are three, it is even better, one is noting in a diary, both are holding the tape, quickly, quickly, quickly, F 12 feet 8 inches  12 feet 8 inches will be written as 12.6. People also write this as 12.8 and then the calculation is done because they know that 12 inches is 1 foot.  It is okay, so 8 inches will be 66, 10 inches will be 83, okay, so this is basic math, but people make mistakes here too, then they increase or decrease its area, this also remains the same and what the builder tells in the buyer agreement.  It is said that this area can be plus minus 2 3. If you go to count in actual also then it can increase in many cases, but where it increases, Milder takes the money and where it decreases, he says.  This is Plus Minus 3. It was written, okay, such stories also exist, but there is no need to be so scared, it is okay, but you have to use your brain. Today, under the formula, I told you all in the comment section, whatever you want. These are the innocent questions which no one is answering.

    "title": "Mutual Fund Vs Real Estate ｜ An Important Factor Discussed [oRJHCBUOZ14].en",
    "content": "Everyone knows about the house that we have taken, anyone can take care of it, no one can buy so many houses that the house will be missing, but the portfolio of mutual fund can be so many, I don't want to take the name.  Tell me in Demat, you have opened five or six Demat accounts, this is my trading account, this is my investment, this is long term, this is my free cost share, this is my old one, this is the old Raita, I have opened it. remained  I am a young man, God forbid why should I go, but even an old man of 70, 75, 80 years of age does not understand that his family should cry for his departure or cry for the one who left after spreading Raita, no one lives in the property, brother, property.  One is two, three is four, five is 10, but 10 is also visible that this is one, yes, this is a flat, this is a plot, this is a shop, this is that, this is in his name, this is what he is looking at and Everyone has taken it in joint names, you can always take care of it, the crowd does not come to occupy it, I say that my youngster who is coming, neither his job is secure nor his relationship is secure, here we are together, it seems like this.  You stay here as a tenant and take possession of it. Within seven months people leave the house and go away. You must be capable of occupying it. You must also be a man from the village. You must also have the personality of an occupier.  The face is visible, friend, don't give it to him, he will take over, why does he look like a child, a living couple, a child, he does n't know when he will take over, if I eat after four months, he will take over your house, but the psychology is such that brother takes over.  This happens only on those things whose documentation is not proper, now there are many properties in Delhi, people have no idea about them and they have been given to someone for a long time, there are also some cases of possession like companies in mutual funds or stock market.  It shuts down, like I said, an accident can happen anywhere, you had to drive a car, you will not stop it, but many people also say that like mutual fund is a stock market, if I ever have any financial problem or anything happens, I will sell them.  I can liquidate it easily by doing this, it is very difficult to liquidate the house, so that is the problem, this is the best thing, this is the piggy bank which does not break because if the piggy bank breaks the fastest then you will get success in life. Where will you create wealth? Hey, keep one piggy bank in your life which does not break even after being hit by a gun. You want the entire piggy bank to be such that it breaks when hit like this, because whenever four or five things happen in life like an impulse, something happens in the body.  So there is health insurance. If something happens in life, it is gone. If the car breaks down, there is car insurance. And you have to spend the money for living. You have made peace for a little while by buying a house, now that is it.  My rent has been saved and my rent will keep increasing. Now do whatever you want to spend. What is it for breaking the piggy bank? What do mutual fund people say? How does Kanjampatti Vacation do this for child education? You did all this, after that you did all these programs.  Your life is zero because after finishing your Swiss vacation, Swiss mutual fund and having children, your life will be ruined. Here you have started creating assets, these assets are standing trees.  Like their fruits are being given, the fruits are saying that take your vegetable, it is cheap, you need to plant trees, mangoes come every time, mangoes come every season in May, so why are you planting trees? Yes, there will be mangoes in 12 years. Hey, someone will plant these mangoes that are being sold. Someone has planted them. If you keep saying that if I don't buy that house, will the builder build it, then you are saying that I am a fool. You are right.  So if I'm stupid  No, I agree that circumcising the house with lettuce is stupid, so I am the idiot who took it, you are the one who did not take it, so accept that you must be an idiot because if he is not an idiot, then what kind of an idiot is this builder who will build this thing now?  That the builder and we control everything, Rera has come, we are not made like Maggi, you are a lady pregnant, then you say, no child, no, I will not come.  You can predict whether someone's wife knows how to make a cake. It is a very big thing to understand carefully because only on this basis you can make predictions and you cannot predict the stock market. I am not saying anywhere that you should not do the stock market.  I am saying that we will eat everything. I am saying that we have to do real estate, we have to do stock market also, buy paintings also, buy antique furniture also, buy gold vat also, buy real gold also, buy silver also and crypto also, whatever you do.  Do it friend, who has forbidden it? Depending on your status, buy a house first. No man buys a life insurance policy first. Yes, yes, and the sooner he buys, the lower the premium. No one wants to die. No one wants insurance but takes it.  Hai health insurance bhi hai toh ghar is like that [Music]"

The video is probably his mother's, it is on YouTube, it is on the story, he shows the house, it is a very good family, it is a prosperous good family, no one tells how much progress you can make in life by making your house so nice and peaceful.  I ship this to you all  Do tax here, do tax there, you definitely have to make it and then such articles come, now we are also Guruji, I never say that equity market, stock market or mutual fund is bad, so why say bad, they are very good.  These are also very good, I am from Haryana, we will eat gulab jamun and we will eat kheer and we will also eat rabri and we will also eat carrot air, everyone will eat. This is the bowl of your fear, Date Chowk is from Haryana.  The same person is asking, Yeh Do Do Katori Ne Do Sab Liye Bhai Bhai Bill, you don't have everything, why don't you have set classes? You guys, I had to tell you under two examples that it looks like every two-three months, isn't it? This is sir because a lot of money is spent in real estate. Brother, these financial people are killing some people. You invest 5 lakhs in the stock market and you invest 1 crore in real estate because in real estate you invest 10-15 lakhs.  You take a loan of ₹ 40,000 and he takes a loan of 85 lakhs, then that is already done for them, now I will repay it, so our games will not be played, so making these stories of AAK is a caste to create misconceptions.  All of them are very big financial, they are on YouTube, they are registered as well, which is normally rare, they are fine in the space and I think they have 60-70 lakh subscribers and all of them are  I make good videos, but there is no complaint, but they themselves openly say that in real estate, this is a mess for me, so the whole time you all are busy in rasgulla rasgulla rasgulla and then you yourself are eating fig barfi.  You are a good one, I will give you the example of figs, it is my favorite, you are figs, why don't you ever ask someone to eat fig barfi, you make rasgulla rasgulla rasgulla.  You keep saying that I belong to you, there is also transparency, by sending a ship of Rs 5000, you think that you will reach it without knowing, they give you the reach, I will become a millionaire in 30-35 years, if you do like this, then it is like this, if I hit 25 setups daily and this I am not a hobby, I will become a home in such 18 years, how many have you become? Message on: Made till date, who is that? Okay, this is the story, if you had done it like this, if it had been like this, if only Baji had given me a caste.  So we say Chacha ji, meaning these are those dialogues, meaning basically, Ba ji's face is not there, Ba ji is Ba ji, so that is because Ba ji is okay, that is not okay, so this is this, which is like this which you see in the media.  Yes because the answer to everything is bad these days. Hey brother, there are so many stories about getting ruined in future options. There are so many news of getting ruined in stock market. Can you give examples of them and say that no, we should do real estate and not gold.  should do And it is being said that it is very good, I will tell you against the Sovereign Gold Bond, you get the direct percentage, it should be gold, there is a making charge, I will tell you that it is not a gold band, I will tell you, what is better than that, and I will tell you logically.  I have understood sir, it is okay to clap on Clarity. If not, subscribe to the U channel. I have a separate channel, subscribe to that too, but I will tell you where you will watch the video in two-four-five days. It will be shown on that channel. Video but again I am saying this ki bhaiya fair pe karen to bhaiya tumhara mutual fund 4% falling news dal do market lapsing this date it stands up again then falls down again stands up again falls down story someone like this  Till date, tell me any middle class person from lower class who leaves his job because of stock market, you will find many people who trade by investing, in other vices you will be Musaddilal only with a ship worth Rs. 5000.  By saying that you are running on fear only in trade, you can never make your bus do this, now 60 lakhs have been collected inside it and now I will not take your nonsense because you know that 60 lakhs will become 40 lakhs at the market current, it will be 50.  He will go and he is not throwing anything at you, but brothers and sisters, if you have taken your two taxes home, who can take what I want to learn, then you are no longer able to do anything in Baby Naaz and two-four houses. In a year or before the age of 28 years and you can definitely do it till 35-40, if you have cash flow then you can show your eyes to your bus, real estate makes you powerful, this is also a truth, I am telling you and not these people.  Will tell you all these things because if you are a barber and asking whether you need a haircut and living depends on saying yes you know you need a haircut, there will be even a hair on your head sir.  Make it equal, it is getting a little long now, you are also paying 70 rupees from the bill, 12 years ago and 15 years also, I have played a lot of mutual funds and all the games, I have seen it, you do the same, I also marry. I also do astrology, 68 different things I do, only 10-15 people know, rest I do at my own convenience, so you have seen the article, the real estate seller himself will say that  No, if the real estate will do good, then that situation is doubtful, brother, you are again and again, if the real estate will do good, will the real estate do good, as if it will do good, for whom will it do good, then ask, it will be good for the developer, it will be good for the investor and so on. It will do good for the user. It will do good for the government. Real estate will always do good for the government no matter what happens because there is nothing to be done to get the money for the registry. I have to go to the tehsil. 8% 7% He did it, he took it  And you gave away the flat after 2 years. Musaddilal sent it to Kantilal. He thought that he will get it registered again. A flat which is worth Rs 1 crore may have been sold to the government 10 times more than that. Without earning the money from the registry, when can it be done in real terms?  Whenever the state does something then the government is good, the government is benefiting, if the builder is getting a lot of benefit then the investor is not getting it, this is also for you and the user to see.  If the bar is getting a lot of profit, then the bar is not getting it. Sorry, if the seller is not getting it or the tenant is getting a lot of profit, then the landlord is not getting it. It is not so easy to understand real estate, the stock market, it is very easy to date, stock.  The market is doing well, put your money in, everyone is doing well, there is real estate in it, there is a trick situation, if real estate is doing well then it is doing well in residential, in commercial it is doing well in residential.  So what is the plot and flat, what is the flat, what is the flat, what is the flat, what is the branded builder, top builder, listed builder and this Chhath Ko Matko builder is ok, all these are in the same category, are all the cities doing equally well, are the cities  In Sari location, it is doing equally well, IT becomes very tricky, nobody teachers, it is like me, there should be a subject in the university in any rail status, real estate should be a subject in the university, if ever a university is formed, then I will be the day to speak on its first day.  Whatever is fine bunny, why should we learn because real estate is the most expensive decision of our life and if you are Mukesh Ambani because the last costume bought by Mukesh Ambani was probably worth Rs 3000 crores, now the valuation is Rs.  10000 crores is also the most expensive personal purchase item of his life. Real estate, this car, a ship, he might have bought it for Rs 500-600 crores, but if you are Mukesh Ambani.  Whether you are Master Dinanath Chauhan or whatever you want, the biggest purchase item in your life costs more than marriage. It costs more than children's education. It costs more than education. It costs more than your marriage. It costs more than your children's marriage. Real estate also costs a lot. If a big loan is taken for real estate, it is important to understand real estate. It is very important for you who are listening to me and today it is less than 35 to 40 years. In the next 40 years when you  You will be 75 years old if you are 35 or 80 if you are 40 or 65 if you are 25. In the next 40 years you will witness transactions of Rs 100-200 crore in real estate. You will witness the bill in your life. Do you want to tell me again that you will do one hundred crore fitness? Yes, witness there is a stock market. With a capital of Rs 5 lakh, you can do training worth Rs 10 crore.  If you can, then the properties of your parents which will be sold, you will buy, buy again, whatever you do with them or your brother's, your children's, your siblings' you will be able to influence decisions, so it is date date it is D figure 100 to 150 meaning 2  If a house worth crores is sold and you take something worth two crores, then this becomes a transaction worth crores. In 2023, it will be like this in 2017.  There will be something in this, there will be something in 31, something will happen in 35, there will be restructuring of assets, selling the shop, selling the house, selling the old, selling mom and dad, grandparents got it, someone has to do something, this will be decision making, so I am talking about the middle class, I am talking about the lower class.  If the rich are not doing it, then it will definitely be theirs, more so the normal middle class who is a normal person trending on the situation and he can be yours to bear witness on behalf of these losses. If you meet him, you can influence him in a way, you can also become a very good consultant, if you want to take membership of the channel, then you can become a real estate consultant, you can give knowledge to people, you can charge, you can take gold membership.  I am also taking gold membership. Message me on WhatsApp that brother, I have taken the bill. I have added you to the special group of gold members where I have conducted monthly real estate workshops.  At list one and something more also date once you take you no bill once your D group so it is good engagement good value for money and by paying such a small fee you can do these 100-150 crore transactions which are impending in your life. So you will influence this in a butter way, you will become a very famous villager within your circle because you have the habit of doing rational consultation. You will get into the habit of telling me that you will not do such a consultation that your uncle had bought that shop in 2002, it is very good, it does commercials very well, take it in 2013, you will not be like that, you will not do rare view driving, I will give you binoculars to see ahead.  I will give you what is going to happen from 2023 to 28 and what is going to happen in 32. If you get a telescope then it will definitely connect. Thank you."

    "title": "New Project At Rs 10000  Per Sq.ft In Gurgaon Real Estate [PTmo3gKoe84].en",
    "content": "Hello friends an idea with which we can have projects in Gurgaon at 101000 000 sq ft I am going to give a very good idea and in a way you can take the proposal and builders also see it a lot, original idea remains mine later rest of them are also taken from youtube  A consensus is not being told about the rules and regulations and other things in full because I am the number one clarity giver, so listen carefully to what I am telling you, you have been following me for the last two-three years  The government has increased the FR, new rules have come, TTO rules have come, FR has gone up to 3.5, 4.5 and even up to 4, the increased FR can create more space in the build, if the floor area ratio is high, then  Whoever is allowed to construct whatever amount, he will construct it completely. If you have FR 2.64 somewhere in your 200 yard plot, then he constructs it completely, the person does not leave his land.  Why would the builder leave it? He is taking land worth so many crores, so what is the big deal in it that even if he builds a bigger unit, the density still comes out to be 110-120 because the FR has increased, but if he builds smaller units, then he will have to consume the same FR.  If the number of units has to be made more, then the density will come to 170-180, brothers and sisters, so is this acceptable to you people, those who invest in Gurgaon, people of Gurgaon, those who buy property in Gurgaon, then you have to write in the comment section between 1.5 to 1.8 crores  Things will come in but the density will cross even your affordable housing. The density of affordable housing has been 150 flats per acre but if you look at the height of affordable housing, it is generally 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 floors and up to 40 floors.  If it is less then this floor will be more and the density will be more but still it will give you a feeling of openness in the ground Do you people agree that we should raise this issue? Should we send a message to the builder that brother, your ticket size is Rs. 6 crore or Rs. 8 crore and we will reduce the ticket size from Rs. 1.6 to 2 crore? Bring it in the middle of CR because there can be two options in it, when you reduce it too much then the price will come between 1.6 to 2 and the density will be very high, you reduced the density a little, you did it till 150, did not go to 180 190, only till 150  If you do it, then it is possible that the pricing may come between Rs. 1.25 to Rs. 30 but the demand in the upcoming market of Gurgaon, according to the price point, is more between Rs. 1.5 to Rs. 30. If it is less than Rs. 1.5 then people may forget anything in their life. Affordable housing will be available anywhere in Gurgaon. It can be sold after one year of its position. The good opportunities will cost Rs. 1.25 crore in the coming time, not today, when it will come into position after three to four years, like an affordable  Housing is  The day it gets positioned in Constant Habitat 102 sector, it is a thing worth Rs. 1.25 crore. I am talking about affordable housing. So whenever MRG 106 gets positioned, the high rise, your Neo Consent Mall and Shobha's  A new project is being launched, your ATS is next to it, opposite to Cocoon, in that belt, it will also cost Rs.1.25 crore, its cost can also go above Rs.1.25 crore of BH, whenever it will be received, there is a delay.  If you want videos on why the delay is happening then I will make them but now you have to give this proposal that something like affordable housing, not by the name of affordable housing looking sleek and good with swimming pool and basement car parking and  A little bit of trouble, if you want good rich specifications in 1.6-1.8 cr then you tell me, second thing is that affordable housing is not seen coming in much quantity in Gurgaon area in the coming time because most of the builders will sell their change license.  In any case, the builder does not save money in some affordable housing because the 5 acres which he has bought for Rs. 10 crore per acre, someone has bought it, suppose now it has become 40 crore acres, in four to five years he will build on that land anyway Go ahead and write the word retirement homes, you will hear stories about retirement homes somewhere because the government has brought a policy in which something up to 30 square meters can be built as per carpet area and it is like 330, hardly anything means so  Such things can also be made, no matter how big they will be, they will be made in small size, they will be sent to retirement homes like Deen Dayal, what is the confusion about Deen Dayal, people think that Deen Dayal means friend of poor Deen Dayal, it's okay, if you misunderstand the meaning of Friend of Poor, people think that this is an EWS scheme, whereas this has already become worth 2.5 to 3 crore rupees, which still has some inventory.  If whatever is left then it goes at this rate so that system is over so now the new you I will not use the word Jumla but the new marketing tool which you will see in the coming time, you will get to see these kinds of things, these small which  We will build one tower, two towers, now societies will start coming up in two, three or four acres also. Earlier it was required that minimum this size should be there, so now in Gurgaon, you all should brace up for more like Dwarka, like not in Dwarka Express, Dwarka Gu that is there  There is Dwarka in Delhi, there are such types of societies, there are not many amenities, there are not many great ones, there is no club house of 1.5 lakh square feet, only then things will come in this range and this is the only way to take the price back to 10, 11, 12,000 again. I would like to say that the assisting projects that you see, which are called luxury, they cannot be less than 15000 to 16000, not even 15 but 16, they cannot be built for less than 16000, otherwise  Anything which is like luxury cannot be built for less than 16, its simple math is cost of land plus cost of construction plus marketing sales and that expense plus some profit which builder will make, so brother this is the answer, in this cost of construction is fixed for everyone  The idea is my one and the specifications are between 3000 to 4000 depending on its height. The more the height you increase, the more the cost of construction increases. So you know the cost of land. You can find out the cost of land also.  It is not necessary that if a builder has bought land at Rs. 10 crore per acre and today the rate there has become Rs. 40 crore per acre and the new person who is buying it at Rs. 40 crore, now the over reality will come in Gurgaon and that  Now a new land parcel will be bought by an agricultural worker, now another big builder is launching the land parcel after buying it, so the costing will be derived from the cost at which the land parcel will be bought, so the general market costing will have to be applied, right, a builder who has accepted it  Land  If the purchase is at 10 crore per acre and right now the rate is 40 crore per acre, then it is possible that he may make the rate a bit cheaper by putting 35 crore per acre in the calculation, but he is not going to do it by putting 10 crore per acre in the calculation, I want to tell you this  I am telling you that he will tell you that he will close the market after six months, what is the problem, he had taught the equation x + y + z to people a long time ago and many people had learnt it. I teach things in great detail in my ramp course. If you want to join my real estate mentoring program, then you can send a rump proposal on the number given in the comment section. Please write in the comment section that no, I do not want this proposal. I will buy only a thing worth Rs. 6 crores, I will have to pay one and a half crores.  I do n't want it for two to one and a half or I want it for two and a half to two. Density of 50 flats per acre like it is available for those who are paying 8 crores, it is not available there also, that is a different matter, even for those who are paying 8 crores, the density is now 70  It has started becoming 75, so it is not less than 70, 75, 80 anywhere now, you can even write it in the big so called luxury ones because only that will happen which is practical and what we want cannot happen now, you people know that  Share, Like, Thank you very much"

    "title": "Noida Vs Gurgaon ｜ A New Twist To Old Rivalry [x8VRj20fnAU].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, Noida vs Gurgaon, I have brought it from a different perspective, many videos have been made before, it is quite interesting for me, I am always interested in it and I am from Gurgaon, so I like it, if someone is your team, then you are the same.  Will support but I am trying to give a new perspective. All investors will benefit if you have already invested in Noida or want to do so or are a new investor from Gurgaon.  I will give perspective, I will give it with a new development. Historically, I have never been bullish on that side. Have the rates increased? Yes, the rates have increased. There is no doubt about that but it is about risk reward ratio where you have to put.  Your money and that reason which was mine, which was my reason, I never spoke in such detail publicly, that thing has become a thing for him, however I have told him in my  In my webinars and people who used to join me, I have told that thing and today it has happened that is New Noida New Noida Yogi Ji and Headlines Master Stroke Yogi Ji's Master Stroke in Bulandshahr and Reland is being acquired in Dadri. Today you will get to know the inside base of Gurgaon and this side of Noida is an endless place, this is your story of Jewar Airport till 40 kilometers from Pari Chowk. Story of Ida Now this is the story of New Noida They are acquiring 209 square kilometers from 84 villages There will be gross over supply from Bolan city and Dadri Master plan 2041 has been released Now people will say ok, you have to see which gentry they are catering for  That city is going to be settled, government will put infrastructure, businesses will be brought in industries, factories will be brought in, workers will be brought in, employment will be increased and GDP will be increased.  It is praiseworthy to increase it, but here as a private investor, we see that where the industry comes, there is land for the industry and material, it cannot run much for it, the blue collar workers of the industry cannot increase the residential rates and when it reached 209 sq. km. They have to develop it in four phases, till 2041, the supply will keep coming, in the short term anyway, the Amrapali Group's  There are stalled projects, of JP Green and also of Unitech. In this way, after the expiry of all the builders, those which are being built under NBCC, after melting down, 35400 Hazrat flats will come in the market next year and there will be over supply to this city.  There is a plan to settle down with only 6 lakh population, yet the population is yet to be determined, but I want to tell you, you can say anything, Noida, Greater Noida.  Noida Extension, Noida Expressway, Ade Aage Ko Peda or this New Noida, add all these, the population of all these is less than half of the population of Gurgaon, I am talking about the urban population, it is less than half and here there is suppressed supply to Gurgaon. If you understand the geography, if you look at both the places in Gurgaon, then the Bharatiya Janata Party government is formed in Haryana, so it will remain in UP for 5 years.  Do n't even know about the one who will eat the camel in 2027, this is also a fact. You know the politicians who follow what can happen where but what is happening in Haryana, no government specifically acquires anything in Gurgaon, land and acquire in Noida.  When it acquires in UP, the authority there earns a lot of money, the authority is earning a lot of money and the authority cuts the plot and people think, oh!  Are you interested and apply? I want to do a poll today through this video. If you are invested in Noida or want to invest in any way, write the truth with your hand on your heart or are you a resident of UP.  Are you from any other place or from any other place, whichever place you are from, my claim is that in Uttar Pradesh, in Noida, in New Noida, in Greater Noida and in Jewar Airport, most of the crowd and investors are from Uttar Pradesh only and not from outside.  When people from outside do not come, the rates do not increase so much. This is speculating that Gurgaon is above Noida and will remain above Noida and will remain so. If it goes up then it will have to go up. I have come here to Noida.  I am not going to spoil things, I am making my Edu video here, so if you people remember, I also have a Guruji from Gurugram political channel, if you have not subscribed, there are more good GK videos.  It is said that subscribe to the channel, when three students had died in a basement, if you remember in our Mukherjee Nagar, there was a basement flung there and there were people of IAS and there was a lot of ruckus in it and  You people know that I had suggested it and I had requested the biggest person who runs the institute there, Dr. Vikas Divya Kriti, that please, this useless place is nothing like the garbage of Delhi and please do it.  It happened in Mukherjee Nagar. It happened in Rander Nagar. It happened in Mukherjee Nagar. It is fine in words, so I told you to go here or go to Noida, and he went to Noida. Now I don't know, after hearing from my video, I thought he had gone to Gurgaon.  I didn't call you, I know, I told you that Gurgaon is already expensive for children and in Gurgaon, I myself gave in to my greed that I should not gather bachelor crowd at all, this list is running, a different system is fine there.  But I have heard of 15000 students and the prices of rents and properties have increased. Exactly in which of the 16 sectors they have done it, I could not figure it out before making a video. You guys, Noida Greater Noida.  You belong to that side, tell me who is Vikas, who is Vikas de Virat ji, where is the office open, which is for IAS coaching and now more children will also come, so we want that area to be better.  Do it but this is gross over supply within Gurgaon. If I go a little south, Rajasthan starts, if I go west, Uttar Pradesh starts, if I go north, if Delhi starts, nothing much can happen. Sorry, go east, go east from Gurgaon.  So, if Uttar Pradesh starts, I go down, then Rajasthan starts next and if I go to the West Side, North West, Delhi starts, then there is not much scope here, BJP is in government.  Haryana and Gurgaon are not acquiring land from the farmers because this has already become a big political issue. This was a big issue when the previous government and they used to do politics on each other. They acquired the land of the farmers and raised this issue.  It is not built there because the land that will be acquired in Bull City and Dadri, I think it will be done at a good rate, perhaps this issue will not arise there because it is historic there.  The authority has been doing this but there were big issues in Haryana, now the government in Haryana is politically sensitive, so it is not in all the cycles, so the land is very less in Haryana and especially in Gurgaon, so the prices of Gurgaon will remain ripe and will keep moving forward and then  A gentry filter is going on. The gentry filter is going on. If 10 people of Delhi want to buy a house and want to move out of Delhi, then the ratio is nine people.  Many people want to come to Gurgaon and one wants to go to Noida side, the one from Patap Ganj and the one across Yamuna who naturally should go there, many of them want to come to Gurgaon only and do not want to go there. You write this fact in the comment section that if you  If you are in Noida then where are you from and where should you invest from? I am saying again and again that you will get the link of Uttar Pradesh. People from outside are not buying flats in Gurgaon. People from Tamil Nadu are buying flats in Gurgaon.  They are buying from Gujarat, they are buying from Mumbai, investors, businessmen, Marwaris of Rajasthan are buying, outside crowd whether from South or from West India, many people are buying inside Gurgaon, now there is no data but if there was then then  It seems very good that those who are leaders, big people, businessmen and politicians, where are they buying? I want to ask whether any politician of India who is not from Uttar Pradesh is buying anything in Uttar Pradesh. What do you think? to me  There are no exact figures but what is your gut feeling, nothing is achieved by naming one, two or four, but what is your gut feeling, where is your big money, smart money, big money, where is it in Gurgaon, so if you, I will tell people even today.  Do not paint in and around Noida because there will be some supply coming there. We will do it anytime. Gurgaon is blue chip and will command a higher PY ratio. Gurgaon is the Asian paint in the paint industry.  Brother, its P/B ratio will be high and it is the second player, like if Kajaria Ceramics is the largest among tiles, then P/B ratio will be high, then Gurgaon's will be higher. I know many people are involved in infrastructure and infrastructure.  I would like to make a separate video sometime, I will make it ok, they will say infrastructure but what is the problem, they are making infrastructure but there is no gold on it, where will the economic activity come from?  Come, it takes 150 years to take a city to a level 18753 which is good for the country and economy and especially Uttar Pradesh but you are not competing in that league, you understand that if a Shahrukh  If Khan is there then Noida then you remain at Ayushmann Khurrana level. Is it congratulations? Was it not a hit? Was Andhadhun not a hit? Is his younger brother an immense power?  Khurana, his wife has not become a hit, is n't this money earned? Yes, it is earned but it does not reach the level. If you understand, then I know it is difficult to make such videos because the people of Uttar Pradesh do not have the population.  Rest, although the population of Gurgaon is more, there are many times when fights take place, memes are made, these are Gurgaon vs Noida, they are historic, you know, there is a lot of liquor in Uttar Pradesh.  Suppose in the whole of Uttar Pradesh, liquor worth ₹ 1 is drunk, in Gurgaon alone liquor is drunk worth Rs. 02. I am not talking about quantity, I am talking about the amount of money. That is the Arwaaz volume, of course, Uttar Pradesh is 27-28 crores, that is in Uttar Pradesh, so if the country was separate, it would have been at seventh and eighth number, then this is the GST of Haryana and the GST of Uttar Pradesh is equal to 12.  For six months in a month, Haryana's GST is higher, check it, and for six months, Uttar Pradesh's GST is higher, and one state has a population of 2.5 crores and another state has a population of more than 25 crores, and it is not that within Haryana,  If it is worth 2.5 crores then brother, a lot of money is coming from Jind, from Fatehabad, from Kaithal, there also 70-80% money is coming from Gurgaon, so understand that Noida is silver and Gurgaon.  It is not gold, Gurgaon is diamond, there is so much difference and every time this happens, we will keep telling whether water fills here in July or August, yet flats worth Rs. 100 crores come here and come on the same road where memes are made that votes were taken.  And they will come like this, but listen and think sometime, because there is greenery on the other side of the golf course road, brother, nothing can be built, you understand, you cannot go anywhere, there is no place and if rich people sit here then Gurgaon is a Classical example of a rich boys club is a club, there is an entry fee, so what is happening in it, is there any quality of liquor in it, it is very different, it is just a crowd, people go to the pub and drink liquor, how expensive is it, what is there there?  What do you mean? The boy who looks like diamonds and pearls, took four friends in his room for tasting on Friday and bought liquor from the shop, tell me how much will it cost, but if you go to a pub, it will cost the same, but the difference is that you will get popcorn.  Bring it, it costs 0, make it in the microwave and eat that big but the same popcorn. If you want to eat it in PVR while watching a movie, you will get it for 300, 350. So what happened, keep saying there is nothing in it, why do you have to watch the movie, why go at all.  What is there in it? It is Louis Vuitton and LV. There is some mark which looks like an  The thing is Gurgaon is a big brand and UP is and especially Noida, Greater Noida cannot come to that level and if the poor guy was trying to come then this announcement turns the area into factory workers which is a very good thing but necessary. Bhai Lot Saheb is a blue collar worker, if he is not there then it will be very good, it will be very good, infrastructure companies will come, many companies will come and more companies because in the new master plan which they have made, it will be very good for the companies and factories.  There is a lot of space for this, if I can see it then I will also tell you that from 2023 to 2027, 3165 hectares (one hectare is more than two acres) will be developed, from 2027 to 2032, 3798 hectares will be developed from 2032 to 2037. Will do 5908 and from 2037 to 2041 8230 brothers  UP is worth 25 crores, you are not able to get 6 lakh people from it, you are making it a state, then no one from UP is coming, something like this is not happening, the population is not increasing, so it is 209 square kilometers, so this is Dadri, Noida, Ghaziabad.  One region will be created which will be of pure Uttar Pradesh, it is very good for Uttar Pradesh, it will be the growth engine of Western Uttar Pradesh, someday Uttar Pradesh will be divided into four parts, separate elections will be held and separate provinces will be formed. Even if Western UP is formed, it will not become a list because as you have gathered people, they will also say that everyone is respectable, I am not talking about classes, but brother, five star hotel is five star, two star is two star, dhaba is ready, dhaba is ready.  It is ready, it is okay, so if Gurgaon is five star, then Noida is at best three star and all this new thing that is being made, it is two star, one star at best, it is okay.  The breakup is in the master plan, whatever residential will be built in 2800 hectares, commercial will be built in 840 hectares, institutional will be built in 1739 hectares and 2900 hectares will be left for traffic transportation, then a lot of industries will come on 8420 hectares, so you know what industries are, all blue workers only, ok.  If it is 8000 then it means that industry has not settled in more than half the area. Again which?  This is a very commendable thing, no one is saying bad, it is good but you should understand what is happening in the entire area, ok then I think it will be clear that Gurgaon has emerged as a clear winner, big money is here if  You are an HNI and want to invest more than Rs 10 crore in Gurgaon. If the cut off is above Rs 78 crore then you can write to me HNI on the given number because it is very  Investments are coming which are coming in this ticket size and this is a very limited supply, like it is said in Gurgaon that the supply of Bitcoin is very limited or Diamond because its supply is limited then the rate of gold is less than that because of the gold.  The supply is more than that of diamonds. If the supply of silver is more than that then the rate of silver gets further reduced. Silver goes in KG, gold goes in 10 grams, diamond goes in carats.  If it is weighed then it is like that then if you are HNI and want your good portfolio and information about products, projects and NI are high net worth individual then you can contact us on the given number HNI whatsapp2 and clear cut winner is emerging Noida  It is behind, but in the absolute sense, those returns are also coming there too, brother, now that the run has become there too, big players are going there as well.  They are not reaching the level but are still going and none of their rates are cheap. No rates of Noida are cheap and I say again and again that the rates of Noida also have to be increased. Gradually the limit has to be crossed.  We don't want to demolish Noida, Noida will grow, if Noida grows by 00 then Gurgaon will grow by 0. It's simple, it can't be that that happened with Noida and Gurgaon. Okay, now this should not happen.  It is possible that India will be ahead of America, right now it does not seem like 100 years, it means at best after 80 years they are saying that India will reach 25% of US economy, this is the mean figure which many times we do not know, America America  If we keep doing this, India's GDP will be 25 times that of America's GDP. If the growth continues like this, then in 80 years, if everything goes well, then that difference is very high and the infrastructure of Gurgaon will cry.  I am telling only one thing to the people, brother, when your infrastructure is also fixed, it will start happening, now see, BJP has come in such a bad government, CM Saheb has taken care of everything, so why will it not grow, now it will not grow.  So when will the double engine government grow? Yogi ji is also there, our Yogi ji is also there, Yogi ji is also doing well. Who said this and who said that Noida will not do well, yes it will but if it increases then 00  Gurgaon will cost 120% and that difference will remain but there is a lot of confusion in the supply which keeps coming, so much commercial will come, so much population, no one outside is investing, now they will say no, the industry is coming from outside but no one is coming and staying.  Even the CO level people of the top listed companies or those who have factories there do not live there, they live in Gurgaon. I want to tell you that I am a rich man.  Aspirational man lives in Gurgaon. Rich man of Gurgaon. Poor man of Gurgaon also has an attitude. Noida Greater Noida was a retiree paradise. It is a retiree paradise and people do not spend there. There is no Swiggy and Zomato. They do not spend. Purchasing power is very less.  The salaries are also low, the intention to spend is even less and there is a lot of small town middle class.  The mindset is that where money does not come out, economic activity reduces. Where economic activity reduces, real estate will work accordingly. Real estate will work according to the amount of rent one is willing to pay. The rent will be the same.  Will give as much as you earn, earn as much as you want, it is okay and if there is activity, all the things are linked to each other, then such videos are solidified in Gurgaon every three-four months and People do this for Noida and someone gets distracted or someone writes wrong in the comment section that you sell in Gurgaon. Hey, there is no need to give IIT IM exam to sell property in Noida and even if there was, then both my  Brother, I have passed the exam, even then I would have done it. If this criteria is also met, then it is not that there is some great work to be done here, but there is an ideal commitment, there is an ideal commitment, there is no noida.  Greater Noida is not at all clear, don't buy this one, this one has to be bought, take it small, take it very small, take it very small, Noida is very good in Greater Noida, yes then stay there on rent, then who has forbidden you to get a job, stay on rent, you can get a bigger one.  It is on rent and buying. Buy here. Buy here. Live in Gurgaon. Who built this in Noida, Greater Noida? Who said this? You have to live where you want to buy because the property will be listed.  The same will grow timeless because the supply is unlimited, sorry, the supply is limited in Gurgaon and in Greater Noida side, we have seen that it is unlimited, a new urban has been created, if I put the formula of R-Squa in 209 kilometers, then the radius will be around 1.5 kilometers. As for you, if I take a turn from Rajiv Chowk, then Gurgaon is solved. You are building a new city, so where else is the rate from?  Only those blue collar level workers will come and look at that also, the authority will sell the plot for 50 thousand rupees per yard. Now even in this city, more people will stand in line to buy it and there will be no benefit in the long term. Everyone will sit with everything, passing the parcel without flower theory because there should be underlying economic activity, only stories are sold, only stories are told, everyone tells stories, how many stories  How probable is that, how much is that, the whole game is based on that, everyone tells the stories, which I have just told in 202 minutes, you guys know this story, but how logical is it, how believable is how much is that, you have to put your mind beyond that, just because you put it.  It is placed there, don't think like this, cross over supply is coming, I am saying that let these expired NBCC positions come in one year and you see what will happen, write it in the end comment section. So take a deep breath now, do not make fresh investments in commercial Noida, Greater Noida and all these areas, there is a lot of over supply of commercial in it, please do not buy by mistake, do not buy commercial at all, what about residential, it is bad, it is good.  Whether the rates are increased or not, whether the rents are increased or not, a person's child will sleep in his own cot and fan, at least he will get a bathroom in the morning to take a bath and cook in the kitchen, his work will still be done.  If a person goes to a commercial then don't buy the commercial at all, don't buy it there and see for yourself, there is no one promoting Noida Great Nude in any way because it is very difficult to defend it, no one is doing it.  And now this new thing that has come is one more city, if seen logically then the rates should be halved but they are not halved because the city will be built in 20 years, it cannot be built overnight so still the rates will increase.  So we will definitely stop, there wo n't be half, I don't want it at all, why did Noida's rate fall to 2, brother, Gurgaon's rate will also fall, I have to increase the rate of Gurgaon, reduce it, otherwise why would Noida's decrease, so I am not reducing it, but these are the future subscribers.  I am telling them that to many of them, if this argument seems logical then please write it as logical and if it sounds like nonsense, I don't even speak illogical and there is a mistake in the spelling.  It will be nonsense, it is easy, B A K W A, I am telling you the spelling myself, brother, if you feel nonsense then write nonsense, one half may also seem nonsense, according to me, it is very logical, okay, if it seems logical, then write logical, so that from that Voting will also be done and please subscribe the channel and like it.

    "title": "Real Estate And Numerology Number 4 & 8 Explained In Full Detail ｜ No Confusion After This [AqajfV6-RHA].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, I had made a video about which project should not be taken etc. I added a little numol in it due to which people got a little confused. Okay, so today I will do it clearly and well through this video so that you can understand. That brother, I am an astrologer and I am also a Guruji type of person. I am telling you some things so let me explain well what the poet wants to say because in that I had focused on that project and he had gone to Newmol ji. So talking about number eight.  will take four  Now you have to understand carefully what I am trying to say, the numbers four and eight have an energy in them which has some rest due to which you achieve a lot in life with that rest, so when it comes to real estate.  When it comes to your house, it is said that those who add numbers four and eight, do not buy those apartments. Even today, if you go to any project and you say to me, if you check some of the vacant units, they will add them.  Two Eight, you can check this, it will add up to four and eight, people believe it and it is also practical, but you should understand it if you are young, I will also give an example of one in Sector 89, Gurgaon, because people have told me on that also. Something said ok Gurgaon Gurgaon is a city Gurgaon is a city there is a sector 89 in it add 89 it becomes 17 and 17  If it becomes eight, then I will tell you from its example also that because I have also taken residential there, so if I am such a knowledgeable person, I am saying this knowledge then why did I take residential, then understand once, because come.  It is very easy to say it like this, if you understand from the video then you understand what the poet wants to say and I will take the example of Sector 89 which is a sector of Gurgaon and will tell you that there is an energy.  Like, what do you want in a commercial shop? Whenever you go to a commercial area, what would a shopkeeper want, that there should be a crowd of customers, that there should be money transfer, there should be brightness, there should be noise, or would a person want peace in the shop or commercial area?  Yes, no one will want it. Those who are old people, above 60 years, 65 years, those people should avoid house number four, eight number. If you work from home, if you have any desire to earn money, then you have a lady house.  You are doing business from number four and eight. Unit is very good. You yourself are number four and eight. Number four and eight means you are born on 4th, 13th, 22nd, 31st or 8th.  If you are born on the 17th of the month or on the 26th, if you are born and you are the head of the house, then you can live in this house because your own energy is like that, it does not matter to you, so what if  live in it  What is there, people will keep coming and going, so people keep coming and going, it is not a bad thing, it is good for many people, celebrations are happening, parties are happening, people are coming and going, but not for many, so it is good. Depending on who you are it is decided so no one can say it is bad or good it depends on who you are The multi utility corridor in Sector 89 of Gurgaon is completely commercial.  If there is vibrancy of activity, then the residences there will give very high rental rates there, which I would say in the language of UP, the way it is spoken, there will be lawn lapad type, there will be a lot of youngsters, there will be a lot of parties, alcohol, disc, this is like this, this element is more now. Many people like this element very much, people call it crowd, it is good, people go to give money for this, otherwise someone can open a bottle in his house and taste it, which is worth Rs.  To get the work done, there is a need to spend Rs 5000 and that is why this element becomes high. This element is high but not everyone will like it. Now let's talk about Sector 89 and there is a lot of affordable housing there, there is a builder whose three  There are four and a half floors, which means they are made of low rise ones, all this crowd is going to come there, but if you are thinking that I should make Papa and Mummy sit there, Papa and Mummy will sit there.  He is 7080 years old and he goes to sleep at 8:30 and 9 o'clock and he will not remain calm, he has no energy, this is the message I was trying to give with love because whatever I had told him about the project in Sector 80, this  It is being promoted like this, so brother, here is the fun, that is what I wanted to tell you, that is the energy clash, otherwise that is that M. I wanted to explain and tell you, hope this thing will be clear to you now.  So now people say, no no, should we take it? Hey brother, you have been born four and eight, so you have the power, you take it, if you want to take it for investment, take it, then if you want this, because what is it for investment, because this  The crowd that gives money, the vibrancy index of this thing is high, people like other sectors too, like if there is a very great sector, like there are 53 sectors, in that too, people said to me like this, Oh brother, there is the waist, there is this too.  The index is high, isn't this one, understand what do you want, what is good and bad, there are many people who say that I would like to use alcohol, otherwise I don't know the actual emotions, but I have to sit and stand a lot and the people who use it are acquaintances, so what I observed is that many  There are such people who will drink alcohol peacefully alone, drink something of their own every day, drink the good one, drink it peacefully and go to sleep, they don't want any company, why dis, why don't they want this and many people just want a brother, they don't even drink alone, they say.  Lonely  You should not drink, if you drink alcohol alone then you will get caught. Drink on weekends. Drink in parties. Drink in crowd. Drink this. So who is a good person in this? Both are fine. It is everyone's individual choice. So this is the individual choice. So when it is the turn of investment.  If she comes, if I have to stay by myself for my peace then I will not stay. I am a good astrologer, I am a good neurologist, I understand all these things very well, I am not myself.  I will stay because of my nature, I know that I am this disco disco, no brother, if I am disco discu, then I will also stay here, I will enjoy it, many people enjoy it, but if I have to buy it, I like golgappas, but do I like burgers?  If I don't like it then I can't buy its cart, I am not eating it myself, brother, I took the example of 89 sector, Tich sector is a good project, one came, goods worth 3000 crores were sold.  His share price of the listed player increased by 12 in the last three-four days, everything is fine, everything is fine and when you want to understand things, then explain them like this instead of trolling that Guruji, we did not understand all your words, I understand everything, this one did not. Please please try to explain once more, even if the message I was giving you seems wrong or something, then jump ahead and read it, I am such a knowledgeable person, I am a salesman, what is your SID and what is the exam.  Will you take a paper of mine? Will someone test you, you are knowledgeable, no need to tell, no, I am knowledgeable, if you do n't feel knowledgeable, then you tell me, it is a simple thing, people, no, I had also seen that newspaper. Self- styled Yoga Guru Ramdev Oho, he is self-styled, Ramdev himself.  If it is styled, then which one is the actual certified one? Will you give certificate to Ramdev ji? You will give the certificate to the whole country and you will give it to the entire country by paying taxes there. People will do it forcefully because they are Indians.  Show the certificate from education, hey, who is giving the certificate to whomever he is giving it to, here the government has given it to him, well, those who are sitting in the government are the same 10th pass, 12th pass are the same in front of whom we say Namaste, who is who, who is giving certificate to whom, for what thing, brother, this  The government gave it a certificate, the government gave it a certificate, then the government gave it a certificate, those few people must be the children of man, okay, they are animals.  So if the monkeys are not sitting, then if they are not sitting, then that man's children too must have gone somewhere after studying. Someone gave them a certificate. There must be someone who is the original. Everyone needs this certificate. So understand and do research. Before jumping so much and falling, check first.  Do number eight, number four is the unit, check number eight, the shop is very good, number four, the shop is very good, will never be empty, will always run well, like we, you must have seen it many times, right, we talk like a cow with a lion's face, now I have all that knowledge right away.  Free I don't give it, although I have to give it many times and I also remove it from such videos because my loyal subscribers and those are paid members, why give everything to the world, then what is the value left, even in Gaumukhi Shermukhi, it is the opposite.  The concept is that when you have to live in a house then there should be Gaumukhi front and Shermukhi at the back meaning there should be Gaumukhi entry but if you want to buy a shop then it is the opposite. Shermukhi shop will work well if it is residential or commercial.  Many times it is the opposite, in commercial you will see a lot of locks and they will not be bad at all, where below is commercial and above is residential, so that too has its own energy, that too I will show you that there is water.  What is fire? What does it do? What kind of feeling does it give? Who should take it and should not take it? What will be good, what will be good for rental, what is good for investment because youngsters need a different energy, brother, only those whose  There are small babies and he is moaning, he is finding that sound so good, you are a new father, I have become a new mother, your baby is moaning, you feel like honey and this is the same thing for anyone.  Who else likes the noise? You tell me, it depends on who you are and when you have small babies, if someone else is making small babies at that time, then you also like it because yours also does it.  you're in that Phase of Life Where You Are Very Understanding But sometimes you become so old that you don't like any happy person, you do n't like any happy person, there are many such people who are such sad people who don't like happiness.  Nothing seems good and all that energy goes away and where money has to be saved, there is no happiness, there is nothing and all such people gather together and that is not the essence of the youth crowd and there is nothing else, then those cities are like this.  It happens to people, then it is called Greater Nada. Okay, so I control my bangs a lot, sometimes I am not afraid of this myself, I should not say so bad, but I am doing it to tell that brother, this also happens many times. You keep all of them the same, why is this old age home the most useless thing in life? One should never go to an old age home, because there is negativity in old age, there is nothing else. You have put all the old people together, ha ha ha.  They laugh just to sell you those things. They have hired four old men. They laugh like this. Ha ha ha ha, old is an affectionate word in Haryana, we say nobody should take it as we, our old, my old, I am old, you are old. This is considered a normal athlete, people of Haryana know it but I give a disclaimer, don't you, how are you speaking so disrespectfully?  They say, 'It's okay and we don't send our old people to the old age home. They have played the game with us and made us laugh and cried. It's okay, old age home is something which should never come in any country and society. This is now the topic being discussed here also. If Guruji is the type then you will get the knowledge even from the one who is giving the video, so that energy is very important in real estate, no one will tell you, all these things are in this.  Paid courses and all in very detail and many times what happens here for free, if you try to tell a little like this then they only read the code because that is again the fault of the subscriber. Many times I say that it is the subscriber's fault. Come on, friend, when I did not tell in detail so openly. So what is your fault, you are ignorant, it means okay, you want to learn, then come, give money, you do n't get anything for free, you don't reach anywhere for free, you are okay, it is free, it's just like that, you did it and went away, okay, so I hope for eight and four. This  Through the video, you have got the idea that there will be no problem in buying, it will depend on why you are buying it, whether you are buying it for investment or not. Come, we have less discos, we have them, they will enjoy it, you will work from home, there is a very good thing in it.  It will be fine to run a business from there, it will be fine to do trading from there, it will be fine to sit at home, it will be fine to sell food from there, it will be fine, a lot of guests will come there, the noise will be good, the brightness will be good, but if you  You didn't want all this, then you took it, then you said that I wanted it, brother, fun, relaxation, no man 's child, no face, no one's face, then you took it. Did he go to that sector or go to that number or go there?  If you go brother, there will be a riot there, you know, you see, aunty will call the police, if the party continues like this, then that party will continue like this, now this one, I hope you have understood right, that energy is some bad bad.  No, it is depending on what is it, it is a good thing, okay, brother of Sector 89, I told you that you enjoyed it, good 00 rate will be given to those who have taken it, that one has 16 rupees till next Diwali, I think I got Mr. 's PLC VLC which  And the one of 89 is at 25 but the money will also go to 2530 but don't sell it. If you go to sell then brother it is not real but it takes 4 years to mature so whatever the rate.  The rate is increasing, it is fluff, beyond that, I will make different videos if you want, plus share this, normally I don't make clarification video, I have the attitude of my brother, I fed him, whether I understand it or not, but sometimes you feel. No, no, friend, I wanted to tell you a big thing, but if you tell it in a short time, many people boarded the bus, so I hope I have explained it to you. Subscribe to the channel, like it, you will get the webinar info group. Go to it in the comment section and see if you understand and if you want to learn all this, then only I teach it in a good way all over India, no one else teaches because there is no 360 degree perspective, only one person knows so many things which I know, otherwise that is why you all.  It will be fun to learn, you will get to learn holistic, so join, thank you very much."

    "title": "Real Estate Mein Tezi Ke Market Ka Ek Positive Side Effect [-Q5zTQrEdqo].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, very interesting topic of real estate, it will be learning for many people, a positive side effect of the booming market, I will only say positive, I am fine, I will tell you the example of Gurgaon Real Estate and you tell me whether you identify with it or not.  When this was before the bull run started, about two and a half to three years ago, if you see, there are many affordable housing in the societies, I can also say something.  Even now I don't want to take the names of the societies. There is a society in Sector 68 which has money making machines etc. There used to be issues there and the people there used to raise noises like 'Hi, Hi, Hi, Hi, Hi', it's fine and you used to see the 'hi' of the general people. Alas, but now we don't do it, even today that road has not been built, by the way, beyond which there was a ruckus, after 3 years, brothers and sisters, there is a society in Sector 68 where there are 1300 flats of some square feet 72 73.  They used to be sold for 75 lakhs and there was a lot of noise, brothers and sisters, now they have become worth 1.5 crores, the rent there is coming at 30,32,35,000, so finger on your lips, that is, when real estate does well, it is the Lola Palooza effect.  If you are not doing well, the negativity is coming for some reason, and even at that time of the Negativity Society, I used to make videos that brother, this society will be yours, it is on top of it.  If you stage a dharna, the rate will be reduced by 00,000 feet. These lifts with affordable housing are like this, they are crowded, less and more people stay in the lift, it takes time, has it changed now, has the high speed lift been installed, has anything changed?  What has changed? Affordable housing will be double of what you had taken. Wherever your position has come in Gurgaon, tell me if it has not come and in some places it will be triple. In some places it will be triple.  The thing taken for 25 lakhs has gone, it has become worth 75 lakhs. Other wise, the thing taken for 28 lakhs has gone to 58 60 62 Other wise, it will be 75 80 at many places. Now no one is saying anything. 17 18 20 22 Rents have started coming in Haj Affordable Housing.  There has been a lot of upsurge, so now everything is practically not changed much on the ground, the thing that  I was crying, mostly that thing happens, so this is what I am telling about psychology, here I am neither showing anything bad to the public nor am I telling anything, I am just telling an observation that when this happens in life and this is what I teach to people like us, this is my second channel. Same thing happens in our life also, fights are happening, Mia and wife are having fights, then husband's tension has increased, these returns have come from somewhere, lottery has opened from somewhere, some money has come.  Then will the marriage be good? The husband has become great, the aarti will be performed, the wife will be good, something good has happened in life or something else, if not, the boy has passed IT or the girl has passed AIIMS or the children have done something good, this is life.  Yes, something has actually changed, which means nothing has changed in oneself, the ground reality on which one had to cry, the thing to cry about has not changed. Look, how I link it to real estate and teach deeper things, but if something else gets better, then everything is fine.  Correct So all that ends well ends well Is all that is well What is the English proverb I forgot I am fine but tell me all is well which ends well or by saying something like yes now everything is fine brother sir fine  Had taken a flat of Rs 70-72 lakhs, had to pay a lot of money but now it is one and a half lakhs, so it's okay, no one is there, now the builder is okay, the market is booming, be careful about good builders.  Start buying things, this is my advice to you guys, don't cry, even once you get the project, do as much due diligence as you want before buying it. Once the registry is in your name, it is yours now, nothing will happen to him by defaming him.  So a lot of goods will be sold and will be sold and people who go in and come out, it happens that anyway it makes a difference to half of them, so now you have to turn it on, it is yours, no, no, I am in consumer form, I am like this.  Well that's you  It will be known that the value of the property will end. I know such societies where RW President and all of them used to sit on dharna. Now in the bull market, the same present has taken three more flats in the society where he used to sit on dharna.  This is also a matter of truth, I am telling you because the market is bullish and many people are in it. One more thing to remember is that there are very vicious people too, many will hold protests and will spoil the environment. They know that the reality is not that bad.  or some  It is going to be good, there is a booming market, we will buy things from you at quarter to one prices, you will find it a little bit disgusting, it is not that much, it is not as much noise as we were making and today go to affordable housing societies which were earlier.  It has been sold where there was very high density, where things with carpet area of ​​400 feet by 350 feet because earlier the definition of affordable housing was 45 meters, then it came to 60 meters and then it became 15.  The meter is also of 160 square feet, so where goods of less than 45 square meters i.e. less than 500 square feet are sold and there are also cars parked there, go today, there is space for car parking in the entire area.  It is a different matter that only a car is visible but there are cars parked on the road and two wheelers are also parked inside, the parking space that was provided below but people have taken out the car parking space, now then there is no dedicated car parking.  Also, car parking space also comes and gets sold and the government has made a provision that if you can sell then things were looking like that at that time and they were going to condemn, you will eat the car parking, it was affordable housing brother car parking.  Meaning, car parking in Hooda sector is outside on the road where there are no stilts, you can go anywhere you want, DL Phase One, you can go anywhere you want, where the ground floor is first second and Rs 2.5 lakhs.  There is a rate there too, if the car is parked on the road, then if it is parked on the road somewhere inside the wall of the affordable society, then what was the problem, but people have capitalized on these things a lot. In two-three years, now no one talks, nor does any UTTER come and talk.  No user comes and says 'A', that's why I used to say on that thread, 'It's a blind buy, everything will increase'.

    "title": "Real Estate Vs Mutual Fund ｜ Deep Analysis [P5tAq-BF1Ok].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today we will take the basic understanding of real estate versus real estate returns of mutual funds. Mutual fund returns because of a lot of finishing influence make topics on things and one standard topic is Rahat, yes, you took a loan on real estate and then you gave the loan and you  If you have given bass, you have given only so much bass for so many years and if you lie here then it becomes like this, basic mathematics is a relief, rough mathematics is a relief, so today I will talk about some things and returns which  Maybe there is no discussion about caste for real estate. I am not saying here not to do mutual fund but I am telling him how to do it in a more buttery way and for such youngsters, first of all you should buy a house and then do mutual fund, this is how it should be done.  We will discuss about that in the mutual fund, every month, it will be invested as per the best, so take any mother, it is a mutual fund, take any good one from any fund house and its new one is ₹ 100, today, if I  If I put some money late and put ₹ 1 lakh in it then it will be deposited as per my 100 rupees. There is a market of 4 years. Lately, the market is bullish or up trade or is it a reasonable good economic scenario in which sometimes such Sometimes the generality is going up by doing like this, then whatever new I get, I will also get 110, 120, 140, if this new is going up from ₹ 100, it is going to 140, 4.  I am getting 150 rupees late in a year, so I am investing my money at different times but here my lib is zero rupees brother in law this is no concept where I can say ok mutual fund sir number I am in your mutual fund ₹  I will invest 1 crore but I will invest it in a year because I do not have money and I will invest it slowly but please give me this ₹ 100 that you have today. I will not say brother, this is no.  Note that in mutual funds, here you will get the market price of the day, but in real estate, when you are a builder and you are looking for a late construction property of a premium builder in a premium location, let us take an example.  As an easy example, let's take dead crore or ₹ 1 crore. For this, you don't have ₹ 1 crore but he told you the square fit rate at ₹ 10000.  Fixed, now that rate is becoming ₹ 10000 400 after two months, so yours is only 10000 but the money is not yours, you got the payment plan, you got 20 * 5 25 240, whatever you got, now you have to pay this much, then you have to pay on super structure, then position.  Paying but your rate was fixed earlier, now inflation has come, sir, the rate has increased, it is ultratech cement, it is a sack, whatever, whatever rate.  Big, he made that commitment to you, that rate will keep increasing in the future, infrastructure development is happening outside, economy is growing, interest rates are going down, Fana, threat, demand, supply story is here, then what did you do, Singh Sahab has one crore.  You did not have it, you had 10-20 lakhs, so you made the payment, then you took the loan, now the loan you took, you took the loan at eight plain eight no percent. Whatever is going on right now, defending on the civil court, okay no loan, if your absolute growth is ₹ 89% and you are giving him build base, eight no, then you are still getting beat because he is flooding the entire portfolio. Sir, till now you have not taken the loan because you see that this is first, this is zero, this is four years, first year, second year, third year, fourth year, so you have given the initial money, you have taken your loan here. Took a loan, now this loan is only for 3 years but the problem you have is that this is not the total cost of the property, it is of Rs 20 lakhs, it is only 20%, then your interest is on it, due to which then your calculator will do that.  Eight is 8.5% so this after that here after that here after that here you are positive then this is the leverage you are doing to him even if you did not have the money then compare the returns with the returns which you can give only when you have the money.  If you can then the absolute numbers get shaken, here you can play for Rs 10-20 lakhs, here you can play the game for crores, date is this one second thing, this market has collapsed, if the stock fell by 20-30-40% then you would have panicked.  Be it a ship, band or caste, do you withdraw the money or is it easy to withdraw the money? If you ever need to withdraw the money, then the ship says do it for 20 years, it will be so much, he would not have done it for 20 years because it is easy to withdraw it, isn't he one of yours?  It is like a piggy bank, if you ever open it like this, it will burst within a second. My ill status note like date. Real state, when you have not got it even before having children, then there is commitment. Your wealth creation is a real statement. This is what Chindi does, is n't it?  By shipping Rs 510000, everyone told me that if I do it then something good will happen in my life. Nothing good is happening. When you get that house, either you will live in that house or you will give it to that house.  If you pay rent and live in the house, then put the remaining rent in a mutual fund. And if you are not living on your own, put it in a mutual fund. Now your rent will double in 8 to 9 years. And you play with this only the market is core. Now when you calculate the market in the middle of the year then you will have a lot of money in the market. If the market has forgotten then what happened to the loan? You have to understand that if  I am 80 lakh loan late. Let me give you an extreme example. People say no, the more you pay, the more inflation will happen. Hey brother, I will tell you with an extreme example. I took a loan of one crore late 20 years ago and I have only paid the onion and I If I don't repay the principal then how much will be my loan after 20 years? It will be Rs 1 crore because I only gave the bass. I didn't even pay the principal. Now the new bass I was giving is being given on rent.  So, my rent for 20 years, which was 3% in the beginning, gets doubled in 10 years, although the rents double in 8 years and also double in 7 years, according to 10%.  It's okay if it doubles in 7 years, but I am from 6-7%. If it doubles in 10 years too, then my three's six becomes 12%, then my rent will be 3%.  You listened carefully, I got the average rent in the last 20 years, I picked it up at 7:30 and that's it, I gave the adjusted income tax rebate which has gone, so that's it for me, okay, now I have a loan of Rs. 1 crore on my head. I have given the basic information that normally this does not happen, people repay the loan in a year because the salaries get flooded, everything is possible, but if you want to give an extreme example then brother.  Sir, inflation has also destroyed the value of his ₹ 1 crore loan. Today you have a loan of ₹ 1 crore on your head and 20 years ago you had a loan of ₹ 1 crore on your head. Do you understand the difference in its weight? Will the value of the money reduce?  You should also understand that the government is the biggest authority of the country. On the other hand, the government is more important than any company and is more God than any individual. Sixth, so many notes are printed that the loan that gets paid does not get paid at all because it is a type of inflation. I have ever seen you as an example. Someone had once made a policy of Rs. 1000000 30 years ago and today it has a maturity of Rs. 10 lakhs. What is happening is ₹ 1000000. Today, when you will be paying him on time, then how much more will 10 lakhs be worth? I have paid you 10 lakhs.  In 1992, how would the policy of Rs 10 lakh be going, the person who did it doesn't know what is great, now in 2023, this is the mutual fund and ship, no one even allows you to have so much and he doesn't even let you have so much, that is a different thing whereas what I am telling you is The property that you had, the loan on it is one crore rupees, the amount of money I had has become equal to the rent, it is my loan, look at the name of the property which was 20 years ago, if it is a property worth crores of rupees, is it a big plot, is it now?  If you see, it will be worth 6-7-8-10 crores, that is Sir's profit, I have given these people in absolute terms that your interest will go to this much, the interest rates vary, in the next 20 years the interest will go even less which was in the past.  He has to go much lower than the 20 year interest rate. The way the economics are, this leverage is the best chance to do it. If someone wants to become rich, he has to create wealth because the assets are so long. Real assets will become expensive. This is the new generation, Jain ji, who has been working since 96, will not be able to buy it. The child who is 18 years old today will not be able to buy a house. This thing will become so expensive, it will always be rented.  But it will remain the same and then it will always be backpacked and the renter and the same should I buy, the car can also be taken, if there is power, clothes can also be taken, utensils can also be taken, the house can also be taken, no one knows what to do next.  could my  Come to infect the house, go to see the bathroom, show me that you are very useless, how are you, you have a lot of problems within the society, so I will make a separate video some time, if you want, at least 10 to 15 reasons which are there.  Note, non- financial considerations, non-financial reasons, you should be normal till date, no one has done that, they don't say, this is security and emotional lead, they have ruined it emotionally.  From need you do not know how to increase efficiency in your life by being needy. How to increase leverage. You live in your own house, isn't it the way your bus tweets is different from the way if you stay on a rented house and  I see what you are saying and renting and staying on in your own house because that is reflected in your attitude which is my video I will make it if you want then tell me  Because today I just wanted to point out the difference that brother, they do not tell me these things, they never talk about rent, they never talk about income, they always keep the interest rate at high, they never say that people  They will also return the loan. These people never talk about your salary. When it is in a mutual fund, they increase your salary by 10% every year and put it in it. However, this is also a fact for people that their salary should not increase by 10% every year.  There is a job too, it is a Chhath caste, if you somehow get a house in this life, then come on, even now you will not starve in the government's two-tax-five-six rupees bathere scheme, because the house rent is something which you will have to pay, if you live in your house.  If you don't live at home, you will have to live physically, then calculate your sins from mutual fund returns, then you can see how things are happening and please send the mutual fund returns for the last 6 years by writing.  Tell me how many negative ones are there, zero or 3%, how many are there? Read, 6 years is enough since 2015 or after 7-8 years, tell me how many returns, tell me the returns of the last three years. Now these people also do this.  You have reduced the fuss, ship the scaffolding, will that also come to me, please do the calculations and tell me what is going, no no, the maintenance cost will be very high and then this cost will flood, then that will flood, then paint will have to be done, all mother.  Lia my brother, talk about the rest of the rent also, what is the condition of the rents in Bangalore? Do you know? Now people want a video on that. You guys know what happened in Bangalore, today rents are stuck inside Bangalore.  It is going to be started today because as the supply of big lions becomes completely limited then Shayari will become different and it will become very difficult to live there. They will say that if it becomes difficult then it is necessary to live there, but also I will tell you all.  I will make a video. You can watch the video from my other channel. If you want to join Real Estate Info Winner Group, you will find it at the top of the comment area. If you are not already joined, there I will tell you the templates in detail.

    "title": "Resale Market Price And New Launch Price Difference In Gurgaon ｜ Deep Dive Analyis [SQ2Dneqy_Ms].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, in today's video we will discuss about the rates available in the resale market Gurgaon which are in under construction properties and those in new launches. This is a rate differential. We will discuss this phenomenon. It is a big thing. People always think about things.  If you want to understand in black and white, these old ones are not being sold and these new ones are being launched at this rate, then we will discuss this thing, okay this is a message for those who have bought the old ones also.  There is a message for those who want to take something new, there is a message for those who have taken something new, there is a message for those who are waiting and watching, this is going to be a very beneficial video for everyone, I make practical videos and there are take aways for people. You will never find such brochures and things moving around like this, neither will you find names, nor will you find drone shots, nor will you find roads, okay someone, the setting of my sofa will change to the maximum, the color of this sweater will change by one half.  If there is a flower or leaf, its color will change, rest will not change but will change, the thing that I am bringing to you in the quality of content is YouTube3, now let's start with the resale, if you go to Gurgaon, which  Things are resale market, basically you can call it cold and we will discuss why it is cold, it is cold because no one is interested, only new goods are coming in to sell, so when no one is interested.  The forces of the market are not interested so no one calls you or calls you and on top of that the resellers also have their own tantrums that they will not sell at this much and will sell at this much, sellers are the market anyway but the new buyer is the one who joins the new buyer. He is going, now he is joining like NRI is fine, so at 20 to 30, NRI is responsible for sales in Gurgaon, now he presses the button of marquee builders listed player or in US.  Sitting in Europe, Australia, Singapore, sitting anywhere, it is not going to evolve anyway in the zig zig zag of resale. How much will you pay, brother, what was the payment plan, what was that, that is one reason, the second reason is that the new goods are coming now.  Coming in ultra luxury, there is a difference in the specifications, there is a difference in the amenities, there is a difference in the quality too and something like now the product has been launched in a very central location in Sector 49, so brother that.  So the location is so prime in the settled area, the area which has been settled for 15-20 years will also demand premium and this is a phenomenon I would like to explain to you better, if you understand this thing then you will understand what is happening. You are seeing that only big ticket sizes are coming, which means the physical size is also coming big - 2400 square feet, 2600 square feet, 3600 square feet.  3000 square feet, the one that was coming 1200 1400 1600, like you had seen of Hero Holmes, you had seen of Shahpur ji, there was a time of 2000, 20, 21, 22, that kind of lashes were coming, Sudden Mama tune changes this phenomenon.  And if we understand this reasoning then we will understand what is happening and one more thing I would like to tell you is that  If you want to see Shobha's project, see Godrej Meridian of Rs. 108, which is of small size and in the same product of big size, there is a premium of 1000 to 00 per square feet in the big size, that is, the big one is expensive. Normally, have we seen in real estate that the per yard rate of a 200 yard plot would be a little higher, but we have always seen this in real estate for 300 yards of square yard vegetation.  This is an observation but now it is not here, I want to tell you that this is a unique thing and you have to understand carefully what the builders are doing in this. There will be some calculations, no calculator is needed, no pen and paper, I will tell you in a simple way to understand.  Try, if any land parcel comes, the builder builds it according to the FR. If the floor area ratio of FR is there, then assume that if the floor area ratio allowed is somewhere 3.5, then if it is 100 yards.  If there is a thing, then 350 yards can be made beyond that. One thing is very simple. Now what has happened is over a period of time. The Gurgaon, sorry, Haryana Government has increased the FR for every place where earlier it was 1.75 or something like 2.25. There everything is increased by 3.54 4 and 1 Half Transit Corridor. This project is within this distance of the road, so much more.  Apart from this, I will not make it very technical, I will tell you the rough mathematics that the FR has been increased by a lot, so now the builder has two choices in that, brother, the builder's FR can be made by the same amount. For example, in some project, a builder can be made from lets. As an example, I am telling you that he is allowed to build 10 lakh square feet, he is allowed to build only 10 lakh square feet, he cannot build 11 lakh and he will not build 9 lakh because why would he?  Why would he waste Rs 1 lakh which he could have made, just like he could have extracted it from sugarcane juice? Now what comes in the story, now what is happening in Khela, okay I am in the sense of Khela, how are the market forces doing that?  What is Bhai Saheb doing in 10 lakh square feet? He is producing less units by making bigger size buildings, so when less units are being produced then first of all the market realizes that the density is low, you can call it ultra luxury somewhere.  The density of 100 is like that of a money making machine. Many people do not even check. The density of 130-140 affordable is 150 flat per acre, which was considered the highest in Gurgaon. These ones also fell below 100. Many of them fell below 100.  Now if that 100 rupees are lost, then 100 rupees will be given to yours, now you are selling it as ultra luxury, the public has already sold it but it is considered ultra luxury. You can't say luxury like this. Okay, so now these people have again brought the density to 50-60. Once again the density which was increasing and how have they brought that within the same FR you have 3600 square feet, 3000 2400 means sizes.  You have taken it big, now no one will forget in this, what is the benefit to the builder in this because if we look at the cost of construction according to the carpet area, it is equal, so he has to do so.  What a great benefit you are getting, you are getting benefit, yes, I tell you, you can visualize now, you do not need to be a little architect, you do not need to be a contractor, you just have to make the carpet area carpet area 10000 square feet, you have to make it here 10000 square feet.  And here also we have to make 10000 square feet. Okay, in this 10000 square feet carpet area, you have taken out 10 flats. If we assume that there is 1000 square feet of carpet, then how many flats have you taken out at your place?  10 And here you have taken out three or four from the flats, for this four is fine, now four square feet, I am not making the mathematics too difficult, it will be like this, so brother, I have made four flats here. 00 * f is 10000 square feet.  Feet made here, I took out 10, so my tiles will look the same brother. Specification Specification: If I am applying the same, then the tile of the tile is getting stuck in the carpet. What is the difference, what is the difference?  It comes to things, four kitchens are being built here, 10 are being built here, okay more bathrooms are being built here, the rooms here will be more because the size of the rooms will be smaller, the size of everything here is big but when  If I reduce the size, I have to make a wall in the room, there is an expense for that, let's assume this again, one room is of 200 square feet and I have made two rooms of 100-10000 square feet.  There is a room of 200 square feet, it has four walls, but the two rooms which I made, now the expenses have increased there. What I am trying to say is that in selling big flats to the builder, there is more margin profit. You can have a rough idea of ​​how much more it is.  Let's take it, if the builder was earning profit at Rs 15 in the small ones, then in the big ones he will make it closer to Rs 25.25. You are understanding and in this, if the unit is carpet then I am getting the goods but According to how much to sell per square foot, if in this one I have to sell 700 units and in this one I have to sell 2800, now I have to sell 2800 units. Even if your ticket size is small but the quantity is huge, then from inside it seems that the supply is very limited. More than 28800 people came. Catching, explaining, showing, selling, marketing takes a lot of effort. This product is easy because in this I have completed the EEI stage, before that even the RERA stage did not come.  Gone to Hong Kong market, moved to US, sent my sales team for four months, did a presentation, got up, got the cheque, now my total case is Rs 700, 300 checks for selling the flat have come from outside me, so I am confirmed as a builder here.  I am here, I do n't need anyone to say hello friends, I don't even need a twitter, that's why you must have seen these days in youtube3 system, when you are irrelevant in any ecosystem, then there is chilli.  If it is released, then like you, some films are released. Okay, when a film is released, then the producer makes it, that is, he gives money, makes the director, then the distributor comes and then it is released in the cinema halls. If someone is fired in between, then Even if two pictures are becoming hits and are running, many people will say, what nonsense is happening, you are understanding but by sour grapes like this, wrong message cannot be sent, okay, wrong message cannot be sent, now big levels. But big deals are happening, all the small players who were down there, like now the joint venture of Hindustan Unilever FMCG is making some changes in how to do sales, so many people feel uneasy in between, so that is ok but that.  Dozen means that there is no demand for the products of Hindustan Unilever, there is no quality, there is no value for money, there are no people, otherwise it is not like that, you people are the public, it is the retailer, what difference does it make to you that the goods  Where is it coming from, how is it coming, what is coming, your focus should be on how much is coming, is it worth taking or not, will it move forward, the builders are bringing big things right now, this phenomenon will play out in two to four months.  It seems to be happening as it is said that everything has its limit so it is visible but this supply is limited and even in this case if he brings 700 units and sells 600 because 100 is still left whereas that one.  Sometimes there is an uproar, 1500-2000 checks have come, so many people have drawn the plot, people refuse, sometimes no one wants to buy the unit, for some reason, if it is 500-150 units, the builder will build it in four-five-six years, sell the project and it will be sold at an expensive price.  He has to incur some loss. To start the construction of any project, the builder has to sell only units at Rs 20. If a tower is sold at Rs 20, then the tower is  If it is possible to start, then if there are 100 flats in a tower, I have sold 20, it is okay, I have not received the full amount, only the booking amount and construction lint, even then the construction of the tower, I am telling you the rough mathematics of the real estate money.  It's like, I have catered everything in it, you have to keep the money in your escrow account, that 70 rupees and all that, after catering it all, I am telling you a figure, so this 20 rupees, every builder can easily afford it. If a person is sitting on 7080 and puts 100 then no matter what is told to the market that 10,000 people are standing in the queue but brother, out of 100, 70-80 are being sold, this is the truth and can be checked in the RERA of the next quarter, so now.  There is a difference between resale and its sale because one or two things are causing the phenomenon that the seriousness of the person trying to sell is not known in the resale. Yes, I want to sell, I have lined up a buyer, now he says he is ready to buy, he says I don't sell, then he says I have to sell at an expensive price, then someone like us comes in between, in 202 days such a video would come.  And through this video, I also make a part of that video that if you are sitting with real estate in Gurgaon real estate, there is no need to run away at this time, there is going to be a huge mismatch of demand and supply in 2020.  There were no launches in 2122, so whoever is selling in resale is doing foolishness, don't sell, Shahpur ji's 2,000 square feet rates have been increased, people have agreed to it only on me, Hero Homes rates have increased, even now I say  I am Shapur ji, don't sell Hero Homes, don't sell Godrej Meridian, Shobha people have tantrums, they are not selling like that, have fun, it's okay, Shobha people have given the rate which is the builder's.  The rate is there, you took it to him only, or there is a demand and supply issue going on, so go there too, he says yes, you want to sell, he comes to take it, he increases the rate by Rs. 00, no, don't sell for this much, Rs. 500 and everyone is having tantrums.  Nobody is giving time now till late and many people are sitting there buying on their own and are becoming buyers that I have to buy just to know the market rate and why is this bullying.  She has been in the market like me, she did not start like me, she did not start like me, through webinars, now I face a lot of trolling on this because the poor person who is working in real estate has been killed.  Fake calls are coming, now brother, I want to buy, I don't want to buy it, actually it is already there, I just want to know the rate, when you call to buy, what rate is told, is it ok and when to sell?  If we talk about it, then is n't it me, I have taught the technique to take advantage of the entire market, when you go to sell, brother, no one is taking it, when you go to buy, there is a garden lying there, then there is a mismatch between the two and which  Today, none of the sellers are satisfied with their work. Nowadays, in the coming time, the system will start picking up the files in the market. Until the system starts picking up the files, the market is not peaking, even Plato is not closing. What will come into the system if the seller is not on high pay and the facilitator is not satisfied with the normal paper work, the hard work is very justified, okay, he has to play the game of only 500 thousand feet, it took three months' time.  Took two-three months' time, then brother, that market will come, only then the resale will be caught, without that, it will not be caught because there is time to be some catalyst, no one can sell it.  No one is calling, there is no interest in selling it and the genuine person who genuinely wants to buy the game is not being given any quote because he is asking the next person to control the resale in the market in a way.  It has been taken because people like me had also given advice and today I would have given advice again. You need money. You are sitting on a good asset whose construction risk has reduced a lot because the structure has been ready for one year.  There is a position in I, there is a position in one and a half year, you take on board someone from your family relatives that brother, this much has been rated, I will give you entry at this much, you take this much and this much share will also remain yours even now.  You will earn more money and the part you had or the money you needed will be yours in full or what happens in many cases is that there is no money for the next installment because you had already taken it, so now wait to extract the full juice. Structure: If you want a video on which cycle money is made in real estate under construction, how it is made because many people buy it, sell it in 3 months, sell it in 6 months, sell it further, it was like this youtube0 bin p  This is the lotus of Hawaii, this is this rainy frog, this is when something has happened then he comes and tells the story. Hey brother, first I have to tell you, you have to explain the phenomenon and you have to come and say like I am coming and telling you now. Note.  Please note that the day the Dwarka Expressway will be operational, vehicles will be connected in Delhi as per the actual ribbon cutting. In 2 months time from that day, there will be a further increase of Rs 15 to Rs 20 in properties. I don't know what the rates are going to be till that day.  The rate is reaching Bhag, which I had made a video before Diwali to predict the price of next Diwali, which I had predicted for 12 months, its % of the price in the last two months. Brother, normally if the time is 12 months then the target should be achieved at 88. If you have predicted something from 00 to go to 130 late then the appreciation of 30 is considered as 100% target.  So ₹ has been done, you understand that in just two months it will be a little faster going forward and on the day the ribbon will be cut, he will shoot over. Read the video.  I will go and try to find it, if I find it then I will post it in the comment section. In the comment section, you will find a webinar of mine and mine in the info group. If you join it, then I will explain things further openly through webinars. Anyway, I will explain.  If I am in resale then again I will tell you that miss pricing because nobody is interested in carrying it out you require lot of people mostly people are interested in selling  The new one will be told only what is told will be told only the suits which are not shown, Chhotu went to Lala ji's shop and Lala ji said, if you show that one, only the suits lying inside will be shown to sister ji.  If you are not visible then how can that sister buy? You should understand that her time will also come and in her time now if you want to get some good things for resale which some person is selling out of compulsion then I am telling her.  If you don't want to sell then Basically there is no rate for resale because the man says that Amit Sangwan has said not to sell in Gurgaon real estate, now this thing should not be sold in resale but this man is still selling, so this man is helpless and the helplessness of a helpless man.  If advantage is taken, then they say that in distress sale, the rate will also be taken only if the rate is distressed, otherwise we will not take it, this is the problem, then the rate is not included in it, are you understanding because in that  The man should give you the same amount as you had taken, now he is saying that friend, I had taken it at eight, the builder is giving it at 11, so you take it at 10, take it at 105, take it at 9500 because he is saying.  Or not, if you give only at eight, then now in this buffalo game, the person who is trying to make them talk or is saying that it is okay, then it is not happening because only if it is resold in large volumes, then the rate will be higher.  There will be a decision, now if someone has got a unit in resale at Rs 8300, then the person who is expecting Rs 93 will say to the person who has Rs 83, brother, the unit is Rs 83, you are talking about Rs 93 with me.  So 83 now this 93 person has no means to check whether this person is telling the truth because now the greed of the people in the middle of the system is also increasing.  That frustrates the sellers and those doing resale, nothing is happening and those who want to buy are not getting any units because he is not allowing them to join because here there is a mood of eating fat and eating cream in between.  If you are not enjoying, then nothing is happening, when multiple resale will start happening, brother, in this society, 15 units have been sold in resale at this rate and that will be revealed to the market, then it will come to know that this is the rate, the question is that  Brothers and sisters, even 15 units are not being sold, they are not being sold in resale, so there is no rate, now if it is someone's compulsion, then they will say the same and many people are doing it, something happens in someone's house, someone's medical, someone's.  If anything else, then they say that buy it at that rate, now that unit is sold somewhere in the market out of compulsion, because you know compulsions also happen by hand, there are compulsions in life, so then the market is like this. If you invest in the stock market, you will come to know that some companies are illiquid.  There are stocks and there is not much trading of shares in them, so if someone buys them at a higher rate then that rate does not become that and if someone sells out of compulsion then that rate does not become a market and if someone does it like this  If there is, SEBI also orders investigation, this is also called rigging up, so real estate is also quite liquid. Real estate is not like your stocks, go anywhere you will see ads. On 99 acres, you will see 150 ads in a single project. Those one or two flats which are in resale belong to him, brother has written to all the brokers, he has put ads to everyone, so it seems that we don't know how much goods are in resale.  It is being sold because you are just counting that number of listings. That is the listing of the same flat. When you call, you will get the same. Call and check. Push the limit in any project. Someone has written four or five things. Three of them are enjoying.  They are not interested, they are genuinely trying to sell and those who are buyers and receive calls, no one knows who is there and all this raita that is spread, half of my fruit is spread to the people that my friend.  Otherwise, there is no way to check, you are sitting idle, call and check how much is it, how much is mine, because there is no stock exchange, brother, I had now bought shares, now I have opened a business and the ticker is coming down.  Oh, my family has this much share or is it going on money control in the mobile like this, oh my family has so much, if there is no way, then he calls and asks how much is done, how much is done, so much is done, okay, I am so much  I will sell and then he will find a buyer.  He gives it and then says no, I will not sell it now, he has said it, Amit Sangwan has said, if you do n't want to sell then no one has to sell it, so these are the times, what do you want to start, whom do you want to do good to, what second third fifth 10th  The order is effected, the one who is going to start it doesn't know, even I don't know what is happening, so I know what is happening, so I came and made this video that brother, if this is happening, then why don't you feel more sad in it.  of  There is no need to be too happy, there is no need to resell, when that whole story is completed, then in the video I promised, I will tell you how this happens, how long to hold it, how to do it, those who bought it and the full purchase money. Now you will jump in the market and say that you have been looted and big people are waiting like this. Hey, many people have taken it. Hey brother, everyone's brother-in-law, brother-in-law, brother-in-law, father-in-law, father, any relative. Many are close, their wives are sitting with FD, so please give them your share and tell them brother, come, there is no problem, there should be such fights and lack of trust in all the relatives, it does not happen even at 70-80, but the right thing is also done.  It has been done by people and when the paper work is correct then anyone can do it. I had also made a video on this. Real Estate Investment Trust which you can create within the circle of five different members of the family, that is, those who have little  It is close related that the two brothers are cousins ​​and their children. Why can't they buy property by doing this like this? Brother, you can buy property easily. The public is not sitting with two crores in cash or is sitting in the bank with a loan but is sitting with Rs 10,20,30 lakhs, a little loan one.  It is possible that construction is taking place in four years, otherwise the money will be lost, otherwise people can take it together on their 25 25 25 25. Four people in the name of women cannot comfortably take it, no, this and that.  What kind of mess will happen? You people have put names and then wherever one's brother belongs, he does the same. There are so many families in India that if we take it like this then there will be a better jump in real estate. This is all a phenomenon.  Hope I made a little long video, I was successful in telling you this thing and the last message is this, hold on to your assets, the party has just started, it has just started, people are feeling that no, it will not happen, to whom will this happen?  It seems  The one who did not buy, the one who is sitting after buying is saying, Son, why is going to the moon ending? It depends on which side you are and those who are sitting with it are in such cities where they are not growing, where parents are selling.  They are not giving where they can't do anything, they will just say so, now we have to increase the love slowly, we have to go beyond the limits, it is the same, now we have to increase the rates, we have to go beyond the limits, okay now those people  If you don't speak, you won't grow like this. Hey, infrastructure is bad, many people say to me many times, Hey infrastructure, look at this, friend, this infrastructure is bad, then this is the rate, what will happen if it gets fixed, then no one thought this because you think this rate is high and this is what you are facing.  Looks bad, ok, that's the problem, if it is so bad, then this rate should not be there, okay, because if the infrastructure is good, then why is the rate not within Greater Noida, 00 feet now, 2000  Rot because people have not come to spoil the infrastructure. Okay, so far it is not spreading. Okay, the house in which a person will have children or three or four children, the family is good and the spread house will look tight. Will that house look bright?  It will be fun, where only old people will live, only one or two old people live, that is the story of Greater Nad, that is neither sound nor any dirt will be seen, nor anything will be seen spread out nor toys will be seen spread out as an example.  But I am telling you that they will be reduced and the day the infrastructure here is also fixed, brothers and sisters, then where will you go? What are 10 to 12 very great things happening in Gurgaon? Right now, some people know about it and some do n't know about it.  Apart from this, I will also make a video and by the end of this year, changes will be visible in the infrastructure also because it is the election year not only for the Center but in May and June but also for the State Government in October and November.  If elections are taking place then this result is final, just like the final paper has to be checked, so the student i.e. the government in this case has to work hard, everyone does it around the exam, right, you also know and there will be a lot of focus Bhateri.  There are assembly seats here and which impacts all around and many people have invested their money so 10 months is a lot. Plans for upliftment are already in place. What are the plans? What is happening?  Beyond that, if you want a video, please write that too in the comment section and in the comment section you will find the Real Estate Info Webinar Group."

    "title": "Saheb , Biwi And Property Buying [jFXTVaz_Z6k].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, interesting topic sir, wife and property buying, normally I could have kept it on my big channel also, I am trying to keep it on real estate as main focus because this psychology affects the real estate, I will explain it very well if you are a man.  So you must share this with your wife, the situation is like a pickle that will emerge, she can get out of it, so let's start today in 2024 when this video is being made in August.  In the last two-three-four years, there has been a lot of run up in property, it has happened pan India, it has happened everywhere, now the property buyers are going to the market to buy property, so the pricing is what it is and it is already run up everywhere as per the space available.  It has happened that you all know, so the women do not know the exact idea, especially if they are housewives, they do not know the exact idea. It is true that if they live in a rented house.  Especially for the wives of government employees, this is more because they are not connected to land and they have to buy in big cities or in proper city centers and they live in small cities and there they have to buy a big house.  And they get a bigger area as per their entitlement, so the problem with this is that your husband's (I will not use the word) status sounds a bit bad, but your husband's budget, which is what he says, is in line with that. Whatever is coming in the budget, I am addressing it to all the women, you will not like it because it has run up, the cycle of real estate is eight to nine years, according to me, three to four years have passed in it. And it will accelerate for four more years and then there will be a stagnation of six to seven years, so madam in this cycle, if you want to take it, you will have to take a smaller one, may your husband prosper a lot, may you all become very rich and you don't know what to buy.  but the truth is that  If you don't buy now then you wo n't be able to buy even this small one because the kitchens that are coming these days are not giving happiness to that many women but they are not giving happiness by seeing the size which they see in the brochure or like this but here I am.  I would like to address them with my knowledge that the kitchen which used to be 7 feet long and the top and bottom remained empty for 3 feet, now due to modular kitchen, things are being made in that space, big pantries are being made and such things are being made.  that you are like this  If you touch, the thing comes down and with the advent of technology, even though the storage space of the kitchen is decreasing, its size will still be much more. I will still not say that if the kitchen was 140 square feet and now it is 70 square feet.  If it is coming then it is equal, no, not equal, but you can say that the kitchen storage which was 110 square feet, today we can extract it from 70 square feet, I am talking about the carpet area of ​​the kitchen, off course.  It will not beat 140. It used to be very big but now it will become smaller and smaller. Parallel slabs will not come. Most of them will remain L shaped. Why am I making this so that by showing this video you can make it clear to your wives that  Now this is what has to happen and it is very important to tell the women here that madam like you are going to the jewelery shop, the rate of gold is increasing a lot, so did you like the 10 tola set?  One was coming till here like this, her earrings were looking very nice and your heart was touched. Wear a nice Tanishka of Dharohar brand. I am not promoting it here. I am telling you as an example but if you don't have money, the making charges are out at Rs 33.  It is off budget and I have to buy something, the rate of gold is increasing today, I am not able to buy 10 tola, so madam, take 5 tola, this is the message, I don't like it today, so madam, no problem.  No, I don't like it today, it does n't matter, the asset class is increasing, the rates are getting expensive, see tomorrow when something will happen, why to leave a you, no problem, why to make good and the best enemy of better if you are not having.  Anything because I want to tell women one more thing that after crossing the age of 45-50, one also needs psychological security of the house, this does not make sense in mutual funds. Other cases also come to me, the wife doesn't know what to do, then suddenly anything can happen if the husband is gone, a house may be small, it may be non-sexy, it may not be that great, because even in a car, if you want a car.  So brother, you buy a car, is n't it okay? Everyone likes a big car, but if you are not buying a good one, then brother, it is better to travel in a scooter than to travel in a taxi every day. This is the message to explain.  This is psycho because what is happening right now husband No one can buy a property if his wife has no smile on her face and no sense of achievement. Now what should the husband do if his budget is one CR from lets and that wow thing is coming in two CR somewhere in North India.  It has become more in the market, but even in markets like Pune, Bangalore or any other market, Mumbai or anywhere else in India, the purchasing power has not increased that much, the price of property has increased in the last three years, so much noise.  The shot is that the average salaries have not increased that much. What is the average? Peak salaries have also not increased. How much do the salaries increase? 5 6 7 But if you have done very well then 10 11 12 But you have put an arrow in the pumpkin very much. If you are very great then brother 12 13  At 14 and that too will increase by one year, no one increases by this much every year, okay the average comes only at 7, 8, 10, the property has increased much more than that and the sizes are less. Even after reducing the sizes, prices are still high, so all the husbands have to be told that this is a challenge, this is a challenge, and sometimes, I will tell you one more good thing in this, I will give another perspective of many women that today you are looking for storage.  You are sitting with space and space and with that you are thinking that I will make a new booking, it is small and what can be better than this, then I have to give you a feeling madam that your child who is in 11th and 12th will go out after college.  By the time the position comes in a year and the younger child will go to college somewhere, both the children will move out of the house, their books have also gone out, their everything has gone out, now it is not known when they will come back again because it is possible that they may get a job from there or get married.  Even if they go to America, Canada, US, Australia, even if they don't go there, if you were living in My children, son and daughter-in-law will always be there.  The son-in-law and he will also come like this, don't plan that much now, don't know anything further, take whatever is happening now because this thing which I just told is happening in many families, especially where the woman is 40.  Her ears are touching and the child is in her eighth-ninth bed and has to come out. As long as you have a position, you take the things according to what you are getting. Moving forward, relatives will move in and out of the house.  There are a lot of festivals, all this will become less and less, and you are taking your flat for yourself, you are taking your property for yourself, not for relatives, if that happens many times then what will happen, relatives will think that this is so.  It was taken too small, because of this, we don't take it, then it is taken 25 kilometers away, 30 kilometers, 50 kilometers away from the city center, I don't know, it is a very good thing, in the middle judge, it feels good, we need a big one, but once you  Hit Old Age Which Everybody Will Hit Then You Want To Be In City Center Close To Hospitals Close To Infrastructure Close To Every Amenity You Don't Want To Be Hanging Around At Corner Because Children Will Be Coming To You May Be For Children  So, near the airport, near the railway station, near the city center, it will make a lot of sense, so today please tell me the formula for my husband's budget also.  I am telling all the ladies to come to know that madam, if your husband and you have given some money by selling the property or your father or the boy's father, the chance is next to zero, or if you are getting inheritance from somewhere, if it is not so.  Have to buy property on your own and I agree, if you have savings etc. then have a big budget. Your husband's CTC is 5 to 6 years. This is the limit. If your husband's CTC is Rs. Lakhs in lets, who knows?  That there will be variable in it, tax will also be deducted in it, there will be 50 points in hand, but still to make the formula easier, I am telling you, if your husband's CTC is 30 lakhs, madam, then do not go above 1.5 crores, if more.  There are a lot of jobs left. There are a lot of jobs left. It is 20 25 30 years. If you are still 30 years old then it is okay. If you go for 6 years then the upper limit is 6 more years.  Lower limit is 5 so it should be of 5 to 6 years. If you are taking it at 44 43 45 then I assume your down payment power will be more. Maybe your savings may be mutual fund or FD. If it is FD then it is 5 years and if you are taking it at your age.  If you have been there for probably 6 years then if you are sitting with a package of 40 lakhs then brother if you do it six times then you will keep 2 crore 40 lakhs less then five I have done this rough math in big cities of India.  According to this, some cities have outpriced these rates in a very terrible manner. This is also a fact, but the rough mathematics has told you that if someone is giving your rental above Rs. 3, then you should hurry up. You should see in the coming time, in the next six to 10 to 12 months, the rents have gone up a lot in the last 2 years. Pan India, my prediction is that the rents will go up a lot in the next one and a half to 2 years, this is your standard.  This minimum will not increase from 89. According to me, rents will increase from 15 to 18. In every city, the supply is very limited in big cities. If Loches were next to zero in 20220, 21, 22, then as a result there is nothing going to come. Ready to move.  In 2025 26 27 there is going to be a mismatch of fresh supply in the market and  If you take this time first, it will be of great benefit. You will also get the benefit of ready to move in. I explain these things in great detail and well in my webinars. If you will see a real estate webinar info group opportunity in the comment section, please If you are not already on any of my groups then join them and if you want to take membership of the channel then you can do so by pressing the join button, many things have been explained and explained very well in it.  Have gone to Rump course, want to join my real estate mentor program where I take people to the consultant level so that you can start earning money from real estate, there are 25 types and 50 types of methods and you can do consultation, all the knowledgeable people can become expert.  If you want to know then if you want to join then you will find it in the recordings. You have done some recordings, there are some live classes, there is a class on Saturday at 7 pm, so feel free to get to know me.  There is a lot more need to learn because no one teaches real estate in the market, no one explains it, no college, no university, no education system, so like an insider, I will explain everything in detail and you will enjoy it a lot and you  Say it in your city or in your city, but definitely you will become the most intelligent go to person among your relatives, that too by joining the Rump course RE MP i.e. Real Estate Mentoring Program and if you join that course then you will be able to do so with your wife also.  You can join one, you can also join two, both are the same thing, my wife, it is the same thing, so you can join both of them together, thank you very much."

    "title": "Sellers Wanted In These 04 Projects In Gurgaon Real Estate ｜ Big Demand In These Projects [Dr8pcXplU94].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, I had to make this very important topic because actually there is a great need for four projects in Gurgaon. I am going to take the name in which I need sellers because I have so many buyers and brother, I have to match them too, so if I want to do business then it is okay because one  If that is the case, then you can be a seller for any reason. I am not trying to convince you here, I am just saying that if you need to then sell, although my opinion is always to sell in a bull run.  No, if you don't know what to buy further but still you want to sell then why should I question your personal requirement then I have requirement from many sellers there are many buyers so I need seller Shapur ji Sector 102 Gurgaon I want a seller in Godrej Meridian, Sector 106. I want a seller in Shobha, I want a seller in End Lawn, Sector 108.  What is the ball pak rate in 106? What is the ball pak rate i.e. what is the guess rate? It can be more or less depending on which flat it is and the variation in price can easily be from 7 to 8 but you understand how much it is.  Is it 000 foot base price at 7 per can be more than 000 000 plus minus it will make so much difference ok it is not towards less the base price I am telling is like bare minimum price than that  It can be increased if the unit is good, then in Shahpur ji, if you have to sell around Rs. 000, the deal can be done even for Rs. 14750, it can also be done for Rs. 145, but in less than Rs. 14, there is no benefit in selling now, we will try till this much to convince the buyer.  You have to understand that there will be a deal in 15 also in which you are seeing only flat, no view is looking very good or sunlight is not coming or the floor is above, depending on whose choice is not there.  Or if there is variation, there will be so much variation, then you will also accept that a thing worth Rs. 00 can also be worth Rs. 1057, if there is something better in it, then this is from Shahpur ji Shobha, considering the thick rate value, a thing can be bought even for Rs. 00 feet and a half.  It can happen in 20 also, it can happen in 21 and it can also happen in 21, so it is a matter of chance, so what happens at 5, 00 feet, 000 feet, then 20.  It can also be 21 and hit the limit on the lower side. 19 750 19500. Now it depends on which plan you have taken and whether you are ready to move in. This variation will also happen on the payment plan, so that variation will be plus or minus 000 feet.  So you just accept whatever rate is being quoted, what is the payment plan, what is the unit, how much money has been spent, is it ready to move or not? You can understand that everything will be done in ready to move in, if there is registration then the rate will increase. Okay, so you understood the rate. The third Godrej Meridian is also a matter of opportunity. You see the unit of 185 square feet there.  But people say something like 3 crore plus and 3 10 3 15, now it is a matter of opportunity, it has to be calculated according to square feet, you calculate it, I think it will be something around 163.  There is also talk in case 17, some also say 1730 but if some are going towards 163, then you can see in that and then the fourth comes the announcement, I will not say the price too much because 18000.  Yes, it is 18000, it is there, it is on the spot, it is 19, it is 1830, it is 19, it is 1930, it is 20, maybe it is not there because the payment.  If everyone's plans were in order, then if there is a problem in between, then keep that much understanding. Ball Pak figure. How many checks have you made? Do not add anything on the rate that I am telling you. GST, EDC, IDC. This rate is in super area rate, so if Shapur  Yes, it has to be done with 18552 square feet. If you have 3 BH, then Shobha is the one, 20 is 43, is it 2343 or is it the bigger one, now d1.  d2 and z12 are of Vista, whatever your square feet is, you know it is 3000, 2950 is around 2500, then it is okay to multiply it by that, do not create confusion in it and it is okay, so these are all the sellers, name your project.  The seller will tell me the procedure for selling your item, it is very demanding, it will take time, what happens to the buyers also, like if the sellers exceed the number then the buyers will be affected.  There are tantrums, this is also a fact, but right now there is no seller, there are more sellers who are only asking the rate, you said the rate is 165, no, I will sell it for 17, 17 said, I will sell for 18, it is 18.  If I sell it in 19, then this kind of system is going on, when you go to buy it, I have named these projects in resale and I will also tell you some more things. Now people, what are they, right?  Negative, they do something, they say that in Signature 37D, in Godrej Aristo Crate, in Godrej Janit Nila, and here, there, Neel Bate Sannata, even after digging, something did not stand up, where can I get premium from there, then premium is not available.  So oh, the market is down, the market too, should any kheer or halwa reach such a stage where value can be seen in it or you have not bought carrots yet and you have booked the halwa, okay look at me.  Tell me with an example, I am the number one seeker of clarity. Milk has not arrived, I have not taken khoya, I don't know about cashew nuts and almonds. So brother, take it from one place. You are seeing halwa, it has not landed yet, you are seeing it in Godrej's return.  You are seeing it in Shobha, you are seeing it in Shaper Ji, and you are seeing it in Even Elan, the amazing construction quality of Layton Group and all that stuff has come to some level and  That's a different one, okay, so you will get something here so soon, how come you are two years old, whatever are the names of these projects, Shobha Shapar ji and Godrej Meridian, these are minimum five year old projects, minimum five six, phases have been coming in them now.  They are being made and are being made on different stages but it is five years old and the announcement also means you can imagine that it has been almost two years since the stories were announced, whenever the pit was dug, the stories were heard, it was sold, it had come.  The market was active for almost two years. It takes so much time for something to happen in resale. If you are thinking in seven months or eight months, then you are wasting your time. This is so much without patience in real estate. Saturn is not required, Saturn is also the factor of construction, Saturn is there, no, patience, no, you will get the money, brother, I am not getting the money, now it is being sold like this, so many people want to buy, so many people, so many people, so many people, they are not that many people. those are four people  And they have written numbers to 40000 dealers and it seems that the whole world wants to sell this project. I told the name, Godrej Aristo Cat, it will do well because it is a ripe place, not much goods are coming there and when that  A little shape will be ready, they have created stories like rivers, rivers, all of them will be seen coming, then the rates will increase brother, then after that is your zenith, there will be a premium kick in it gradually. This will happen when the utility corridor of 150 meters will be visible there, which you will see in 2 years. Then these stories of cyber hub 2 will come, stories of global city will come. Do n't you have patience, get the premium in 6 months, get it in 6 months and also get it. I am not saying that you are not getting 5 lakh 7 lakh 10 lakh, but 5 7 lakh 10 lakh is living in the mouth of a camel, isn't it Gurgaon real estate?  In the real estate market, only a broker will take that deal for Rs. 2 lakhs, he will take it on top of the deal, if you are getting even three and a half rupees, then if you enjoy it then what happens to you, then sit peacefully, all the people, you  [ __ ], [ __ ], They sell it like this, take this, take this, the new one, the sexy new one, no one talks about the old one, no one asks about the old one, the old ones are very old societies, people are ahead of them, this is useless.  It is useless, don't take it because brother, if you have taken that one, then who will take the new one? You are understanding brother, which is our work, which is not to be taken, I saw a user made something and in the comment section someone wrote, \" Why is someone ruining our society?\"  The dogs have come, now the dogs will come somewhere, if something comes somewhere, then if you keep selling the property, that is, whatever is coming, there is something or the other in these, there is no such society in Gurgaon which is coming under construction, which has not come.  now or  Which has arrived in which we cannot remove 50 holes in it and after hearing about such holes, why should it happen? Brother, I have also bought such a society which has holes in it and tell me now tell me what will you do, will you go to Dubai and buy it? Take the video of Dubai, you want, you should take it, you should not take it, the story of Dubai will be over, the story of Sharja will start and it is going on differently, if the rents have increased so much in Erates wala, then the public is going to Sharja, do Sharja. Even in peak traffic, it takes 70 minutes to go from Sharja to Dubai. In the peak traffic, if Dubai is Delhi then Sharja will become Gurgaon and now money is going there, people will say, oh man, Dubai was becoming Dubai, now Sharja will be seen becoming Sharja, then all this will happen.  Will keep telling stories, you will not get citizenship there, you know how our environment is at times inside the country, so go there and understand that any thing will be right at any time, the position of the tower is coming.  And brother who has not got the registration done, the one who wants to sell is the best time because as soon as he gets the registration done, he will transfer the cost of the registration to you. You still have to get the registration done, if you agree, listen carefully, if the flat is worth 3 crores.  If he has not got the registration done then if you buy him then you will pay the registration amount of Rs. 3 crores. According to 7 rupees, 21 lakhs is fine and if he has got the registration done then it will be Rs. 31 lakhs for him.  Now he has increased the rate for you, now he will not give it to you in three rupees, so his decision making is being done at the time of getting it registered, so he is ready to leave 5-7 lakhs, as soon as he gets the registration done, he will do it peacefully. Maybe he will sit and get the wood work done and give it on rent. The seller does not panic about the thing which is on rent and then that thing has to be sold at an expensive price. Same thing is happening in the market when the person is going to buy it for resale. He is getting only substandard units because he was an original long term investor. I explain things very clearly. This is a very high level thing which I am going to tell through very paid content. Every investor likes this thing.  They are long term traders, they jump in at the beginning, they don't look at rate and weight, they say that they consider it to be timeless property, it is something that is not going to come again, they never want to sell, they want to keep the family.  This is to give to our next generation and those who come later gradually, they will get the discount, they will get it, so those who come in that cycle, they do not provide such good units but they sell more in the market.  And then the wife doesn't like it because when you are taking it for resale, the wife will come, there is no sunlight in the kitchen, this one looks small, this one looks big, there are 1.5 crore tantrums, so things are not possible in it. Now many of the  What happens is when the seller comes and the seller is unable to sell then it is said that real estate is down. Real estate is not down. The customer also has a choice. Then today we are looking for sellers within these four because they have very good products.  I am not a seller but I am looking for a seller among these four. If you are a seller then please connect. Then the price point will be told to you. One thing will be told to you and then that will be to know the rate. If you are asking then I will tell you the ball pak rate.  given for him You do not need to waste that time separately, I will tell you the same, it is okay for you guys, so this was it within these four projects, please do it quickly, there is a lot of demand within the night, there is a lot of demand now and later.  People who live here will come from Chavadi Bazaar. Yes, Garg Saheb will come. Brother, I need a bus, I have to do the registration now, it has to be done now, that is, payment can be made in the day also, if it is possible, or the athletic people want.  Should I make it or sell it at this time, there are many people who are ready to sell now, brother, this is the right time, my advice to you is, do n't sell out of spite, if you want to sell then tell me, because what is there, don't give any advice behind it.  Motive comes, don't look for motive, even in breathing, if someone is taking advantage of you, why are you looking for motive for that person, because to deny him, you will stop breathing, if you have stopped, now you will not be benefited.  Ok So how does breathing benefit someone? Write in the comment section. You breathe and I benefit. So have I made a connection? You have to understand that it is okay. There are people. Ask Adani Emani. They give you everything. They give you everything. You are sick.  If you are there then you will go to Maidan Ka, Gurgaon, Narayan Hilay, their shares are also listed, people will also become rich by buying them, so you will travel inside IndiGo. People will become rich even by buying tickets, so you don't have to worry about other people gaining because smart guy will always make money, you have to become smart, okay and learn these new things, so please write in the comment section how many sellers you are. I am a seller and not from the comment section, then you can buy this thing on whatsapp2 hajj foot for Rs 40000, it is not happening right now but the question is It is that brother, you are not getting good things and the things are getting expensive and are becoming so expensive that you will not get a salary, your salary will not increase. Brother, if the rate of any property increases even by ₹ lakh, then the price of that property will increase.  To buy Rs 10 lakh extra, you will have to earn Rs 15 lakh, because Rs 5 lakh will go in tax, Nirmala ji's tax will be deducted and the rest will be deducted in Gabbar Singh's tax, whose GST is also paid. They will have to earn more, they will have to earn Rs. 18 lakhs to give Rs. 10 lakhs, to give Rs. 10 lakhs extra to you, if you earn Rs. 18 lakhs and the Rs. Even if you have to eat, sometimes you have to earn ₹ lakhs to actually take out ₹ lakhs extra and understand now how much is your package, which is worth even 25 lakhs.  The package is that you will have to work extra for one year because you have not taken the decision, just look at the price increase, I have linked 10 lakhs to the package of 25 lakhs and why will I pay tax on earning 25 lakhs from one year, after that I will eat something only then my  There will be 10 lakh savings, you are thinking that you can grab it now, later a working person will not be able to take it in Gurgaon, only businessman and inheritance person will be able to take it whether he has got some money from somewhere or by selling something.  If you have got this opportunity, then you have mentioned four projects. The risk reward ratio in all four is very favorable. In fact, there is no risk only because almost two or three have already been made. Two or three are to be made in one announcement and the rest have already been made. You know what it is so don't miss out this opportunity this Navratri please if you are a seller connect quickly thank you very much"

    "title": "Should You Buy In Reliance Met Jhajjar ？ [6ArpetllPFA].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, there was a lot of demand for this topic in my comment section. Normally, I do not want to make such videos specifically and you must have seen that I have not made any specific videos till date but I have to make them. You invest in I will make a long video, I will do higher order thinking, you people will understand, whoever invests in Daily NCR, this will be a very good video for the investors and you will complete it well.  Have to listen, reliance 1 has a different story, it is less, it is resale and there is always more difference in it, then the question comes that if it has increased then it will keep increasing, should it have been taken a year ago, then my answer is that you should not have taken it even a year ago. Short answer because now I will explain it further but the rates have increased. What is the biggest problem in India? Ours is not only investment in other sphere of life, also I have many other channels.  I hope you have read all the Sango Life Satra Clarity for Youth Guruji from Gurugram and this Sango is of real estate and one of astrology, I cover them separately but here I will tell you that decision making is based on the results. Decision making is judged. Decision making is not judged as a process in isolation. That's why we get killed in investments. Decisions get killed in relationships.  I get beaten because the decision was worked out correctly, that is, it was a good decision, that is, if you invested money somewhere and the money came or for some reason, the result came out right, then the decision was good. I will take an extreme example of this and tell you. I will try to explain reliance1, not real estate, but in other wise also, I am the number one clarity giver and because I am number one, that is why I am speaking, there is no one else around, I am not speaking out of arrogance, so I am explaining on the same basis.  Listen carefully, one thing happens after playing Russian Roulette. One thing is right in English, that is to see and you must have seen it in the pictures, one was Anil Kapoor 's picture and in the other pictures you must have seen, one was Anil Kapoor's Jaazab picture, there was that bullet in it.  Yes, it is a pistol and it has six holes and one is put in one and it is rotated and after that everyone keeps it on their belt, like this, if it is ok then your chance of dying is 16.66% 1/6 ok, two.  There are people and suppose there are stakes on it, 10 crores 100 crores from lets, if you earn money in this way, suppose you did not die, another person died and you earned it, now no one knows how this money was earned, who knows how?  Except you, every person will say, 'Dude, whatever you did must have been right but you have to see whether it is worth it. Risk reward ratio is not included in the decision making, so people take such decisions.  Will you die? Otherwise, 10-100 crores have come. Let's take it. Life is like this. There will be a doctor couple who did medicine for 40 years and gradually opened a nursing home and then they ran it and reached 50 crores in 30 years.  By exerting his life, he reached Bhai Saheb by doing such a scandal, within five months now both are neighbors, both have the same car, one is a slightly older couple, they are 55 years old and this new one.  If you are 25 years old, then who is living a better life? Practically, it is a good life, which one would you like to live, then according to that, the answer to 'Reliable Mate' is no. How is it that it is happening in a speculative manner that some factories will come up here?  It looks sleek but brother, if you live here then only blue collar workers will come here, TCS employees will not come to your Greater Noida or that side Yamuna Expressway or that O.G.  The factory has come, the factory has come, the phone factory has 25000 workers, those 25000 workers, TCS opens somewhere in Gurgaon, 3000 2000 employees come, those 2000 employees take the real estate up, they cannot take 25000, buying power purchasing.  Power and End Use He did not build any house or cottage.  Like what is being sold in jewelry, the same work is done here by Lay Mate. You see, let's calculate. You have taken the rate of Rs. 75,80,000 and still the rate of the plot is Rs. 75,000. Now you know the construction cost based on the rate of the plot. Today, you can calculate everything from it.  You will come out with the calculation of one floor that one floor will be built for this much and now the number of floors will also remain. You know, three floors are already being built for four floors, so if I rent it.  I will enter how much rent will be given to the person working there, then you will see that the rental would be like 2 per 2 a half per cent is not a good investment, the minimum should be 4 taka in the current market, in many markets even five taka.  The kind of gentry that will be there in India because all the investors have taken it over, no one has ever taken it for ad use, never ever bought it anywhere in this. In investment, anything, especially real estate, where there are more than 50-60 investors or I know investors, is very important, but as much as the investor is important, the end user is also important. Initially there may be 100 units at some place. Wherever in any project, 50-60 investors come but if 40 or 50 end users are not coming then it becomes Greater Noda, everyone is taking it there because of your budget.  Now it is coming in Gurgaon, let us assume that plots are priced at ₹ lakh per yard.  At lakhs of yards somewhere, you think, let's buy it here, it is cheaper, why are you buying it because you are able to afford it, only that is not a good reason, because this is actually all done in Jhajjar, instead of this, some one  There are half more projects, again, I would not like to make him famous by name, I would not like to do that thing, I would also like to change the gender, I would not like to do it, but he lives near it on Dwarka Expressway.  There is a project there about 12 kilometers and this 12 kilometers is a hell lot of difference. One thing is at a distance of four kilometers from your SGT University at a distance of 5-10 minutes and that thing was also available a few days ago for 335000 yards.  Now she is getting it for 55, in my opinion, as far as I know, she is getting it for 55 51 52, put 52, they say 55, you will get it for 52.  52 Pay is better than Reliant Met, that is my opinion because Reliant Met is mostly about blue collar only, because what is there ultimately is that the whole crowd will come there only those people who are at executive level or slightly higher level, they are up.  You will not down, brother, this same story has been played out in your Daru Heda, the same story has been played out in your Bhiwadi.  There is a cap where there are blue collar workers, you cannot break that cap because they become gentry like that so may be he was on 20 22 hj so it made sense 30 35 pay may be for some buddy but avoid that  It could have been done for sure, now you get it just because, so what is the exchange of premium in that color which is opposite to my hair, if it is in that color then people  People adjust, maybe it will be an investment, my whereabouts are gone, it is never an investment, buying a thing worth ₹ 1 for ₹ 50 and thinking that my ₹ 50 is gone, this is foolishness, that 50 could have been thrown from a helicopter, it would be of no benefit to the poor. Your personnel account would have become better. You thought it was okay, it is the foam of cold coffee, you have to make fish from it, it is not actually milk. Took this much milk, put some coffee in it and swirled it, if it becomes this much then has it increased, that is foam, brother, this much foam is there, you should know that, okay, so it is the same thing, so what should one invest? Clear cut answer at this price is  A big no and what should you do if you are sitting with it? Brother, look, you will find someone, you don't watch all my videos, you don't listen to all my words, if you find someone then see, alternative cost opportunity is very. Important, you have to understand one more thing, many people will say, friend, if you look at Australian real estate, Australia is not even a country of 2.5 crores, it has less population than Delhi NCR, it is three and a half times bigger in size than India, only in big cities they are at their 90s.  Population lives in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Canberra, which are the top five or six cities where their cricket matches are also held, then if everyone knows the radius, then everyone knows the formula of the circle. sk, so if I double r, it's okay, then my area will become four times, it is a simple thing, just double it four times, so if a city is spread for 10 kilometers, then only 10 more kilometers have to be expanded and it should be expanded four times.  It is okay to do this, if within a radius of 10 kilometers from a centre, if the infrastructure is good then what difference does it make if it is within 10 kilometers radius from a centre, if it is only a little difference then it will increase by four times.  But why do n't people want to go to real estate there, even 10 kilometers extra, that is the thing, they don't enjoy that place where everything is there and the same thing. When I studied New Zealand real estate, it is okay to invest there also, those who have to do it.  Let's get all the work done, it's okay if you want to do it in New Zealand too then you have the same thing in New Zealand too. New Zealand's population is 70-80 lakhs, equal to the population of Najafgarh and your Rohini alone. What is your name, New Zealand, the whole of New Zealand, but you will go there, they also have the same two or four Christ Church, Harare, and what is their name, Wellington and three or four of their cities, and they are not ready to go out even a little, outside they feel like a jungle and  Animal means such a feeling, no one is ready to go, so where people are ready to go, the rates are high, so even here in India, those of us who are 10, 20, 30 years old are a little different in thinking, now the youngsters are not going to leave.  It has to be a happening place, I will make a separate conceptual video on this too, if you want this luxury when real estate had become very expensive, right in the early 90s, they call it tube there, it is called metro, go 100-150 km away, one and a half hour.  Travel in India, live in big places, now what trend is being followed there because what is all that, US, all the people follow US only, meaning markets trend and thinking wise. What is the latest trend that will come in India in the next 5 years, 10 years, which we will catch up, then they want to know who buys when and where in the life cycle, let me explain it to you very lovingly, it is a conceptual video. Take them in the conceptual way only, however, if you make the ri5 rate less now then it will be less, I never want this because I am not that here, I am not a moral science teacher, I am not a leader here, I am here.  I am not one to do any good to the public, this poor public, am I not a messiah, I am my co-rate vet, I am a normal consultant who gives knowledge for money, like a doctor, I am not one to give free injections there, I am like a private hospital.  Doctor is great, that's my thinking, okay, so I didn't want to make this here at all and it is possible that I may remove this video after one level, why should I harm the people who are associated with me, brother, direct you.  They were asking whether I have made it for you otherwise I can't call each one and tell. I am fine, I have been coming for many days and have been coming for many days, brother, please tell me. Brother, please tell me. Whoever has taken it can see how to get it out sometime.  If you are thinking of taking something then don't take it at all because your risk reward ratio is not in favor, the rate will go from Rs 70 to lakhs, it will not go beyond that, I am not talking about the process, just because you have a share.  Bought it and it increased a dozen means, your decision was right, assume that there are issues somewhere regarding corporate government governance, assume that you are feeling that the market is ahead of the goods, it is possible that some sanction may be imposed by the government, like that on a chemical industry.  There is a risk in me or in someone else, there is an overhang because if the government announces anything, then things make a difference. When you, an edge analyst, study such a company and you get red flags.  And do you think that this can be avoided because there are 100 more places to invest in, it is better to buy affordable housing of your own anywhere, buy it for resale even if it will do better, it is a noisy shot, it is made of money and rent.  It will come and in the main that is an eco system, an eco system is needed, now it means that only the laborers have to live there brother, only the laborers have to live there and they too will not stay, they will also move up and down from somewhere, I will tell you this. I am looking very nice, I am not refusing to go there, it is a company, it is a road and road, everything is looking good, but if it is just a good place then go to Bhiwadi, you will like it, you will like Daru Heda too.  Neemrana will also cost the same, now the rates are according to inflation or do they increase. Tulip mania also happened in Holland and tulips were sold very expensive in the 17th century and that happens but what is the process?  Process wise is fine, process wise is not good then whether you want to invest in share market or in real estate, first of all you have to ask who will buy this share after two years and a year, who will come into this property and who will stay there just because something rises.  Is it being done or is it fancy or is it being told that the dozen make a difference scheme is also like this when it enters the multi level marketing chit fund scheme or the one that I am talking about there.  I will plant a tree and you give me money, you will get this much, then you bring four, then you will get this much from them, everyone is getting them but know that friend, this is not right, the decision making process is not right, there will be many people who will go away after making money.  Will go but that party music will stop whenever it ends. Well, it is a saying of Buffett or one of these two sayings of Charlie Manger that only when the tide goes back people will release who they were.  Swimming naked because as long as the tide is there, people have water up to their chest or stomach, when they go back, they will come to know and swimming naked means that the idea of ​​the British is fine and of their knowledgeable people, so you know one the tide.  Reverse then you will realize what went wrong, this music of real estate will stop, sometimes it stops, it becomes stagnant, then after that we will know how much that thing will cost now, what will happen to it, where will the fans be, then this  According to this, this should be avoided, I may be a good bye at when it was late, it is okay but not now, earlier I remember when it came, we used to go anywhere to Rohtak, like we were from Gurgaon, Reliance was written everywhere.  I didn't know where Jagga was, once I did some spying and reached there, he was neither found there nor here, then the one in his Badli wala tehsil where his office is, somewhere opposite there, 5 kilometers away somewhere else.  If you go there five or six times, you have to search with difficulty, that is, it is not like it is completely in your routine, somewhere it is falling on the road, somewhere on the main highway it is falling, there in one or two colonies, I have not come as told.  She is failing there, still taking it is better than here, the rate is better, that too is speculative and plus anyone can live there, anyone above the level of normal workers can also live there.  And that AIIMS Bhat Sa is there, they have it and AIIMS Bhat Sa has its own ecosystem, okay, so it can still fix things there, for sure, but you guys have to avoid this one. Tell me how did you like the video?  Will continue to make like this in future too. Thank you very much."

    "title": "Should You Invest Or Buy Properties In Tourist Places ？ [E8t02iBNZAc].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, we will do some deep analysis in the studio, buy and invest in property in tourist places, it is a very important topic, many people have a question on real estate investment, so we will break it down, we will break down the tourist place only, which tourist place is a tourist place.  The general people who think about the mountains, think that brother has gone to visit Nainital, Mussoorie, Shimla, to do something of his own, he is staying between builder villas here and there, he is saying brother.  Sir, you take this and when you people come, it will remain like this for you and then you put it on the prison, there are some stories like this, their rates are 45 lakh, 80 lakh, 90 lakh dead crores, some say, take a plot, people say  I should make something of my own. People's big mother is saying that near one stage, many people are losing money and are not able to manage it. Many people don't have that much in actual but they think it's because of this.  The story is that nothing is bought from them, it is bought for 40-50 ₹ 8 lakhs at times, nothing is available in a big city, so these are the fantasies that I will use such money and put it to use, so the discussion is on which tourist place.  You can take it, I will also tell you which one you should not take, I will also tell you the reasoning, first of all, whenever you invest in a tourist place, first of all, remove one thing from your mind, I will soak it.  Go and remove that, go and stay in five star semester, no debt, bill, be more productive, if you take one side of the story of Bhimtal in Nainital, Mussoorie, then will you go there every year, wo n't you get bored on the same route, same mountains, same same bus, everything is complete Travel at different times, if you have so much time, because when you go there, then who will open its lock, who will open the lock, then asked the broom, will you check or not, we will keep Chotu, then Chotu.  If you keep it then Chotu, who will be the resident of the same place? Yes, if you search for someone from the same place, then he will have the key. Yes, if he has it, then brother, he will give you the chadha according to the hour. Then what will you do from behind and there will be dust.  So, have you thought that it can't be like this, no, we are very good, very good, there is no one in India, who is very good in our country, who will not even open it, will not miss you, will not do anything.  wo n't give it to anyone How will you maintain it? I will install CCTV cameras there. Okay, then I will sit there and watch. B. Practical about it. Be the bill to the boat. It is the D message. You have paid that money. You will have to keep it handy. Your fixed cost is very high for owning the property.  There is property tax, you have to pay for electricity meter, you have to pay for water meter, it is a fixed cost, you have to pay Chhotu's money, if you have spent so much then you should have gone to Gangtok once.  We would have gone to Darjeeling, we would have vomited once, we would have gone, there is no dearth of mountains in India, no dearth of beaches, no dearth of deserts, there is no dearth of anything else in our country, the story is as per your wish, but it is not practical if you like it this way.  There are six ways to do it because it is a discovered place so don't buy it as a tourist place and one thought has come to the people that people are saying it is big even inside Goa and that is if you live there yourself, Shukla ji.  Malhotra ji Gupta ji Aggarwal hits out that yes, salute to you, your title is fine and your money will be withdrawn, you have made a site wide on airbnb type, you think that sitting in Delhi, you have also taken urban, you have taken it in Goa, you have taken the story which is well discovered.  It is a tourist place. Hey, today you have to understand that when a tourist is going out, he is an Indian tourist because there is a lot of flood, even an average Indian is going and getting the experience. They cannot give you that experience.  And then those ridiculous people are coming there and then they are not less and they are coming to do something there, if there is good food there, good omens, all those things cannot be given to you as much as you can give within the setup of AirBnB, which a good hotel can give you.  You want a welcome drink, everything is good for you, it is all this, it is not that good, your case is there, that tourist will be of his level, that tourist is also dangerous for him, if your level is there, you understand what I am talking about.  Am IT IS NOTE THIS IS BETTER THAN THIS, STILL IF YOU WANT TO DO IT, THEN I WILL TELL YOU THE THINGS THAT WILL BE MORE SUCCESSFUL, I AM ALSO TELLING YOU WHO IS THE RELIGIOUS TOURISM BILL STYLE IN Puri PLACE AS PER ME AND INVEST HERE, YOU HAVE NO STAY SYSTEM HERE YOU ARE IN VARANASI.  I am in Ayodhya, you are in Vrindavan, I will keep Varanasi and this one will be my Ayodhya ji. Okay, so this is the top place and here you make something which is more than 500.  1000 rupees should be the type of life with a camera, it is not necessary to make it like this, you have to withdraw money from the volume here because they have reached the big parties by building big hotels, Dharamshala, you can make a shortcut thing which is called something like Dharamshala.  You can make it where the money is in the rooms and the bathroom is attack type, you have invested, taken a plot of land, that thing is successful, this second one which you are saying is an imaginary casserole of making one's own living in the mountains and all this.  sustainable  It is not available in Varanasi also, when you go to Ayodhya ji, you may like to stay in a very nice hotel for three days, but you have a good hotel running there and you have kept your proper employees and a manager according to the accountability. From there, no less than Chhotu is running, four-five-six-seven people are employed, a business model is maintained and you go regularly once in 3-4 months and check it in the city.  After staying there, Sir comes to understand that this thing will definitely be successful and people are doing it and are also getting success. Here the rates of course are flooded but still you will get the thing to do this kind of system. But this is a well discovered old tourist place, don't go here at all, there are a lot of legal issues, like land session in Goa, some Portuguese doctor has just started there, there are huge land issues, you should definitely not get trapped in Goa or it. This note is possible without living in a tourist place yourself. What they say to their subscribers to do in Goa, they should see their example is wrong because they live there, you people do not live and cannot travel on auto, money will be saved, nothing will happen, man every  A man thinks that a man drives a taxi and he gets the desire to drive a taxi and he gets money back, lakhs of rupees from the net, work is late, after driving a taxi he thinks, I will get another taxi, call my brother.  He is late from the village, okay brother, now he goes on another taxi, he has to give money to his brother also and he is left with ₹ 30,000. Now he gave ₹ 30,000 to his brother, so it is not 70, but he is left with lakhs of work, he is giving 30 to his brother.  If I am, then by not playing ₹70, now he is left with ₹50000. Now 20 is gone, I don't know whether the brother is stealing, whether the brother is spending in petrol or the brother is not spending at all. Is it because of him that we are not? But you will put it, then call your uncle's child, he is late, then call the villager, he is late, call the other one, he is late, then he comes to zero, there is no saving, brother, here the challan has been deducted, brother, the tire is flat, brother.  Yes, this engine oil has been drained, this is done, no money is saved, be it any person, think that I am the tax payer, people do a lot of extra poultry, drive their own car, earn lakhs of rupees, they think that I have come up with a design and this I am practical, thousands and lakhs.  I have talked to the taxi drivers, I give consultation, it is the country, the date of the note, brother, if you have earned one lakh rupees in one tax, then if you have taken out 10 taxes, then you have earned 10 lakhs in this note, earning the bill is like 3 lakhs.  Only when you are sitting and driving yourself and rarely doing this, then the earning is different and on remote, not on auto, date it is big message, don't give fruit but true lucrative sounding things when  You get in the practical of dam it it is not working legality's words are there, there are sanctions, who gave the permission from the government, what de moment used, get involved government, everything becomes commercial tax, GST torn, just like that, it is okay not to save anything, not to save ₹1. Because then which one did he take? Then tell the big ones from here to fill the returns and then to keep all those accounts, Chartered Accountants are the accountants.  His money then its money brother, when you do n't have even Rs. 24 to spare then why are you doing this, you will get the car only on normal residential, then don't use this money for investment, do something else on the story or run yours from a different level.  Like I said in desi style, ok that can work and taste of d consumer is also changing and going in d future it will change but if you start  Something in Ayodhya and Varanasi like I said which is bottom of the pyramid which is D Dharamshala think so that date bill cup doing well because brother in the day before yesterday hoon is coming has just you sleep dear is not looking at experience usko night sona hai kuch  Even if he gets some food there, he feels like an outsider, he has come with a religious mindset to have his darshan, he will stay for a day or two and then leave, he will spend time there only. Tourism and luxury is the debt think bill note that Musdi Lal's will not work, then you are opening your own hotel and are so rich and are going to invest Rs 100 crores, then that is not the video for that. Yes, on video, D normal public is fine.  I was thinking of putting my normal Rs. 50, 70, 80, 100,000 in a tourist place, so don't put this D message. I hope you guys find the message ok, please Sher.  IT'S WITH YOUR FRIENDS Because many people argue on this, they say that I did it there, I did it in Goa, Goa is the one favorite place of justice, I didn't do it, is there relief there or did he manage Goa while living from Bengaluru and Delhi? Took a lot of money and it is working, check this thing once, if it is like rest of the rare, how this person must have a lot of experience in Goa, he must know every inch of Goa.  You must know the locals, its network must be very strong, you do n't have that, you don't know anyone in Goa, people do n't know the names of the streets and localities of Goa, you have control according to that, by the way, you will get 99% of all air traffic and this is already crowded space. After that, there is no relief for him, there is no relief for the one with first more advantage, who had earlier taken that amount of Rs 30 lakh and now it is worth Rs 90 lakh dead crore. He has gone, he is sitting in profit for him, then he has to reduce the rent and offer it to Wickham but it was private but fresh purchase fresh this business model is not working it is de message hope you bill share it with everybody please like share subscribe thank you"

    "title": "Stilt Plus 4  Stalled Again  ｜ Who Will Benefit From It ？ [4luYZD3env0].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, there is a problem again on State Plus 4, the chariot has stopped, earlier they used to say all this in the elections but brother, it is not coming, then date after date, 22nd August, after that, most like, elections will definitely come, code of conduct etc. will be imposed.  If this matter goes on like this then will it stop the supply and reduce it? Recently there is a centric kit centric project in Gurgaon, its supply will be limited because there is some other project.  People were thinking that the floor guy will come, now the floor guy is not coming, do n't know where the supply is from, if he is not coming, then Deendayal's other places are closed, inside it too, he had written oaths and promises to take permission from the neighbor here. Take permission from, is it permission? If you do n't take it without permission then there was nothing to be done anyway, but this brother, that too, that too, many people are getting disappointed because these policy decisions are challenged challenge after challenge.  It is not coming even from the government side, I am not able to understand properly what is happening, but practically the supply is being stopped. If you look at it in a way, there is no supply, property rates will go up, if it is ok then still plus.  4 This is news for you, there is no clarity on this and after three, four, six months, it was talked about in a cold manner, what will happen after that, even if something happens, the Joy Policy was visible right now, which is the story we wrote.  Earlier it was said that Sulai will be available in the same way, there was no hope of more supply but now even that is not there, so this was the update. Now I hope you people will take the decision because in the coming time, things will become more expensive and more expensive for people.  People in Gurgaon city are not able to digest. According to me, already we have reached that stage. If we have reached that stage, type yes, otherwise you tell me. It will be more expensive then we will reach, but according to me, today in  Gurgaon A normal man cannot buy a property without selling a property. Somewhere you can buy a property by selling it only on the basis of your salary and loan. Even if the husband and wife work, buying is moving towards impossible. Yes, father helped.  The father-in-law has given the wife a job, you also have a good job, so many people will buy the property or if someone had bought your property earlier, then youngsters cannot buy it.  People in there 40 50 60 Yes, only those who have earned a lot of money in their entire life, have acquired many properties, are restructuring of assets can buy, only those people are buying or NRIs who have a lot of money, then HNI investors are buying.  HNI end users are buying, rich people are buying or those who are selling from Delhi or you are buying from Delhi, then only the same customers will be left in the market for a common man.  So, the only option will be to buy affordable housing for resale and that too for 2 BH which has become 80 85 lakhs, where the position has come and one year has passed, then after the position you can buy, then the matter there is 80 85 lakhs.  Lakh has gone and so many positions of 3 BH case have not come in affordable housing and there it will go up to 1.25 crore, so I hope you people will get an idea of ​​the rates and where.  Yes, crore common man is the only affordable house. This has become a fact of life and affordable housing is not coming any more. All of them will come under retirement homes or some different scheme. Many people were waiting for affordable housing.  According to the information available in Sector 95, 92 or some places inside Sonha, nothing is coming anywhere, something else will come and only Rs 1.5-2 crore will come. If you understand the matter, then this is  There was a clarity, if there is intention in it, there is no way to reduce the price of property. Supply property is not such a thing that it can be built like Maggi, it takes six to seven years to build the projects which were built by Deen Dayal.  There were projects which were originally said to take two years when they came to Gurgaon. When did two years go by for many builders? They came after Covid and it has been two and a half to three years for many of them and still I feel it will take a year.  And even in almost low rise, it is taking minimum 4 years to get the position because NGT's ban on construction eats it all, at 33 the time eats up the time of the year at 30, then it rains once the labor goes on.  She goes for Chhat Puja, goes in winter, NGT ban is imposed, does not come back for 15 days, as soon as the ban is lifted, labor is standing, she comes again as per her wish.  If you have, construction travels, because of this, whoever is thinking in Gurgaon that if he will get any project before six to seven years, then he is not going to get it, then do n't think that if you have this, it is getting delayed, it is getting delayed. Why does pollution happen? Ask the government. Ask the NGT. This is a delay. This is a genuine delay. There can be a delay of one or two years from the builder's side too. If there is a delay of 2 years then the project can easily last for 3 to 4 years.  According to what was told earlier, now the RERA is coming, now the RERA will be for seven years, then there will be no delay, it is like the timing of Indigo, they automatically tell the long time of the flight, if from Delhi to Ahmedabad it is one and a half hour.  It seems that the flight takes 1 hour 20 minutes, so they say 1 hour 45, so that even if there is a delay, it can be done in 145, hence their on time is always good. If you are smart, then give a little more time so that you can achieve within that time.  If you do it, it will take 1:20 time, then say we are on, we are before the time, if you are a little late, it will be 1:30, if you are more late, then it will be 140, 1:5 time is mentioned in the flight, not like Air India, but Air India people. Poor guys, they show the right time and are late every time. I do n't know if Air India has got better these days. I have n't caught an Air India flight for many days, but when Air India was Air India, it means it was not private, it was the real government one.  If it was there then I used to walk comfortably saying Guru ji, what is the hurry, we will walk comfortably, become comfortable, sit comfortably, boarding is not in a hurry, so those were different times, so this reality timeline in real estate will help you."

    "title": "Stilt Plus 4 Effect On Gurgaon Real Estate [tRBhnlVHJu8].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, many people in Haryana and especially in Gurgaon have been waiting for a long time to know something about Still Plus 4, but elections are going on, now they are saying no, before the elections, they will give some understanding before the assembly.  It is not coming, do you know where the property prices have gone from? In the coming time, the spec is that it will come on 12 meter road, maybe not on 9 meter road, it will come on this only, it will come in three types [Music] Because of Speculative Floors, what has happened to the people of Delhi now, you understand that look, this is the status as of now, you are also aware of it, but what I am saying is that there was an ecosystem which used to exist one and a half years ago, that the people of Delhi  They used to come and buy a floor, like that you know what is the transaction and they used to buy some commercial and youtube0 things were sold on it but what is happening now is that no one is making it anymore because it has to be  If you don't mind, take out three floors, then the rates of that plot are so much, there is no profit in three, even today someone buys a high rise, so now what the people of Delhi call it, it's like they call it the blood of high rises.  They left other types of projects from here i.e. they also came to the realization that the amenities here are not that much, there is no security, dogs roam around or generally the work is not that fun and when you are coming to Gurgaon.  So why not enjoy the better things and now the money is available in resale, no matter how it is found, it is going there. What has happened with this is that now it will also come in 6, 8, 10 months. Let's say it has come somewhere, so I don't care about it.  It doesn't seem to be benefiting investors or builders, the plot rates will keep increasing, they will keep stagnating, but that charm is over, now people will not enjoy it that much. This is my view of the next six months to one year. This is the view that of course there can be a change because if you take these other projects which are coming up to the sky, if you beat the rates of Mumbai, then brother, they will look good. Who is this? This is the problem. Come after six months, one year.  I will make a video, earlier you used to say this, the world is also going on like this, earlier people used to say so many 400 crosses, now they are saying so many crosses, so the meaning of people also keeps changing according to the situation.  This is the case, I do n't know what will happen after 6 months or a year, but right now nothing is happening, now the results of these elections will come, then the Haryana government has to take elections, they have also played with their numbers in the assembly, then that assembly will be held in September.  There are elections in October, will its code of conduct be implemented or what will happen, so there is no focus, this is just like this, who is the one who has to be killed in Haryana, is it okay, so it seems to be such a pending matter and in this  effect  So what is happening is that the price of property has increased because of the closure of one day and after that you have closed the floors then how much inventory will be missing from the market otherwise tell me how many plots are still there in Hooda Sector where the scope was to build four floors.  There are a lot of plots, if you count then I think you will get lakhs of plots, so if they are sitting on two floors, two and a half floors, one and a half floors, two like this, then there was the potential to create additional 2 lakh floors beyond that.  Due to lack of decision, the ecosystem where builders from Delhi used to come and build has broken down. I feel it will take at least three to four years to revive it. If a decision is taken on this in six to seven months.  Even if it comes, it will take 3 to 4 years for the final decision. I feel like I would have got a blanket. I do n't see what is the meaning of a blanket. Make everything, make it somewhere, some rider will come or the other.  9 meter road will not be built, it will not be built in the old sector, it will not be built here, it will not be found there, so this is my opinion, what do you people have to say on this, what can be better on this, however, I would definitely like to say one thing on this, legal one.  I would like to tell something to those who can follow the logic for the court, those who had bought PAN Haryana in the auction in HUDA or HSVP sectors and on that day it was still plus 4 allowed, then you When you did the auction, you had this information at the time of doing the auction, if you did the pricing accordingly then it must be still plus 4 for you people. How many people are there who are affected like this? Write in the comment section that brother, we have done so.  Which one is this one of yours, this is the sector behind Mahindra Ra, within the Apna 111 sector, there were some plots of Hooda, people used to ask me, okay Guruji, take it, take it. Tell me, are you getting it at this rate? I did not know at that time that Stal Plus 4 would not come, so we would have asked for that rate in general, not Guruji, till what rate should we do the auction, people from me found out in general in Rohtak, Gurgaon.  We used to discuss through consultation how much should we auction, then when I told him that formula, we used to do the calculation and in that calculation we used to go with stilt plus four. Now he Bidding was done according to the calculation of stilt plus four and that bid won. Now if you change the story then it is cheating on him in a way. Now only the court will decide whether this is what I am talking about.  The logical thing is happening, the rest of the people will not speak, now they are sitting silent because the decision has not come, because now even if you go to the court, what will the court say that this decision has not come, but according to me, they could have taken the decision immediately, this is mine, mine.  Opinion is, although I am not that much of a legal expert in this, but I am applying the principle of natural justice, I am applying the principle of natural logic. Tell me how do you guys feel, if it seems logical or not then tell the end channel.  Subscribe and like. Thank you very much."

    "title": "Stilt Plus 4 Latest Update ｜ 20 Sep 24 [Mi5lP4EM37o].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, the embargo of State Plus 4 in Haryana has now been removed, its letter has been issued, so the good news is that new launches are coming from some big builders of Deendayal, they will now come in Clean State Plus 4, there will be an impact in the pricing too.  It should be seen that the rate which was being calculated according to three floors, in my opinion now it should be reduced by Rs. 15,20,25 lakhs. According to me, that is one good news second. After the elections, the idea of ​​​​the results of the elections is generally known, what is the accounting going on in Haryana, after that on October 8, one more thing will become clear, which is the rule of Stal Plus 4, which was going on before that.  Take permission from that person. Take it from this person. Inventia was not going to come from him. There is no need to take permission from the person who has built four floors. But if one and a half to two and a half old people have built the thing and now you are fresh.  If you wanted to build, then there was a need to take permission, which in itself becomes a TDS task, then there are many builders who used to come from Delhi and used to start many projects here locally, like this one plot, two plots, four plots, so they are so much.  It is not anonymous, the rates of the plots have not fallen at all due to this but the rates of the builder floors which are ready to move in will go up a bit. I am telling this which has been settled as exist or yes which was embargoed. It has been removed. Now you will not have to make videos like ₹ 5000000 on real estate channel. In the coming time, I will make them very regularly here. Let's see some tubers talking about the real estate of Gurgaon as if they are slowing down.  Yes, yes, it has slowed down a lot, according to that earlier the goods used to be sold in an hour, now it is taking a few days, some projects are even taking a few months, that position will be different in 7 years.  The matter is about those projects, but that project is no longer being sold within an hour in a day, so yes, the thing is not being sold in an hour, more time has passed, it is a little bit fine, so if you compare it like within Mumbai or elsewhere.  Which place is Pune, Mumbai, Hyderabad or anywhere outside where real estate is sold? In Bangalore, according to that, Gurgaon is way way ahead. Inside Noida, you will now hear the rate of Rs 22,2000 square feet. Greater  Now Noida will also start getting degrees in five digits, Greater Noida five digits, five digits means not 9000, but 10000 minimum square feet, so in the coming time, fasten your seat belt, fasten your seat belt, the weather is going to be very good during Navratri.  Now paa 10 days ago rain kich kich pani pani Navratri will come now sunshine will come then winters then festival season then new government.  New release, new stories, stories, 7th, 8th, 10th, I was not listening to it for the last 10 months, I was not meeting you to tell it, you will meet me again after a month and everything is sold on storios, you know the goods, it's okay, don't troll me and start doing that.  Those from whom it is not bought, it has become expensive, they keep saying that it is okay and those from whom it is becoming expensive, they remain happy, depending on who you are, it is okay, let the stock market fall, let real estate fall, everything should happen like this, it will happen like this, see  Take  Gurgaon is now out to be proud of the middle class. The middle class cannot buy much in Gurgaon and if they do not sell any assisting project. Yes, if someone has bought something somewhere and it has increased, then after selling it, they will buy something new somewhere, but the old one is new.  Taking a loan is completely out of the hands of the middle class. If you are roaming around with a salary of Rs 2 lakh, which is a very good salary according to me, then also you  You cannot buy anything in Gurgaon and it hurts to hear this because it is not like that because now if your low rise floors come then they will also be worth Rs 2 crore plus, two low rise floors will also be less than Rs 2 crore.  If the above matter has happened, then if the matter is above Rs. 2 crores, then the person with Rs. 2 lakhs cannot do it, how will the person with Rs. 2 lakhs buy the thing worth Rs. 2 crores? So this is the latest for you, yes husband and  Wife is a double income group, they still have a chance, they still have a few days, other wise, after selling the property, they get the inheritance money, only those people are able to buy the property, then this was the news, you will find the group in the comment section, if you are already any of my  I am not on the group regularly, now things will be explained in the next four, five, seven, eight days. I want to tell you one more thing. I am an astrologer. I want to tell you that we don't buy things on Shraddha, even at what price.  If you do n't meet then buy, it is very easy to say come and buy, don't buy, don't buy, it doesn't seem like anyone is taking the cheque, it's a different matter, you do n't have to pay for the fresh one, if you can avoid it, then it is good, that is, if someone is doing the same as in the past.  It's been 3 years and now someone is asking that it is not fresh, no no no, it will have to be given, this will have to be given, all the old programs will have to be done, but to spread awareness in this matter, one should definitely join for the products, weight for Navratri.  Do a Big Bang in Navratri, it will be great, only a few days are left, Navratri will start in October and then we will meet, and till then take rest, learn things, enjoy and write in the comment section about which projects you want to hear the rates of. What are your queries? If you have questions, you may not get answers in the comment section, but you can combine them and do a live session or ask questions or answers in a video.  If you can make an answer then please write in the comment section also. Thank you very much."

    "title": "The Top 07 Cities Of India ｜ Latest Real Estate Market Trends And Learnings [uEljjUpvoLA].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, the data of top seven cities has come again and there is going to be great learning in it. On this report, prices have increased by 23% on an average in the last year in the top seven cities. What about those who keep doing SIP of mutual funds?  You might have taken something worth Rs 4 lakh which had become worth Rs 6, now it has reduced to Rs 1.25 due to the correction and you are again deprived of gas at 23, where your money might have gone to Rs 20 in a year.  On and average price has increased on 23, I am talking about big cities. Yes, I know there is pollution in Gurgaon, Noida, Delhi, Delhi NCR, I know there are traffic jams in Bangalore, there is water in Mumbai also, there is no water in Chennai.  When it comes, it doesn't stop, there are more issues and issues of big cities, there are 1500 more issues and there will be more issues and beyond those, I will make a separate video, I have made some on pollution also.  My video is due, I will explain that also, but despite that, who told you that it is necessary to live in a big city, if you have taken property because those who need it will stay there and will earn rent, if you invest and they will have to pay rent.  Today, he is studying in B.Tech first year, he is studying in second year, he is studying in 12th, he will live in the same house which is under construction now after 5 years and after 5 years he will get the position whose and you  They will pay rent, that child ca n't buy, why can't he buy because his father is paying his fees, they can't buy a house for him and he is not able to earn money and there are many people in such situation, so those who are in this situation. No, those who have small children should invest, they should buy. Those who have grown up and can afford, they should also buy. The stories of the seven cities will continue to unfold further and a stage will come like the one that has come in Gurgaon.  This is the stage where no middle class person can now buy anything new in Gurgaon without selling something old or taking inheritance or taking money from the wife of his parents, in-laws and father-in-law. A middle class man cannot run a household with his own money. In Gurgaon, you have been working for 25 years without selling anything of yours and the money is lying in the account and you have a fortune of two to four crores. They are such rare people that they cannot get out of a normal job and salary because  There is a limit on loan also, whatever is your income, your EMI cannot be more than Rs 40, 45, 50, Rs 20-30 will also go into tax, if you need even food at Rs 30, then you cannot do more than that.  Now do the backward calculation, if something is worth 4, 5, 6, 7 crores then how much loan can you take, then a middle class man cannot take it, it is a fact that in other cities also he has the same.  The bags and bedding will fly away, nothing will be done by crying and washing, nothing will be done by calling someone dirty, the sellers, the builders, the government has the biggest hand in the rate of the property, this should be known to make it expensive, it is ok and you cannot do anything about it. Taxes are so high so you can either cry or invest. Even now the train is leaving. One day there will be a QI index. After that I will make a video and I will tell you about it and you can sit comfortably and watch it thoroughly.  make people understand  Okay, so listen to that, but I said this report is very important for you people, please follow the real estate prices in top seven cities, attend webinars, workshops, know the rates, keep the brochure, keep the layouts, make notes, know the rates, know the rates, then only you.  Will Know What Is Happening Because If You Are Reading Just Newspaper Articles Only Then Many Articles Will Come Out Bad Talkers Are Right Now this right speaker has come, he did not say that one should buy a house, he just said that the rate has increased so much, the speakers will still come saying, do SIP in mutual funds, do SIP in as many mutual funds as you are doing.  What they don't know is that the capital of Rs 30 will have to be given to them when they try to break it after 10, 15, 20 years. Now it is at Rs 125 at some point of time.  It was also zero, now it has become 12, maybe it will be increased in the Direct Tax Code, maybe it will be increased later, maybe it will be increased gradually.  5.5.5 If 1% becomes 30% in the next 10 to 15 years, then what will you do? You will have to pay tax on that also, otherwise there will be no tax, then there will be capital gain, if it happens then it will be on real estate, but you can sell the real estate.  No no no why not sell the real estate because the real estate will give you rent so if I earn Rs 1 crore capital gain in the property then I am not paying Rs 30 lakh tax because I am not selling it because it gives me  She is giving me something every month but my mutual fund becomes worth 2 crores, I will withdraw it as soon as I withdraw it, because without withdrawal, it is not giving me anything. Oh, what is this, let the direct tax fly, we will know how much the real estate will still increase. Returns will increase by Rs 50 per year, not by 40, I am saying you will give eight or nine or 10, you will not be able to get even that much on a higher base if you are paying in 5 years for a property worth Rs 3 crore. In a property worth Rs 2 crore, you are giving the money in 5 years. In a property worth Rs 1 crore, you are giving the money in 45 years. The money is going slowly. So brothers and sisters, if I get an absolute rate of return on it even at 8 or 9 years, then my  The money went slowly, beyond that I am getting returns at 15, 16, 17. If I am not getting returns anywhere else then what is the problem if I get returns at 89 and if only after having the position.  I get returns on Rs. 5. Inflation linked inflation is more than that but on Rs. 5, the cell of land for making cement bars, iron labor keeps on increasing, now the bridge has been connected here, the metro has come here, those stories are there from that.  You get more returns, I am saying that if you get returns only on Rs. 5, then who will go for Rs. 5, then you will get rental also on Rs. 4, if we live in that house, then you will not have to pay rent on that house on Rs. 4, and the rent will increase.  If you go to 9 then you are bound to get returns in real estate in any case and this return will also become very high in the future when you will get returns in lower single digits in every asset class like America and what is there here.  The rental is at 4 today, it will become at 8 after 8 years because the rent doubles. If I took NHPC shares at ₹, then I will calculate its dividend deal at ₹ 1 which I have taken at ₹ 1 or I  If it is running at 80, now I will check it at 80. It is for you all to check. Have you understood this thing? How did you like the video? Please do let us know. Do write in the comment section. If you have any questions, there are also technical questions.  So I am absolutely ready to take all the questions, any kind of question, do you think it is good or not, that should be taken in the city, that should be taken, traffic jam on pollution, whatever issues are there in big cities, detailed video beyond that too.  will come  I have a lot of clarity on that thing, where what is happening, how to understand that thing, how to understand what to do, beyond that, if you want a video, then definitely write in the comment section and then it will come on my other channel. But you must watch it and subscribe to the other channels.

By learning and making notes of understanding, you can become a good expert in real estate and then you will gain confidence while walking. One good is bad, one is good and one is bad. By doing this you will reach nowhere. Keep saying good, bad.  Is it good or bad? After 2 years, you see the rate. Then where else have you gone? Where have you come now? You keep talking. If it is bad then you can become a window shopper. Sister, if you don't want to buy a suit then you do n't have to pay for seeing it. So sister, if you want to see a suit.

    "title": "This Formula Will Not Work Any More In Real Estate [4PlGiF5Qbiw].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today's topic is this formula one no longer what is the formula in real estate investment, I am talking about big stocks especially and this formula has been working for many years and it is working so much that now people know this formula  This happened to the later investors because they listen to stories of their old family members like uncle, paternal uncle, brother in law etc and the formula is the same bank property output of a city and then they take it and then the red floods go up by 15, 20, 30 kilometers  Buy it from a far away big city like this and the rates will increase, there will not be a system, you be ready, today the youth is ready to buy things at Kara, this is your different media influence, it is our happiness, Akshay Srivastava, these two names And there are 20,000 such people who say that they want to take the loan, so it is clear to them that they want to buy mutual funds, they are not going to go far. Then the system of going far away which was ended in the early nineties in New York where they used to call it tube, metro.  to that this  There is New York, there is Manhattan, other places are very expensive, so people will travel 100-150 km from here and live in big houses here. Now people do not like this, they say that we will live here in 300 square feet carpet area, 4:  They pay Rs 30 lakh as rent, you can check it, the average rent of one house can be rented and carpeted, but we will stay here, our roaming around, eating and drinking will be our life here only, and we don't want to live in a big house, be modern, not always get married  This is not going to be done in big cities, only when vertical cities are going to be built because 20-30 years ago, in many cities, 30, 35, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 floor stories were not divided, it was divided in Mumbai many years ago  The division was of 15-20, 10, 15, 20. So, where the division was of 15-20, 70-80 floors are being constructed there, where there are five, six, eight floors.  There were 15, 20, 25 floors being constructed, so whether it is a city, those six cities, Gurgaon city, Pune or any other city, now different ecosystems will be formed, but you have to see that it should not be too far away, too much  People buy such land in the far off places because the ecosystem is good till the place where the flats are being built but when you go to buy this land, you will see this surprise and surprise that nothing happens there for 15 years. Many people are such fans.  There have been outskirts even in small towns. Have you become trapped? Do you know anyone who has been trapped like this? Please write in the comment section. I told you that there is a flood, it will flood, it will flood, take it in Bhiwadi, take it there, like this.  Take the liquor, there is nothing going on in the city and the best way to learn it is if you want to learn this example, look at Australia, the population of Australia is less than Delhi NCR and 3.30 times more than India, its area is 91 legs per kilometer, always 27 lakh km then population from India Your capital is Canberra, theirs is Sydney, yours has been deleted but it is Melbourne and this is Brisbane and this is your Canberra city, their city, that is the capital and please check the real estate prices of these 6 lions brother.  Why doesn't this happen for 5-10 kilometres? I am not saying that it is okay. There is coal in the middle of Australia, it is not worth living. People live on the coal, all that story is mine. Tell me one thing about Adelaide.  The formula for PR² for any city is 3.14 * 5², so 25 km becomes 3.75 square km. If I add just 5 km to it and do PR², then the formula of 10 squared, how much will it be? 100 divided by 100  If I do it from 3.14 then 314 would be increased by only five kilometers, you can see, I am making my area 4 1/2 times bigger, how many people in the city are there, but why is it not happening, what is 5 km, in our India, 5 km is something  Not only the distance there also, there it is increasing vertically, he does not want to go outside, wherever that street is made, whatever is its big system in the college, they are all spreading here and there like this, those 5 kilos and there  There are no traffic jams, friend, there is not that much population, I am saying that the whole of Australia has less population than Delhi NCR, you can check it, if you check the same thing in Canada, the story is working out there, you can also check Toronto, check the population of Canada  The size of Canada is bigger than Australia, it is very big and from the article, hey brother, look at the population, look at the names of the lions, Toronto, whatever, count them separately, how many cities are there, there are a lot of Indians, ask them there.  You will automatically get the answer that people do not want to go there, the real estate has been made expensive there, therefore here also in India, real estate will keep on becoming expensive in the big shares, you can buy it outside and buy it there also  There will be no benefit in taking it abroad until the infrastructure is not built there, the whole cost of real estate will not come down so quickly. If 12000 crore Dwarka Expressway is being built in Gurgaon, then the government is making recovery in the real estate sector from the story of registration charges in the builder agreement and in levying tax on the builder, in levying GST, in charging the builder, etc.  Since you do not give it to the government, then it will come out of you Rs. 12000 crore, hence property or any thing will be expensive. It is to be seen that wherever the system is being built, if that hospital is nearby, then you are the one paying for it. Everything is open in Rajasthan, there is no pollution or anything, so now you should take care of this thing that do not waste money, many people are thinking that I will buy 5 bananas outside and this is a flat worth 5 crores in the flat  What is going to happen is that you should look at those flats worth Rs 5 crore, see how much they are worth and how many people have bought flats worth Rs 50 crore each, they have some businesses in their list and they want to buy them, so where have they gone from where? I am not denying it, but this is the advice I am giving  I am giving you advice between 2023 and 2050, take any advice, people should take it from this, now I have seen a stock in Greater Noida which went from ₹100 to ₹1000, so it went from ₹100 to ₹1000 in 10 months, it happened in 10 years, now that In the same year, Rs. 1000 will turn into Rs. 10,000. Does doing this extra farming suit a smart investor? What has happened because of these reasons? Then when those people get the understanding, then it takes time for them to understand, then those people can understand it.  It goes with the trend, like if you look at one element of commercial, look at SCO plots, no one asks about such plants in Haryana, in Gurgaon it was said that we will do different histories and people were saying that the rates will increase but they do not increase.  Realization: Many things are like this, it seems that this formula will work, but it does not work. So please share and like it. If you have not subscribed to the channel yet, then subscribe.  I bring very realistic education through my webinar workshop, you can also become a golden member, you can take membership of the channel, you can get access to the workshop and you can join the webinar info WhatsApp group also which is here in  D comment We will discuss these things in detail and will do it with some more data and examples If you have any response then please do that also Jadeja thank you very match"

    "title": "Understand The Complexities Of Project Pricing In Gurgaon Real Estate [bQIj-fqwbOs].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, it is going to be a very important topic. Understanding Pricing in Gurgaon Real Estate is a video with basic information. It may sound basic but it has created a lot of confusion. Some builder has reduced the rate. This clarity is about the same and not about wandering.  I have to tell because everyone keeps spreading it, there is confusion, that is why I call myself number one because everyone else wants to do vote politics, such content is created like  That you want to contest the MLA election from here, I am the one who gives education, so listen carefully in the small class of 6th, 7th and 8th class, we had learned a formula of interest rate in our 100 principle into rate upon time in our 100 and compounding.  You also know the formula of 1 PS comes to the power A. Now there is a game in it, payment P, when do I give you the money, I give it in 1090.  I give it in 2080, I look at the construction link, I give it in PL, I give it in 2030, I give it in 50, I give it in 20 40, I give it in 40, I give it in 40, I give it in 20 40, this is the whole game, brother, no matter what the rate, more, less, more, get it done from me.  And who has to do the total calculation, everyone figures out how much total money has to be paid and you know the payment plan and PLC. According to PLC rule, if you go to RORA, then PLC word is not allowed. You all know that no user has taught you this thing, you cannot sell it by making PLC, you can tell your unit, this is so much but not PLC.  If you can speak then you will say, what is this? Yes, many times such laws are there, it is also a fact that do not use the word, you cannot sell car parking separately, rate lake, if yes, then someone will rate you in the same.  It says different, still different people say late but the cost is not fixed, everyone says rate according to the super area, what is the rate of Gurgaon real estate, it is 000,000 feet, there is some other rate in the builder buyer agreement. We get 24000 23000 25000 because your rate is according to the carpet area. You are always given beige. Now what to do here on social. Become an activist, contest elections, make the public aware, the public will do something like this, the public is poor, innocent, can't do anything, ca n't do anything, the public feels like it is not the public, no, did it happen there because no, you are with them, you are the public, whose are you?  I am with you, you all judge why should I come and give an explanation? Some man, my job is to bring clarity, to shine the torch. It's like making noise, nothing happens. Whatever the rates are in life, listen carefully and I will explain to you.  There is nothing in Gurgaon real estate less than 000 feet, if there is something, then tell me and if it is there and will come then brother, then no one can guarantee that it will not be built, because listen carefully, I am going to tell you a very big thing. Whatever price is being told to the people, the builder is telling according to the time frame of five to six to six years, no project is to be built before six to seven years, you take the date of RERA, not the project in three to four years.  If someone is in the making then you  Tell me the fastest work, the fastest contractor, he gave the position of four towers exactly on time, what he said was Shapur ji, 2 was launched in January 19, but the project is still under construction, how many years have passed and when will the last phase be completed, one day work  It is not closed and on top of that there is no contractor of our own, that is the second Shobha, Shobha has its own engineers, it has its own staff, see for how many years is that Godrej Marine being built, brother, see for how many years is it being built.  Also tell me the project, the position, I am saying, digging a well pit, getting allotment, your allotment date and you getting the last key, then what will be the prices in life, you can see that, the rate will be 15 to 00 feet in Gurgaon, those who are saying that the price should be less.  Will go down, he is fooling the public, he is fooling me like he has been fooled in many projects and what about anyone else, call me a fool but I know that I also bought the rate brother.  Told 14000 very good, after that people put different rates for car parking in it, many builders installed PLC, I am telling about some other listed player, here I am not talking about others, whatever the rate, you say the rate is low.  If you did then he was telling that rate with PLC, now he will tell it without PLC when you go to get the allotment letter, then that will happen. You have to understand that the builders have no urgency to sell their goods.  I will tell you the phenomenon of who is buying what in Gurgaon. Today no common man is buying property in Gurgaon nor can he buy it. It is not possible for the common man to buy property in Gurgaon.  If you buy a flat of Rs. 500, then you are not a common man, you are not a common man, you are not a common man's cup of tea. Brother, the man who is earning two lakh rupees, two lakhs is a lot, so if you limit yourself, he would be saving only one lakh rupees. because tax  One has to pay, there is food, there is rent, there is electricity, there are school fees, if he saves lakhs of rupees then he will save one crore in 100 months, if he goes to 500 in months, he will save 5 crores, one month is 12, one year is 12, then his income is 42 years.  This is when he has two lakhs and 42 years of income, how will he buy anything? How special has he become a common man? Are you talking about a common man? If you stay in Gurgaon, you are not a common man.  If you want to stay in Gurgaon also you are not a common man and common man is not buying, you are a special man, first of all you have bought yourself, if you want to buy then consider yourself a special man at least and this  What is the rate, isn't it the rate, it is bound to increase and not to decrease, this is a p in math, no one is teaching you this, no one is teaching you this, no one is telling you, tell me one simple thing, any project every year.  If it cannot be completed before then the builder has a gun on his forehead that he has to sell the thing in one year, he has to sell it in one day, he has to sell it in one month, the projects which used to be sold in 15 days are now going towards four months.  Which were sold in the first four years. Shapar Ji's unit was the first in the inventory and was sold in 2019. I was the first on 25th January. Now I have been selling the goods for 4 years and kept selling for 5 years.  If the rates keep increasing then what is the panic, the builder has to sell the inventory of one tower at Rs 20 to start the construction of the tower. If there are 100 flats in a tower, if 15 flats are sold then the builder will not start construction. Rs 20 should be sold. There is time for environment clearance to come.  It seems the rest of the clearance comes later, environment clearance let me tell you, it is not given before RERA, that one comes on the line after RERA.  Again this is the biggest nonsense thing which should be taken up with the government and RERA should be taken up and this is an escape route for the builders and you guys that first give the product beige and then to delay, my environment clearance is not coming.  On this, no YouTube will give knowledge or tell because either it is not there or they do not want to tell, that is why I say come every time and I know that big people like chilli but I will always follow my religion. That I am the number one clarity giver, I don't say, I also prove it every time, why don't you come and take environment clearance with RERA first, why don't you get clearance in one go, your 15 days, one month, two months will be delayed when that happens because environment.  If you can't make it clear without that, then you have fooled the public that brother, take the allotment letter money, give it at Rs 10, give it at Rs 20, give it at Rs 30, because that  But in the beginning we take 20 rupees just like that to dig a pit or build anything on it, so we are just sitting there, nothing is being built. In the last six to 10 months, whoever has bought it, tell me, if anything is being built, please tell me.  After taking the photo, this project was sold six months ago and look at this, the construction will also start, but now it will rain, then the mouth will open. Which construction will you start in the rains? If you got six months tomorrow, then the officers do not appoint you.  It gives clearance but who can ask questions from the government, then the builder suffers all these delays. Every time the builder is not at fault. There is a lot of lethargy here. It is the fault of the system but the builder takes all the money from you. If you even drink coffee to the builder,  You don't go to his lounge and buy the product, go there to understand it and eat coffee biscuits and you also give coffee biscuits when the builder launches a party and you also give people his money.  The channels you give are like parties of people and they open like this with liquor and great launch and they do lights like this and videos of them are made and given to common customers, all this is done by unscrupulous builders but you have to tell the builders like this.  Don't do this friend, you are taking money from us only. Why are you celebrating? Keep quiet and do your normal work. Reduce my rate to Rs 100 00 in total because that is the expense of the party. That will be divided from 1000 flats only. If you organize a promotional party worth Rs 1 crore then if you are selling Hajj flats then lakhs of rupees have been added to my cost. I have to tell this but no other people will share this knowledge. Brothers and sisters, this is what  That is the channel, you subscribe to it, this is the channel of best clarity and I am telling you to raise the issues according to the clarity, the price cannot be reduced, builders have the power, you are a builder's man, I am a builder. I am not a man, I am the voice of the sky, I am time, the time of Mahabharata is telling the story, he could not stop the disrobing of Draupadi, for that only Krishna ji will have to come, but time is time, he is spinning around.  You must have seen the old Mahabharata, I am the time, I am telling you what is happening, I have seen it with my eyes, I am telling you what is not even visible to your eyes, I am telling you every time, brother, this is happening, we know it, right, we are sitting inside here.  We are cooking in the kitchen  Do you know how much oil is there, how much oil is there, what is happening inside, what is happening outside, what is inside, what is outside, people, something was running at 100 per cent, it came to 70 per cent, then it will come to 90 per cent, so coming to 70 per cent is not considered that oh rate.  Baba, the rates are not decreasing, the size will be reduced, Maggi was Rs 10 for 100 grams in 2012, then in Rs 14 it will be 90 grams, then in Rs 10 only it will be Rs 8, 80 grams again.  70 grams, it is called shrinking in the language of MBA. We cannot call it inflation. The prices have reduced, the sizes have become smaller. Brother, if the prices are not going to reduce, then those who are rejoicing that oh, this will burst, many people are paying at Rs. 30.  Come on, you won't get trapped, you won't get trapped, you are like us, you were giving information earlier, first of all, people are less and those who give them freedom and protection are like us, not down the market.  Will not let the builder suffer loss Will not let the public suffer loss Will not allow investors suffer loss Will not allow anyone in the society to suffer Will maintain positivity When inflation is at Rs 789, then brothers and sisters, despite the price being the same, there is a loss of Rs 8.  This is basic economics, we will continue to explain this, there is no need to have any reluctance in the product, rain will come, Gurgaon will drown again, then photos will come, then memes will come, but the price will still not reduce, people.  Will remain irritated, I am also irritated, my second channel is Guruji Gurugram, I am going to contest elections there, almost it seems that if they see my content, it is fine, it is my separate channel, where many people have seen me on the same channel on my channel.  I do all the work, I have five channels, it's okay even if there is content, there is knowledge, then the channels will also be different, when you are a good cook and can make five dishes, then will you put everything in one dish or not?  So, I will serve dosa in pizza too, no, no, that is different, beyond that, I am doing too much, raising my voice too much, telling many things, but this one, come here and let me explain to all of you, this one is fine.  And you don't understand this thing. Thank you very much."

    "title": "Understand The Concept Rich Boys Club In Gurgaon Real Estate [XvSNPZ_72Pw].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, I am going to explain about Rich Boys Club, it is playing out the story in Gurgaon real estate in many places and also does a lot of things, you will get to learn some videos, right now there is some confusion about YouTube2, many YouTubes are coming depending on the situation.  If you can't do much yourself, it is sold, then it is bad, is it okay or has it become expensive now? I call many of these people as 'Binpendi ka Lota', you know the 'Binpendi ka Lota' which is sometimes found around here.  Here with the wind with such a gust I am the number one real estate clarity giver I am going to give you clarity on this like nobody else does because people are like Sapre in Gurgaon this has just arrived for Rs 18000 here it has come this this project has come  Gone, sold, happened like this, so this is a lot, I was saying this for many days and now I am telling you again and now today I am going to tell you about Rich Boys Club. What is a rich boys club? Yes, there is a rich boys club, rich boys can also have girls but I say boys, they gathered together and made a circle at any place and said that only rich people will come here so only that.  The thing will be rich, there is no logic in it, example five star hotel, this place is so expensive, made its rate expensive, there could be a dhaba next to it, a place for the poor next to it.  It may also be that there may be everything next to it, but now you may question why it is expensive, it is expensive because it is expensive, it is a bag of Parada, it is a bag of Parada, it is a bag of lace, it is a bag of some brand, it is something important.  It is not the end of the matter, how come it is so expensive, now you are not getting realization of this thing in real estate, people are treating real estate like a commodity, rice, wheat, rice also have different rates, Basmati rice will be different, the government which  is selling  That will be different, that of MSP people will be different, the middle one will be different, small grains, thick grains, brown rice, Thai rice, its rice, black rice, I don't know which one, everyone has a different rate, then just because you will not be able to afford it, if you will not be able to do anything.  Can't do it Rich boy syndrome, it's a club, he works out everywhere, a train is going, yes, that train left from Delhi and reached Mumbai, it has 10-12 coaches now.  All those coaches, all the trains are running together and will reach at the same time, but there is first class, first AC, which is called second AC, third AC, sleeper class, general class, same train, but each ticket is different.  Gentry is different in one, what is it, yes, it is open, a little bit, that much, that much, that much, that much, so much, the ticket in first AC is as expensive, sit in the same plane, it is first class, it is business class, it is economy class, so is it more expensive than economy class?  his ticket is  So did you have so much fun and the flight is of four hours and six hours, let's say 2 hours, 6 hours and 8 hours, then is the ticket so expensive? You go to drink coffee somewhere, you are drinking it in Starbucks, so many others are drinking it in five star somewhere.  So can he make filter coffee at home or can he make fat coffee? Can it taste 25, 30, 40 times better than normal coffee? It may not be tasty but why is it so expensive? It is just that.  Yes, these are the shoes you buy, different vehicles, the most perfect example is that there is only one road in Rich Buzz Club, there is only one red light, at that red light someone is standing in a motorcycle too, someone is standing in an auto rickshaw too, someone is standing in an Alto too.  There is also a Karetta in this car, there is also an Here you will say, friend, the location is the same, the road is the same and at the red light, brother, everyone stops, everyone stops and everyone consumes petrol, this one does more, what is the benefit, how much does it give, oh brother.  When you buy a Rolls Royce, you do n't ask the mileage. When you buy a car, you ask about its mileage. Do you want to buy a Royal Sla or do I take a Bax? Which bent should I buy? You don't ask like this, you ask in the same way.  Real estate is coming, what is the surprise in it? For example, let me tell you another example. This is a big misconception. Someone had posted a video. There is a little lack of knowledge, that is why I come and speak so harshly because people make so many mistakes.  There is no 360 degree perspective. A real estate person knows real estate, I know 70-80 things. Now in someone's video people are telling that it is like golf.  There is a product on Kos Road, Camellia, a thing worth Rs. 00 crores was sold there. It was said that a thing worth Rs. crores is being sold because there they sell things in equity, so the tax is saved. Some of them seem to be free from tax. Hey friend.  Earlier there was tax loss, read it, now cap of Rs 10 crore has been put, now it is not applicable, earlier it was there, now the deal has been done, please go and check income tax rules, not more than Rs 10 crore, capital gain tax is Rs 2 crore.  And this is the equity sale that happens when a start up sells the equity etc., the listing is done, the government has put a cap on it at Rs 10 crore, even after that it is being sold for Rs 100 crore, because again it is a rich boy's club, why and how it is.  A rich boy's club is a rich boy's club, there are CEOs, there is networking, there is hi-fi, people live there, rub off with each other and move ahead in life.  They go and they made one of their own because if someone says it is worth 100 crores, then brother, 100 kg gold will be worth 60-62 lakhs, 62 crores will be worth 100 kg gold, one kg gold is worth 60-65 lakhs, so will you invest 100 kg gold? Even then you will justify by eating 35 crores, you have also invested gold, you cannot justify it like you take the price of Bentley, Rolls.  Take the price of Royce, you cannot do anything like this but it will happen here if you go to the middle of nowhere in Rajasthan, in the Thar Desert, there is nothing there, build something on 510 acres and do something in it and there Alia  Bhatt ji, take there Shahrukh Khan, Mukesh Ambani ji and someone else, Virat Kohli, Anushka and others like that, you and those Englishmen from outside, take some top people, then it will become a rich boy's club there, middle of nowhere.  And make something there and do some activity and say yes, here it will be 25 CR 50 CR. Middle class, I don't know what logic is going on, why they are not understanding. Now let me tell you again, this is Camellia Magnolia, all these turned out to be  They were released many years ago at Rs 5000-6000, they were released at such a price, how many times higher than that, they were expensive at that time and are even more expensive now.  Will remain expensive in future also because where the logic comes is that I have to buy so these things Delhi's rich wife Wife of a rich man says I want this then husband has dozen questions that if you want this then how much will he get it for  Have to give it and their supply is relatively less, no one is questioning, now everything is ready and sing.  He is the top builder in the country in 77 sectors and he launched the product and that product was sold so quickly and was sold so expensive. Nobody questions that they are saying that it should not be sold here, it has become so expensive, now there will be no further rate increase, there will be a lot of rate increase in this region.  Brother, there is exclusivity in it, no one has talked about the density in it, brother, the density is also less, if it is some 40 is a flat, then royalty will be charged, you will stay at one place.  If you are building 150 flats but 40 are being built on one acre, then there will be exclusivity in the 40. Now, what atmosphere will they create there, how will they make the lift, how will they make the lobby, how will they make the club, how will they make the things, when it is ready, then these products will be made.  Are Timeless Properties to be Kept for 30 40 50 60 80 100 100 Plus Years Across Generations and Build  Generational Wealth Middle Class Never Thinks Generational So Datchi What's happening, all this is happening for the middle class, nothing is coming in the Gurgaon real estate market, so of course it is now feeling that I too am saying like me, some product should come.  1.5 to 2 CR is expensive, it has become expensive, even if the density is high, 1.5 to 2 CR, there should be some product in it, it should be less, it is not coming value for money. It is becoming difficult for the middle class to know the things. The middle class looks for value for money in everything. The functional things also have a lot of value. Brand value. Who will remain the gentry? The things which cannot be touched are intangible things.  Okay, we call the thing that you cannot touch, the thing that can be touched, you call it tangential force, that is middle class.  Tang force goes behind things but what I am trying to say is when India is doing progress and we are going to become a 5 trillion dollar economy, okay from 4 trillion now in three to four years, then the wealth that will increase in it will be here in the pyramid. So if I take HNI, let's take high net worth individual, let's take any number of them, let's take let's say 2 lakhs.  If it is okay, then when it will be from 2 lakh to 5 lakh, then 3 lakh will study in the entire country, but these 3 lakh people want expensive things, then demand and supply of these things do not come every day like Maggi, this rate will increase because of Covid.  When it came to the rich and the poor and the middle, everyone suffered greatly, so the rich said that everyone should have a room, so it became very tight, even if tomorrow I get imprisoned again and I should also have a study. And mine should be like this and mine should also be like this, my studio should be something like this, 3600 square feet, ask the other wise, brother, what is the need of 3600 square feet, brother, Rich is coming, NRI is coming, he is coming and these are the things coming.  These things will come and they will become more expensive because their supply will stop in the future because whatever product is coming, it will not be available before 6-7 years, say four-five years.  Take the date of RERA and you will know when the final position of the final tower will be there, then it is not such a suppressed supply, some supply has not come in 202021, not much has been launched even in 22, then now it is happening so 2 20 21 22 some.  If it is not available in the market then 24 25 26 27 There is no ready inventory in it, there is a huge mismatch, so these rates are increasing, even if you do not like this  It seems that I am not a foolish person who is taking people. Have to understand that when God gives the power to earn, Lakshmi ji also sends it, in this way money does not come without sending, because people are questioning the judgment of people.  R buying is fine and it seems so because what is happening is that many people have become irrelevant now builders are having so much fun there is so much demand that there R People who used to sell things in the market or make videos on channels, what is the need to take high moral standing, why can't people speak to us, we are Ruth Capitalist, I am speaking today, Rathasaptami system is demand and supply, not customers, I am giving advice.  I am doing it like this, even in words I am if people are connected with me, you know I am taking in value for money real estate, I am in a ticket size  Personally speaking Gurgaon real estate is extremely value for money in this at 18 19 20000 also but the below thing is not there then when it is not there then give it is there not anything value for money if you want less than one year then there are  Other cities and people who are connected with me, I am bringing products on weekly basis, thrice weekly basis.  I have been in different cities. If you want to know and understand those products and want to attend webinars, then inside the comment section you will find a subscriber info group of real estate. If you have not already joined, I have many groups. It is okay if you have not already joined.  If you are listening for the first time then please join beyond that, you will get the ticket, there is no city of India which is in the top seven, eight, 10 cities which I do not cover on regular basis.  If you like the size, yes, I will assume that the budget of the middle class is 70, 65, 70 to 95 lakh. Anything is available in a hurry, it is being snatched up, it is not available, it is available in many cities, at least in Gurgaon.  There is no one left, there is an affordable housing in Gurgaon and a house worth Rs. 6 crores, that Deendayal has disappeared, just like that, there are a few units left, if anyone is interested. Tell me, it is value for money, there is no question of doubt about it, but there is nothing else, the middle class is waiting and Karan will come, Arjun will come, Karan is not coming, Arjun, nothing is coming, everything is coming.  Six S R F S R and that means now the next one will come, now he will come here, he has so much CR, he has so much CR, so brother, this rich boys club is being formed, these Delhiites are coming who sell themselves for more than five rupees and these NRIs are coming to you. Come  Other things are being grabbed and tomorrow when it will be launched by India Wealth Creators, only the same people will buy it in resale. Even if you are middle class, you should not buy it. What do you think, this has been launched in Rs 27 and it is so cheap.  Sir's thing is gone, it has to be bought by the middle class, now people say this, you will buy it on loan, what kind of Sir's thing is bought by taking a loan, who is the bawdy butch who is saying this?  A thing worth 7 crores is taken by taking a loan. Since when does one get so much money? A thing worth 7 crores is acquired rich by restructuring their assets and by buying the wealth they are creating through their businesses. Nobody takes a loan of six crores to buy more than six crores. Property Nobody Take Loan: Those people are not fools. They know that if they take a loan then the cost of funds will be Rs 859 and they will invest that money in the business.  If he earns 18-20 rupees, if he takes a loan then he will take it for business. There he earns 18-20 rupees. Here he is happy even after earning 10, 11, 12 rupees because he knows that the thing has come as per his wish, he will get it from the choice of his mind, he is getting it from the builder of his mind.  The density of the mind is matching with the amenities and those moments know that these are timeless properties and are not coming again. If you do n't understand then you  Have to Take a Call Condom Rich people are always smart It is the middle class that makes mistakes Rich are smart Why they are rich Poor is not playing all these games So the middle class is getting messed up I have read these things I explain with love and openness to understand. Please come and listen to my real estate predictions for 2024 which I will make right now before the end of this year and you all should come and listen.  And in that I will explain the reasoning, I will explain the thought process as to why the issue will become more expensive because people are feeling that it is a big deal, it is a big deal for those who wanted to buy and those who wanted to sell, no one is asking you both about the market.  I am feeling that since we are not being asked, we are the center of the world, then this thing will end and you will keep seeing like this, Tuck Tuck Luch 34000 sold, 36 sold. Gone 30, sold for 40000, they will come and go like this and no one will give you tea or coffee, they will also take your check like this, they will tell you 14000, 15000 and then they will snatch 18 more and it is over, then you will keep roaming around with the cheque, you will say that I did not take it, I took it.  No, I have caused harm, it is being explained like this at many places, so what is the wrong thing in it, it is being explained that I am not a bottomless pot, my mine.  Advice is running consistently, who is following me and is getting a lot of benefits since last two-three years, till now nothing has gone wrong with the consistency, I am still very bullish in 2024, I am in more bullish and this is this and this and this and that of real estate.  It doesn't get cold that quickly, it will happen just because you are tired, you are defeated and many more horses are coming to fight the race. This clarity will keep coming to all of you.  Stay connected, join the group given in the comment section. You are immediate and only three-four days are left for the end of this year. As many opportunities as there are, the rates are coming out at many places. It is okay, they are being revised from the first of January. They are called once. No sister, it doesn't cost money to see a suit, so I am telling you with that example, weigh the rates of all the suits available, write them down in your diary, otherwise what will happen, Badhani Badhani, Oh Badhani.  If you do n't even know the rate, then how can it increase? Now I say, whether the rate of gold has increased or decreased, you will tell only when you know the rate of gold, when you do n't even know how much it is, then how will you tell if the rate of gold is today, this proposal is some amount. So whether it has increased or decreased from yesterday will be known only when you know the rate of yesterday. When you do not know the rate of tomorrow then how will you judge if there is a big decrease then that is what I am saying, the year is coming to an end in 2023. Knock knock, take the rate from me, do it like this and note it down, then you will automatically know. Be in the market, I am the only one, who is welcoming window shopper. Window shopper does not even ask what is a window shopper, whom should he take? There is nothing but that.  Want to know, I am doing life long window shop myself, that is why I have so much knowledge, there is no brochure of Indian real estate from any city which was launched 20 years ago and is not available with me.  There used to be hard copies because there were physical brochures, now soft copies are coming, they are very easy to keep, this is what I teach you, if you have any project launched in India, it should have a soft copy that this project was launched so much, this is its design.  This is its rate, this is its map and this is how it was done and note it down only then you will be able to follow it with conviction Don't have that uncle ji uncle as a reference  ANALYSIS OF YOUR REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT That Three People in Your House Don't Be in the Market Do the Hard Work It's a Full Time Job Nobody Teaches It No University Teaches It Anywhere I'm the Only One Teaching in the Country That's Too I'm  Not an arrogant person, you know the people who follow me on so many channels, I am a very normal humble person but I say I am number one.  Because there is no number two, the day someone comes number two, number three, I will not call myself number one, but there is no one else, no buddy is teaching, everyone comes, someone shows a drone shot, someone shows a brochure, someone shows his daily life. Bin P's weekly opinion is like how the stock market is traded, the market will go down now, it will go up, now this will happen, the real estate market is like this, today is up, tomorrow is down the day after tomorrow.  Like this, it is not like that transparency is less, there is no index, it is not known, but then I help you in identification, look at the prices of stocks six months ago, the market is forward looking, it is not today, today they have sold the goods, it is the market force which is moving ahead.  What is going to happen is when the stocks are running up. Follow the real estate prices. Stock price of all these listed players. You will get to know what is happening as you see.  The balance sheet is not looking great right now, there is no profit being made but the rates are rising in the stock market because the market is forward looking for six months and 12 months. The smart market knows what is going to happen in 6 months and 12 months. You are not here so physical asset when you will buy that will also go up because the market is discounting it today share market is doing it today actual market later Will do it because in real estate physical market there is a lag of 6 to 12 months compared to stock market. Here the first thing is anticipated and then comes on ground. I hope this video is useful please share with every buddy please join in the group."

    "title": "Understanding About Balconies In High Rise Projects [I79baq3o8CM].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, we will discuss about the balconies in high rise. Tell me, how do you find such a unique topic, then that's why I say, I am the number one clarity giver because by taking the example of the entire youtube2, show how they are different from the old balconies. They were like the DDA balconies.  Or earlier, it used to be of high heights, earlier it used to be hanging in the air, look left, look at the night and this is the wall like this and it used to be protruding from the wall like this.  And what happens to many people is that in such a large area, the plaster keeps falling off and it gives a very shabby feel. Still, the plaster on the wall is not there because these people had not put up a chicken net. This is fine, normally the houses are built on three or four floors. You will never see plaster falling on the balcony there, but no matter how many societies you see, the whole thing used to be a mess. Now all the societies have been coming for two, three, four years and ever since Mavan Construction has started, you will see that the  There is a balcony, right? It is like an open room, meaning it is from here to here like this, and if it is like this, then you will see the balcony like this. This wall means there is privacy here and also a support. There is complete support. You will not get the feeling of hanging in the air like this.  You will not even feel that I am not hanging in the air like this, so this difference has come inside the market. If you see in Mumbai market, they have removed the balcony from there because unfortunately the balcony is also counted in FR there. This is a good provision in Gurgaon, no matter what sector you build in, whether you build a low rise or a high rise, the balcony in Gurgaon is still not counted in the FR which is a very good thing and today I will tell you a rule about the carpet. Area is called the link from the balcony, I teach the link in education, carpet area has become the inside area, which will include the door area also now on S.  The area of ​​the balcony on RERA is called exclusive area, so many people often question the loading, so today I will tell you under the formula that this exclusive area is actually the balcony area plus your carpet area divided by the super area.  Which the builder says has to be 70 then the loading cannot be more than 30 but you understand the point. Now there is another twist in it which I am sharing here for free.  I will not tell you all because it is a part of consultation or my paid webinars, but let me tell you what it is, you think for yourself, what is the ideal ratio of the balcony, how many balconies should there be, is the wrap around balcony good, is the balcony too much?  Let it happen because what I said carpet area plus exclusive has to be at 70 so carpet area can be at 69 and balcony can be at 1 is it a good situation and carpet can be End balcony can be at 65 and carpet area can be at 50 and that exclusive area actually which is the balcony area can be at 20 but it will not be much because brothers and sisters the balcony is a thing hanging in the air, you cannot sleep there.  You can't eat there, you can't do much of anything there except sitting in the pot in the morning and evening or doing pranayama, although there is a good area but there is a limit there. Yes, I am sure there is a need for drying clothes but there is a limit to it. I make you understand this thing very well in my webinars that how will you know how to complete the project because the rate at which he is selling it, brother, you are also super.  It sells it by area, you have to put it in carpet, it will be written in BBA in RERA, no problem, but we are area, even today when we say 00 square feet, 15000 square feet, then we  Let us say that the flat is of 2000 square feet and if it is 000 square feet then we will say that it is a flat of 3 crores but if we go to this 2000 square feet then we will get the carpet area of 1200 square feet then we will say that Guru Ji has  I had said that you will say that at 70, it is 1200 and at 60, brother, this loading is at 40, oh that.  There is also an exclusive area, is n't it? 200 sq ft. Pick up any brochure after doing 1200 and 200. Formula will work. Builder can do 70.1, can't do 69.9, will get stuck. So you will get stuck in this area at many places. You will see 70.5, 70.9 will be visible, 71 is not visible normally, 70 and 71.  One half remains in the middle, if someone makes it 72, he is seen doing more, then brother there.  Density also has elasticity, but understand this thing, is 75 good, it may not be okay, it cannot be below 70, but the biggest game has been given that how much should that carpet plus balcony be, what if I am selling it to you at Rs 2000 super.  So, can the balcony area be more, can it be too much and because in affordable housing, you know that the rate of balcony is per 1000 feet and the rate of carpet is 5000, so it would be Rs 1.5.  It means the government or the builder has calculated somewhere that if it takes Rs. 00 to build the balcony, then it takes Rs. 00 to build the inside, but this is the calculation, according to this, it is being sold at an affordable price, but when you buy luxury, brothers.  Sisters, do you understand that the balcony is sold at Rs 00 and the inside is sold at Rs 500, all your goods are sold at Rs 500, so you understand that I am telling you all the content.  If you go, you get stomach ache, then again, if not, then who should join separately, how to learn separately, okay, then come to the webinar info group, if you are in a mood, sometimes I will tell you for free too, okay, but add it properly at the end because  Many such things are said under examples which are not good to be told openly because I have never been a social reformer on high moral ground and I am the biggest messiah of doing good to the public and I do not wear such a face at all. I am a paid Guruji, give me the money, come understand or say Namaste separately, respect me, only then you will know the thing, okay, and only then I call myself number one, because no one has this attitude, okay, everyone comes and does something, I am with a straight face.  Do it like this, come under the canopy, come there, I will tell you in the webinar, come there, I will tell you what is this game, how is this game done on the balcony, because you are the same brother, see this.  There is a big balcony of 3000 square feet, but it is very big, all the balconies are giving, the balcony is very big, we have to play cricket there, or it is like Raj Kapoor, it is raining if it is coming, which song is it with Nargis, what is that?  Song, which picture was that, I forgot the name of the picture too, Shri 420 Thi Awara Thi, which was the rain song, it is okay, by the way, love happened, Ikraar happened, it is okay, this is it, maybe it is okay, so that, that work.  How big a balcony do you want? A big terrace is coming to you. Oh terrace, you are being charged at the full rate. Okay, it doesn't even have a roof, you can't even put a bed there, you can't even read books there, you ca n't even eat food there.  Ca n't even sit during the day Nobody can sit outside Hold neither many people sit Even if there is a need, what is the ratio Brothers and sisters, tell me how the videos look. If you have not subscribed to the channel yet, please subscribe.  There is a request in the friend circle to share it and like the video and you can join the link of the webinar which is given. There is one more thing that if you press the join button, you can also take membership of the channel, then there is nothing more than that. Get to learn something and soon I am also launching a good two month course, if you want to join then RE MP can tell me its money and structure, I will tell you then RE MP Real Estate Mentoring Program and  By doing this you will become the master number two, India's number one, I will remain number two, you will beat everyone as much as I can, you will not have to be ranked below, thank you very much."

    "title": "Understanding EOI And Its Importance In Real Estate ｜ Expression Of Interest [T69Hb6BqMT8].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, why should you give OI if you are a serious inducer and investor? Let's see the history of OI. What is this UI? If you do not know, it is very popular in real estate in North India, but now it is in Pune side.  It has started happening in the western side and other sides also, in the south also in Bangalore, UI e-expression of interest in this what happens that you give a check and some money in advance.  And you express your interest, then we will discuss about it because many people with expression of interest feel that they have not told anything in detail before, they have taken the expression of interest and what is it? By doing this, I will tell its history.  I will tell you who was the first one, many years ago, this builder has been doing this for one, two or three years now. Before that, there was another thing, taking an example from Haryana, let me tell you, his name was G. Hooda, Haryana Urban Development.  The authority which is called HSVP, which is not getting anything as of now, is also fine, more of the matter is just that it has become an authority and whatever it has become, we keep looking after the sewerage, water, electricity and the work of paper vapor.  Now she does n't know anything new but she used to talk about her at one time, you know and people from Haryana please write in the comment section, people from Delhi will also know that when Bhai Saheb used to come with the plot, do you remember? They did not call it expression of interest, it was called Hooda Invites, an application, they used to call it Earnest Money, it was a word, so it was a short shot that Earnest Money is 10, but it was a very good amount which people had to pay and  It used to be stuck for six, six, seven, seven months and at that time it used to be several lakhs, which means today's fifty lakh rupees, which is more than the equivalent of UI charged these days because it was  It was a matter of 15 20 25 years ago. 15 20 25 30 years ago, it used to be stuck for six months and its draw was based on the plot. It was not even certain to meet. Nowadays, if you give the expression of interest on time, you will understand the thing. So you will take it, if you gave in the beginning, at that time the draw used to come out of the lot, then a system came such that the banks started giving, the banks see so many, two lakhs, one lakh two lakhs or whatever.  It also used to go up to Rs 3 lakh 4 lakh 5 lakh depending on whether that scheme has been running for many years, so what did the banks do by giving you a loan, they used to take interest from you for six months like Rs 000 8000 or Rs 100, 12, whatever.  Interest was earned and the bankers used to give it to him. There is a government servant, a bank used to give it to the government, the government used to give it to him, he used to give it back to him, they used to settle among themselves and this went on for many games. I want to say this, at that time everyone used to do this here, so what is the problem today, who sits with the money, why is there so much fear in the mind because the money is not being wasted, no one's money is being wasted, later on, someone has taken more of his own money.  Gave it back and forth 45 days, signed the application and got the builder buyer agreement. However, till the builder buyer agreement, you do not have any problem on your loan. It is okay, if you have paid one month's interest, suppose you also paid Rs 10 lakh.  So according to the percentage, the interest on FD is Rs. 600, its annual rate is Rs. 5000 per month, if this Rs. 000 is yours, then what disaster is coming, who has it, who has to buy, if you are an end user investor, what happens because you give money?  Yes, I am telling psychology, I have also given UI at many places, have taken up a lot of space, have also not taken up much space, I am also telling this, but by giving OI, you become skin in the game, not me anymore.  You have to understand this well, now I have to go and you become fully committed, no, we had to take it, we paid the money and went inside completely, you are not able to take it, because what is the thing these days, it is not until you see the face.  As soon as it is said that the face of the brochure would have been shown, the face of the layout would have been shown, by then all the UIs would have gone. Recently, as this video is being made, I think there is an allotment where UIs were kept at two places, in Gurgaon real estate, I am going now.  kept their allotment  I hope those who have got a good priority number will understand and take their allotment, but this is the procedure, it is there and this is how it is, that craze and that happens because where such a situation does not happen, the person says take it. See, it will be done, if you think about it, then there is no need to explain things to the builders, it is not like making it open ended, because the pricing will be there, there will be some discounts and see, the square feet at Rs. 00 is Rs. 50.  400 500 600 square feet, if things are priced at Rs 2000, then a discount of Rs 10-12 lakh is not less, especially when the money is being taken at Rs 10. Well, you have to understand that appreciation is visible in this price only on the ground.  It takes time for appreciation to happen first on paper but gradually it comes on ground also, so I request you all to stop giving this UI. Without hesitation, you will not be able to do decision making, this is a noisy shot because when you shy away from giving UI, because as I see in other markets, in Pune side it is only 500, 1,5,00, 2 lakh, Kolkata, Pune, Chennai, which is North. Gurgaon does not have Indian Markets, in Gurgaon it has become 10 lakhs. Earlier in Gurgaon also it was 1 lakh, 2 lakhs, then it became 5 lakhs, now it has become 10 lakhs for some builders.  It has become 15-20 lakhs. Those who are top builders are taking up to 30 lakhs-50 lakhs, it is okay because they are saying that brother, they are also looking at the potential, otherwise they are taking 55 lakhs in vain, now it is worth 7 crores.  If the property is worth 6 crores, then what will he do with it, if it is worth 5 lakhs, the world will catch him. Okay, so this is something which is happening in the market and you need to be very. Careful about it in a way that without this you cannot buy, so this mental is that brother, 1520 years ago, lakhs of people used to invest in HUDA's applications, today we become like this, this builder bought thousand flats and 5000  When people applied, we thought, oh my God, 5000 people had applied earlier, brother, lakhs of people, these few hundred plots used to come out to a few hundred. Plot means thousand applications used to come on one plot, this was the ratio of real estate, when you are old, if you know the time, the last one I applied for was in Gurgaon, I remember the one from Hooda, in 2004, it was for 52 sector, not 52. Was it or 57? Sorry, 57 was released in sector 57, 52 was also released. If I am not in color, I am confused between 52 and 57.  52 must have applied in both, they must have come out at the same time, okay, and in 5257, people used to apply in such huge quantity and then after selling the premium paper, they used to come out and it was the same slip, slip after slip, slip after slip.  Those times were also fine, so now this is so, there is no need to worry about it, when 20 years ago people were doing this work, so many years ago, it was a matter of so many lakhs, it was fine at that time also, so that's what we got.  The money used to go, did not come out, used to be drawn by the government, after that they removed that too. I am thinking that this system should not start the bank address again or should it not charge interest, take Rs. 000 and give that.  Do I don't know, this can also be one but then builders are not interested in this because builders are not interested like the government, then there is interest in getting the interest because at that time they used to say that  Man, this is the income of the Hooda people from the interest on it. There used to be a saying in Haryana that it used to last for six, six, seven, seven months as if the time of giving the money came, by then another sector was launched and another scheme was made, it was made, it was made, it was made, it was made, it was made better.  Had it been done like this, that money would have reached lakhs and crores of rupees with the government because every person is giving so much and lakhs of people are applying, so it would have remained lying there.  It was simply not refundable, till the time the next one came, interest came, interest was played, so that too was our time, old, ok, still there is time, but brother, we will have to do it, tell me how to do without AOI.  If it is possible, then see, although in the future, units are saved even after EE, it is not such a thing that units are saved, UI came, everything came, everything came out, but the one thing is that yes, this project came, the entire market was explained to the people. Focus came, everyone understood everything, video studio was built  All the focus came and the things got divided, now after that there is a job, it will continue, they say sustainably, whenever the builder has built the sample flat, the builder knows that he has to sell the goods easily, he does not even want to sell the whole, but without any investment.  You Will Not Be Able To Take The Call In The Present Markets This Is Not Every Builder Will Do This Coming Times But Most Of The Builders Will Do This So You Have To Be Mentally Ready For Giving The  At the stage without UI and UI, you will not know the exact rate, nor will you know the exact size, nor will you know the exact amenities of the site. In fact, people tell you only a day before the allotment. It is okay.  So that remains a craze, the tactility of marketing, the builder himself cannot play the name of the customer, that I bring my builder and work as per my own, then whatever is in the market, we have to do it accordingly and in that, if we  If we persist then we can do this thing easily. Okay, like the channel, subscribe. There is a webinar info group in the comment section. When these projects come, I analyze them. Top seven of the top 10 cities in India.

    "title": "Unique And Curious Case Of Mumbai Real Estate [lVGp61vZtAk].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, in this video we will discuss the curious case of Mumbai real estate. How is Mumbai real estate different from other real estate? As you learn, you will understand that the prices are very high there, how are projects sold there, what different story plays out.  There and I will try to compare it a little with the market of Gurgaon from daily NCR late, you people will enjoy a lot, it will be fun, understand that off course in Mumbai real estate, many of you are not living there and cannot buy, no problem.  No, although I am going to bring its projects also recently, if you ever want to get such information, then in the comment section you will find a whatsapp.in group, click on it and join it, then let's start real estate there.  What is the difference there, the difference is that whoever is the developer is a developer, he is not a land owner, so what is the result as a result, the land belongs to someone else, earlier there used to be mills here, cotton mills etc., okay, so that. land  There were owners, a lot of development took place there, big owners, so mostly the developer there is yours. In a way, think of it as the one who is making money on the goods that will be sold and manufactured, so his interest is always that the more expensive the thing is sold and  As the goods are sold, he will earn profit and the rates will increase further. In Gurgaon and other markets, there is pressure on the builder to sell the inventory quickly and sell more because  His huge wealth has been invested in buying land for real estate, so he has to recover it first because the cost of interest, cost of interest meter is down, the cost of interest of the real estate developer in Mumbai and his meter is not down, he just says that.  He is making halwa and is taking money for making halwa. Neither has he bought ghee nor has he added all the ingredients like cashews, almonds and anything else, neither gas nor stove, he has nothing. He is just taking money for making it. As the pudding is being made, the money is coming in, that is why you will see that any project in Mumbai is built in four to five to six years. Whatever high rise you know, it takes so much time, so the builder is comfortable with it.  He is interested in selling for four to five to six years, hence when any project is launched, his initial interest is only in removing the inventory at Rs. 20, he remains speculative and that is why it seems very expensive in the beginning and it seems so.  Who will buy the expensive ones, then the same people are buying by selling, that is the story that is being played out in Mumbai that the outsiders are not buying that much, it is the insiders who had a flat of 1500 square feet, which was there for 40 years, 50 years, it is over.  If it is done, now we will take Rs 7500. If we talk on the basis of carpet, I am talking on the basis of super, so you can sell a carpet of Rs 1200 and get Rs 600 carpet.  You can sell 800 carpets and get 400,400, that is also there and that is how inheritance is kicking in and the demand is coming in the same way, you will see a different case there, the density is 350 to 400 acres on flats, what will you find a different case there? You will never see another balcony in Mumbai because the balcony is also included in the carpet area and if it is counted inside the FR, then there are balconies there.  Whenever we meet people, they say, why give a balcony? We need a balcony to dry our underwear, to sit, to drink tea, to put pots in it, to take a breath of air, but now in Mumbai you don't see people who say that brother, the living space is so much.  If you are giving less then if you give a balcony in it then it means that it will be counted in it so people are not benefited then this is again a pickler case of Mumbai real estate and the land is not increasing in Mumbai. You know one side. Complete  It is the sea, it is okay, so it can be up and down, it can be up and down, because yes, it is spread till Pune also, things are fine but there is a limit to it, that is why there is another region in Mumbai in Everybody Mumbai Real Estate that it gets filled with water.  There is a lot of traffic jam, the infrastructure is very bad, that is why the prices of real estate are high, I will tell you this separately very well, but here I want to tell you, just imagine if the infrastructure becomes very great like Yamuna.  Expressway or this jewelery favor or something, friend, if you tell me then people will be less suspicious. Like Mumbai is Mumbai, let me tell you one place where you can reach in half an hour in a very fast train at a distance of 150 km. Then if I improve the infrastructure and there is no huge crowd, then people will all stay there, otherwise why would they want to live nearby? They want to live nearby because the infrastructure is bad, this is what is increasing the property of Bangalore, that is, the traffic jam. Man should not get trapped in this problem which has become so much that is why the man wants to buy real estate somewhere where he works because he does not want to spend three hours of his life every day. On the same basis he is reading the article. Tell me the day when that problem is solved so easily.  If this happens then why will the real estate increase then these are these counter things, what do people do, what should happen, what should happen, they go on that, normally this is the middle class, any essay is being talked about, some debate is being done and Dhruv.  Rathi's debates take place on his channel like the content lifted from Wikipedia which is stuck to the youngsters and they think that they have acquired a lot of knowledge, there is low order thinking, what should happen, what has not got that much meaning, what is happening and what is happening due to that.  And what will happen due to that happening and why is it happening? If you understand, wherever there is trouble, what are people doing to avoid that trouble and what are they doing to help real estate.  What effect will it have? This is the answer for real estate. If a person reaches everywhere smoothly, in 20 minutes, you can build such a city with great ease. Then brother, the one where so much real estate is so expensive, is Nariman Point Lower Parel or your Cafe Road?  Or whatever your property is not even in Mumbai then go to Andheri, you are ok, Carnival East, see how expensive it has become, ok then why is everything expensive, why is your even Navi Mumbai becoming that, ok so  The reason behind this is that people there want to stay there and do not want to go far. The same reason is in Australia, real estate and everywhere, where there is lethargy of people to leave their ecosystem, someone's own place, where his friends, food, water, school, all this is that.  He does n't want to leave so soon, he has been with him for so many years, otherwise what difference does it make if he goes 20 kilometers away and comes back, then he will not get that feeling of being a Mumbaikar. Mumbai which is called Mumbai has the feeling of a Mumbaikar, just like a Delhi person will get the feeling of living in Najafgarh, Thona will come of staying in Narela, although technically it comes in Delhi, you will call Najabgarh as Delhi, you will call Narela as Delhi, but brother, do you get any feeling after staying there?  I am a Delhiite, a Delhiite, a Delhiite, Punjabi Bagh, Shalimar Bagh, a very sophisticated Delhiite, the address of Delhi is a psychology and Mumbai is very sophisticated. That man also plays in the metro, he hangs around wherever he is, in the local train etc. but he has to live there only, he will live in a small house, we will make it smaller and smaller, one room, one bed, Rs. 000 per rent. Youngsters are going to such places, they are going to struggle, there is financial capital, there is Bollywood, there are dreams, so basically when I speak, I want to speak about that. I will have to major in square feet on aspirations.  The value of a real estate is that you have moved to a city, Jind is fine, Fatehabad Rohtak, Rohtak is a different beloved city, I will not take its name, I will make a separate real estate for it, if you want a video on Rohtak real estate, it also has a lovely phenomenon.  If you get to learn a lot then write Rohtak Real Estate. I don't know there are many subscribers in that area, but if we pick any small city like Saharanpur or any other then how many square feet are there in that area. Will define the real estate there in Mumbai is the most expensive real estate in India because there is the highest desire per square feet. Today I have given you another matriculation through this video, no real estate person will teach or explain that I am number one.  That's why I am telling you that the price of real estate will follow the desired aspiration per square feet. Now how to calculate it? Aunty cat does not teach all the things to the fox at once, otherwise who will ask? Have you heard the story?  The fox is training the cat aunty. The cat aunty is training the fox. She teaches a lot. Now the fox feels that the cat will eat the aunty. Now, is she of any use? No, she has told everything. As soon as she attacks her,  When aunty cat climbs a tree, the fox asks, \"Hey cat, aunty, you didn't teach me how to climb a tree. Son, if you can teach me everything, then jokes aside, I did n't teach you everything through a video.\"  It's okay by the time Cat aunty will teach you everything Cat aunty will have to learn something new Because I can neither make you number one nor number two, if you are okay then calculate these things, make aspirations, is there any way to calculate aspirations? Talk about dreams and dreams on square feet. Which city is taking dreams? Greater Nade is not taking dreams. All the retired people are sitting there, they have no dreams. They call it God's Departure Launch. If there is a departure latch in the airport then it is God's too.  Departure is a shame when you are checked in, it's time to leave, you don't know when the plane is coming but now you have entered it, now you can't come back, Panchkula is also one such place where such people live mostly, okay now many  People  They will say, there is peace in God's departure. Yes, there is peace, there is no tribulation, because you can go anywhere at any time, it is ok to take, but not by aspiration, real estate will not increase, there will be no fun, there is fun only where there is noise, I am like this.  I have to do it by force, I don't do this work myself, but sometimes I go and see where all this is happening and in cyber hub Gurgaon, there is a tank of Rs 000 and tequila shots are being given and so on.  You lick a lemon, apply some salt or lemon and lick it, I sit and look at everything, I am not judgmental on the ground, Guruji, I am a man, I say yes and do whatever you want, why should we be judgmental when in a salary of Rs 65,000, you are worth two and a half to three thousand rupees.  You take tequila shots, cut cut cut and your real estate there will increase. Brother, we are seeing that the person who is not ready to spend so much on this will also do it on real estate, he will have to do it like us.  We will increase it and we will say, child, when you are doing this on this salary, will you get a room here for Rs. 8000? You have to see this thing, this also comes in the aspiration itself, in the calculation, this is the highest in Mumbai and if this is the highest then  There is maximum real estate there, it is simple, so whenever you invest in real estate, today what we learned from this video, we learned one new thing that brother, dreams, aspirations, vibrancy index, all these things are cool. Those cities will remain cold where a person cannot order pizza because the intestines get damaged. If you want to eat bathua raita and this, where the focus is on bathware, although it is absolutely right, I also agree that there is no junk food.  One should eat, one should not drink alcohol, one should not do all this, but in the places where these stories are coming more, eat Bathua ka Raita, if you eat it like this, then there Bathua consumption will do that and not that much.  There are parameters and all this can be done and there are big investment firms and those who write these things, I call them these things, I can connect real estate with such things which are beyond imagination if you like.  Want a video, friend, we did not even imagine this, you linked it with real estate and you can extract its data also, you can check that he is not talking in such an air, then a smile will come on your face, if you want that video.  write down your imagination  beyond imagination is your thought beyond that means beyond what you can think so when I get this content beyond what you can think datchi ok so like this one share share tell me how did you like thank you"

    "title": "What Mistake  Existing Buyers Should Not Make In Gurgaon Real Estate ？ [iTgoE70Hf4c].en",
    "content": "Yes Hello friends, this is a very important topic if you have invested in Gurgaon real estate as an investor and end user, especially if you have invested as an end user, this video has been triggered, it was forwarded to me by a subscriber, a famous person.  The builder has a project in Sector 104 Dwarka Access in front of which the home buyers were protesting. If you people would know then write the name of that builder in the comment section. There was protest happening because of delay, so I am not a builder spokesperson but I bring a perspective for you people and if you understand anything in that perspective, then you tell me the ground reality, I will tell you about the future, I will tell you what to do.  You will enjoy and please spread it on yourself. The date of RERA is given by a builder which was given in 2019 which was launched in January and February like this builder.  It happened in December 2018 so it had a rare date but in between 2 years were given to Covid, everyone knows it but now people have forgotten Covid but remember the time, don't know that there was Covid for 2 years, all the projects are minimum 2.  Now I will tell you the names of some projects which are running late for a year and I will tell you what to do and how to do them. The advantage of creating frustration is that you can get the deal at half the price.  Especially those who have invested from outside, these home buyers also feel that if there is a delay, then you can file a complaint in RERA, the builder is not giving the position of some part, we are also current, your pain can be completely understood. But you also enjoyed the appreciation. At what rate did you buy the flat of 1099 square feet? First, how much margin is there now? So, it has to be understood that the price which is under  If you apply for construction, I am telling you that if you get a certified and happy ready to move in house and the price appreciation is under construction, then this will not happen, you will have to go through two anxiety construction risks, delay risks, execution risks. Why do you have to suffer, you have to earn more money, otherwise I say simply, do not put any project under construction when  Once it is ready, take it after a while, but it is up to you to see whether you will be able to get the unit at that time of choice, whether you will be able to be so disciplined that you will be able to collect that money in this way in your life, whether the rate is out of your budget.  It will not go away because those who were thinking that in the last four-five years the pricing in Dwarka Expressway has been 2.3 times more than I would like. Recently a report has come out that in the last 5 years real estate all over India  Appreciation is shown on an average, in which Gurgaon is at the highest number one peak. In the last 5 years, the price in Gurgaon has increased by Rs. 160 to Rs. 160. At Rs. 160, it means that an item worth Rs. 1 will be worth Rs. 2260. It has increased in other places also.  And 83 73 that is also decent, Mumbai market, this market, that market, but you know this, now the price has increased, now it is time to get the thing.  The time structure is ready, I agree that delay is of course but in delay you see that it is the builder's fault in delay, no one is denying it but if mitigating factors say 100 if there are reasons for delay or 100 units of fault.  If yes, then it may be upto 30, 40, 50% of the builder's salary, but there is no work in winters, there are groping norms, labor issues due to rains. Issues Real estate has become so busy that so many projects have become such that the work has increased so much that the manpower is not that much, so you can hire laborers and bring them, but when the work is done with Mavan Construction, then you need a train of people.  You cannot bring anyone, you have to have its shuttering done, its solution has to be applied. I will not say that you need a person exactly like a civil engineer, but you need a lot of people like diploma holders, now inhouse who can do their own construction.  Let's do it in Gurgaon like Shobha who is on the payroll, whose shaper ji is on the payroll, Shobha's project which is going on in 108 sector, brothers and sisters, it has been completed for 8 years, it is being built for the last 8 years and minimum three-four.  If it takes more years, it takes 12 years to make what is the best, but it is slowly sold, Covid came in between, the project was big, I accepted the matter, but 12 years, Shaper ji, is a smaller project than that.  Shapar ji is an even bigger contractor. He is a very big contractor of India. He promised to deliver his first phase in 4 years but it was just launched in January 2019. By the time the last tower is delivered, it will be 2026 January i.e.  The best in the market is not above that, he is also taking 7 years, he is the best, he has worked even during Covid, he had in-house people even during Covid, so those laborers are not like that.  They were gone and we have to catch them and bring them back and all their work has been going on perfectly, everything is very good, people are also satisfied, construction quality is also good, everything is good but brother, it is the best for 7 years, you can see Godrej Meridian. How much time is it still taking? Look at Godrej Air. It is taking time there also. If you avail the RERA of Godrej Nature Plus, it is on time. Now what is the latest thing, I am telling you that earlier in RERA it would have been taken for four years.  Were And then there is an extension and this is what happens, now in RERA, the builder has to stay for seven years, keep watching this video till the end, do not go like this, oh you are talking like this about making money from this, I will also tell you what is there in the market.  This is what you have to realize that today the builder will complete the building in 7 years and is taking the money for 2.5 to 3 years ahead which is seeming expensive to the people. The prices being sold today are the prices after 2.5 years.  If you are asking for it For two and a half years, the matter will remain the same, many people, the signature is 37D, the pit is God's, the construction has started, don't pay the money in full now, let's go after taking the premium, let's take Godre Janit, how will you go out, brother, how will you take that pricing, that is, that foam in cooking.  It will take time to ripen. Recently, I had made a video a day or two ago, it got 10,000 views. I had told that whoever is a seller in the projects should contact me.  10000 views were seen and he mentioned the names of four projects like Shapar Ji has around 1500 apartments, Shobha has 1500, Lawn has 750 800 unsold, Godrej Meridian has 750, so total if we add then there are around 4500 apartment owners and that Video Goes to Mostly Groups Frustration I Presumes Mostly Atlist 4500  Out of these, at least 3000 must have seen it. Now those who have bought can be investors, can be end users and can be sellers who want to sell. Only I have got a single digit response. Can you believe it for sellers?  And even if I look carefully inside him, he is more interested in asking the rate and by looking at the rate he has quoted, it becomes clear that these people are not interested in selling.  There is no seller in the market, so I have tried it and in this video I am saying again in Gurgaon, but if you become a seller in Zenith, Godrej in Godrej Aristo Crate, then how can you become what you have become in Signature 37D.  How will you get an exit? If a person gives you a premium, the pit is not God, the execution risk is still the same, so what is the benefit to him, only when the thing is ready, all these will be sold.  That's why there is stock because including Hero Homes, there is stock in these because the structure is standing or your structure is standing, so you know that people have started living in it, people have started living in Shapar Ji and Shobha, Meridian also seems to be completely standing.  We have everything so now I feel that yes it will happen in 6 8 10 12 months. In Godrej Nature Plus you have to check for 2027 28. RERA has given 27 28.  The builder is wherever there is RERA and will build it as per his own requirement. If it is 2031, then look at Janit's RERA. If it is 2031, if it will be built in 7 years, then clap it, only then you will know that what you feel is the supply.  There is no supply. As if Delhiites want ready to move in, they come with it after selling their property. It is not possible to get it easily for the next six months. I believe it is ready to move in.  Move-in rates will increase a lot. In some cases, under construction will be shot. Brother, tell me, I have to pay Rs. 00 for under construction in 4 years, 5 years, 6 years and if I have to pay for ready-to-move-in today, then ready-to-move-in should be cheaper. But you will see that you will get ready to move in for Rs. 105 and it is worthless property. As they speak in the language of Haryana, worthless builders, the rate of their goods has increased in the market.  Those who have now got the projects worth Rs 100-100 crores, live in the disbelieve system that hey, what is this useless infrastructure, this is a useless infrastructure, this rate is useless, we will come forward, I will keep making videos in the future also because now there is a latest  Someone came to their first business standard, I said I will make a video, then their link is going viral on the internet, now one is going viral all over the place on real estate that real estate is nothing but eat and that and land.  There is no dearth of money, if everyone had this much then I will make a video beyond that if you want, so that you can give a complete story about why real estate is expensive, why this real estate is expensive and it will keep getting expensive only and inside this I will tell you more about the project.  Let me tell you the name, the signature is 37D, it is 81, that project is also of two years, as it was said, it seemed that four floors will be built, Covid came in between and then Haryana's policy also comes many times.  There are factors and still I am not giving a clean chit to the builder and that too at the builder's time. I feel like all the builders sometimes increase the rate of cement bars and say that they will not buy now or delay it for two-four months. They do it like this, the money has arrived and they eat the interest. Look, in RERA, money cannot move around in an account. They are doing it comfortably and they are looking at each other. No one is giving it in a hurry.  is like like  There is cartelization of airlines or hotels, everyone has increased the fees, increase the fees and some things are genuine about everything, cry about some things, sometimes do it like this, sometimes like telling the issues of main park, it is genuine, it is smart.  The world is smart, the world had said that low rise buildings will be built in 2 years, look at it in 3 years, even the low rise will not be built before four years and the high rise will not be built before 7 years, write it down somewhere. Because how many times has the policy been changed, first you can sell it at Rs 50, then at Rs 50 you will have to do frozen units, then it went on for one and a half year and then it was said that you can sell it at Rs 80, then the frozen put, then selling the frozen units, these are big issues, friend, it is not so easy.  This is to say that it will take that much time to develop the thing, but what is the good thing in it that people should not worry about, other than some names which are affordable, Mahira Jo  Unfortunately, mostly by the grace of God, nothing has gone wrong in this land period and what is going on, you have to see if there is any listed builder or the builder who is going to bring more projects like one more project from Herom.  If he is going to bring it then how can his intentions be bad? He has to sell the goods in the future also and the goods are his sold. Why won't he make a builder out of the sold goods? If his intentions can be bad then how can his intentions be bad? The goods have not been sold and he has no money. So understand.  If it comes in India then they have reputation further, they are listed players, even if they don't have a listed company in real estate, but they have a listed company somewhere in the stock market, so those things will also be played out in the market like that and  And let me tell you one interesting thing, you guys should calculate that if RERA of 2024 will be made in 2031 then will we have 2000 205 26 27 28 29  Ca n't we predict the supply that is going to come in 30? Do we need rocket science? If the announcement of 106 still has some delay, the first seven or eight towers have already been built and we have an idea of ​​when they will be built, so can I say this in my opinion?  We cannot write when and how much supply is coming here, so we can exactly calculate that supply that whatever rate it is, it will increase by holding all of them because those people who are buying them now.  There will be brothers and sisters who will sell their property and earn this income. Now no person in Gurgaon can buy property by taking a loan. It is a fact because how much can the salary be, brother, hit your limit, you will be rich in ₹ lakhs, the wife also earns.  If you invest one and a half to two lakhs, you can invest 5 lakhs, then income tax is paid on 5 lakhs, if it is more than 1.5 lakhs, then for 35 lakhs you have to pay rent, food, school children's fees, visas etc. So push the limit, push the limit, you will withdraw 2 lakhs, you will withdraw 1.25 lakhs, you will withdraw 2.25 lakhs, that is, push the limit, you will take a loan of 2 crores, you will break your FD, you will tear everything, you will also take money from father, mother, father-in-law.  If you take out Rs 50,60 lakh, 70 lakh from there then what is you getting even in Rs 2.83 crore? You are not getting anything, you are getting something, so please tell me, now you have the property.  Will there be inheritance or someone will buy now in Gurgaon? The age profile of the people who will get in will be 40 and 50. The businessman will buy. The one who is a startup crowd will buy. The one who sells to the Delhi crowd will buy. Or the one whose property has been sold somewhere else will buy the family property.  That you had invested in property somewhere in your 20s, it has increased, now you are in your 30s, you have to take money and loan, you will have to take everything in Gurgaon. To buy property, you will have to take loan, loan from mother-in-law, father-in-law, father-in-law, mother, wife, wife, everything is all in, even then it will not be taken from many people, this is the status, so now what guidance do I want to give through this video.  Listen carefully, if you raise these slogans then the value of your project will go down. Drop as many as you want. Do you think that by raising slogans you will put the builder to shame? The builder has a thick skin.  The problem is to go to RERA, it is government's RERA, you do not know where the address is, you cannot do it, go to RERA, go to RERA and give your complaint, who is refusing, if everyone goes, then it is not known whether the builder has any new solution.  He is coming, he is coming, he is coming, why are you doing this, who is doing this, who is standing there, is there a house owner there or not, I too can stand somewhere and say anything, oh hi, hi, hi too, not me, we  owner  If yes then show it with allotment letter and if you have allotment letter and you have BBA and it is delayed then brother, the process is to go there, first of all go to RERA and protest in front of RERA, still it will make a difference if something like this happens.  You will do this so that they will still guide you, because what happens just by protesting, I have seen this protest, this is what happens when the general rates were increasing, were increasing, were increasing, now 15  Brother, 16 Hajj has come, leave it now, now it has to happen that these ones which were of premium segment, were not of ultra luxury, their rate has become 15000, now will you take them to the moon, now if not like such a rocket, then now it will be like this.  It's been some time now friend, why haven't you got it now, why not in 2023, why not do it, it is getting delayed, it is lagging behind, it is going on, why didn't you do it because the reason is the reason for this, this is a simple reason.  This is a game of demand and supply of the market. As long as the rates keep increasing by thousand feet every day, everyone remains calm until it seems that there has been a little delay, it has been delayed for six months, brother, please check, era.  Have they got an extension? As far as I know, during Covid, the government had given one year extension to all the builders, whatever was their date, and now these projects of different towers have been launched.  These have been done according to each tower and different RERA has been taken according to each tower. But I am not a good thing in the same project. If there is only one project then there should be only one RERA. I will sell one of its towers. After 4 years RERA again.  These are two towers after one year, they are rare for four years, five years, then like this, or many people are now taking only seven years straight so that there is no problem so that they will be sold in the market, they talk like a vegetable, don't go to anyone.  eat you  You will get it in 40 minutes, then give it to him in 38 minutes, you said 20 minutes and when it was 22nd minute, he did not come, did not come, did not come, did not come, did not come, so how many times have I told this through videos, I am telling it again.  It is a high rise, anyone can say anything as per their wish and it will not be available before 7 years. Today all the builders are smart and they are taking only 7 years. I have also told the names of two projects which will be launched in 2024.  Go to RERA and check the certificate, if the date of 2031 has been given, then they are taking it for 7 years, so they will make it in the same amount as they are taking, there is no need to make them sooner than that and they will make it as per their own, many people have become rich slowly.  It will be sold slowly, many will be sold according to the tower, many will be sold by increasing the rates, it is up to the builder as to how to sell, it is okay, he has time of 7 years and in low rise, now the low rise is more.  Those which are not being launched, the government has just come in Haryana, otherwise not much work is going to be done regarding change of land use, hence the supply is going to be very limited. If you become your own Jagga Jasoos sitting at home today, then give. What projects will be ready in 2025 26 27 28 29 30 31 is in your hands because the one which will be launched after two months will be ready in 2032 itself. I can tell you about the supply and the demand is fully predicted from where and how much is going to come, that is why these rates are seen so high in the market during this bull run and I myself am saying that if the rates are visible today after 2 years then 2  If you see the rates after a year, they will seem expensive but they are for two years, maybe after 2 years the rates will be for the next two years, just like discounting the future in the stock market, sometimes there is a lag in real estate.  But in the bull run market, real estate also demands the future price today itself whether there will be shortage in future. He sees the market. Who is that market, that market is like us, I am the market, you think this, I am the one who is telling you if the shape  You have to give it to the market, this is a shaky market, just think that it is the supply that is being told to you today that brother, when a person's child will have to live on rent, then the demand will increase, the demands will increase and things will not be available on rent, when the rentals will go up.  So Property rates will also go up and builders have shown a lot of wisdom in the last 4 years as to how they have controlled their launch speed. Let me tell you another good thing - such videos with real estate awareness youtube2 This thing sales reduced by  If there were less sales on 20 units as compared to last year then we would feel that oh sales are decreasing but below it it will be written that the sales have also reduced if last year 100 units had come in the market.  And 90 were sold late, so this year only 70 were sold late but only 75 came in the market, now what will you do if 75 came, 70 were sold but the 70 sold is less than 90, but still brother, we are in this.  To find the term, you have to solve: Inventory Over Hang. What is Inventory Over Hang? How much is the total inventory and in how many months is the current pace of absorption? Any inventory overhang which is less than 24 months will be sold. It is considered very very healthy in the worst periods of real estate when the goods were not selling and economic conditions, demonetization and whatever you put it. In the most negative times, the inventory was up to seven years.  This year i.e. 84 months to 90 months, those 84 and 90 numbers will be in single digits in some markets.  It has come in 10 months, 11 months, 16 months and in that too, in the big projects that the builder is launching right now, he is saying that he will launch this last tower at a price of 0000 feet, as per what is being said in the market right now, and  We can't believe it after hearing this but he says that brother, I will do it after 5 years, I am not doing it now, I will do it after 5 years, I will do it in 0000 feet, I am currently in 20, but I am not going to take it till then.  I will take it and I will launch it then it will be made even more late, so if something is launched only after 4 years, then it will take 3 more years to be made, it will sell itself easily, so the rates are not decreasing anywhere in the market, which has to be bought.  Be sure to restructure your property. Anyway, it is not possible to take a loan in Gurgaon, so it has to be taken in restructuring, so if any property is not doing well for you, it is not doing well, you can keep the handkerchief, you can pay at Rs. 20-30.  Yes, and you can buy all yours, buy only after selling some of it. Count all the people who have come to the exit at 30, the total is not 100 people in Gurgaon, but the total is not 100, you will get 20-30 in signature 37d.  510 will be found in Shad Zenith 510 will be found in Aristo Crete These are 510 people and these people have 99  Aker magic brake dealers are everywhere in the comment section of the users. Sell it everywhere, sell it, sell me, save me, save me, so what is it, tahi maam, tahi maam, tahi maam, it looks like these 100 people have shaken it like this. This is a market, this is a big secret, I want to tell you, these are so many in number, these are the names of the projects, I told you, there are so many available in the market, so many are available, so many are available.  Take it, then take it, take it from them because this is the region where the structure is not standing, why take it in resale? Today I am going to give a guideline to you people, listen carefully to you people, there is no benefit in resale in buying where the structure is not standing completely. You missed it earlier, now you come when the payment is done at Rs 70, then you will get a good deal and if any brother wants to give it now, then it is called distress sale, it will be sold at ₹ 1 less than the rate at which it was taken.  I am saying ₹ 1 foot, I am the minimum, it is okay, do n't think that you are a big villain, you people pay this much at the time of selling the rate, you people are like this, tell me one thing, what will you get by abusing these selling tubers and builders?  If you abuse them, it affects their health. No, you are dirty. Yes, you are dirty. Politicians are dirty. Businessmen are dirty. Brokers are dirty. YouTube is dirty. The middle class is good, the poor old man is dirty. Middle class whom he fools every time, isn't it the rate? You people have made the rates so bad. Yes, someone is needed to take the rates up. The rates of these movie tickets have also increased, don't you ever get a rupee?  Once upon a time it was available for Rs 5, it was available for Rs 400. Yes, it is not working now. Yes, it is not working. Then the rates have not reduced. You cannot go and watch any movie at Rs 0. You are so beaten down. Cinema hall Burga would be lying vacant even then.  You can't go like this and say, I will watch it in ₹, it will not be available in PVR, its ticket rate has been fixed, below that you cannot go and watch it. The restaurant in a five star hotel remains empty most of the time, but go there and you will get a coffee for Rs. 50. You will get a sandwich, you will get 0, it is empty, friend, this is not how they are sold, you have to understand that you people can also get plane tickets very cheap, even an empty plane is going, but if it is not below a limit, then it is in the market.  Focus on the supply, whether you accept the demand, FOMO is created or you can say, brother, I don't know what the demand is, there could be a lie in it, there could be a lie in the supply, go and see for yourself whether Maggi is there or not. She will be like this in a month. Look, if a lady gets pregnant then you can say that she will have a child after 9 months, then how many ladies are pregnant in India today, then according to that you can say that she is pregnant for two months.  If yes, then the child will come in 7 months or in three. Can you make some predictions exactly? Real estate is also the same thing, brother, today we can predict exactly how much supply will come in the next six years and seven years because so many projects have been launched. We can tell that whatever will be launched today, brother, it is a high rise, multi- story high rise, they are launching a golf course that will not come before 2032, because till date they have No one even gave it. I told you so well that in last 7 years, Shaper ji is taking the best, no one can be better than him, when all his other goods were also sold, in 2022, all his goods will be sold.  Even after this it takes so much time, other people have also sold a lot of goods and will sell all of them in 6-7 years, there must be some situation that the goods will not be sold in 7 years, some 50 units, 100 units, 150 units, whatever.  It will be sold gradually, sometimes Diwali discount, sometimes this discount, sometimes New Year, sometimes Happy New Year, sometimes Holi, sometimes Independence Day, all the goods, you know this payment plan, that payment plan, increased the discount, gave that discount, all the goods will be sold, sooner or later it is okay.  But you have to see how much is the supply and then take a call. If you want to buy a house and want to live in this city then don't wait, nothing is going to be cheap if it is priced at Rs 121000. If it comes, it will come near Pataudi, this Rewari Expressway of yours will open now, Pataudi Rewari Highway will come there, 121000 will come there and when that rate will be said 11 122000, then you know that in 11 122000 there is GST also, EDC is also there, IDC is also there.  There is also PLC and there are charges for intimidation and that too after getting that done. 123 will be increased to 13 and its density will also be higher because if it is above it then its FR will be 4 4.5 4.5 If the government opens it up to 4.5 then you will get the thing of 42 FR, then you will have to understand that all these things are not going to reduce now when 2 crores  Plus lows have risen in gold, so now you extrapolate what the rate is going to be on this side, right now I am saying that whoever wants to buy in resale should buy.  The structure and position is ready, you can get it within a year, you can get it within six months to one year and the next person has almost made the payment, he wants to save the cost of registration because what will he sell after getting registered, you also know the cost of registration.  It takes around 9 or even 9, as they say, but the government has added some charges to it, it is very close to 8, where it is written that it is 7.  It is also worth eight, six is ​​written where it is worth seven, so when a person wants to save, if he is getting something, then pick it up, then you will get it right, then those who sell in resale do not sell and whoever can buy is getting it.  So take this, no one is interested in the market, I have tried everything, 10000 views are not less, 10000 views are not less because only those people who are interested in the Gurgaon market are watching and those projects. I know that whoever makes it, the things go on those groups, everyone has made groups, so the sellers in them are only in single digits, I have got only single digits within the four projects, the owners are in single digits, so the rates are  Hold on to the latches that are available now and there is a lot of juice in the current pricing as well. I don't see the above price increasing much. The latches that are coming will not increase much but this gap is seeing it getting reduced.  I am talking about resale because whoever needs a house needs a house, his immediate rent is saved. His wife has said that the father-in-law had given only Rs 20 lakh to get a house for his daughter. Was it my answer or was it a gift?  Now it is not the son-in-law's choice to do theta, he has already hit 40 and his children are 12 and 14 years old, it has been 151 years of marriage and he says brother to me.  So how much are you getting? If you want to buy it in full, then there is a lot of demand in the market and the supply is very less. Check it yourself. Do n't get carried away by the feeling. Count the names of all the projects. How many are coming in 111 and which one in 12? Hey, many of the houses are lying vacant, doors have not yet been installed, mirrors have not been installed, bathrooms have not been built, sewerage has not been installed, electricity has not been installed, it will remain empty, but it has been bought by someone and there is a loan going on from his brother so that he can come into it.  Will it remain or will it be given on rent and many people are waiting for rent also and will do so and the rates will also increase as the biggest thing is the secret of Dwarka Expressway is that in one to one and a half years you will have such big offices in Arrow City. Spaces are being built, a lot of crowd of Delhi will shift to that office space and all the people with that office space will be on rent on Darka Expressway because it will be at a distance of only three to four kilometers and four to five minutes distance.  I was the one who was asking who will stay here, where are the offices coming, offices are not visible here, they will come here too in two-three years, you will see many coming to the offices, but today I saw what is being built. Told because no one is able to link it there, something is happening inside IOC Aero City, Bharat Nandana Park is happening, many things are being built, so as soon as it gets built in one two-three years, you will see all the links up.  If you see it happening then you will not get it here again  The demands will not be met and if any of you are still buyers in this project then please connect, if you are a seller then connect, I am making it again and again, you have to sell, you are scared, you are late, you are big.  If you are worried, if you are really very worried, then sell it in the market. What is the problem? If you don't come out then why can't you wait? You are in anxiety. Yes, the builder is dirty. Who am I saying? All builders are dirty, all businessmen are dirty. All the people who earn money are dirty, everyone is dirtier than anyone else, only those who do these jobs, this middle class is good, so now tell me, now you are good and all these are dirty, now tell me what to do, tell me what to do, you know.  It's gone, it's cleared, yes now peace has come, no, politicians are also dirty, actors are also dirty, all the rich people are dirty, all are taking advantage, everyone has increased the rates, so you who are sitting after buying, be patient, there are many people from groups. Now inside I am the same, there is fraternity but there are many people who do property work, live in groups, they have also bought and it is as if the definition is not mine, I am feeling that I am telling my definition is fine and these people  This kind of frustration is spread. It is very easy to spread frustration. The sky has fallen, the sky has fallen, the sky has fallen. Start speaking, start speaking loudly, start speaking again and again. If published in newspapers, if the sky has fallen, then people will  You will start running somewhere without any hope and you don't know where you will go if the sky falls down then where will you be left but you will see that it happens in that also and that much makes a difference, a little sales come, that much breath comes in any project.  Do it, some of you people say whether it is easy to increase or decrease the rate in the project, you tell me is it easy or listen to the stories, I can increase or decrease the rate by speaking, there is no point in decreasing it, anything, four stories.  Tell me, whatever story is not a false story, it is absolutely right, tell me, he will check, yes, it is like this, ideally, the market has priced it, the market knows everything, people do not know at the individual level, like there is a share market.  So they are proud of the market, all the stories, when Covid came, the market fell very badly and when in reality people were dying in 2000, the next year when the delta wave came and so many people were dying then the market was rising, why?  The market has released 1 2 But we will die, the market is emotionless, we are all emotionless, we will also have greed, we will also have fear, we will have many emotions, but the market is not like this, the market runs only on demand and supply. There is always a saying that no matter who will sell, people are sitting with patience. In the long run, the money will transfer from the patient investor to the patient one. Your Charlie Manger is a very intelligent man, a patient person, and all the patient people will give him money, everyone will give him money, all brother sir, it is not possible for us, hi hi hi hi hi, go and talk to the company, hi hi, you have to do it. Take a little bit, he is also not refusing but take the help of RERA and this is not good, there is no benefit from this, we have confidence in it, so what will happen to you, what will happen due to that, he will get defamed, even if he gets defamed, he will be famous.  Have you been here?  Do n't think it is making any difference and are getting even more lazy, now do what you will do and that thing will be made, by the time there will be an uproar, someone will take cognizance, the thing will be made, you have reduced the rate to 00 by complaining, just think this, when the builder gives you the goods.  So the goods are yours now, what do people think? People think of it like Ola scooter, they think that Kamra has spoken and its servicing is not good, its lion has fallen, it is not like that here, this is real estate, it is you.  Is that a scooter?  There is something worth 20 30 50 thousand one lakh, it has got spoiled, it has become infamous, something has happened, the story is real, this is a project, brother, it is yours, he has sold it, you are the owner, he is going to paint it and tile it in six months.  Keep calm, what is the delay, is it off course, should there be resentment from the builder, should there be any ruckus, should it be created, but take the help of RERA because wherever you will be high, many people will make videos of it and will harass you 20 kilometers away for their own benefit.  They will give you 000 feet expensive thing and say this one is good and then you will say yes yes this one is good 20 kilometers away it is 000 feet expensive and this is what is happening, we see it every day because what is new is good, old is useless, new is good, old.  Useless, move forward, hold back, leave behind, hold forward, leave behind, all the projects behind are better, I am telling this to the coming ones, all the coming ones are dense and what is this density, you will know yourself one day when you will be okay and someone else.  There is no choice, these will also be sold, those will also be sold, patience is ok, so you will have to apply your mind in many things and every person who is in the market is on the other side, like in this case, we seem to be on this side, it seems that we are You are bowling, you are a batsman, okay, so the bowler will not be asked to bowl fast, he will have to do the batting, put your feet properly, put the bat properly, put the helmet properly, put the L guard, put your elbow guard.  Get involved and learn a little batting, it is not a choice, you will not get anything by crying, no government is going to come here and say that free electricity, free water, free house, free house, government, this is my video that brother, real estate is high in India and will remain.  What is the dynamics of high end and why is it there? Only the middle class is crying in this too. Actually the rich do not cry. The more rich are the more rich, flats worth Rs. 100 crores are coming. All the dhalias of DLF will be booked just once. Such news will come, how many were all sold out? Goods worth Rs. 32000 crores were sold out in two days, we didn't even know who were who, who are who, then they will remain and then they will be resold and it will be published in the newspaper after 5 years.  And the one worth 100 crores was also sold for 150 crores, then you or who has so much money, this is also a different story, so I hope you all understood.

    "title": "Where Should You Do Property Investment In Present Times ？ [7Zrbq1vREyM].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, property investment in today's times, June 24th is the time and I have been conducting my workshop for a long time webinars on this but today I want to share this opinion with you people through video, if you are interested in Indian real estate  If you want to invest in today 's time, then before investing in some things, I would like to tell you where not to invest, I will tell you that please do not invest in commercial, any commercial, any commercial, okay and in office also in this  I don't want to do it, now they will say oh no no, look at the performance of the top three REITs of India for the last 5 years, look at their vacancy rates, there is Brookfield, there is Embassy Group, there is Mind Space and their rental lands are coming just at 66 and a half.  Only and no capital appreciation has happened in all three of them, one or two are incurring losses since the last four years, so this is the condition of our best of the best commercial, so speculatively it is very good, residential has not performed  Very well rental earnings have gone up but now if we look at investment in Gurgaon market then we will find very less things now because everything has become costly for 4, 5, 6 years so normal common man feels proud out, so for you people  There will be some options. I will stay in Bangalore. I will stay in Pune. I will stay in Chennai. I will stay in Kolkata. You will have to take a pick. I know it's very difficult for a North Indian to tell his father that I am staying in Pune. In Bangalore, he will say Bawdi.  He has asked if he ever stays there then who will take care of him, this is a webinar, I will give you answers to these four questions, you can join, inside the comment section you will find a webinar info group, there is no choice, tell father, papa, 70 lakhs, 80 lakhs  If you can get me some property somewhere else then buy a plot, yes buy the plot in Jind, what is the rate there and what will be the rental amount there and what will be the session, where should I buy, buy in Hisar, buy in Rohtak Where will Faridkot, Firozpur buy, Samastipur, Ballia, Ara's one will buy, where will Supal's one take, what will they take, you tell me where will Robertsganj's one take, where will Basti's one take, where will Amroha's one take, the people there who have come to the big cities and do not want to go to UP and Bihar How many people want to settle in Fatehabad? You tell me, there is no place in Haryana that belongs to that place but do you want to settle there? Will your job not be there? My parents are staying there but their assets are already there, so where will you buy now? 60 Your budget is 70-80 lakhs, so the things in your budget are not available in the cities where you want to buy it and you already have pathological property in your pathological city, so in the coming time you people will have to understand these things.  In the coming time, property management firms will come up, there is Zolo, Nestaway, Stanly, Oyo Life and many such startups are coming up. In the next three to four to five years, top builders will start their own Vertical management firms are going to do this, it will do good to the real estate sector, these things already happen in America and Canada, they only manage, rent out, do this, do that, they do the same work across, I live on one side, property is on the other side of Gurgaon  That too is managed by someone, no one goes there himself, so today that property is in Pune, Ahmedabad, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, anywhere, it can be managed, this is a good place  You have bought it at a good ticket size, yes it is not easy to earn money, yes this decision making will have to be done and yes a lot of people are taking it and they are benefiting because the rental leads are high there, the properties become cash flow positive, the payment plans are very good and the properties  Are not speculative you will get a return of 10 to 12 per cent in absolute returns since your money goes like 25 per year over further years your returns will be 16 to 70 per cent if you  Do it on single you still don't sell them you hold them and then the capital appreciation even it falls down to 789 per which is inflation linked then the rental rate of 5 to 6 per kicks in yes 5 to 6 per then the combined return is  still 13 14 but initially it was 18 but you put this on Excel 15 years it became 15 at ah I spoke English like this I did this Excel Shiksha Shiksha I didn't see anything so that's why it is for only those people who understand the things because  I am not going to explain everything here, I am not going to get into an argument, mutual fund is right for you, go and invest in mutual fund, a boy in mutual fund tells me, Guruji, you are absolutely right about mutual fund, I am 29 years old, 10 times  My piggy bank has broken, he says she doesn't go away, he says it would have been better if I had bought a house by now because who sends me a room, bathroom or something like that.  He asks that I sent one kitchen sink, I needed it, the Gulak does not break, nor the Ulka of real estate does not break, if you bought it then take it from him, then when the rental comes you can do anything with that rental, invest in mutual funds  You can do it, you can pay EMI, you can get income tax rebate, all the work can be done and then you can buy many, many properties with that. This is how Robert Gasa has bought 15,000 properties, it is the same model, get rich and follow it.  Do it, it is not as directly easy as it is in America, but brother, it is not possible to have 15,000 rupees, but you can definitely have 15 properties in 15 years, I am also promising this much towards this, I am teaching many things, soon I am launching a ramp to  Real estate mentoring program where I teach real estate, the fees are quite high, the course is of two hours, there is one class, there will be seven to eight to nine such classes, if you want to join it, you can get a very good education in real estate of India.  You can become a consultant, you can become number two or three, one I will be there, two three, if any of my students will be there then you can also become one, so everything is taught and understood in it because that is very important for you people to join that  Of course you will be witness to 70 to 100 crores worth of real estate transaction in your own life of your own people that is you, yourself, your parents, your in-laws, your relatives, your brothers, your children, your own transactions like say you sold a flat worth 2 crores then  When I bought it, it became a transaction of Rs 4 crore. My father 's property worth some 1.5 crore was sold. Then I bought something worth 1 crore, so it became a transaction of 2.5 crore. In the next 40 years, whoever is listening to me right now and whose age is less than 40 and  You are listening to me now, in the next 40 years you will see transactions of 80, 90, 100 crores, so if you learn about it well then  How much value is it for your money, so whoever wants to join for rum two, my course is going to start this month, you can write rump two, two because one is already done, so this is a real estate mentoring program, where in you can start earning  There will be hundreds of benefits from knowing real estate but you will learn to earn from real estate. You will stand out in the market. These will not be the people who move around, meaning your level will become very high. You may even get a job, I do not guarantee that you will get one at that level.  I am not doing it but your level will be much higher than those who work in real estate, it will be much higher, it will be practical, I will tell you that thing, otherwise give a guarantee of just one thing that we will leave this world and go away, does anyone else give any guarantee other than this  So he is giving wrong information, so I am not giving any guarantee, I am not telling you what the syllabus is, I am just saying that you will become great, that's all I am telling you, people say no, no, tell me the syllabus, course content, course content is the biggest money earner  That is it, I told you that, I will take money for telling you that, you want to hear the course content, what was taught, explained. I will take money for that also and I will take only that much money as the course fees, so just attend the course, okay now you have a big attitude friend, yes yes, a little bit happens a lot, what to do because it is a leap of faith  This is a thing which no one is teaching or telling, this kind of thing is not available in the market, I explain it practically and you will not find a single slide in the whole course, think that you will find some study material or you will find slides  You will not get it either, this is also a guarantee, it is completely desi, I will speak exactly as I am speaking, yes, if you make notes, you will definitely get the recording, you will definitely get the recording and you can make your own notes and you can make them again from the recording, so I hope this is a good opportunity  There is some opportunity to learn in the summer, everyone can join, thank you very much, go for properties which are less than one CR, this is the advice, go for properties which are less than one CR, if you find a good builder in a good location in a good city, then get a good builder look you can't go color in them no no who is like that  You will take care of it, you will see, earning money is never easy, people work in a job of Rs. 40,000 from morning till evening for 30 days and then 365 days, so if there is a property that is getting appreciated, then sometimes one will have to go there also, it can be taken care of through technology And when a person buys a property, he feels stressed and when he buys 101, then that work gets done automatically, so instead of buying 101 CRs at one place, if he wants to buy one place for investment, then he should buy one CR at each place from five places.  can be bought for Rs. 10000 or for Rs. 80 lakhs at seven places. They can be sold anytime. Liquidity is high. Rents also increase quickly because they are at the bottom of the pyramid. By fully furnishing the properties, good rents are also obtained.  So subscribe to the channel, like it, you can write a ramp to the given number, if you want to join the real estate mentoring program and want to attend the channel's info webinars which are free, then you will get an info in the comment section  You will get a webinar group, you can join it. Thank you very much."

    "title": "Where To Buy Property If You Are In A Transferable Job ？ [I4yEcbtX2yo].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, this is a very important video, especially for those people who are in transferable jobs, due to any reason they are not able to stay at one place, they have to go to different places and there are many such people, they are inside the corporate, they are in government jobs, they are youngsters.  You may be in your 20s or you may be in your 30s. Real estate is very important for decision making. I want to give you one information. Please understand carefully where you will be.  After a year, you don't necessarily know that you may be in different places, be it a big city or a small town. You don't even have an idea where you want to settle. So when you do n't have an idea where to settle, where to settle, then you can take your mutual fund.  If you try to play fund mutual fund, then the up cycle of real estate is going on and the boom is going on and the pan is hot and will remain hot, it will not wait for you, then what to do, let me tell you a strategy.  to the people  In this strategy, you people do not agree, how much do you make, let us tell you, you are a group officer in the government, who is of my core audience level or you work in a corporate, basically your salary is above 80 thousand.  It is one lakh and a half lakh, quarter lakh, two and a half lakh, two and a half lakh and maybe your wife and husband also work, then the eligibility increases a little further, then you should see.  That is, if you are from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, I am taking your name here, that is why I have to say that normally I do not like it, but if you want to give clarity, then you will have to tell openly and you come from backward districts there and you have no intention of going there and settling.  Maybe you are from Basti, you are from Samastipur, you are from Arrah, you are from Munger, you are from Ballia, you are from Supaul, you are from Mirzapur, you are from Robert Ganj, you do not want to go because your children will not study or work there or your  If you don't feel like it, there could be any reason, then which place will you buy property? The question is, I will also help in the answer. You want to buy in Gurgaon, you want to buy in Delhi, maybe you have run out of your budget, you are in Pune.  You can buy it in Ahmedabad but you have nothing to do there. You can buy it in Bangalore, you have nothing to do with it. You can buy it in Chennai. You can buy it in Kolkata. If you have nothing to do there then I would suggest. If you are on North Indian setup then  Pune is one good option for you people and there are products which are in the category of 80-90 lakhs and in the category of 1.25 crores where the money will go easily in 4 years. You can see that as soon as you say this proposal to your wife, the wife will say, 'Hey, we are here, you are here'.  Do n't know if you want to stay there then why are you buying it? Hey Madam, because the gold rate is increasing, the set you want to buy is not made or you don't know about it or it is not in your budget.  Because it is worth seven tolas to you, the budget of your husband is four tolas but gold is running away, so it is better to buy something rather than not buying. After 10, 15, 20 years, when there will be some decision making, then we will sell something.  You can sell, you can do something, it will become an athlete, it will become an inflationary time, notes are being printed under pressure and the value of money is decreasing, the government will suppress spending for elections. Interest rates are also coming, they may go down even further, nothing will come of money and everyone is taking it, now you need to take a little, there you belong to a place where you cannot take it, do not want to take it, will not take it and where to take it.  You do n't know that as a result, if you are not able to get anywhere then that asset is going through cycle. I have made a facility for this. If you go to the comment section, you will get a telegram group about my real estate. You join it.

And real for you people, you will know the price and nothing else, sister, there is no cost to watch, neither does a window shopper, he can come and see that projects and products. Where is K Rate Across India because there is no stock exchange near you? CNBC came and the ticker is moving below N P 3200 reliance1. There is no way, it is I who will tell you, open all your diaries.  There is a journey of real estate education on which you have to remain constant. Don't sleep like this, you will wake up in three months. Hey, so much has happened, you were getting so much now, so stay in the journey because when?  When your luck runs out, your father-in-law's heart falls on you and he says, Son, you have been keeping my daughter with so much love for so many years, then you should get some reward, it may happen that sometimes you have to be prepared, father-in-law 's mood is good.  Whether it is my father's, whether I get any bonus, if any lottery opens, then I should know something somewhere or whether I will go to get education on that day, first of all brother, which thing do I want to buy, now you tell me, then explain, then we are poets. Convincing is a process because when you have been in real estate for many years, in knowledge, when you see what I always call phenomenon, be always in the market, buy, not buy, always be in the market, you should know what is happening, where, what.  What is the rate, how much is the appraised, how much is the density, how much is the carpet, how much is the rental, how much is the rental yard, what is the story, what is the under construction, is the payment plan, is it made, is it branded.  It is unbranded, everything should be known, all the cities should be known because in future, property management firms will come in the big way in India, America, Canada and everyone lives there, these are some of the names, go and check yours, it is JOLO, it is Stan, it is living, it is NEST. Away is Oyo life, you will find many like this and write about them. They are coming. Earlier some came in bachelor living, now some are coming in young couple living. They take it on rent. Apps will come, a lot of things are coming, so there is no problem, like if you buy shares, then to buy shares of such a relay, you go to their factory, it is a big company, it has industrial units, so you buy it and that is all over India.  If you are working then in the same way now it is not necessary that in the future, if you want to buy a property then your situation should be such that you should buy it there because the rentals are good in big cities, the appreciation is good and Buying property in a big city will become impossible in the future, you can buy it in a small one, you can buy it in a small one by selling it at any time, but you cannot buy property in a small city and buy it in a big city, so when you people who  You are roaming here and there in transferable jobs and you don't know which one should I take, what should I take, why should I take, how should I take, then all these things will be explained to you very well.

    "title": "Where You Should Not Buy Property In Present Times ？ [QZs0Lt5fWK0].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, do you know from today's time what activity has happened 5-6 days ago, the announcement has been made, as a result of which some people are making mistakes in real estate investment, one of which has been seen is that they are investing money in small shares in Haryana. From the beginning, I will tell you how to check your things in any statement and what mistakes you should not make. I will tell you why there is a tax on putting it in small letters. Brother, the circle rate is 18-19-20000.  70 80 90 thousand means you have understood, everyone is intelligent, you subscribe to me, he is above the intelligent, a hint is enough for the intelligent, some of you are in between genius and intelligent, so you have understood what is that, but now what is that?  There are some places where there is a feeling but the fact of life is its value. I am telling you from the example of that small town of Haryana which is not on GT Road. Do you know which one is on GT Road? Gurgaon is the best and the best lion of Haryana, but you are going to these small lions, dishonest Hisar and this belt, Jind, Jind and this Sir, whatever is yours here, is going to you. Note worth it, the population of those lions is coming in your future.  There is less honey, there is no increase, already you can check how many there were in 2011 census and now whose data of elections has not come, you can go to the Election Commission's site and see the water. Take it because through elections you can also get to know the total water of the district, look at the city, look at the city, there is one left which is coming a little from the village, but there people of 22 to 40 years of age are missing in these lions. Retired people will go, old people will live among the lions and there is no growth of the city. According to the population, it is realistic that so many plot cats have been given, so many plot cats have been given, people 55 thousand 60 thousand.  65000 70 thousand 7580 A options are being made, Hooda's plots are being made, HSVP is being made according to what he says and people are taking it, that is, everything in the option has to be given clean, still the rates are so much, the program of the other one is also going on completely. And they are becoming very satisfied because people are saying that yes, this is the rate, there is no underlying value in it, so brother, the rent is your one floor of 10 marl.  It comes to Rs 10,12,000 and the rent of one room in Gurgaon which you must have seen in the old society is Rs 20 to 25,000 in the golf course, that is a camera of EWS, please do not put it in the small shares which are available wherever you are.  I am hearing that economic activity will increase in big cities only by holding big cities and it is safe. In every small city you can buy the middle of a big city at any time and small towns at any time. 500 yards in a small city, 250 in a big city in the middle, you cannot buy 250 yards in a top city, you know about this thing, so this opportunity you have got for investment is a black swan event.  Taking advantage of what has happened, you should do research where you can start investing money, but these are the top 10 cities of India, whatever you like, according to your community, according to the colloquialism, according to your very belonging to you.  According to South India, West India, North India, please do this city thing and don't spend money on stories and small lions. As the villages are getting emptied, migration from small lions to big lions will also go on, at least it will not go down from the state capital.  Less than 1 and one is my WhatsApp group, I will post it to you at the top of the comment area, there I understand these things in more detail, I understand them according to the data, I understand by looking at a few more stars, I answer your queries, then you  You can join that also Thank You Very Match"

    "title": "Which Builder's Project Should You Invest In？ [DeK8av5SdtQ].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, this is a very simple small topic, which builder 's goods should you buy in Gurgaon real estate, then the very simple consistent advice is buy only from listed players, in the entire Gurgaon real estate, I can't think more than one person's name, builder who is not listed.  I do n't know if someone will come in the future but those who are going to buy, they are also listed. I don't take the name of builders for deliberation. I have explained its reasoning earlier in a half video, there are many builders in the listed space, they operate in every ticket size, there are those from Bombay, there are those from South, there are those from North, all of them are comfortable, take any of them, don't take from anyone else.  Because which property will you be taking first? You will be taking the second one. Beat your hands, you will be taking the third one and the fourth one. If he is taking more than the fourth one then he is the same wise man who has already taken four. He does not need more.  On the basis of guidance, why go to someone else because the risk reward ratio is not favourable, some projects are coming towards New Gurgaon, some of the builders are not going to build, they do not have the strength to build, but that is that now when the real estate  If the donkey is running, the horse is lame, the donkey is lame, the horse is lame, everyone is running in pieces, it is very difficult to recognize them because there is a lot of dust, everyone is running, everyone is walking, so now  If you don't know this then I am saying stay on the horses only, there is no need to go on the donkey also and the lame pitcher is the donkey and the lame horse is the lame horse, the one who used to be a builder is lying dead, the banker is blacklisted but is sitting with the land parcel.  If it is a donkey, then you know what a donkey is. Okay, and I told you about a lame horse. A lame horse is one which was once good but is no longer good because it belonged to a different time.  It belonged to another era, now it has nothing to do with it, so don't go towards those builders, the horses of today are listed, then there is one more half builder whom I can say is also good but his is a limited one.  There is only one project in residential, there is only one project of that builder, there is no one else, which builder is it, keep his name, everyone's GK is also tested, many of my subscribers' GK is good, okay, let me tell you immediately.  There is only one in the comment section, according to me, I don't see the other one as of now. Those who are coming to Gurgaon reality are also listed, so be safe, be with listed players, other wise, risk reward ratio is not favorable.  People will come and say, I am a new player, give me a chance brother, no, it is not necessary, okay, first of all, I will not take the example and the next one will be okay, so it is clear to you.  I told you, now don't ask again and again, first of all ask the question, is he a listed player? Hey, there are many products of listed players and more are coming too. If I count, then according to me you guys also write the names. According to me, there are eight or nine listed players.  Listed in Gurgaon Real Estate which means it is listed on the stock market, it is eight or nine, according to me, if you can be 10, 11, 10, then it is okay, that means there are eight and nine, okay, as many as you are. Count them and that is their bathare, their bathare projects are already being built, are being launched, are about to be launched, so it is not that there is no choice, so when there is a choice, then just stick to them, don't go anywhere else, thank you."

    "title": "Which Floor To Buy In High Rise Project ？ [4fYdtjIrtCA].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today's topic will be real estate, high rise is very bikini, people take high range in big lions, so the topic is which floor you should select in a high, this is a tricky thing, I want to tell because before that I tell which one should be taken.  I would like to tell you that whenever a project is designed and its different towers are launched and you know that today all the towers are not launched at once, RERA will be available for three different towers if there is a tower outside.  And that's the dear time, the project is divided in eight years, first face to face, then in six years, then it is divided like this, now you have to select the tower and it is a matter of selecting and selecting the floor, so when the builder He also makes it in such a way that whenever you are standing there selling goods and I am a salesman or someone is a salesman, he tells you something good about any thing and you tell him the bad things and he tells you something.  ok tell me  So if you want to do the floor, like you will have to see the fencing in the floor because it is note about that I want the eighth floor, you have to see the fencing also, now Facebook because whatever is available, you want the fencing on the middle floor, it is fine.  I am not getting anything, I am not getting anything in this, it should be in the bill B direction, if you want sunlight, then you will not get a view, if you get a view, then there will be no sunlight in it, this is also a fact, but still who  To take a look, I am telling you the latest trends of what is happening in North India. Historically, there used to be PLCs on Loris which were on the lower floors and in Mumbai, they were on the upper floors. In Mumbai, there used to be garbage disposal the higher up.  When I used to go there, there was less sound, I got to see that much view and I got to see the sea, if the sea is fenced, like Mumbai, if I talk about West Side, then what is there, who can see above, then there it used to be like below. their noise  Sharavata used to be in North India, it was the opposite, now this thing is changing in the North also, in the North also people are moving upwards that if they want to live in high rise then they should go to high rise because there are many people who live in low rise, even nowadays  Those on the first floor are also a story, go and enjoy them, if you are okay then you want to see it in the big high rise, I will tell you some facts, the ambient show comes on the first, second and third floor, so when you reject it, you will be told.  Keiji  These are our windows which are sound proof, so that thing will be destroyed by your mother. Then you will be told that if you are taking 10th or 12th floor, then take 6th floor. Even out of 10th, it is very good to have 12th floor because the mosquitoes come till the 8th and 7th floor. After that, flies and mosquitoes do not come. Even if someone comes in the lift, it flies away, goes left or right. After 14 15 floors, the sound should be absolutely band. Below, the sound should be less. Serenity is flooding in your mind, as if you are listening to me right now, do it like this and do it like this, complete relaxation blossoms, okay and if you go above that, then your view is that after 12 14 15 floor, if there is dust and dirt.  The story is flying about the road and it also does not reach the top, it also remains below it for 100 feet by 50 feet, so it does not go much above it, so this is an advantage, now people call it middle floor.  If we say middle floor becomes 20 to 25 then what kind of middle floor is it and people say higher lower because when the floors are changing now which middle floor is kept inside Burj Khalifa? Lower floor is good and it has lower floor too.  The floor will be reached in 40m 30. Okay, so you have understood what is the height to be. Many people will say that due to concentration, if we go to the balcony, we will feel dizzy.  I don't get that dizzy today, I will tell you the reason for it, it is hanging in the air, but if it is not, then if it was supposed to be earlier, it was a building, then it used to have open balconies like the ones in houses in Hooda sectors or see, you are in the balcony.  Standing left is also visible and such a feeling of having legs has come, it happens in the old society too, but the one which is being built today is also covered here, so you are feeling like education has not been done here, otherwise this camera too. if he could become  If you have got a camera type feeling then you do n't feel dizzy and on top of that the height of the railing has been immediately increased to 1/2 feet, so when the railing is up to the chest, it does n't feel like a brother to you and that too I can tell you in detail that  The pot is 6 feet by 5.5 feet, so keep the lotus near the railing, so do not touch the railing like this, if you stay 1 foot behind, then this angle has less relief, so I do not feel dizzy. Parents come to the consultation and they feel dizzy. I told them, 'Brother, this is not the case, first you get it, in the beginning it seems strange again, after that, it seems good, so those who have been filled with maternal uncles for the first time.  If it is okay in Kalkaji on the second floor of Delhi or in Greater Kailash or Kahaani, now she is coming here, in the 25th floor, then mom will definitely feel the initials, but those initials are taken two-three times in the plane.  It feels there for the first time too, after that when the man becomes her then I am telling this way of doing it to her, I am telling you this way of doing it to my mother, my mother's height is 5.5 feet, 5:30, so she should be tall, her height is 5 feet, the railing is 4:30 feet.  If it is there then it means that you will have to make efforts if you want to go through it. If the story is fine then there are no such issues. Higher floors are going to be preferred in the coming time. Youngster hair floors will be preferred.  Youngsters are preferring, these days they feel primitive, if you do chillam chilli, then there is not much noise on the story of their caste, nor theirs, it has also been seen, it is okay and privacy is also there, it is okay on the upper floor.  People like it, okay then more premium will remain in higher floors in the coming times and personally, even if I do n't tell you normally, I also prefer higher floors, but let the project be a project, think can change also. Defending on, if you are taking the inner one, then if you want to see the beauty of the swimming pool and the garden in the inner and then give fourth, fifth floor, if you do not see the benefit of taking above the sixth floor, then you should take the higher floor, you have to take inner fencing. Look at it, there are two types of environment, there is the control environment, there is the control environment inside the project, what you are seeing is not changing, that means, that is the swimming pool, that is the club house, that is the garden.  That's a park. Children are playing. That view is always going to remain the same. The view outside is going to keep changing. The landscape will keep changing. Sometimes something has gone, sometimes something has gone, sometimes something has gone. Sometimes you are not very noisy. Anything can happen, it's okay, it's a surprise.  There is no smell of any kind above 10 to 12 floors, if someone's drain is going nearby or some other issues are happening, above the eighth floor those issues start happening. Okay, if there is no sound then I do n't know about the uncontrolled environment outside today, I do n't know what will happen tomorrow and if my view gets blocked then the thing above height is safe if you are taking it outside.  If you are taking it inside then you can take it lower because what is there inside, many people, as I have seen the story, have very good condom rules, all the constructions inside, the banks which are ready on Dwarka Expressway, where some people are also living now in their second  third floor  On which stadium tax is visible and swimming pool is visible and tell me in which stadium the stadium is built. If the GK question is ok then it looks very much like love because it is visible with IB then the concentration is that if you want to enjoy the inside.  If it is your case, then take lower floor, it is fine, maximum up to middle level, and if you want to hire a higher one, then look outside or look at the sunlight. It is okay and among the things in the list, one think builder is established to make such a thing.  One floor will not make such a tower that the view can be seen, the sunlight can be seen and the fun can also be done and that means the controlled environment should also be there and the direction should also be right, the whole thing will take a minute because when you come, you will criticize it, friend, this is not in it.  Then he will say, Sir, look at it, this or that is there, but Sir, if this is not there, then it is a created thing like this, this is called brain, okay, you will not get all the things in one, you will have to choose, but  Today If there is a three side open flat then there are issues of sunlight and direction and views till date. Till today the builder is of the same company and says that Sir, something is visible from the drawing room, you are seeing something from the bedroom, he is seeing something from the hair done.  There the sunlight will come in the morning, there it will come in the evening, from there it will be visible from here, this will be visible from there, that is visible, so most of the artists are making it like this, so yes, this is a mean factor and according to me, there is no factor, this is also a factor, okay? because many  Whether you get something or the other is also very important, but if you are getting it against choice, then it is a different matter. Adverwise, there is not much difference because the builder has given something or the other in everything and you bill one or the other.  You bill low sum means if you are tightening a floor then I will point out five shortcomings in it then when your moral becomes low then I will tell you five good things then your mood will become good again this means this should be things are plant understand this  Needed  Of clarity and I am number one in India, I will tell this thing, other wise people will not tell in this way, if there is anything wrong then it will be good then you are jumping too much in it, if only good will be told, then this is what happens.  It is made like this, that perfect thing which you want to tick all over, you will not get it, thank you."

    "title": "Why Comparing Projects In Gurgaon Real Estate Is Futile Exercise ？ [_Rxvrw_nBZU].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, comparison between projects in Gurgaon real estate is a very interesting topic, it is going to be a lot of fun and maybe again after this, some Uber has been released recently, so we were comparing, which project is out and which one is upcoming.  If it is okay to go to the board and give such numbers, then I am going to explain to the public, full and final, never ask for comparison, the result is fixed, India's number one real estate is telling clearly.  And I am also saying to all the users who also work in real estate and this youtube1 say no yes, this high moral ground is good for the public, hence you have to win over only those whose goods are to be sold now, then come straight and say, this is good.  Whatever we sell is good. I was talking to someone in sales long ago, I was in a very dear position, I was also asking him the same thing, then I got a straight answer and I will be learning the same thing in life forever.  It is good that we are selling now, so the result should be the same. Please do not waste your time by clicking on these videos. Take the example of that video and let me tell you further. Brother, two projects are being compared in these companies.  The projects are of different genres, one is a horror movie and the other is a rom com, how can you compare them brother, if both are rom coms then they can be compared, action pictures can be done in their own way.  You can say that this fighter picture is from India and that from Top Gun is from a foreign country, which one is better, even then both of them have Jhajhu added, both are action, both have the same background, so you can compare. How will you compare Dilwale Dhulia Le Jaaoge with Pathan? The actor is same but the genre is not the same. If you understand what I am saying then no one is telling that brother uncle second transit.  There is a TTO project and a transit corridor, its FR is not being disclosed. Everyone knows it. Look, when he comes, brother, he makes a video. I may call myself number one and say all this is fine, but everyone is evil, everyone is intelligent. He comes near RERA as if he puts it on the side, it is not rocket science, I have taught all these things, I have only told you, my subscribers also watch others' videos and should watch them otherwise. How will we know who is number one? Like this, anyone can come and say something in the comment section and everywhere else they will write density, so tell me, the point of your use in the game of Madari has been hidden. The point of your use in the game of Madari has been hidden and on the rates.  Well, someone should declare it. Brother, the other's rate is 177000, please tell me something and brother, if it comes back to 1514, then that too will be very good. I will tell you today.  I am going to tell you the full and final truth in one go, completely clear project. Which is the best project? Yes, the best one is the one which came 2 years to three years ago. The density was also low, the location was also good, the price was also good, but did you not take it? Yes, or did you take it?  So, whether you are very happy or you have not taken it, now which is the next good which is there today and after that which will be good which will come tomorrow, which will be launched tomorrow, that is good, it will be better than the one which will come the day after tomorrow, it will be better because in the growing bullish market.  things are moving i sink  Inflation is taking place, the rooms will become smaller, the sizes will become smaller, brothers and sisters, the rate ticket size is hanging there somewhere, everyone's stories should be made. Someone else had also sent to me that it is easy to make stories. It is easy to make stories. Yes, there are stories.  Make one, I also tell you, but it is difficult to make a story in which there is no hole, even a small baby can tell the story. Papa, Papa, I will tell you a story. No matter what you are telling, the story should be a super hit that everyone will agree with. brothers  Sisters, it should not happen that we become like this in four years, in which there can be no holes in the story. And I do not claim that with number one clarity, I will tell such a story of mine in which no one can make holes in it and I myself can make 50 holes in my own story.  And then I can fill those 50 holes, only then you become number one, when you play chess from both the sides, whichever side you play, the side wins, you people have to understand that any project which has come earlier is better.  We will know when we are ready What is your density? Go and see how they were built in Sector 89, how are they visible now, those four storeys that came up, oh I used to say at that time also, Azimo Shan Shahenshah, in such a row, in such a row, 50 plots here, 50 plots here.  Four here, four here, 200 kich kich kich, they will shake hands like this, from back to front, you go and see, but they will also do well, I am also telling you, now I have told the story, I have made a hole in the story, now I have made a hole in the story.  I am filling Dispina Sale This Them second thing I am going to tell and announce in my coming days are the old projects which are a little old meaning the position has not come but it has been sold for a long time now, the inventory is all over. Regarding those projects, I had promised the builder that I will bring them but you will not see them for a long time. My aim is not to do social service here. My general aim is not to help the people coming here. Those who have bought other things. Because my address is for those people because no one is asking those who have bought it, everyone says yes send it brother send it send it oh why send it execution risk is over location good builder good thing good got the product visible  Have sold it after you said that you are enjoying it or you have to place it in the next one, this is the problem, otherwise I will bring those videos wherever you guys have taken them, write them in the comment section. Some of my thoughts in the coming two days, in three-four days, they will be visible to you or very soon, they will be visible very soon, they will be yellow and blue colored thumbnails, take a look at them brother, do n't ask again on time, after that then they will be visible.  This will happen again and again for my paid members. I want to tell all the YouTubers and all the people who work in real estate that please have a mask of a professional and not a social reformer. None of us are social reformers. Doing all this, I don't do it like this, friend, don't do it, I am telling everyone, this is capital, brother, this is what you understand, you have to take it, tell me the chance, 15 minutes, gun, next, next, builder, everyone is doing like this, if it is a bullish market then it is the same man.  Who will be able to take a decision, the window shopper who has been here for two, four, five or six years will suddenly sleep like this and will keep turning, brother, you tell me which is the best, you tell me by comparison.  Tell me how to compare, brother, you are getting only 4 BH in one, big BH's are available in one, you are getting 2 BH in one, why are you doing comparison, you are an SUV, 500 is a car, you know BMW 320d brother, this is  So it is small, you are buying desi ghee, what if you are comparing desi ghee with what, gold and silver are all different genera neither by weight nor by weight.  You are doing it according to volume, according to size, according to brand, according to location, when people do comparison in a city, I say, why are you a little foolish? Someone says that this location is the supposed one.  Let me grab the location here, grab a location here and try to explain it to you by embellishing it with extreme expressions. Okay, is there any property in Chandni Chowk, Delhi knows, we are in Bhidi Gali, brother, reach like this.  There is trouble anywhere and there is a property in Neemrana, there is a 200 meter road in front of it, I have made it 200 meters, it is a very good location, Neemrana is fine, so which property is good, tell me brother, 200 meter approach is open, such a big location, so I am Neemrana.  That look, I am taking it to the top of the differentiable, now I bring these two examples to one city like this, I bring them to one city like this  Now there is a location at some place, there is a location at a different place, it is a different part of Gurgaon, it is a let's buy or in some city, it is a different part, now the property is exactly the location, it is more important or the approach is more important.  Everything is important but sometimes someone says that suppose someone is in Connaught Place and it is the center of the city, then someone says where are you going to go if there is jam here too.  It seems that only 15-20 minutes are left, so that's it, there are more properties like this here which are some good ones and you will see them in the coming time, to take you out into the open, to a distance of 25-50 kilometers.  Here I am not showing any property below or above, I am giving it as an example. Everyone who comes will sing praises of which one to take and how to take it. I will also give a clear cut video on that and explain it well. In Gurgaon, many people ask me which builder to hire without taking his name, ' Master, you are the builder because everyone takes the name of the projects and takes the name of the builder. I say, I don't want to share the name of the builder publicly.  Take and say, why don't you take? I said, I will not take it for free and I will not take it even by taking money. If I take money, then take money. Then it is not your credibility. And without taking money, why recommend someone, why do your work silently for free?  Own your business, by the way, tell people about free funds, NRIs sitting outside, sitting here, they think that youtube1 channel has been made, this is the upcoming launch, next six, next five, next six, next five, next six, next four, next five, then each one, each one.  Then the previous one was this one, the next one is good, this one is good, that one is good, this one is good, all the customers are sitting like this, seeing which one.  And it is going to be good and it is going to be good, the decision is taken quickly, with this you have to relieve all those who are listening, first of all you have to see your money, what is my actual status and what is the requirement if you want to live in a 4 BHK.  If there is a requirement, then a product is coming in which the density is more than 2 BH, then you see whether you want to live in 3rd and 4th house, whether you want to live near Delhi or somewhere else.  You have to live there, if someone is doing a job there, if you have anything to do with Delhi, then you have to choose your location. How can that location be compared with any other location? No two locations can be compared because whenever the city becomes big.  So everyone's own independent story plays out and the rates increase. You tell me, the location of Greater Kailash is good, Defense Colony is good, it has its own ecosystem, this is what I say in words.  I say no, yes, other YouTubers also copy, okay, just like Mavan told about the density, he told the public that ask these questions to them, in the same way he is telling, now this ecosystem will become a new word, now everyone copy this also.  Will do Which is very good because copying is the biggest form of fluttery This is the terminology that I am making in the videos that I am using This is the terminology that we have to use from these only  Decision to be taken is no langar, the location will become important and relevant in coming times because in 20 to 22 minutes from Rajiv Chowk in Gurgaon market, entire Gurgaon will be covered. Already in 30, even today, after 30 minutes, whatever is Gurgaon.  So no, if you tell me which is such a place because Rajiv Chowk is exactly the center point of Heart of Gurgaon, you can reach it in 30 minutes from Eve Chowk.  You reach everywhere and in the coming time this distance will reduce to 20 minutes. Okay, so going from anywhere to anywhere will not be really a big deal. You will reach very comfortably. There are many types of underpasses and this flyover is so and so. Everything is being made today, whoever books the project today will get it in five to six years, they call it Rera Vera and by doing this, they get banned by NGT.  There is no construction for more than seven months, take out the rains of July and August, take out the rains of November, December, January and February, half the time there is this NGT ban, the rest of the time there is construction, so no project is going to be built in 4 years, it will never be built, these days it is fine.  Even builders don't say, builders say four, but in RERA itself, you are getting five years and then it is extendable, you can go to the builder and get it extended for what ever reason, brother, it was not possible for you to make it, the weather was bad.  The stubble was burnt, this was burnt, all that happens, it's okay, so don't think about any big project mentally, physically, emotionally before five years, just like affordable housing does not come before 5 years, if any comes fully ready, then write down whose name.  Apart from Shoor ji, no one has found anything in the first phase before four years. Till date, if you have found anyone in Gurgaon, please let me know and that too will be available phase wise, which is the best construction.  I am the biggest name of Shaper ji in India. The best cannot give it in less than six years, so those who are less than the best will take a little more time. Okay, you understand, if my point is correct then be realistic minimum.  There has not been a datchi in 6 years, there have not been many latches in 20, 21, 22 also. Because of Covid, real estate is running away. Stop comparing projects, approach in isolation. This one, this one, that one, no two products match, no two products match anywhere, what kind of projects will come in the coming times, I will keep covering that, subscribe the channel, I do a lot of such education webinars, free at Rs 90 and paid at Rs 10.  If you want to listen to mine in the comment section, there is interaction in it and you also get to learn about pan India cities. Only one city is in the top seven.  There are regular posts about cities, so please join, thank you very much."

    "title": "Why Home Buyers Ostrich Approach Will Not Work ？ ｜ Hulchul In Gurgaon Real Estate [CaeS_hud1R0].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today we will discuss about the real estate of a big builder in Gurgaon, whom people have stopped talking to you for about 2.5-3 months, those people who have bought the society of this builder, I will tell them what to do now.  Now you will ask who is the builder then date man you know not affected, you can smile by doing this and smile and when someone writes in the comment area below then understand that it is okay if it is a matter of concern then I will say off.  The course is off course, no one has made this video, I am trying not to understand it like this, I told you this, I never even told you about the linkup, no one gave its link, nothing, after something happened, now everyone became silent and new  There is no talk of things behind things, there is no talk of it, blue bet, there is silence, so if you are there, then what do you have to do and what do you have to do to everyone, let everyone eat, factory, Gurgaon, follow, Gurgaon real estate market, very very classy and IMD number one.  Real estate clarity is yours in the country, that is why I am going to give clarity now. Listen carefully, what is to be done. In the different projects, the initial projects have been completed a lot, there is a little longer breath, there is peace because the thing has become this one.  This can also be tweeted in this way, this is my own opinion, peas are subsidized but I will not talk too much about them, but like when Titanic hit the iceberg, many people stayed for the day because they said that they could not even give two and there was plenty of time.  Bachchan Bachchan and what was that seat, there were a lot of life votes but it was all a hotspot, you know if the movie is good or you have followed it, it is going vacant, first the ladies are going, then 10 people are sitting in it. Man will not go but children and ladies will go and maids are people 21 could have sat so he is less like him with some hotspot because sometimes people on life so I am not making a video of Titanic I am making a video wiring  There is waiting for the payment, it is very clear even in the big time, this is the bank giving because the bank has stop giving, the place and demands are coming, the same banks of stop giving, you have to check because the rating of the builder and the rating of the builder in one market is official. Rating hai jab woh gir jati hai banks becomes skeptical they know on nps nothing d bank is not coming you have tu ko aur meet d builder ka representative dil se sir hamara Kam chal raha hai to you have you and see don't cup relying on youtubers they will come and tell you kam chal raha hai toh kuch hai, kuch hai kuch nahi hai, this was an ad ok in which one if you see a banda hai message  Is typing and is doing reverse and there is a boy standing behind and there is also a tree and he is saying 'What is it? What is it? What is it? What is it? What is it not? What is it? What is not? And then it is applied in the right manner. If it says 'Ga' then it means.  you wait like this  What are you doing? No, it's okay, it's okay, do n't sit with your face in the right, the cat has eaten all the viruses, it's not okay, it's my pigeon approach and Australia approach, if I ca n't see you then you ca n't see me type.  The approach is that I have given a mouthful in the rate, while I am sitting with a mouthful, the title of the video can also be okay, then tell me what to do, first of all, don't panic, first of all, whatever happened is fine, second thing, everything has been said outside.  which because  If there is a litigation tomorrow, if something happens tomorrow, then it may be better than one, better than two, it may be 200 to 500 and all of them, when you all come, there will be many of you who will be lawyers themselves, there will be some money here too.  What has been given has been given in different ways because what has been given by signing it will be accounted for. Do you understand what I am explaining to my subscribers? Genius is not wisdom. A hint is enough for a wise person. Genius is that.  Because everything is understood, okay, if you give ₹ 100, then the check number of ₹ 100, then you can understand because you are intelligent, it must be fine, anything will happen, there will be a conversation, it would be better if you go every 10 days and tell that something has happened.  Check how little is going on. Stand physically and count the labour. Check that the yellow crane has a very high fare. It is a story. It is running low. If it is not on the other one, then what is the status on the other one?  jump on  Brother, fresh, I feel that I am saying number one and something is happening from behind and I don't know, I don't think so, nobody is buying and selling, nobody is talking only date, this is me, but many people still think this.  That Sir, I have to take this, Hello, in which world are you living, I mean very effect, you are asking this because you are the talk of the town, it means happiness, but still.  It is Top of D Town and you do n't know what it means, it seems that yes, India is a very innocent country that people have just come, that is, it is being promoted silently, that is why someone is coming and asking, brother, to buy this.  If so, then you all tell in the comment area below whether the goods are being sold, what will happen, when will it happen, because it has not been taken out from Jai yet, how is it not Sunny, representative of D Company, should there be more oil and Address D public yes they are not listed form so let me note come inside d SEBI norms and d some norms of declaring things yes I agree but there is a moral thing also to hoti hai na bhai aake nahi told them once oh every week  Tell me, come and make it every week, it is becoming your dream, the milk has gone, it will be made, we are making it, there is so much milk, so much money will be made in this much, you give this much, this contract was made to Nath Singh at this speed. It has been given, it has been given, whatever is inside, legal action is going on, which will be lab bill, tech IT course is over, they are in control and this is happening because that is what I want to know, how the contractor's payment is being released. If a person is in the story of Jai, then has the power been given to anyone or are his signatures being taken by going there? Exactly, it's the nation, it's you, you have to speak, and it's like Swami has also come, public needs, you know, now can I go and find out?  should do  I neither got it inserted by anyone nor did I take it from them. It is okay that it is a player making machine, okay what is the making of it, do you know it? So it is okay that I am a company, so brother, who will know, this customer will know, you are in a WhatsApp group of yours. Are you on them? Because people say that there is only one thing for the people, why should they worry? No, people should not worry about this or that one India in life, because worrying is the society, why do you have to worry?  Taking action, worrying, nothing happens, discussing, nothing  If something is going to happen then no brother sir, nothing will happen, everything is fine with us, you are fine, tell me, it doesn't happen just once to someone, it is okay, it is not achieved by saying, it is for a few days, it is for a few days, this is what it means  This is not happening here. Doctor Saheb further said that the patient will be cured, that is not the story, this will be seen publicly, it will be released out and slowly, another player will do it, another one will not do it, what will happen, how will it happen next, how will it happen before, how did it happen before?  It's a relief brother I'm watching  IT is very close. Take this awareness of this video. If you are associated with this video, then take it as your own. It is not necessary to make noise and share it. It is okay and I myself do not want to give awareness to too many people in this big because of IT, it is the duty of many people.  There is no one else doing that duty and I am not a social worker as per the story, I have to speak as if it is okay, they should call me Aadhaar Bhav DK, I have to stop reading that brother, let us capital list man.  Consultant, I am the day after tomorrow, I believe in making money, making money, helping people make money, doing this to me, still that, yes, I did not vote, I did not contest elections, I do not want that Baba of yours, I am not in any ground, but I am that.  If I am a brother then I am the number one, then it is okay, then he himself gets pain in his stomach by doing number one number one again and again. You also have to say that you are becoming such a hero, so tell me, you are such a hero.  If it is bad then he doesn't even dare to tell, I feel scared of that too, I feel scared, you also know, but I am asking you to monitor, come to my group and check some questions, I will meet the contractor only after going to the site. You are getting money, he is happy, the contractor is getting money, he is happy, the laborer is getting money, he is happy, there is less going on, then why are you afraid and keep monitoring him that this Happening every 10 days  Go and impose duty. If 200 people in a group bought it, it is ₹ 1500. I don't know how much they have bought, but a group can be formed of 200. It can't be formed. Brothers and sisters, you can impose duty out of these 200. Even if two people go every month or every two months or three months, you can monitor for 100 weeks without repeating yourself. Two people will go and bring independence report.  And this is the report, so brother, who went on 5th September, Rohit went and Shobhit went from here, mother is there and both of them went in the same product, she talked to him, he got this feedback, he got this, so everyone is taking knowledge, say, next time is mine.  There is a coordinator, an admin will go, I will get my house, if money is being asked, what to give, not to give, debt bill, be decided, somebody, I personally, flower, government, sold, entering, somebody, sold comment oil.  I will give S. If the thing is worth two and a half to three crores, then there is no such thing that the installment of affordable housing is coming, it is not worth Rs. 2.5 lakhs, Papa will give the money of Rs. 2.5 lakhs, then here she is also a pearl, isn't it worth 25-30-40 lakhs? Or even more than that, brother, if the bank is not giving me, then where can I get the loan, it will remain that way, I will vote for you, cancel, what is the rule of canceling, how much money is late, if the builder is not making it or is not making it.  If some issues have come up then even Rera Rera is going into it, I mean, the story is written in it, the provisions have not happened till now, Rera Kitchen, when something happens, there should be something before it even happens, may be my knowledge, power, I may be wrong. Maybe you did not drink the diamond sparingly, but do whatever you are affected to do, now if the car collides into a mountain, you can apply brakes before that, you can wear a seat belt, you can buy a car with an airbag, you can increase the speed a little more.  something can rock  Something can be done, you just wait, don't get hit, only then the ambulance will come, only then the government will come, the government will come only when the train gets crowded, then I came to the story, before that we are seeing caste, we are not trying anything, that burning train.  Dharmendra's Jitendra's Burning Train picture was good. One Danny makes the brakes fail. Whoever was good in it, it felt good. Dharmendra Jitendra's train was a very good picture to do. It was good for the old times, so he tries his best, so isn't he?  He had another way of saying what should we do, sit down, we will send him to pick up the approach, enemy mouth approach, ostrich approach, this is something I don't like and this is what our country is called, no, no, no, look at it big, no.  Say no, say this, by doing this, it has reduced to something like this, all this has happened, you are listening to me that maybe we will get something, the lie is loose, what is not the meaning, which is the stage of construction, this is defining your what.  If you have advanced, then the status report is going to me, now what will happen, then it is a matter of concern for you, now tell me whether you have it or not, use your mind, first subscribe to the channel and press the notification bell icon because  There will be many such things in the times to come who will come and then will go. I have set up such a big place here to do social service. My mother and brother also feel like I am a hero here, Hiralal.  Rambo and she is honey, so am I too, Guru ji, okay, so tell me more, I was telling this to both of them, till now the video is my never yours, this is a single cockroach in the kitchen, still share the link, please share it, I had already told about it and  The time is visible on YouTube, brother, after how many months has it been uploaded, so it is not that I will go to YouTube and change it, that I have uploaded the video tomorrow and YouTube is showing it for the next month, I have that time, you will see it.  So I told you, I explained, I am explaining now, I am explaining now, I am explaining well through gestures and maybe after 4 months, I am doing this video and clipping myself. I am not enjoying in such a situation because  If the situation is not so good for the people, then the mother also does the clapping thing. In any situation, the situation is going well, everything is going well and I am enjoying it because I am passionate, you also have people's emotions. I am telling this and I am also telling this after 4 months, I will tell you again that this one was told and explained because brother, it has been two months, he is not speaking, even if you check on Google, you still do n't know what is happening, a small pearl thing.  How many crores, lakhs, crores, lakhs of crores are there in this D-world, if you only see, if there are 1500 flats in a project and two are two and a half to three crores, then that project is worth Rs. 4:30 thousand crores. How many more such projects are there and where?  where are they filed  Add it and where is the remaining land and then from which party the loan has been taken and how many people are involved then that amount keeps on increasing. Elections are coming, elections are coming, that's all I will say, it is fine and a hint to the wise is enough.  You are also some genius sitting there, write in the comment area what you want to write, write it openly and tell it to other people and share it on your group who are affected people, it is possible that you may not be able to see it till you are very scared. Okay, the tree should go for the members, okay, this can also happen, as of now, I am making it for the general public as you are listening and watching, so for now, I am just going to subscribe the channel and press the bell notification because like  As soon as you press the bell notification, a video is released. Immediate notification is a type and you can watch it, you will utilize it in this way, there is no need to panic at all, there is no need to worry at all, there is no benefit, it is the most important thing to worry about in life.  Likely it should be fine but you will have to do your work which I told you because the fear is that you have to kill it yourself and show the solar power. Whoever buys here, you think that someone else will do it and you can see heaven, it is not going to happen, you have to do the hard work yourself.  I am killing it, the story is South Indian, they take it literally, they take North Indian dialogues and then they fool, they understand Hindi but some times they fool, what are you want, you say, what I do n't know, I am just saying it.  N proverb thoughts have tu oil is ok please spread this awareness and subscribe the channel thank you very match"

    "title": "Why Real Estate Prices Will Remain High In India ？ [cPk2Ksw5xec].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, why real estate prices in India are high and will remain, so beyond that, I will try to tell you about two or four things, why builders are not able to bring things very cheap, first of all, the cost of land in India is expensive for many people.  He had run a Lincoln, had also appeared in Business Standard, Ajay ji Karke is his first name and he had written that real estate is nothing, it is bricks and stones and cement, make it anywhere, these are ridiculous rates.  So in this we have to understand that the cost of the infrastructure also comes in the real estate because it becomes the cost of land. You cannot take the economic activity everywhere, it is concentrated. Mumbai is a 150 year old city. How many 150 years?  The history of economic activity there is 150 years old. You cannot create that thing by going anywhere in Neemrana or getting hold of anything anywhere in Rajasthan. Water will come from here, electricity will come from here, build separate houses, it will not happen like this, when a road is built inside Gurgaon on Dwarka Express, there is a road of 28-30 kilometers, it costs Rs 12000 crore, is this Rs 12000 crore somewhere?  It will be taken out from somewhere, it is the government that is spending, it is the government that will take it out, it will be taken out by changing land use, it will be taken out from the registration cost, it will be taken out from GST Licenses will be charged, there will be some fees, there will be external development charge, internal development charge will be there, if the builder adopts all these things then the cost of land increases, then the desirability of people to stay in relevant places, nobody wants to stay 50 km away also.  From the Place of Vibrant Activity: As a classic and good example of this, let me explain to you, look at Australia.  Friend, calculate the population of Australia, how many 2.5 crore population is there, the population is less than Delhi NCR, Australia's area is 91 lakh square kilometer, India's area is 27-28 lakh, yes, people will say that Australia is not in between, so and so, brother, as many cities as we can sit with.  If cities can expand further by 5 kilometres, Melbourne, Perth, Sydney, Brisbane, Canberra, they can expand. If you apply the formula of Pi R Square, how much will it go in square kilometres, if 5 kilometres? I also did the square of five. 25 25 * 3.14 Why is there not 75 square kilometers? New Zealand population is 70 lakhs. Why is the real estate there high? Because after one stage the jungle starts there. People do not want to live there, they just say that, we  We have to stay here, go up, I am not going away, there is no discussion about this thing. I have given so many examples of New Zealand, of which I have told three places - Najafgarh, Dwarka and Rohini.  Najafgarh Dwarka Rohini Three places in Delhi have less population and real estate than Najafgarh Dwarka Rohini, see how much is there in Christ Church in Auckland, whatever areas they have, go and check there, in Australia, go and check, people always think this.  Only a few will be left, why are there more because that sewerage pipeline, that system, water, electricity, electric poles, all of them are counted in real estate. You cannot live life by going in isolation. People used to live here at one time but now mall is nearby, school is nearby, hospital is nearby, shops are nearby, there should be PVR halls, entertainment is nearby, office space should also not be too far away, only by doing all these things, real estate can be acquired here.  The prices are high. Secondly, let me also tell you an Illuminati's expectation. If the prices of real estate are not high in big cities, then why would you come to work in big cities because you have to get stuck in that rut, how can you stay in the rut of getting a job?  Why would you work there because the work is there, then you will buy the house there or pay the rent there, whether you pay rent or buy a house or pay rent, then earn a salary, if you have a job to earn a salary, then the slave is made like this, then the system. This is not good on both the things, hey friend, come on this channel and bring knowledge, do good and bad, don't become a moral science teacher, stay in your small town, some person may come from village to city, from small town to big city and vice versa.  It is not considered a demotion and there are economic activities in big cities. There are sources of earning money. Other people in the family can also earn. Yes, it seems that if one man in the family has to earn, the wife has to stay at home as a mother.  -Many people think that if the father has to sit at home and the children have to prepare for the exam, then a small town is better, but the fact is that if you come to a big city, then all the people there can earn like a classic. Our example is that in developed countries, we stand in queues to get visas to go to US, to Canada, to Australia, to European countries. We have heard there that money is paid as per the passport. Even a woman can earn this much $100. Only three hours of work has to be done here. Someone is saying that I have to work as a librarian, someone has to work in a shop for three-four hours, someone has to work only in the evening. Someone just needs to do the job of baby sitting, whatever things are there, big cities will give such opportunities in the coming time in India also, hence there will always be crowd here and I advise all of you, whoever is listening to me, to Buy property in the city, if you can. Buy at the lowest price. Buy in a small town. After 25 years, there will be no time left to buy in a big city. If you are from Haryana, it is important to buy in Gurgaon. If you can, buy it in a big city.  That is because their coming generation will not be able to buy it. If you can't buy it then buy it in Pune. Buy it in a big city where your rent gets subsidized. Maybe your child goes to Bangalore and you buy property in Pune.  If you bought it in Hyderabad or Gurgaon or anywhere where you could buy, if you bought a property, your rent would be subsidized, where you were paying Rs 0000 rent, here it became Rs 20-25. Many parents like this. No, they are not thinking, they are wasting their money in FDs and mutual funds while their next generation will continue to suffer. They will not get freedom from job until they own the house. And the system set up by Luminati will keep you away from buying a house, that is different. Will take you on different paths Why is it a waste of money Why is this thing Rent is so much Save here do this So how do you You have to listen If you have your own roof on your house Rent  If you do n't want to give then the government is still giving 5 kg ration to 80 crore people. There is no problem of food in India. And if the food of the house is food and the food is clothes, then there is no problem in India. Now no one believes that house has come, bread is cloth.  And the house is just under whose control you are. All this has been created only to control you. And yes, one stage 10, 12, 14, 15 years will have to be enslaved until that house is there, but its Start slavery at the age of 24 25 26 27 28 so that the path to freedom starts opening before 40. There is a separate video to come on this also. If you work in a corporate then 45 years is your retirement age. Whatever jobs you are doing. You will not be seen above 45 years on middle level post. In fact, shops will start closing at 42-43 only. Which job will the shop provide in the future? That if you are not on the blue pedigree of IIT and IM, is it that you have to go ahead and go to the management level, become a CFO, become a CEO, become a CTO or whatever, make it up to VP, then it is okay if you are not on that path.  So brother, your shop is about to be closed, please buy a house before the shop is closed because you are going to need it, it cannot be that it was a habit of living in a big city for 20 years. Children were born and brought up in big cities.  If my wife also gets into the habit, now we can't afford it, so we will go to a small town, you will feel a loser in life, this is the actual truth of life, no, small towns are very good, there is less pollution, yes, it is less today, but after 10 years, when  If you go, then those cities would have become so big that the pollution would be very high and the pollution in the big cities would have reduced because all the electronic vehicles and public transportation would have become better, so the issues that are there in the big cities today. In the next 1012 years, there will be a lot less and the issues that have not yet come in small cities, which are the issues of big cities today, will come in 10 years, then will there be a job in life, will retirement also happen in a polluted place?  I am telling you the truth and the second thing I always say is that buy it in a big city and put it on rent at the rate of 2 BHK from Chutku in Gurgaon. If you have your own, you can take a nice house on rent in Rohtak, I am talking about big rent in Hisar, live comfortably in the house, what is the need to buy a house, buy it here because there will be a stage when old age comes.  So here one will have to come medically for those things. This is also a fact in big cities. Secondly, that too in old age. I have a video pending on my other channel that the parents can come to the children again when needed. Would like to live for the last time and children will not be in small towns and parents will not have any house in big cities and children's own house will be rented and then new guard will come, so keep everything of your old age first. I am telling all the parents that old age will come for everyone, now the 45-50 people are listening to me, brother, 20 will come in 2 years, yours will come then where will you live, the daughter-in-law will keep her children in her house, not you but ours.  She is a daughter, she will keep her, will not the drug keep her in Ganga ji? Those who did not tell you in their previous lives whether they would get such a daughter or son-in-law or daughter-in-law, no one told them, I am telling this as a social observer and social scientist, nothing. No one will let us stay, they will say that we should eat at our place, there are no children's books, we are already living in 700 carpets, 800 because this will be the future of real estate in big city already  We are moving in that direction, even if it is in 1000 carpets, there will be no place for you because it is not there even in the heart, so how will you find a place there, so in your old age, keep your respect with you and take something small.  Towards this I keep bringing webinars seminars and sub teases and it is very important that you attend them this festive season is starting very much like this  Opportunities will come, you will find a group in the comment section, the cost of all the land is increasing, everything is increasing, so there is no delay, if the prices of inputs and everything are increasing, it means project lunch for the builder to get a license. Till the time of purchase of land, we keep it for 10, 12, 14 months and if the inventory is left overhang for more than a month, then it is not a Maggi which will be constructed in two minutes and the builder will give it to us, please again and again in different videos.  I am giving a hint, demand is a different thing but start paying attention to the supply, how limited the supply is, no builder can supply a lot even if he wants to because it will take time to build the project which is being made today in the video on October 24, which is very light.  If it happens then it will be available only after a year. I have heard these stories of three-four years that they used to get two towers handed over to them, now the land parcels have become smaller, the whole thing has to be taken from RERA at one go, now it is known that it will be built in a year.  So, make preparations according to the year, whoever will book in October 2024, you have to meet in 2031, do it even now, I am telling you this thing because there was a time when such a thing happened, if you remember which car  You had to tell me which car models were there that those who booked, there was a waiting period of 8 to 10 months, then the one who got it could sell his car at a premium on the very first day or else I would not take it out from the showroom.  I am going to take Rs 3 lakh, give it to me, you take it, this has also happened, tell me which car was there on the vehicles, this happened at a time because there is demand and the supply is not coming, so the prediction is another for 2025 that you will  The prices of the properties which are coming to close to release position will be seen to be equal to the new land equivalent ones or will be seen increasing whereas they should be less because the money there is to be paid to me in 4 years. I have to give it already, this is already happening with a builder who has some mortgage in the name of the resident. In Gurgaon, there is a ready-to-move-in one of Rs. 0000 and the new mortgage is Rs. 25000. Go check because whoever has the money, he has to pay it now.  Want it now and ready to pay, he is not going to wait for 6 years, he is saying buy it today itself, do it, a very new trend is coming in the market which was going one way now.  In every way, the customer has to take action and while the customer is acting, he cannot remain in the mood that I will watch now, I will think that things will keep getting expensive, they will keep getting denser, so please like, share, subscribe to the channel, share on your groups and family.

    "title": "Why You Should Not Invest In Goa Real Estate ？ [EEruRwWf9Zo].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, should you invest in Goa real estate and for that matter in tourism places, I want to give a little clarity on this, although my Goa video has come on my other channel in great detail, clarity for youth and was very appreciated and good thing on that.  What happened, what do I want to praise, the day that video was released, I will give the link of it. If you have not seen it then definitely watch it. Three-four days after that video, the Minister of Goa himself said that in Goa two The very soul of Guayas is dying, real estate, tourism, other wise there is nothing there and it is going, this is what I explained through that video and today I would like to tell a little more on this, whatever comments came from beyond that. People have taken it and are stranded there, go and see it in the comment section and you will find my video too. If you have n't seen it then definitely watch it. Let's discuss further. Goa's own Chief Minister is speaking about his too.  Please check Sawant Saheb that they don't want quantity of tourists, they want quality of tourists. The quality of tourists in Goa. This is another minister's tweet saying that these are the people who cook food in buses and they are under the influence of drug addicts and all this.  These are the kind of people we don't need in Goa and the main thing in Goa is the sea. If you have to buy a property for your Air BnB and that buying is not the sea, there is no beach then it will not work.  Recently there is a user Akshay Srivastava, he made the calculation, he made a video, he made a video, I told everything in it, even after that he told the calculation on the community post and wrote that Math People La and Maths Dozen La 200, Occupancy will be 54 in 365 days and  People, hey brother, maths would have been 365, maths would have been a dozen but the person making the mistake is a  Human Being Only Na That Human Being Can Be Rang The Human Being Can Lie And whatever you put in the math formula, it can be wrong, so I accepted the formula is correct, it is only 2, 3, 6, but two had to be put or  If you had to put three then it could be wrong p * r * t up 100 equal to interest will come out only the rate of interest on the formula, whatever you put Ajman is wrong.  Maybe the rest will work out a formula. Focusing is an illusion. States like Goa should make a rule that people from outside should not buy because if the cuisine and culture of Goa gets destroyed then there will be nothing left in Goa. This music plays there, there is no music there, go anywhere as you wish, you will not get food, whatever you get, the food that people from your other province are cooking, does not exist and the system itself has ended, this is it.  Goan taste, the cuisine, the culinary skills, real estate, everything has been taken over by Barwala, that is why it is Himachal and some Uttarakhand or some such states, even in our North East, where outsiders cannot come and buy because outsiders have come and created a mess.  There is no ownership there, they do not have any culture there and especially in such sensitive ecosystem where the land is in such a way that even inside the forests, the trees are weeded.  The ecosystem is free there and someone is buying something and flats are going to be built there. Hey, I want to live in a flat only in Gurgaon. If in Goa, I will live in Gurgaon. The sea is not visible there. Where are your flats built?  We are here because the sea would have brought complete sand, where will flats be built there, some will be built somewhere inside, if I have to travel only 5, 6, 4, 8 kilometers, then if I go in the morning, I will come back to Thona in the evening.  If you have to take rest, have lunch, then go and come back then your friend will want to stay closest to the beach, but whatever is his capacity, even a poor person can live on a shoestring for Rs. 800, so this is Air BnB.  The person who is going there is not going again. It is a bad experience but yes, the population of India is so high that to taste Air BnB even once, there are many Air BnBs.  One day will pass, two, three years will pass, everyone will come to my comment section of that video which I have just posted here, go to the top of this comment section and watch that video, people have said the same things that my wife is very angry.  There will be no food, there is no food anywhere nearby, he had to go there and make Locky Tinda, then why did he take him there, he says that the children did not enjoy, there is a resort, there is an ecosystem in which you do hospitality. They are saying that they don't know about hospitality, they know a lot about hospitality, what if they haven't tried hospitality, then what if they have experienced hospitality, what requirements do they have in hospitality? They know that I want this too, I want that too, the bell keeps ringing like this.  Do I want a man or do I want to eat this food, I have this Farmaashi program, I have this problem, I have that, it is not that facility, and if Air BnB provides that facility.  If you try then there is no margin. Tourism in Goa is nothing for six months and seven months and in the remaining six months the occupancy limit can be hit at 7080, so we are still looking for not more than 120 days. It is not possible. 200 day calculation.  It is wrong that your rent will increase for 200 days but will increase only for 120 days and there are so many hotels and there is competition.  And tourism itself is decreasing because like he himself made a video of going to Cambodia or somewhere on that side and told that he had his own photo taken from behind, so it is cheap to go there, friend, I am also saying this and Goa.  The Minister is saying and the world is saying that if you have to go from Delhi, then Vietnam, Cambodia, at least have a passport country and if something looks different then Goa repeat, people are not going, now someone has gone once, now he does not want to go again, the taxi is very expensive. own  There is a mafia there, the rates of everything are kept like this and the quality is the same, otherwise when you buy a story in such a place, then what you will be left with is white. Lakshadweep has not been activated here, take it in two-three years.  Where are the tourists from Kanas loyal? They will go anywhere as per their wish. Half of the places are visa on arrival. Thailand, this is Phuket Sakat. You can go anywhere as per your wish. You do not have to buy there, where to buy in the top seven cities.  Buy value for money thing because a human's child needs to sleep. If he comes from job, then you cannot be there. You can't read the reward ratio is favourable. I will bring a lot of value picks and value buys in the coming 5 10 15 days. Where I am staying, rental lead will also be 5% on 4. Top cities across India with small ticket size. For that, you can join the group given in the comment section. You will get the information of webinars and at a real location in a real city where there will always be demand, there will always be economic activity and there will be requirement. Please do not buy fancy products in fancy places. It is always better that if you are in your 30s, 40s. Child after 5 10 15 years may happen to study and work in Pune and Bangalore I am not  Even Talking Gurgaon If you say Gurgaon then people say you keep talking about Gurgaon PU Ahmedabad Bangalore Hyderabad Chances are there for your child to work there and study, so if you buy a property then your child can live in that property, he will not need to pay rent.  And even if it is not there, then this rental will always be in extremely high demand in the cities, so the message is very clear, do not take Goa and fancy places, you are jumping as many crores of money as you want.  You can buy a tower in a building, if you have 150 crores, you are getting 6 units there and that is a robot demand. In the coming times, property management companies will also come which will easily rent the property and it is  Very very easy than this airbnb thing where commission advertising funnel is very painful, rule regulation is very much and law itna vahan ka sab baale hain yahaan land  Buying it is free from danger because here, why are you making players out of danger, why are you taking people to a dangerous place, go there, Portuguese land law and that is everyone's trouble, the land title trouble, you yourself are accepting it.  If so, then why go to such a place? First buy a house for yourself, then buy it for investment, buy it for your children, then again I have got the testimony that to become a tourist, entrepreneurs start publishing and take that much money.  At that time, there will be more clearances and I don't know what else, then the construction will be stopped, then there are protests, then this happens, then only then something will be achieved, since when did the common man start gaining strength or not?  I will also play hotel hotel, I will also take that villa of my own somewhere, Villa, I will also stay for 10 days, my friends will also stay, you will not be able to stay, you do not go again and again, if you want to see only the sea, then why would you see the same sea only there? Even people go there, they do not go to the same place. In Air BnB, if you go once and go to one place, then it is a kind of beach, then next time you go to a different resort. It is next to impossible to meet everybody, so there is also no human being in it.  Take the expense of the ship and it will not go to the same place, every person will say, friend, next time let's do it like this, let's see Kolam Beach. Come on, friend, they do like this, let's see the other one in India, let's see some other one.  Friend, they go there every now and then, see in Lakshadweep, there are big resorts there too, sorry, you will come to Lakshmideep in Port Blair in two-three years. There are different beaches in Port Blair, if you go two-three.  Within an hour, this island has become big by doing that, two-three are very good there too and if not, then you are going to Thailand and Vietnam, you are going to Cambodia, these South East Asian countries are very cheap there. Stay in the five star hotels there which will actually cost you Rs 10, 11, 12, and in Goa, don't read your five star hotel for less than Rs 20, 25, Haj. In the season, don't know what their rates are and then pay here.  Fish is going to happen in the coming time and the Chief Minister of Goa himself is the Minister himself speaking, so what do we have to do more than that when he himself is speaking and that is what I said. Politics is happening so pick it up tomorrow and they will throw out anything. The outsiders have had enough and will do anything, so there is no need to take money there, there is no need to invest your money, that is the message. I liked it. If I understood the message. Please understand. If you don't like it then explain it logically. Don't say that it is bad, no, no, it is very good. Do n't say that. I had taken a good question that what has happened in the past is not a forward looking thing. Investment.  This is a forward looking thing. Till now you were hitting a run rate of six. If you have 120 runs in 20 overs, then how are you batting ahead? What is the condition of the pitch? What is happening next is also very important. You were bringing your car. Any car was running fine. If there is any accident, then before that it was running fine. But now it was running normally on the highway, in plains. Now the mountain type has come, so now it is in the same condition.  You can travel at speed, you have to change the road, if the weather gets bad, they sit in the plane, in the middle, the captain says, fasten your seat belt, the weather is going to get worse, so you should know the weather from now on.  The weather is about to deteriorate and you are being trapped, so there is no need to get trapped in a wrong place. Clear cut Goa real state is not to be touched by outsiders. Now they will do whatever they want to do, just like that, a lot of raita has been spread outside.  I will speak only to the people outside and I want to tell the people of Goa who are listening that you please tell under this video whether what is being said is correct or not. If the person in Goa already has his link.  What is being said is this true, construction is going on, mining is going on like this, the total of 20 kilometers out of 140 is taken up and they will be registered by North Indians or outsiders. Keep chanting the name again and again, no one will come there again, and then when there was fun, rest, peace, culture, hey the coast line is no less in India, hey, not all places have beaches, I also know this much geography. But brother, it runs from the Run of Kutch, comes down all the way to Kanyakumari and then goes from here to the Bay of Bengal, this peninsula has seen so much, it is such a big peninsula, I don't know which virgins are there in Orissa.  There are so many beaches, everything is good but it has not been discovered yet, it is an inner place but it was from Goa because of the Goan culture, the cuisine and the atmosphere and vibes there, when the party is over, it will start somewhere else, you do not need to get stuck there.  Go to different places of yours, invest your money, earn a good rental for it in a good city, use that rental to travel anywhere you want. What is the need to buy wherever you want because you will go to the same hill every time?  You just have to see the hills of Nainital or Mussoorie, you have to see Shimla, you cannot see Coorg, you cannot see your darling, you cannot see Ooty, you cannot see the big hill, the high hill, the cold hill, the small hill, the forested hill, we have 50 types of mountains.  The people of Kashmir will look different to you, the people of Himachal will look different to you, the people of Uttarakhand will look different, the people of Darjing will look a little different, there are many places in the South also, if you have gone to Mannar, then explore every.  There is no need to go everywhere and buy places. Your money should come from somewhere. The game is about money. My money is coming from here and with this money I am traveling somewhere. Nobody wants to repeat. There are so many tourist places in India that all the  If you go on a trip for a year, your life will be spent, all the tourist places in India cannot be covered and if you add foreign expenses then it will not be possible anyway, okay then don't buy here, this is the message, thank you very much."

    "title": "Will Investors Get Exit In Underconstruction Project ？ [0d4-wdZ54z8].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, this is going to be a very real estate educational video, it is going to touch many people, it is going to benefit many people, I am giving only a paid consultation, you understand that this is a question which is often asked by people, Sir Will I.  Get Exit Guruji, I will get the exit, if I put the money, I am going to answer today because I am crying one by one, whom should I answer? Real estate is booming, it is applicable on Pan India, this video is applicable on Pan India real estate. Wherever there is Gurgaon's example for example in big cities, if something has to be used then I may use the example here but it is applicable for everything. What has happened there is a run up has happened and is happening in the real estate ok.  A project is launched, some payment plan comes, some money has to be invested in it by doing something and the other and people think that if they put it here then the rates have increased.  Example: Somewhere in Gurgaon you had invested Rs 7,75,800 square feet, there the builder has taken the price as Rs 10,000, so you think you will exit in Rs 9,500, you have earned this money, now this new one is coming 13 14 15 16 177000  Wala or 18, whatever I put in it, it will play at 20, at 30. Advice, I am going to tell you that will you get exit in a bullish market. Well, one thing that India's number one clarity giver is telling you is that you will get exit and this you should write down somewhere that you will get exit quickly.  Not 100%, you will get 1000% exit, write it down, record this video somewhere, tell the world, we will all get exit, we all will get everything from this earth. 1100 crores will be exited, now 850 crores are remaining, they also have to exit, apart from this, if there is any exit, if you ask anyone, anyone says that he is a sly one, he is a sly one, I hope you understand Hindi.  But if you ask then you are a fool. The one who asks is a fool and the one who promises is a fool. Remember this, the one who asks the word is a fool and the one who answers it with yes is a fool.  It is clever, now I am explaining it under some numbers, so now it is understood that something was built on Dwarka Expressway one and a half to two years ago, there was a launch of Rs 9000 something, it was in different schemes, now all that is standing and it is very good.  Went to see on Dwarka Expressway, now lunch is being done there at Rs. 00000. It means builder is giving it, so has the price become Rs. 20000, try reselling.  There will be customers even in Rs 1415, otherwise someone would think that if it is Rs 20, then why is the rate Rs 20, I have already made a video on how much is the inventory that has to be, so this price differential will always be there, reasoning on this has been done earlier also.  Please tell me that you should not invest in this matter, please do not bite more than you can chew in the matter of exit, so I will tell it in percentage ideally.  Speaking, a project has a delay of 4 years, it is said that it will be built in five to six years, NGT bans and you know, okay, so let's take the average of 5 years, six will be a little late, four will be done very soon, very  Only a few great builders are willing to build it or the one who is building it in Phases, right now those are being built together and 800,700 are being sold at one go and are being built at one go.  If you have been there for minimum 5 years then it is ok then it is 5 years, here you have to pay money from 0 to 100%, even if you have only 25% and you want to get out of it by taking exit then the risk is high if  If you are entering into this by taking money only at Rs 50 then the risk gets reduced and if you have full 100% money, then the risk gets further reduced. It is possible.  That at 25, it is possible that you may get an exit but you don't plan it, that way, if another opportunity comes, then it is okay, then it is okay. Other wise, today the market is not interested in getting any exit. A fact that many heads are bursting because right now in the market, everyone is enjoying the fun of the sellers, the buyers, the buyers, the sellers or the buyers.  And the rest, some are walking in fear, some are walking in greed, there are a lot of emotions going on. There is no clarity, there is no stock exchange, the sell order is confirmed, I want to sell, okay, you want to sell at what price, okay.  This price is ok you want to buy ok now you want to sell no I don't want to sell so why are you asking I was knowing the rate so now when it is in the market then no one  There is no rate in the market, the builder's rate is this, so now even the buyers are jumping straight to this because that payment plan is like this or brother, they add diamonds, pearls and silver to it, they are also giving some better in new projects, it is definitely not like that.  Well, because they are bringing something better and more in technologies, construction, technologies, architecture, everything, so it is my request to all of you that you should not invest anywhere in the first attempt to make an exit.  I can hold it only for one year. I can hold it for one year. These are mostly the people who are playing with their parents' money or have some money of their own. Don't overleverage in the market. Builders have also become famous now. Even the up front UI itself has started asking for Rs 30-50 lakhs. Those big brothers who have the capacity to pay this much at one time, then you should come, otherwise the builder also wants a situation.  Every buddy with only money at 25 has got into the project and he is very happy and as soon as he went to you at 25 and asked for the demand at 35, you are saying no, I will resell, resell, resell, resell. So if you want to build a house then the builders are also a little smart, I have talked to some builders also, I have given this advice to them and in giving advice, now I have given one thing advice. And you will see it coming in the market. My advice to all the bidders who have given very recently is just have a construction link plan as per your own because that power is again in the hands of the builder, build fast, build slowly, build quickly in the beginning and then build slowly.  If you want to make it, then it is in his hands and the customer is not sure because you know that even in two years there can be 70 demand, he has written down and made the structure, after that it is a matter of make-up.  You will continue to do make-up at your own convenience, depending on that. Now those who are sitting with genuine money, those who have genuine money should do the same in the market. Now do not do this in the sheep trap, otherwise you will be busy in making it a spec market, then that is 2525. But the whole world is sitting on this market, right now this situation seems to be playing out in the next one year. You know that 1090 2080 which were launched 2 years ago?  Will it make a difference in a market like Gurgaon and other places too? Maybe it won't make a difference because they are still not selling, there is still a year left in the market and the number of weak hands is gradually increasing.  They keep coming out in the market, do not come in one go and what is the matter when the appreciation becomes very high, sometimes it makes sense, this is also a very deep thing I am telling because people do not want to take it in black and white but want to take it in the video.  advice advice  Always lead, remain gray and have higher order thinking. Now listen carefully, if I bought a thing worth 75 lakhs, it turned out to be like a 2 BH titist, if it has run up and gone above 1.25 crores, 1.3 1.4 gone. So brother, I will get 1.3% rental allowance even at 1.4% but it becomes rental allowance on my 75 lakh rupees 55 5 55 so 5  If I own 55 rental yield and now I will take a loan and I will get income tax rebate on the loan, then my short fall is less, which means I am not getting too much load out of my pocket, so my pay load is not coming.  And I have loan taking capacity, which many people will have, that is because it is loan against them, many have taken subvention and all these schemes against them, right, civil bill.  It has already been checked, so when I get hit by the loan, I will have that cushion from income tax rebate and rent because the rents have increased a lot in the last 2 years, you know and they are going to increase further in the coming one year.  Suddenly that property seems to be cash flow positive to the people, that somehow we had given it at Rs. 20 at that time, we insisted, okay, now we will give more at Rs. 1015, it is okay at the position. So I will take a loan, let's say it is 60%, so it is 60-65. I will get the rent as much as the interest component is in the loan. This calculation is being done because you have not taken a loan of 100%, you are getting 55% of the invested amount now.  The current market price is getting at Rs. 3 but I hope that all of you are able to understand this math. If you are not able to understand then I am not at all. Brothers and sisters, look at this, he is not explaining like this because all my channels are not for those people who cannot understand this one, whatever you want to do, do it, okay, not everyone has such an entry.  So you understood that brother, my original loan is at Rs. 55, the current market price is at Rs. 3 and if I took the loan only at Rs. 55, then at Rs. 65, if I took the loan at Rs. 88.5  My interest rate is so whatever rent I am getting, he will take care of this plus which is the income tax benefit, the income tax of the property is available, a person gets around Rs 66000 per year, both husband and wife are taking it.  If it is 132000 then it may be my profit in a way or it will be used to pay my principal, then when these things happen because when these things happen then I will make this video again.  People will sell to sensible people otherwise and if that rate is confirmed then you have to understand the rate. It has to be confirmed only after being in the product for three-four years. Other wise and the foam of cold coffee is from the builder and those who are not buying from this thing are those who are not. Those who want to buy, do not have money or convincing will die, they are not realizing that the froth you are seeing now will also become a solid thing in three to four years because the economy has to grow. Election results are about to come, stock market has to rise, inflation has to rise, nothing will come of money, if that 100 turns into your 150, then there is no need to worry about it because it will not be eaten up by inflation which is officially at 67.  But if I consider that I am an aspirational person from the middle class who is not counted among the 400 in the government's data which calculates the AICPA number.  Inflation is probably at 12 13 14. You see what is happening to the school in which you want to send your child, what is happening to the rents because the government which does the data is very official and does it in a different way, it is an unofficial system and  Economy also works in India. If you know it, then it is important to do this. Understand this but do not do it to exit, do it to hold because if you have seen the monopoly. If you have played the game of Monopoly, which children play it? If anyone has played it, please write Monopoly in the comment section. All of you stay in the game for a long time. There is no win or lose in it. The game keeps going on. People are bankers in it.  They keep coming out after falling flat and that is a long game. Those who stay longer are the ones who take the properties of the market and pay the rent under pressure and go on making it and those who earn are the real estate entry exit entry.  They have to earn their living by exiting because there is a lot of unemployment and they are not reaching anywhere. Remember that only those who have the money to earn their living do not want to withdraw it from real estate and have the holding power who are only in this exit-entry-exit-entry affair. So you have to see that entry and exit at a place may not be at the rate which is being shown in the market but when you buy something, you are buying it at that rate. The rate you are understanding is definitely an increased rate, so you also see it increasing, but the rate you see increasing is also a foam for a time and the difference that was there will be covered by the foam, so stay here.  There is benefit only in me otherwise if you keep paying EDC IDC GST brokerage and registry and all these charges then take your property peacefully and if it looks lucrative and you don't have money then pass it and smile. Consolidate, buy one after another and then sell it and never exit the property in the same city. You had investments in your  The story did not come out, whatever is the reason, now if you are not enjoying then exit is made from it and then here if you like the story in Y city then you can post it in the same city like on this road in Gurgaon, I took it. Now it has become weak on this road, it has become weak here, oh brother, everything is increasing, it is increasing in the same ratio, somewhere it increases here, sometimes it increases here, sometimes it increases here, it increases everywhere, now if the rates of New Gurgaon increase.  They are increasing and are increasing a lot and there will be lots of 16 17 18000 rupees, then Golf Course Extension will be more expensive, it will be more expensive in Dwarka Express because relatively they will remain above that, it is  Something like that if Gurga, if Greater Noida grows, then Gurgaon will grow, meaning if Greater Noida is growing, then Noida will grow, if Greater Noida is growing, then Noida will grow, if Noida is growing, then Gurgaon has to grow because price differential things are always going to be delayed.  The situation changes many times and it is a dynamic situation, so I hope you understand through this video.  I regularly bring webinars and opportunities and projects from top 10 cities in India. For that, there is one of my real estate live projects in the comment section and all those things are done very well, so you can join it.

    "title": "＂Pros And Cons＂ ： A Wrong Mindset While Approaching Property Purchase Decision [kTgG2O_tDw4].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, in this video of real estate, I will talk about Pros and Cons. Okay, so normally I have seen that whenever there is a creator or audience on real estate, it is a Pros and Conscious something which is always the head project approach and tell me the cons. Serve this and consume this in sufficient think is what I am trying to say through this video LED video Higher order thinking will have to be done, you will have to think a little more, not simply stick  This is a service and consumer education system, it was never able, you take decisions, decision making is not good, it is not because of the Indian, it is our education system, it used to be like this ever in our education system, okay, this system has come, progeny pause of democracy, tell me this color statement.  Democracy is so excellent, you do n't need to discuss it because of it, you should do it, brother-in-law, it's no. Alternative you cannot say, this is the advantage in dictatorship, this is the problem, these are all the disadvantages in dictatorship, it is not rights, it is not bullying, it is not, but this thing will be fine for you, this is the approach, because of this, what do you get from this, you want to marry a person.  Come on, she is like Amitabh Bachchan's aunt. Projon Kansa Dil Do, which is a scene from Sholay, you will not be able to marry because brother, that will be visible to you.  It has to be seen holistically, I want to show you my understanding on the basis of an example. There is any project in which it has been served and made, but apart from that, there is also a third thing to do, which is made or served, is it adequately priced? Should it be priced from this?  There was a dead crore of product but who is this despite Sony doing this three times, you have to see, you understand my point, if something is lacking in something like Nick Adidas, these are the branded ones that start.  The one which is rejected from the factory outlets, as long as it is cut or has some minor fault, but instead of Rs. 12000, you are getting that shoe in tax due to a small defect, so will you look at its specifications, who is what?  Who is it that he is worth so much? Oh brother, who is he to you for being so much, he is getting ₹ 8000 cheaper, so take it quietly, you understand what I am saying, no banna, learn the meaning from God, from the Gujaratis.  If you want to buy a lion then do the promotions of the company. Hey, leave the company. See, it is at mill rate and at what price it is served. The story is not like this and what is the maximum concentration and what is being said is in actual.  It is not even effective, those who are not gold big and who are Sir Fox conspiracies and at some place look at the project holistically and link everything with the rate, link it with the opportunity and alternative. Now link with the opportunity, this is not a product but brother, I don't know its pricing, Mashallah, don't know how much it costs, everything is great in it, the builder is great, this is great, the location is great, everything about you is great and brother, the rate is also great, very much.  And here is another product and here if you buy two people then their rental will be more than this, so in this way also you have to see that you ca n't just go by air or not, I have such a product which is such that absolutely no one can go anywhere.  Execution race, there should not be any doubt about that thing, because such a thing exists and if it does, then brother, you will get the risk reward ratio on all three times, this is the term which I want you to introduce it is very open used in share market but I want.  You introduce into d real estate market also understand d builder can style what apps d society can style and also understand d builder can style something which can come Touching society which is not a good think otherwise thinking about your proximity which was not better when you made decision so that risk bill always remains but you have to concentrate on the amount of risk which you are taking which can be this match this is This is what is d reward associated reward if it's so much risk lek gen is also happening so much and a little risk lek gen is so much happening  So I also give this reward ratio this machine fever give you and give us the possibility every time if you are buying something in 2018 plane and give also you are very match give the understanding has you be clear I am adding 20% Things are being allotted to me. 80 rupees have to be given to me after that, its execution is done. You have released if the construction link is plant.  So construction bill happen de only de money bill ko to de risk is content because it is linked with construction link plain something which is just timely which is used you be in de kaise of affordable housing in gurgaon alier ki that time nahi tha in 6 months  Now I have to pay, whether he has made the builder or not. In this matter, some four-five-seven projects are going wrong in Gurgaon because of this.  This fact about rule changed is construction that if this much construction will be made then that whole thing will be made then you have understood this think date real statement and the thing which is getting at the rate, now you have to analyze it, you just serve it and leave it after taking a can.  You give me brother, there is every suit, there is cloth, there is vest, there is any thing, there is a car, then he says to him on the car, hey, for how much is this also, see brother, what is the value of the budget.  But you have money, now you say one car, dog, no, there are two more bags in it, okay, the car worth six rupees has two more bags, so there will always be butter of course, okay, zero, you do 100 in one car, mother, take it in 7 seconds.  One is doing it in 12 seconds, that one is of 5 seconds, so which is this cross that you have given me to live? Hey brother, is that 5 seconds so important for you? At what price is it coming, tell me in what condition it is sold by Maruti. It is said that the vehicle is relatively relatively clean, there are few vehicles less in cleanliness, I have seen it in this way that brother, the price of the vehicle is so low that the person who owns a scooter and motorcycle can upgrade, now I am the risk factor. I am not checking inside the vehicles, I am checking inside this vehicle and scooter that a family member is going on a scooter, is it okay, is it safe or is he going in a cheap car? If you  the rest  If you do the comparison, my performance may have been lower because I know those ratings. I am not trying to defame anyone, this is in the public domain, everyone has star ratings but definitely that of you will agree with this fact.  Traveling for people traveling in other kar kitni un safekar ho kuch marji uski rating ho isse match se for de traveling on n scooter yeh to manoj to se think formulang property  This People Don't Understand Because God is a Rest and a Reward.
