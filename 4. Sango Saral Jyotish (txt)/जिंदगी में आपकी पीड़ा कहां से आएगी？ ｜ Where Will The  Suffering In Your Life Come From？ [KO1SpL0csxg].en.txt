Hello friends, today's topic is very interesting. I am telling you very simply in simple astrology, from where will the pain come in your life. Look, everyone faces pain in life, it is not like that, but you can get some idea as to where it will come from and it will come from there.  It will come so that we can get peace from it and then we will discuss about the solution to the pain also sometime, last time I had made it clear that your mind is in the moon in houses, if you had understood then today whatever we will talk about, we will talk about Shani ji, so what  Shani ji is suffering, yes, so it will be a very interesting topic, my topic of Sade Sati has become very hit, if you have not seen that video then definitely watch it, it is recommended from the playlist and tell me what you feel like doing, I teach astrology in such a simple way, so much astrology  There are so many channels, there are so many people and everyone is doing good work, to stand out in it and connect people easily requires a little effort, I think I have to move towards that, the house in your Kundali is Saturn which is signified by poor man, dry planet, dryness of emotions.  There is also pain in reducing, you should check that you open your Kundali, open your Lagna Kundali only And check in that horoscope where is Shani Ji sitting, in which house is he sitting, so if Shani is sitting in the first house, then there will be a life of pain, there will be a life of struggle, from where will the struggle come, means now that life itself has become like this, you should understand that the struggle  It is complete, now Shani ji is sitting, whenever I teach or tell anything about the placement of planet or any planet, I never feel bad about these are playing cards, some are butt and  If there is any loss in the living aspect anywhere, the material aspect will also do good there, I have already told this, you must watch my old videos, things have been explained very simply, so if Saturn is in the first house, then you will be a little serious.  And now you have to match this, take out your family's horoscope in all the horoscopes and make notes of the houses one by one, I will tell you everyone's horoscope is placed somewhere or the other, so match yourself, match the following, there are four in the family, extended family and the elder one  Family is of 10, 12, 15 people, then there are friends and sometimes someone comes into someone's life  If you are having pain or suffering, okay then you can come into it and ask him that brother, is it like this or is it going to happen like this, then you get to know a little bit, yes friend this is bound to happen, Saturn is a cold planet, wherever it sits,  It will cool things down, it will cool down that relationship, so if any planet sits in the lagna, then now all the aspects, lagna is very important, so your personality itself becomes such that you yourself are a cold person, cold means hot passion  No, there are no emotions, okay, if Saturn goes to the second house, the one whose Saturn is sitting in the second house, you can do it interchangeably with the zodiac sign also, that Saturn in Aries, Saturn in Taurus, I am also telling you a fact, but in that it will work about 50  But whatever is being told will work in the house 100%, you can understand this way, I am not complicating it further than that, if we go into advance then there will be a talk of views also, but I am not complicating it now, we will do it simply  Let's go first, Saturn is in the second house, it is cold, then you may feel something  You will like cold food or you will get cold food. There are many people who are destined to eat cold food only. These people have Saturn in the second house. They will either like cold food like ice cream or normal food like microwave, this is basically their fate.  You can see whether you can eat it after microwave or you can eat it cold, there will be no need to even microwave it, everyone has to taste it and write in the comment section, brothers, watch the video comfortably because it will be completed in this video  In my second house, it is also of your original family. I have explained what is original family and every relation from every house. You should watch the video. You will be hurt by your original family of parents, siblings.  In some way or the other, you will suffer some pain throughout your life, your assets will also be built with a delay, wherever Saturn sits it will cause delay there too, so when there is pain from one eye, it means that there is only physical pain, it can be emotional pain as well.  it can be physical pain it can be pain it can be a Disputer is also there, Disputer in the sense everything gets delayed, so your assets are also getting delayed, if you see it, Saturn goes into the third house, then third house is of younger sibling, it is of communication, you may get pain from there. Your email, your drafting, all these things pull you in the office or something goes wrong, that is where the pain comes from, communication happens with you, paper work happens, documentation happens, relationship with younger siblings happens  You are a little cold, you are suffering from there, you are suffering from younger brother and sister, you are suffering from some things in the workplace which I told you about, Saturn moves in the fourth house, see the fourth Saturn, there are many benefits in having each one. So today we are talking about the pain, where does it come from? Today we are not telling the whole story because what would happen if we tell the whole story. The video can be of three hours as well. We are focusing on one aspect today. It is not like there are only benefits too.  On some other day, Saturn is in the fourth house, which is the house of the mother, the place of happiness, then the mother  There will be pain from the heart or the mother will suffer; the opposite can also happen in the relationship, like there can be a problem in the life of the younger brother, if Saturn is in the third position, there is pain in his life, there is pain in his life, then there will be pain due to his pain also.  It is possible that this imagination has to be used, what everyone does in astrology, they do not do a little higher order thinking, they say that this was told to me, I have very good relations with my brother, but friend, it is possible that his life may go a little like this  It may be that because of that you may feel that the life of the brother is not going well, the younger brother's younger sister is not hurting him directly, but you are getting along with the way her life is going or you have to take responsibility.  What happens many times is that you have to take the responsibility of that person, so in that way it means outside in a way, in the same way if it is the place of mother in the fourth house, then mother is seen having bone problems a lot, which also  You are sitting with the fourth Saturn, tell me, there will be some issues like arthritis, osteoarthritis or many times the relationship with the mother will be cold there.  You will suffer because of that house, the construction of your house may get delayed, although a lot of things are constructed, I will tell you about it in a positive way, a lot happens in Saturn, I will not complicate it, who is looking at whom, who is eating whose zodiac sign, go to that and predict. We can do that but right now we are learning A for apple B for ball then Rohit is a good boy sentences will be made later we will go to Past Perfect Continuous later right now we are learning here that Saturn is in the fourth house so you guys have  I have learnt that brother, you may have some pain from there, heart is also included in it, you have reached an age from there also, there can be issues from there also, take a significant part of that house, you will find some issue there.  If we go to the fifth house, if the fifth house is of children then either the children will be delayed or there will be suffering from the children, there can be a disruptive love relationship, there can be a lot of romance as well, Saturn in the fifth means that they must have had a breakup and they cry very badly. if they have it, either they do not have a romantic relationship and  If it happens then they cry a lot in big heartbreak, they will keep crying that my wife is gone, my man is gone, in such cases it is okay to look into it, there are many digestive issues also, they have digestion issues, Saturn five is fine, fifth house has issues, Saturn sixth house  If Saturn goes to the sixth house because the house itself is like that, then maybe it will be a little negative but still you will face some trouble in the work place, from there you will face trouble in getting a loan, there may be a delay in taking a loan, its significance  You can get pain from your maternal uncle too, who is not a close family these days. Your mother's maternal uncle's younger siblings are also in the sixth house. Your maternal uncle's younger siblings are also there. You can find out about that maternal uncle's family.  You can also get it from this, you can see this, you can check and tell yourself from where is the shade coming, where is it coming from so that we can extrapolate it, I have the initial two- three shades now  Even the umbrella is seen in the house, that is extreme astrology which is the last point till here  this this this this so now if they start saying this 50 for each one then the 50th is the umbrella, okay so now how can there be any pain due to the umbrella, yes there too there will be some issue, prediction is very strong But I am dealing with it in simplicity right from the beginning that you will get it in this, otherwise you tell me where it is, okay, the seventh house, everybody knows that it is the seventh house of the husband and the wife, so Saturn in the seventh house will be a cold matter, that relationship will be cold.  It goes that wherever Saturn is sitting, it will make that relationship cold due to any reason, if there is a relationship then there is no warmth, now if it is someone's wife or husband, if Saturn is in the seventh house then that person's relationship with the spouse will be cold, but what is the relationship?  What is Saturn, if it does not break then the marriage will not break, what does Saturn do, it delays, denial, that is a good thing, it delays and things get right for those who have patience, so I will tell you one remedy for it here while we are on our way, from where  Are you feeling pain too, pain is bound to come Saturn is definitely going to come, he is holding everything somewhere, you have to surrender from that aspect, that pain is going to come and you have to have patience, the moment you will have the feeling of surrender where Saturn is and patience, your pain will end at 90, this is my  I promise, what a lovely remedy I have told you, in what a lovely way I am teaching astrology, there is no need to go anywhere and spend a lot of money on consultation, I am telling you myself, there is pain because everyone is carrying Saturn, who can run away, no one can run away  In the seventh house, now we come to the eighth house, the eighth house anyway belongs to the in-laws, so Saturn in the eighth house means relations with in-laws are cold, eighth house also deals with inheritance, so Saturn in the eighth house means parents will live longer, inheritance will get delayed and if the parents Not much delay means if due to some reason brother's inheritance is delayed or else there will be a court case with brother and sister also because inheritance is delayed then a good reason for inheritance delay can be that  If your parents are living for so many years, what will you get, if they are living for 90, 95, 100 years, then that is a good thing, then delay, someone or the other will cause pain there, okay, or you will suffer according to the eighth house  It is okay to check, I have seen researches also because if Saturn is in the eighth position and you start learning astrology or get involved in research in any thing, then you are only suffering because you are getting inside but this is a good thing.  There is pain, I keep giving small ideas in each one, wherever I get remedies, okay, wherever Saturn is there we have to be humilated or we will be made humid or if we lie down, then Saturn is fifth and fourth, which means Mata ji is lying down  It may happen to you or it may be that you become a cunning child and do them, this is the rule of a ritual, you have to bury yourself in this, if mother is doing it then take it, you know why it is happening friend, where Saturn is there, there is humiliation in the fifth house.  If I am there then there is going to be humiliation, the kids will humiliate me or the kids will fail or the kids will do something like this  that he will have to face humiliation, so this is a law of the system, with Saturn in the seventh house, if you look at it, he gets elevated, but brother will not leave his work, no matter how he gets elevated, he will do it, he will do it a little bit, okay now Saturn goes into the ninth house. Look, do not take stress, to be happy in astrology, first of all there should be joy in life, wherever you look at yourself, look at others, this is a Saturn technique, I am telling you a simple technique, you normally say 100 on 25 charts, but try it on 25 charts And make notes, it will work amazingly and then when it works you will realize that friend, I keep telling you in between, first thing is acceptance, second thing is surrender, the pain ends at 90, you can bear it at 10, okay so Saturn is ninth  If you go to the house, you may get pain from father but there is one more thing about father in Saturn, if you surrender there to father then no one will be there, you will serve him, if you start serving wherever Saturn is, Saturn is third Younger siblings serve in the house in fourth  Service to mother in the fifth, service to children in the seventh, service to wife in the eighth and if you surrender then the humility will automatically reduce, if someone is doing service then he will get friend but that will be reduced considerably, same work should be done in the ninth house.  We will have to understand what Saturn has to do with it, it is a pain and it means pain, I said pain or sorry pain, where will that pain come from, doing someone's work is also a pain and effort, isn't it? Saturn is a factor of effort as well, so basically you  You can use one more word that you will have to make an effort, it will be challenging there, father can attack or you can meet father, it will also be seen that it is related to religion also, Saturn will be there, so you will get your support from religion also. The ridge will be high, it can be a good thing or a bad thing for any religion, beyond that if Rahu and Mars do not come then it is good because if they come then you can go towards fanaticism.  So we will keep it simple for now, okay, only Saturn is visible, okay, so ninth house  Saturn is in my horoscope, there can be a delay in higher education because Saturn is also a factor of delay, you know that formula has to be applied everywhere because Dispiter starts with D, delay also starts with D, whenever there is some delay in life, Dispiter is late.  The flight is running, you reached late, you got something late, the food order came late, if it is disruptive then accept it, first of all, Saturn is in the seventh house, the marriage is getting delayed, so brother, you tell me that I have been waiting for 23 years  If I want to get married then your reference point is 23 years, if there has to be a delay then it will happen by 28, you will say I will definitely do it at 28, then brother it will happen at 33 because the delay is from reference point, see how much I am not enough for free  I am giving it to you, it seems to me that I am teaching simple astrology as well as New astrology, it's all a game of your mind, I want to get married at 24, my Saturn is in the house, it is 24, I did not get married, I am 25  what happened  If the marriage has not happened then it is happening and it is coming to fruition because if you had to do it at 23 then it will happen at 28, it is not that bad at 28, okay it is delayed as per your requirement but then it is according to the society  It is okay, so this is how Saturn works in the 10th house, Saturn in the tenth house will bring you humiliation at the work place, whoever sits with you will get forced humiliation, if there is the best scenario then it will be that you will not be humiliated, but you will not get fame either in the tenth house and  If you look at the work also, if you look at it, the tenth house in Kaal Purush's horoscope is the sign of Saturn, so that way it should not be bad and it is not bad also, but brother, the theory that I am following, the formula that I am teaching, that is  Saturn will work, it is not bad, it is fine but it will work, there will be many benefits in every thing that I have told, there are many benefits in each one, Saturn is in the seventh house, but if we tell you according to the house, then Saturn is in the tenth house in his Kaal Purush's horoscope.  so it no but this  That someone or the other will humiliate you, there will be some delay, there will be some delay in fame, something or the other will work out, you will get a delay in your life, Saturn will come intermittently, it will be late, Disputer is nowhere if you are sitting with Saturn 10 and you  You deserve the fame, it will be delayed but not denied, so we will not mind Saturn that much, whatever Saturn gives you, brother, it gives you something solid, if you mean something like that then you can touch it, it is not air and Rahu's  He gave it and then went away Saturn means it is moment by moment whatever you will get, you will get it due to your hard work not due to luck you will get it due to your hard work and you will definitely get it, there may be a delay but you will definitely get it, so have patience wherever you are, the opinion of Saturn is 11  Again, if it is the zodiac sign of Saturn, it does not mean that the person does not earn money. People with Saturn in 11 earn a lot but many times it happens that you did the work today and got the money after 10 months. There are many such people, I am also one of them.  the works which i do that  It remains that if you worked today, you get the money after 10 months, 12 months or sometimes after 14 months. But now what happens is that if you worked in January, you got the money in December; if you worked in February, you got the money in the next January; if you worked in March, you got the money in December.  You got it in the next March but then you completed that one cycle so you are getting it every month, you understand, you are getting it every month, so this is the delayed cycle that the payments get delayed but you keep working since you keep working.  If the work keeps happening regularly, whether you are getting the money regularly or that money is coming, then you are sitting with it, do it this way and this will happen with you, surrender a little, accept it, do not get irritated, what many people say that I  If I worked today, I will get the money after 10 months, then what is the use of doing some other work that I do it today, hey brother, work today, you will get it after 10 months, whoever works after a month will get it after that, then the cycle of flow will be formed, right?  You learn things from this simple astrology, okay now come the good Saturn  In 11th house you will have a larger network, front circle, you will get some problem or lesson from there also, in this way there is an elder brother as well as an elder sibling, so just like we told about younger sibling, you can also suffer from elder sibling as well.  It is okay in this case, now let's come to Saturn in the 12th house, Saturn in the 12th house, again if it is your bedroom life, then there is a human there, I understand that you may have performance issues, you are not a human, sex is not that easy for you but it is important  No, that means you should do 100% workout and many things happen that people mean there can be ifs and buts in it but your sex life will become cold now it is because of your shortcomings it is because of your spouse or because of differences  It is because of living in different places, your posting and reasons will be 150, so I am not saying that the meaning of Shani Bav house means that brother, you have some deficiency, you have some weakness, it is premature ejaculation, such thing  what am I not doing many times  There are many things which a person feels while telling that if I have told them then no, it is not like that, everything is fit, everything is good but there is some delay, okay, it does not mean that much, it can happen due to disruption, you have to use your imagination in human mind because  The things that are written in shlokas or rules are just statements, they can play out in a thousand ways, one should not grasp it immediately. By the way, many people do not need Saturn in the 12th house, it also happens in the mind.  If it is not done then this can also happen, so all these things are our own techniques, you see how for everything there is some remedy or treatment, for many things, so I have told you first of all, I have told you to accept it, even after that all that is there now  Things can be taught one on one, they are taught in paid courses, they are taught everywhere, it becomes very big, every thing means it is of two hours, one does not watch two-hour videos, then there is a feeling of devotion towards learning  it happens in a structured way but some of the issues will be worked out like this okay and you  I made a complete video, I gave a lot, the paid one is fine and now a good student can derive many formulas from this, how many formulas by doing higher order thinking that this will happen, that will happen and after seeing it, hold 25 Kundalis which you know  You don't have to go and ask the people whose life you are in, how is your program? You have an idea about the scene. So, as per the Kundali, if a marital issue has come up in Saturn's house, tell me, there is an issue in sex life, yes, it does n't matter, we will do it.  Okay, do this one like this, you do this, what do you do, it seems a bit difficult to tell everything at once, why I don't tell is because there is also an astrologer code, there are so many people who are making a living on astrology for me to become  Come to Cheap Popular and make everything 100% free, my subscribers will increase, I am a great man, I don't want to become a Sarpanch, nor do I want to become an MP, nor an MLA, I don't want votes, nor do I want to be Cheap Popular, my work goes better than other things, so Thatchi Community  to me  He said that friend why are you doing this, you can earn money from there, you are kicking us in the stomach, very right, that's when my Numol ji's videos stopped, you guys must have seen them a lot on youtube3, number seven, number eight, number four, number three.  After that they stopped, there were five issues left, people said when will it come, it will not come, it will never come, it is okay because everything was taken out and put into it, it cannot be made again, if such films are made at that level then many people will be hit hard  So still as easily as I can put curiosity in you, this is like primary school of astrology, yes we can take you, I can take you to PhD level, also but then at PhD level, confusion occurs in the beginning, so join yours first, if you  Whatever I am telling you is working in your life as I taught you, only then will you develop faith, you will enjoy it, only then will you have the confidence that yes, something is happening, take it straight to Ashtak work, take it to Mahadasha, take it here, take it there  Then go to Navamsha and take the big D60 predictions peacefully  A for Apple B for Boy, this is how things are learned gradually, so stay connected here for a while, if you want to see better and in-the-way technical content, then take the membership of the channel, many videos have been uploaded there, many of our workshops You can take membership of the channel which has videos and one more thing is very important, I have a course of about 12 classes of two hours each, Sango Saral Jyotish and discounts are also available on it, if someone has some Rakhi, then you must check it.
