Hello friends, I have been doing a lot of research in astrology. I am getting very good feedback through this channel. If you have not subscribed to the channel, then subscribe now and share these simple questions with your friends and family because it may be someone's  If you are facing the issue that I still do n't know the time, what should I do now, then if you do n't know the time, then we assume that you know the date, you know the year, you know the month, but you don't know the time, whether it is 5:00 in the morning  It was 5:30 in the morning or it was 2:30 in the night, it was around 2:30, it means there is a doubt in it, then one basic thing about it is birth time rectification which is done by an astrologer, but before that I want to tell you people  That any lagna which happens is of 2 hours and 120 minutes and is of 30° so 1 degree is covered in 4 minutes, so if your 29° is 29.5 28° or  If the ascendant is of 0° 1° 2 degrees, then the value of time increases a lot in it because the ascendant will change in just 2-4 minutes. If 1 degree is changing in 4 minutes, then one has to be very careful in it, otherwise if your  It is 15 degrees, 16°, 18, 20°, so we have a lot of questions, however knowing the exact time is always beneficial, the exact time because that also forms your conditions and when you have to take predictions in the future, you have to see that this event of mine  When will it happen, if there is a little variation in the time then even a variation of 2-4 or 10 minutes comes in the prediction of that event in every two-three months, but still by doing reverse engineering which is called birth time rectification, by checking that  Your event didn't happen, but after asking you, after asking you, after asking you, like they say, adjusting the needle, that too, well this one happened to you at the age of 31, I did n't get to know about it.  So if it happened in 30 or at this time, then he will note it down, then when did this happen, when did this happen, from that he will set your time exactly, many times, like someone's lagna is a simple thing, cancer is cancer lagna and  There is a Leo ascendant, suppose someone has Leo ascendant according to the time but actually he is Cancer, then just by looking at his face for 5 minutes you will know whether he is a Leo ascendant or he has a fiery nature  So brother, then the Leo ascendant seems fine, he is an emotional person, a cold person, a cold person, an emotional person cannot become a Leo so quickly, but it takes a lot of time and effort of the astrologer and of course the fees are also high.  It is because you do n't know the time. It is something like your report is not correct and you want to generate the correct one. It is possible but if you have n't even taken the date and you don't even know the date, then you have increased the degree of difficulty a lot. Yet there is some account I am not telling that here in simple astrology, but normally, if it is for many hours or even one and a half hours and there is no idea at all, then it becomes very hard, then we try to do it with the moon sign because the moon  The date of moon is based on the date and the date is like two days plus two dates and one day, so the time of the date is more, the date constellation is correct and the moon remains in one zodiac sign for two days plus two days.  If it remains then an attempt is made to do it but yes, that much detail is there in the chart reading and that thing definitely makes a difference in your accuracy but it does happen, it is not the case that another half an hour, 15 minutes or 10 minutes If you know the date and time then it becomes easy for him because he knows that this was the engagement so the next one cannot happen because it is near this side because in the next one he will have to wait for two hours.  If it has to be done then he will take this one, then it becomes easy for the astrologer because as you explained to him that one  There are 12 lagnas in 24 hours, so one lagna is of approximately two hours, so the lagna of two hours is of 30 degrees and 1 degree is covered in 4 minutes, so you can think of the whole game as  Those who are sitting with the lagna between 27 degrees and 3 degrees, they have to be very careful because that 3 degree variation is of 12 minutes, so if the time changes by 12 minutes here or there then the lagna can change and the one which is at 29 and exactly on the other side,  0 punt something then they have to be very careful so this is something now in this they will ask what time of birth is taken when the child cries because this has been seen in many hospitals also practically I am telling you guys that you have to  Be very careful in this also because if the old people do not know the time then it is okay, now the new people should know the time, now there is a clock, earlier the country was so poor, so many years ago there were no clocks, there was time  Where will we do it, the midwife used to be in someone's house many years ago, now it is in the hospital, so there was n't even a clock at that time, so what about now, when the child cries, it is the time, many times uncle cots him, then  And the hospital people write the time then or it could be that their watch is running a little late, the one who is supposed to write the time, the time is mentioned in the birth certificate, so brother, in foreign countries, which are developed countries, it is shown that the father is standing during the delivery.  So you will note down the time, this is not a culture in India yet, so whenever you need to check the time once because you can be correct even upto seconds and if someone is correct upto seconds then it is great, then it is not necessary to make that much effort.  You will have to put in an effort, there is so much technology today, that child's first birth time is the time when it happens, okay now that is your birth time, so put in a little effort, try to note down these stems  The more you take care of your cells, the more valuable they are, and you'll realize that over time, like stem cells help  You can do it and keep all those frills and such things, nowadays technology has come so you can find out the time, I am very surprised, there is no birth date of 1960, 50, you took the time of 70 also, okay, you did not take it at that time, but friend  It is happening in the year 2000 and right now you are still not able to get the time, so it is like that take the time, the country will be seen, you have the knowledge, you believe it or not, that is the time, so take the time of birth and our birth certificates  In the hospital it is kept in the records as a country tension but I feel it is quite loose, it depends on the mood of the nurse or the doctor or the assistant who writes it, yes I had this much idea that yes in this  Maybe this baby was born on time, otherwise by doing this it should be made fool proof, whether it is a boy or a girl, the father and mother of the child being born would not know about it, there she is delivering the child so there is some relative Put in a little effort, not much; put in a little effort, it will take you time  You will get to know that there is no problem in that, whichever nurse is going in there or that person, ask them that how do you people write this time because practically most of the people are taking their own time and the time of many is several minutes out.  If it is there then things get a bit out of place and then they say hey you did not tell me the right thing, you did not tell me on time, now he will say that he will tell me on time, now you bring the reports from up and down then the doctor will tell you according to that report only, you will have to wait for the birth  People don't know the time, so just put in a little effort to find out the birth time of those who don't know it, then it will be told after looking at the horoscope of the children, if you know the time of the children, then this was it, thank you very much, subscribe to the channel Like it if you haven't done it yet, thank you very much
