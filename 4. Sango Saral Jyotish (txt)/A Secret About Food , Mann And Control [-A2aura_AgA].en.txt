If papa and mummy are listening to papa ji, then there is a need to create awareness among children and in society, there are small warnings in it too, so listen carefully, your mind is its factor, moon, we know this is basic astrology, I have explained it in earlier videos  I also taught you that moon and mind are one thing and moon is also a factor of food which we eat, so if you can control someone's food then you can also control his mind, now that food is bad or junk  In the way of food or in the Satvik way, as they say, as the food is, so is the mind; that is absolutely correct; we become like what we consume. So, if you want to make someone something, there are both positive and negative connotations for it.  This has to be used very responsibly, just like you would keep eating readymade food instead of eating it in the dust and dirt.  You will keep eating food which is made for profit, you will keep eating food made by the hands of such people who are themselves unhappy, okay, if you are unhappy in life and not happy, then that sadness will spread in your life as well, there is a hostel there  He is an employee who earns Rs 12,000 and has to cook food three times a day, his shifts are long, he has no relaxation, he is unhappy, he will make so many people unhappy that there is no cure for him, so the most good thing that I want is for this video  First through the medium because I am telling it according to astrology but in practice there is no substitute to eating food prepared by your own hands because these hands are mine, whether they are washed or not, they are clean, how do I know their status, I eat this food with my own hands  I am cooking for them only, I have bought the food myself, the vegetables, flour and all this, and I am cooking this, this is very significant, this mummy's kitchen, aunty's food, tiffin service, this so and so threat, hey brother, the food of the lady of the house Its value is decreasing in the market and many people say that it should not be done  yes, we do not, we believe in this thing and we do not do it. mostly because of the income, you are not near, mother is not near, wife is not near, many times women have stopped making it in the houses, okay, so that is a big fact that you should control that  Look at the mental state, look at the mental state, the person who is cooking the food, a troubled man, a sad man, a sick man, a little sad mentally, physically ill, if you eat food cooked by such a person, you can never be happy, all our food, all that energy goes into it.  And it can also be seen, how is the texture of the roti, how quickly it is prepared, how is the tadka applied, how is the salt, how is the water left like this, all this becomes known, from the big utensil to the smaller utensil, then to the smaller utensil and then to the tiffin, then to your house, then to your house  When I take the food from that tiffin to your utensils, after changing five to six utensils, till the time you put it in, what was it first, the food that was being cooked, in the old times it was put in from there and put in such a way that it was just here  You prepare it and eat it directly, it does not go through six vessels, so this is also a great technique, consumption pattern  By making changes, the British made us addicted to tea. Here in India no one used to drink tea, there was no concept of tea at all. Now see, in India, tea would be so important that even the son of a tea seller would know that tea would be so important to you.  Just look at the tea, it is okay, tea is in our life, India cannot function without tea, there is cutting tea everywhere, this is tea, there is the tea seller, this is readymade tea, it is in the office, brother, you will have tea, you will have tea and coffee, tea and coffee, like this Work isn't done without it, they gave it to me, now I can't leave it, but what did we drink before this, think about it 400-500 years ago, when the British had not come, 300-400-500, even when they had not come, they would have done something  must be so, what we used to do, I mean what we used to do was that whatever we felt like getting some energy from, we controlled it, so this packaged food from outside is fine, this old juice, I don't know when it got out of the box.  It is put inside, I don't know when that processed food was put inside, now like in a foreign country  You are already eating the old idli, everything is made fresh in India, otherwise you made the batter for idli in the morning and ate it, you took out fresh dosa dough, it is dirty and the roti is absolutely fresh, this much freshness is definitely available somewhere no this bread brute for four days, five days, six days even now in villages or some places in Haryana the milk is taken out or poured like this and so this food is very important you see if your mind is not under your control then you should see that your food is also under your control  It is not in control, people who don't or can't control their food, then the mind will never control it, so when you say that this rich man is eating with great tantrums, I will have this or kado with this and art bread and this juice, this is how we feel  He is choosing, brother. Whatever tantrums he is throwing, you feel that he is eating what he feels like eating, and whoever feels like eating what, he is getting it and eating it, so his mind is not in his control.  You have to understand it like this, how deep and simple astrology it is  I am telling you simply, you should adopt this thing, if your mind is not good, your mind is not good, when the mind is not good, you have seen in families, earlier they used to say that the way to a man's heart goes through the stomach, heart, i.e. one can control the heart as well Women, when they don't see, whenever we are there, we have been invited for dinner, the prime minister is meeting, dinner is being had, the king is meeting, dinner is being had, that meeting of the minds, eating food is very important, you tell this to someone, right?  Invite for dinner, you want promotion, invite boss for dinner, so why invite boss for dinner for promotion, I mean why not work, work more, work a lot, why for dinner, by inviting him for dinner you can turn his mind towards you, did you understand what I am saying  And you will have to feed them good food, then it becomes a part of their mind, food has a huge link with the women who know how to cook good food, look at the present time in 2024, you will see that they knew how to cook well in 1980, they knew how to cook well in the 90s, they knew how to cook well in 2000  You did n't get any benefit from his claping, in my opinion  It has happened, it is not that it did not happen, but in 2024, those who know how to cook, whether they are men or women, their life will be very good, their mind will be under control and they can turn others towards themselves whenever they want, because just  Imagine someone who feeds you very good food, prepared by his own hands, can you ever become hostile towards him? Think for yourself what is wrong, I mean something good, let's say it is potato paratha or any of your favourite vegetables, dal, or anything else.  She made some very tasty Rajma Chawal, you will become exactly like her, you will respect her from within, very good, so when we know this, then why don't we learn it ourselves, why don't we teach it to the children, why do we consider this a lowly job, this is very easy Cooking is a high level job. Cooking is going to be a very high level job. You will not depend on any such thing as Zomato. You will cook and eat food at your home with your own hands. Teach your children, share the video and this is such a Although it is an art and technical channel of astrology, you get to learn everything. You know, I have four more channels, but I put the data in this one only. Think for yourself, 25 years ago, the population of India was 100 crores. I am giving these figures orbital, these are not calculated figures because no one has done a survey, but I am giving you an example to explain that if there were 100 crore Indians 25 years ago, then the people who used to feed them were 25 crore, that is, 25 crore people used to cook food and the remaining 100 crore  They used to eat food, it could be mummy, it could be the cook, it could be Raj ji, it could be the ones from the hostel mess, it could be the readymade garments guy, it could be the hotel guy, it could be any person's kids who used to make food in it for profit.  Is it being sold or is it available at home or is it available for free or someone is making it himself and eating it, what I am trying to say, now we have become 140 crores, from 100 to 140 crores and I believe this That the number of people who cook food has reduced these days, so suppose 25 years ago if 100 people used to cook food in India, then their total job was cooking food, I am not saying that it was their profession  It was there but they used to cook food whether they were housewives, bachelors, divorcees, elderly people, kids, mess staff, hotel staff, any human being, child who is Indian, if 100 people used to cook food 25 years ago then even now brothers  Sisters, I am saying that only 80 or 70 are being made, then if the number will be 140 crores, then earlier one person used to feed four people, suppose today one person is feeding six people, let's say I am trying because  If food from that hotel is going to so many houses, then he is feeding one, two, three, four, five staff, you understand what I am saying, so this is automatically becoming a in-demand skill, that is what I am trying to do This video from Clarity for Truth is also available  I was going to like it because this content is going like that but still I am launching it on astrology only, that's why I am saying subscribe to all my channels like Life Sutra, Clarity for Youth, Real Estate Guruji from Gurugram and  This simple astrology which is being consumed by everyone, its dots are getting more clear that what we have to do, how easily through astrology and with the help of some logic and numbers I told you that brother if your child is sad then cook food yourself  Start doing it or start eating hand-made food of such a person who is a little happy, whose mothers are unhappy, their mothers have to come and say that also listen, it is like this, you cannot be happy for what ever reasons, many times women are not happy  If they have issues then the husband will have to learn to deal with them himself, the kids will have to learn or someone will have to be brought who is a little happy because then there is no use in getting sick because many times we cannot make someone happy, he makes many things happy by crying  There are people who cook it after crying, that is why the food gets spoiled, which you Why do people remain unhappy in normal hostels or places like these? Because one man cannot make many men anyway and the biggest reason, I told you, is that when your food is as many utensils as you want  It changes the layers, the taste of the food gets spoiled, its soul gets destroyed, the less you can keep it, earlier it used to be just like a phulka, from there like this and directly in the plate and in the food it is not like this, in six places in the casserole, then there then  It's not like this, it's going to six places, the question is, here whistles are being blown, then it's coming down, tadka is being applied there, then it's going in the big one, from the big to the small, like this, then in the small bowl, he puts this thing  Understand that this is a very important thing, you people have to share this thing and please like it and in the comment section you will find the Jyotish Webinar Info Group, if you are not already connected to that webinar group because we keep conducting a lot of webinars, so please join it.
