Hello friends a very unique thing is happening in Gurgaon real estate and this is a very positive thing which we have not witnessed normally what happens normally is when a property is bought and sold specially ready to move in which we talk of resale property  There is a unique thing happening in it that sellers from Gurgaon want full check deals, they want full check that you do not witness such things may happen in daily which is very very positive because the seller from Gurgaon or who was a while buyer who ever purchased  He is a very educated person, he knows about capital gains tax, he does not want to deal in any wrong way and he knows that today you will also get the knowledge of capital gains because everyone in Gurgaon knows it, so if you do not know  If it was Rs 2 crore, then you will know that capital gain tax of up to Rs 2 crore can be adjusted if you have held the asset for a long time. Secondly, if it is in the name of two people, then it will be Rs 2 plus two crore for that property.  Now you can buy and adjust in two properties by the government, earlier it was adjusted in one property, now with the changes in it, you can adjust in two properties, so very neat and clean, very good deals are happening  Yes it is a very very happy matter and what will be the benefit of this that the base rates of Gurgaon on which the deal will be done, if somebody has bought something worth Rs. 3 crores and the registry has been done for Rs. 3 crores, then if tomorrow he sells it for two, four, five, six or seven  If he sells it in next year then this becomes his base rate. Now even if he sells it for four to five years, he can still adjust it. And mostly the husband and wife are buying it together, so he gets even more profit when the individual name  You can adjust it to 2 CR, so what will happen is that it is becoming difficult for Delhiites to buy property in Gurgaon, what has happened to the properties of Gurgaon which are not of A list builders but of B list builders.  There is no C list builder's properties, their rates have started increasing  Yes, it is attracting the people of Delhi, so when the rates of C increase, then those of B will also increase because B is better than C and A is better than B, so this phenomenon has started, you will see this phenomenon in newspapers and on social media.  You will feel it after four to five months in the public domain in the media, you are feeling it yourself, so tell me, there are many positive things about it, it creates a lot of transparency and ease of buying and one gets a clear cut home loan, you have registered for Rs 2 crore. So you will get a clean loan of Rs 1 crore 60 lakh. So the customers and the gentry of Gurgaon are getting separated. It is a very long journey of a city in that journey, as it is said that one track has become very good.  Here you will find more of those people with double income and high loan taking capacity, those who work in full cheque deals, you will see them more, especially in the resale of flats of a top builder, this is the phenomenon which is playing  out then i thought i Let me tell you people and you should take cognizance of this thing, how it affects you, this is a reality and people are willing, yes, if I have to pay more for the registry, then I will have to pay, it is a very good thing, so this is something which  It is good for the country, good for the economy, good for the end user, people who want to stay for the seller also and for the subsequent buyer because the whole chain reaction happens once the mess is spread in the property of Delhi, you know what I am saying  I am telling you how buying and selling is correct, so here that is a better thing and a good thing, so I hope you guys enjoy knowing the trends first, subscribe to the channel, like it, take the membership of the channel, thank you very much
