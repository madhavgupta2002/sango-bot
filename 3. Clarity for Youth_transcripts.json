    "title": "02 Burgers , 1 Movie And Gold Digger Girls [I8hRBaeD7Ww].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, a ridiculous situation has taken place between boys and girls of India who call Loveratri. This is how I came to know about the things late and there was a conversation and at one place I had gone to attend a lecture etc. and I was having a discussion with a youngster, so there I had a discussion.  There were boys, there were girls and there was some joking and there was also a conveyance in it, so I want to tell you the same thing that these days people call them boys, what do they say as boys, just like in the language of UP two burgers are called.  She gave some girl an Uber ride somewhere, gave her money, showed a picture and she broke up because it didn't work out, they say girls are gold diggers, meaning she is gold, I said for a gold digger girl, you must have gold.  Also, if you want a gold digger's English, you have learned it very well from the foreigners. If you look beyond that, then in the context of who is the gold digger, it is said that an old man or an old man has 50 years and crores of rupees and then  Young girl is said in that context, brother, those of you who are 23, 24, 25, 26 year old boys, no gold digger of yours is coming to you, does any girl come to you to chat, to say hello, to see?  If it's a dozen work out then think about it, every time a girl leaves you just see that she does n't smell, I'm looking fine, I'm fine in talking, I 'm fine in thinking, so question these things.  You are speaking directly to her, maybe she is going to tell me sometime, what was the reason, Guru ji like us, I am telling you, there was a picture, if you people have seen the old small thing, 1976, Amol Palekar and Ashok in it.  Kumar is Colonel Wilfred D'Souza, he has four other names, you understand that I am the same Ashok Kumar, okay, and he also takes huge fees, I also take fees, okay, and nowadays I give training, so those who are stuck.  I am here to give clarity to those who are having a broken heart, so I wanted to tell you this, I will try to give it for free, if you want through workshops, I will give it as you want, please tell me, write in the comment section.  But don't force all the girls to act like sour grapes, because the competition in the dating scene has ended, most of the boys have become losers and the two, four, five, 10, who are in good shape, have their brains.  It works properly and they are feeling that the swan will peck at the grains and the crow will eat the pearl. So they are feeling that the crows are eating the pearls. Are the crows eating the pearls? Maybe yes, they are eating but they are well mannered and intelligent. So now they are  It seems that girls, oh my God, this means that it has become like this, oh brother, learn it, understand that yes, now there will be no one from Switzerland that girls from Switzerland will settle in India and their  You will meet those who awaken wisdom and consciousness, this will not happen, these are the girls of India, they cannot be brought from outside, they have been born today 23 years old, cannot wait 20 years that a new girl will be born, then she will be 20, 22, 23 years old.  You will think of dating her and she will be very nice, by then you will be 45 years old, that girl who will take you somewhere, as Acharya Prashant says, marry the one with whom you have to have a relationship.  Do something that takes you somewhere, neither is it worth going somewhere, nor are you worthy of going, and I ask, is it necessary to go, even if you don't go anywhere, is it okay? Life has to be spent, something has to be done here, or a program has to be created.  They have become so now, go under the guidance of people like them, they come to us after wandering, then you will live a loser life for 20 years, if you will not even earn money, then you will not even get a gold digger, why 45 years of gold is nothing. You have two burgers, two burgers, two dosas, I mean, I am saying this, friend, don't insult women so much, if you are a gold digger in actual, then it is okay, you have taken some gold, you have taken some in your hand, if you will take some actual.  It is understandable that what can be found in two burgers and two dosas, you mean that she ate them, now you have any girl's message for all the men and young men out there that if a female or a lady comes.  To you a young woman and you go somewhere to eat, you are spending this is the bare minimum you can do because he also got her company so you got a kind of conversation so basic you know civil which is dead civil what Nowadays people don't even know about this, people only know about 498 and this is what is the condition of Andrew Tate. Look at the condition of those who follow him. Look at the rest.  I feel good, if you hate me, then why do n't you do this? Now girls see that all the boys are gay cases, that is, many boys are like that, come on, I will tell you by giving more examples, the video will be interesting, why practical, many of our talks happened like that.  I am telling you point by point, I am a boy who says that if Guruji takes food then there is gender equality. If there is gender equality then brother, give me both the money, why should I give, I am a tough boy, oh crazy butch, which equality?  He is talking about that females go through menstrual cycle for five days. Do you also go through it from 13 years to 48 years? Where is the equality? Whatever discussions are there about equality, this is equality to give opportunity to women. Other wise opportunity should be given to their base talent.  And the one who has to give and take in life, it is one on one, that's all for him, there is no equality etc. friend, females and  Males and Men are Women are different, they are not equal, they are not even the same, so don't do this competition, all the men are telling you, you all should get a program of 5 days from the age of 13 to 48 years, that is, 35 years.  One day you will multiply five by five into 12. For 60 days, if you multiply 60 by 35, how much will you get? 2100 days, 2100 days. Wear a sanitary pad and keep roaming around from morning to evening. Then I ask how much fun it is. You will get equality in life and then if you have to do it then the child will come out of you as a brother and that too will be a caesarean and you will have to keep it for months and there will be nausea too and then it will be like that. After all, you have to feed the milk to the child with your body. I have seen the condition of many women who do not feel ashamed. Boys, do n't you have mothers? You were not born to anyone, do n't you have sisters? Brother, at least a little, at least a little heartbeat.  Shouldn't it? Yes, it's okay, you scoundrel who says that people are like this, they use such words, everyone in the world does it, people of every religion do it, people of every caste do it, people of every gender do it, the rich do it.  The poor do it, everyone does it, then he is not alone in it, it is called a cunning person, but some women have divorced, it is such a thing, I want to tell you one more lovely thing, this is enough which is our squeeze, is n't it?  things  I am telling you the points of, it was a very good session, if you want it to be virtual then take membership of the channel, you will get a lot of clarity on this, you will get to understand and learn about it in a very lovely way, first of all you will do one thing in life.  Tell me, if there is a late marriage in any relationship, if anything happens, who has more chances of pregnancy? Who has more chances of pregnancy? The man has to say 'sorry' and run away in a minute. What is the loss?  What can ever happen to a man is the worst that can go on with the man and what can happen with the female, there are issues inside her body because she will choose the partner, she will always have the choice of male and female if you live on the net.  Go inside the nest, chicks are laid there too, you tell me, the nest irritates men, there is a problem in taking them home, why should I take those eggs there?  It is the job of the bird to give, but the nest is made by the bird. All the birds build nests and call the bird. Come, come, I will tell you in a big and sweet way. Listen carefully. Peacock and Pee Haan Pee Haan is no more beautiful than anywhere else.  Peacock is beautiful Peacock dances like this with all its feathers like this To attract Peacock that date me with me And if I say like that then Peacock is everything in itself Survey all  It is very strong, its feathers are good, it is beautiful, it knows how to dance, all the things are useful, but brother, even there the peacock has to impress the peacock, when the peacock has everything, then why wouldn't this thing be there in the human beings?  It would mean why do you get into trouble in this, there are lions, there is a pride which is said by lions, in any animal kingdom the men or those who are male have to work hard to attract the rest of the females too.  There is work everywhere, they also have to do it, so they have to do it so soon, I mean, I am saying that they have stopped becoming men, it seems that men are feeling like they have to become princesses, it seems it is becoming a man.  World men are running world. Yes, females feel that they have got the opportunity, it is not less, it is not, it is also men who have made the rules, this is the truth of life, so please think about this thing a little.  To end the points so quickly, if anyone wants a good dating scene, wants a good married life, wants to attract a good partner, he has to stop hating the thought process. Sometimes what happens is that you do n't have it in you, I am saying this.  That more than half and one more thing was my point like all of them are masturbating and looking at the pawn, so who is in the pawn, are you looking at an animal, looking at you are a woman, okay see, you are a woman, such a gay.  type  The instinct of men is not there, so for example, if someone does not like Rasgulla, then he would like to see Rasgulla, he would want to eat Rasgulla privately and secretly at night, or he would say I don't like it, but the problem is that he is not getting it.  The program is no longer set, it's just your intellect and consciousness, you have to become a tough boy, you have to hate women, if you are getting happiness by hating women, you are reaching somewhere, your conscience and consciousness are awakening, you know.  No, they are going on very big spiritual paths and don't know what they are uprooting, so please continue, but this is the only reason to cry, the cycle is like this, it will get stuck and will have to come back again in 45, 46, 48 years. You will get married again and will be the same.  If you will marry someone who might have been divorced at that time or something like this might have happened, then you have to remember this point and in the comment section, there is a group of thought that it should happen by force. Here I am not asking you to perform Aarti, I am saying that by keeping trade and negativity within you towards women, your life is not going anywhere, you are not happy, you have self-esteem issues, fix your face, if face is fine.  If it is not there, then correct the intelligence. If the intelligence cannot be corrected too much, then keep the tongue a little sweet, maintain some manners and etiquettes, be a little civil, talk a little politely, that too will do the trick. I know that not everyone has a lot of money and it is not that women are doing it only like this, everyone is watching, everyone is watching, everyone is like this, look, even the boys are watching which boy is there.  I wish to marry the next girl, no one wants to but it is a transactional work, I will do a course on relationship someday and will teach it, this is all for now, the boys are not so decent, they are also constantly looking at me, how does it look like a kiss?  She comes from a family, is she doing a job, how many jobs is there, how much money is there, what will happen, don't think so well, I am telling men like you are such a woman, you would not have tolerated it, just be calculative and see because Once her program happened with someone, a brother of marriage, after that she became the mother of his child. In the marriage market, she has a liability of a child and pregnancy and the body also has the effect of pregnancy and the child, the man is like that. What's the matter with a man? Husband and wife can't live. Both of them were playing, roaming and enjoying. One fine day, the female gets pregnant. The man's job is going on well. His friends. Nothing is happening in his body here.  His first trimester Nausea starts coming out of the stomach, heavy pain in the back, many hormones inside the body, up and down, vomiting or the end, he doesn't know what hits, after that the baby comes, the baby clings to him completely, one and a half  All the years she has to drink milk and milk every morning, what is the change in the life of a wet baby, she has the same job and will always remain like this, so brother, if she has to bear all this and she wants to be very sure of which.  Man She Will Do All This Stuff And Which Man Will Be Of Some Help And Consequences And Will Make This Experience Worth It Because It's Very Uncomfortable For Her  The thing is these days, there is no difference between girls and boys in terms of what they desire, to have fun, to travel, to enjoy food, to enjoy job, money, they are a little more choosy, that's it, now you get rejected, sometimes why are you so sad?  Do you feel that you are going to marry someone like this? So if you check then it is okay. Now when she is checking then you don't have the body which used to be attacked in old times, so you can marry a powerful man. want to get married  If you were there then this is the best of the times. The boys who are 5 feet 4 inches tall are the boys who are 5 feet 6 inches tall. They are short boys who are not attractive. Their complexion is not as per what is required in the marriage market. Personality is not great. Hair is not that much. Rajesh Khanna.  Look at any other actor, old or new, the only thing you have is that brother, if you are in a good job, you will get married, then this is the best of the time for old men. In those times, they used to be beaten and only the fittest could survive. That whole animal kingdom was going on. Today you have shares worth 50 lakhs in your demat. You have a flat worth 70-80 lakhs. You have a car worth 7-10 lakhs. Your clothes are fine.  You are wearing your mobile. Mobile is fine, you are conversing fine, you are employed at the right place, you have salary statement, ITR, Fatir, show Form 16. A1 was saying, show Form 16.  For this, you have an eligible bachelor and all these programs are not suitable for you, then you will have to fix them. You had all these points. I hope you all liked it. Please share, like this video and subscribe to the channel.  If you want to take membership, then take it. This workshop is going to be held to look into the minds of youngsters who want their freedom from this thought process that women are bad, women are also bad, men are also bad, elders are also bad.  Children are also bad, Indians can also be bad, community can also be bad, people in religion can also be bad, foreigners can also be bad, businessmen can also be bad, teachers can also be bad, anyone can be bad.  Yes Guruji, even an astrologer can be useless, a doctor can also be useless, someone can be good, so why bother with this, many doctors create a lot of mess, so why do negligent doctors stop providing treatment? Drivers in taxis often meet with accidents. Do you stop sitting in a taxi? Do you get food poisoning while eating? Do you not eat outside? People go out to so many places. Due to overcrowding, a stump gets filled there and a fire occurs.  So don't go there, everyone goes to all the places, so they do all the work, then with girls, if something goes wrong with 100 boys, a thousand boys go wrong, one lakh boys go wrong, then brother.  145  There are crores of people, you won't have to do this, learn these eight, what is that method? Most of all, I ask one simple thing, brother, why do you attract such girls? Don't you know some formula to attract good girls, brother? Many times.  It happens that many flies are coming somewhere, why are they coming, do you understand why is something going somewhere, maybe there is some dirt in you which needs cleaning so that such girls do not come to you again, you are a fool.  If the making girls had come then you would have understood why you are such a fool. I hope you all will enjoy attending the workshop. Please write in the comment section. Thank you."

Listen to it carefully and understand it. Most of the people and those who are going through two extremes of emotions on the day of Taj with super excitement, I will tell them what to do.  The most important thing is that if something good is happening in life or if some achievement has been achieved then this is your speak, this speak has to be controlled a little, you have your own generic approach, a middle one.  Text Neutral Apply Text Something Good Happens in Life Be Celebrated Be Little Beat Exide Come Back You This Neutral Don't Be Hair Because Sting Hair Bill Make You Like Come After That Straight Then You Will Fall Here When Something Goes Wrong in Life When Home Is Here So Growth Is Here A Little More  Try you come back always find this your speed like it is not brother 65 70 KMF will be the best mileage if you are at 100 then ahead at 70  When it came to 40, then went to 70, you have to look at this thing, we also call it Sustainable RPM, if we do it in the language of any engine, if we make it most optimal, that is this emotion and you are so big, come on, give the party, man.

You should understand further in life. Third, many people are wrong about me. Third, let me tell you one more. Two, I had promised. Third, what are you doing wrong while leaving, people have made their life auto.  Have put it on pilot type, will pick up the story in the morning.  Will go, do something, something will happen to them and two-four-five-10 years of life will be spent like this, Goddess, let life just take you, don't take them, groom them, then give me the bill. Find out friend, where did I get stuck, the bus is also dirty, how is this atmosphere.  Hey, who did I marry? Hey, what happened? It was not due to any thought process, because Sir Khel to Dil Dil Ka Achcha wala was going on and the second one, Manjhi Champi, was roaming between extreme excitement and depression. Should not be done, what are you doing for the sake of excitement, are you doing like statement, it is okay in the child, too much, but these days, if the child keeps teaching it constantly, then it becomes a problem, it is getting excited about certain good things happening to you. But don't mean date John but you match time because only then you must have noticed in relationship if you have seen the trend of celebrities they have a breakup in.

If it is a family channel then it doesn't tell but you know that you get over a mother and get this and the time is going well, where did you go to wander about, then like this, you look at the rest, yours is going stable, it is relaxing.  No then what is the joke? Like, the problem is that when you go to your office, you get stressed there. The problem is not that you are not having fun, the problem is that if you sing a song there, then you need recharge from that story.  The problem is that you are earning money, you have to be very focused in life, do n't put it on auto pilot, every day when you are living life, you are very busy, you just don't say that I don't have time, the condition of people.  What is happening when you eat food? Any person in life, here we have brain, its processing speed is same but we have named it like this, naming people for such small things. Need a consultation. It is very interesting. I hope I can tell you in this example that you should leave everything for a bit and do not dwell in these two extremes.

    "title": "02 Things To Ask HR When You Get Your Appointment Letter In New Job [okaTM-40sGU].en",
    "content": "Yes, hello friends, I want to give a clarity to this war, I want to give appointment letter, when you get a new job, then there are interviews etc. and then after that you get the job. In this rush to get the job, you have to ask one thing which people ask.  No and why don't you ask Sharma shy or brother or become like you are getting a job, this will be a big thing, do party, that's what your duties will be today, what will be the workers, what will be the actual scope of work?  It will be reduced on weekends, it will not be done, and today it will be harassed, it will not be done, the startups here are giving tech prides that brother, we sleep here, they are ready, they want to keep showing off like this and the one below, yes, we too. Passion, are you ready, that is the color of nonsense in a startup person. Whose startup is there, if he kills his employee with him, then he will eat anyway, but the established good ones, you have to ask others. Sister-in-law is not asking many people, you can ask 4 by doing this here and here and will send it to this person, then the story will be written in the email, you must have done something, otherwise tomorrow when it will be rubbed, this thing will get damaged, then you will have some return.  There is something in it, I am not saying that you have to hit the bus on the first day itself, or that you should make a presentation on Saturday or on Sunday or you will do it, it is a little less, it is quarter ending, this is no, not on the first day.  but you have to see this That you were told because that company tells you everything that if you get a laptop then you will not be able to do second moonlight, you will do this, you will be fired, give you so many days' notice, they consider everything as theirs and give it to you, they sign everywhere with you.  You have to disclose this, you have to do that, you will not do it like this, otherwise you cannot ask me a basic thing, then you have seen how helpless a middle class servant is in a job, a maid has come, right, she would have asked, how many utensils are there for how many people? man's food  It has been asked that when one has to kill, one goes around the house and sees how dirty the house is, how big this house is, it is 500 yards, this gives an idea as to what rate to charge, it is 1500 square feet, it is 2000 square feet.  The flat is of 3000 square feet, one on Rahat, the shoes come out and all she does now is put the shoes inside. In many families, the shoes come out. Do you know in North India or in general India?  If it is right, then it is right, just right, this is D general cleverness, because if the people living there are very drunkards, then their stronghold will expand more, in such a situation, he is not ready to do anything less because he knows that money can only be bargained for so much, sometimes people  Many people say that they think that we are comparing ourselves with the media, but I am telling you that I am not comparing you with the media, I am your maid, you are in a very good position, the power is yours to do everyone's job.  I have gone through MED also, I have become less while taking a job in the middle class, I am not able to even ask the basic things, Hey brother, how many days will I reduce, how many hours will I reduce, please tell me something, I will come to office at 8:00, I will come at 9:00, story 9:00 By saying 5:00, you will not change my life from 8 to 8, if you do then tell me now, tell me a little more, I will give you this much, I will also see my compulsion, let it be clear cut mentally because of that.  What happens after that, the Chinese system starts, in the beginning there is training, there is a little late relief inside China, there is a little late relief, it was not known that he had said five of eight, he had said five of nine, he had called 9:45  Sometimes they called for 8:30, then made 5 1/4 of 5, then made it 5:30, then sometimes it became 6, and then sometimes it will become a habit, then the whole public will sit, then they will say that it happens like this here only. Brother, yes, this happens, then ask once carefully because that person will remain worried. Jobs everywhere are limited to Rs 40-50-80000, but there are many jobs where you can get ₹ 10, ₹ 20 thousand less.  You but you have time and mother's peace, those jobs, you people should go towards them and there is no harm in clearing it in the beginning, after that you are going to get a chance because you cannot just ask, when everyone has given up everything.  Everything will be fine, then what will he even ask from him? When marriage talks are going on, then only he is asked, Jain, keep the promises, that's a different thing, you may lie, lies are also told, but you can still ask him, ' Brother, please'.  Tell me what is expected of me, what is my role, what is my work, what is my work, I make 1000 less than a person in a startup, do anything, do this, do that, do this, do that, do everything  will speak again He is less than very clear, he will just tell you that friend, he has not come today, if the tea seller has not come, then it means today is your turn, you are a junior, you have to get your cleared, do not panic with your mouth open and if you are like that then we should not talk about such things.  Even I don't open my mouth, then you will get rubbed in the job. Remember, if you want to open your mouth this much, please spread the awareness. Thank you very much."

    "content": "Hello friends, today's topic is very simple, I will tell you 2 to 3 things which you should not put into too much discussion and debate and two to three things which you should put into and on which you should focus, it will seem a little counter intuitive to you because it is absolutely fine.  It is opposite to what has happened, but you try it in your life, try it for one to two months as per my advice, completely remove these things from your mind, I will also tell you a little reason, I will not say just don't do this, I will also tell you a little reason.  that because of this you Avoid and what things to discuss, where to focus, focus there, the first thing is global warming, the earth will end, we should do like this, nothing should be done, everything is being looted, water is coming, everything is being looted, mangoes will be looted.  There is a request to the public, brother, don't focus so much on this, just concentrate on this, it is not practical, that is why I am telling you because this is a very layered complex thing, where there are experts in the government, our politicians are leaders of the government, they level it. but cheese  They have to be dismantled and the day they are dismantled, that day is nothing but following us. Stop the polythene. You stop doing it at your level. The day the government said that no polythene like this will be made in India.  Just take your jute bag of clothes and stop making it, it will stop but the government is not saying so, there are 10 thousand reasons for the government not to do it and they will become things with time. What can you do in your house? do that  That you can't do it, you should be better, you are not able to focus in your life because I will tell you what are the three questions I ask from those who talk such big things, I will tell you then you will understand, don't do this, it is important but there is so much on this. Don't use all your energy on emotions and all this, it is slowly getting reduced, renewable energy is being collected, but technology is getting on top of it, the rest of you will also be less, it is such a big thing, if it is an electrical vehicle, then the problem will be there, it is not necessary. If electricity is being generated from thermal, then the smoke has reduced inside your Delhi Gurgaon, it is happening somewhere else from where the electricity is coming, the only difference is and that is Lithium battery, what will you do with it, then later the winter is not like this.  It is a late thing, it means it is difficult, it is not a simple stick, those who are doing it are doing it, you can provide the second thing, there is a lot of discussion on this, vegetarianism and non-veg, it should be, should not be, what should be, should be, there is not much benefit.  Do whatever you think personally, I will tell you the same way, I will tell you in the context, in India about 38, you will give 39 less, 40 crore people are RP and vegetarian means they do not eat anything non-veg, mostly they eat milk and curd like us in Haryana.  Haryana is done, you will get it in UP, you will get it in Rajasthan, you will get it in MP, among the population of this state, this one is more in population, it is 38 crores, okay, and in the world, there are hardly one or two crore people who  He is a vegetarian and that is because of the same reasons, he does not repent, there are some other issues, if you do the math, then if you do the calculations to make you fat, then out of 80820 crores, then we are facing ₹ 7500 crores or 770 crore people are non-veg.  Then I will put it in the discussion that there should be, there should be, I am telling the figures, there are figures, now you can be any of these, you can be non-veg.  Okay, but you can see this anytime, never the topic is always like this, non-vegetarian will never come and say like this, leave vegetarian, it is good to eat non-veg, only we will eat only this, we will eat only this, such people do not even speak normal, there is always talk that there is a question.  In the Reliance Indian context, there are 3 mails per day in 365 days, so if you multiply by that, you get 1100 mails, this is your rough estimate.  Let's take 1100 mills which have to be eaten. Out of those 1100 mills, how many of us are eating non-veg? Is 1100 mills of 1100 non-veg, is it flax or non-veg, is it 50, is it 500 or is it 300?  This is to be seen, it is also important, it is not just about who is driving a car, who is driving an old car.  How much pollution someone is doing, its quantity is also important, so again it is a very layered thing, this is being discussed for so many years, there are so many institutions, it is neither increasing nor decreasing, each has its own system, what happens at times is discussing it in my mind.  I feel that brother, there comes a stage when the dalni rings and the dal is not eaten, someone congratulates you even Rajma and Chole, okay, it is a personal thing, no, but go to 5000 years ago.  4000 or I don't know why, what did you eat friend 10 20 30 50 60 years ago, personally you are not going anywhere after discussing this so much, keep doing it but you are not going anywhere, it is taking a lot of mind space and discussing it.  After doing this, people should not take it, you should not do it, you should not do it, you should not tell it, it was written blank in Vedanta, where it is written here, where it is written there, where it is written in my old one, you should pick it up quickly, then  Pranayama is also an idol thing, don't do it in job, don't do it in marriage, don't do anything, then life will become better immediately, nothing will happen, but I am saying this, life is a game, everyone has a ball in their hands, do it as per your own.  Tell me, yes friend, tell me one simple thing, friend, why do n't so many people study about alcohol and cigarettes? We know alcohol and cigarettes are bad. Why doesn't the government do it? If all this is bad, we also know it, then why?  doesn't do it because again in this  Higher order thinking is required, it is not a simple stick solution, you just come and say, stop smoking, stop this tobacco, people will start taking wrong drugs, it is said somewhere, I do not want to name you too much, you people are just wise, it is said somewhere  It is said that if you want to drink alcohol, then do not consume alcohol because it is not good for alcohol, if you do anything else, then people say, which list is harmful in this dying list, that is, the government is very complex, the government. Individuals alone are not intelligent here, there is a leader or an employee, but there is a system which is called the government system and which runs the country, to whomever is given power, they will think that they will do it, they are thinking of discussing it endlessly inside everything. According to me, my suggestion is that what the audience should discuss and what they do not discuss is that how are our relationships within our home, with our parents. Whatever land and property I have, but whatever land and property I have, 50 lakhs, 1 crore, 1.5 crores, 10 crores, 5 crores, 2 crores, 80 lakhs, how can the family move forward in the best way, because what is the vacuum? Every person wants to sound intelligent. Every person wants to consider himself the internet. Whether I should participate in a discussion or have some view point, I am saying that there is a limit to the view points.  To keep it because there is a limit to the thoughts and messages sent here, time is limited, social media also has a limit, every space has a limit, so endlessly discuss those things which you do not have any immediate direct benefit, otherwise someone will have to think.  We have to protect religion, its religion has survived for so many years, I do n't know what it has done to everyone, whatever it will do to you in future is a personal thing, keep discussing within 24 hours, this is fine, that is fine because I am not one of these people.  All those who discuss people and who also come as big fanatics, I will also make videos in the future, if the bed sheet has to be changed then complete it with them, I am saying that inside my house, I have released it only with my consciousness, intelligence and discretion. That everything is in the family and the house, all the happiness and all the sorrow, all the pushing and discussion and the coolness on others is the capability of your parents, no one can give even coolness, no teacher, no matter, no one can give it.  Unfortunately, they are not giving, they are just not giving, that's why all these other people came to me, come to me, my house is mine, they are doing this and that thing, they are being exploited, do n't the lives of your parents seem to be worth it, then go, I will help you.  I will tell you, if the life of the parents actually seemed so good and was good then the children would not go anywhere. More videos will be made on all these and there will be lead videos. You tell me this kind of thing, do you understand? Like it, please please.  Talk about your inner practical thing friend, you have to call the maid twice, call her three times, my wife will not be able to reduce this much, hey, why are you charging so much less than my wife, the maid will do it for Rs 15000, why don't you reduce ₹ 15000  Why don't you treat yourself to something like 20000 or 30000, then leave your job behind, what will you do with the troubles and discussions with your mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, what is going on at home.  You won't give the address, it is a difficult thing, it is near home, so you will know about the suggestion and solution of the brain, but how many discussions can be done by going on Twitter, on social media, on YouTube, on WhatsApp, he is distributing knowledge on family group on WhatsApp.  What should be done is what is happening in your family. Look at what is happening in your family. First address you are really the shoes and these issues. Are I really not sure if Mumbai will sink then these 150 people will be in Mumbai. Purchase of a flat worth 150 crores, the region, then I do n't know, when it will sink, what will happen, global warming, I don't know like this, pick up the report of 1960, all their global, till that time, till 2010, a lot of things were to happen, those few vans, we don't know, we  Can't think about what fits so much, what will happen from there, people are busy, we don't have the status in actual, most of us who are normal, we are middle class people like  We are class people, we don't know, friend, we are just being forced to discuss and we are having fun, friend, people are watching, who is saying what is not important, those who are not watching are watching, you do as much as you can from your side, you garbage person.  And separate the recyclables in your municipality. Tell me brother, keep the garbage separately. You can do this much in your surroundings. Do it practically. You are busy arguing there. Focus on your life. People's focus is not on their neighbour's life, it is on outsiders, on the neighboring country, on making memes, on the one who has less money, on the one who looks happy, the one who has it is also on him, these great things are less, by doing this I will destroy.  This thing has been happening a lot and now social media has become like mud, I have seen that 99% of all the trolls I have have strange names, they will never keep a man's name, they will keep some superior name, they already know it.  that he  In this space, social media is like this, it is understood that a genuine man, he did not like what you are saying and he is writing something, which is very fine, but there are many people, look at them by their name, now I many times, I am a  I was thinking of making a list of videos to make, okay so my advice is please focus on the real things in your life, thoughts affecting what you are, kids are doing, what are your respirations, what is this.  Dear Influence is turning on his thought process, is he in touch with whom, will you not be focused, suddenly your child is saying something, yes, it was always happening but you were not keeping an eye on him, there was this difference, so please like, share, thank you."

    "title": "02 Unique Ways To Invest In Gold [ObVOZ_b1o0Y].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, two unique ways to invest in gold. Today we will discuss about gold. My aim is to give a new perspective through this video. The audience will also know about it. Good, good, sovan ga bud banane nahi, soren gold bund nahi nahi ke liye, good, good.  ETF ETF also not telling good good no mutual fund no mutual fund not even telling and digital gold no no no nothing so let's first discuss which one. Investing in gold can be done in many ways. I am telling you in a practical way which according to me is the best. This is for educational purpose. I am not a registered priest anywhere. Invest on your own. Convincing is one thing. I am very fond of Sovan Gold Bund. Personally, I am not a fan because it is backed by the government but not backed by assets, so it is contingent by default. There will be no Zimbabwe, no, our country will never be there again.  We will discuss on it, we will go on politics, then it is found in 2nd exam, you have to write it for 8 years, take it out for 5 years, everyone knows that thing but ultimately it is paper only, so paper itself is not actual gold.  No, no, but those returns are yes, returns have to be written, but the paper itself is physical gold, that is the key, now you will not say, no, its storage and theft, yes, yes, theft, storage, anyone can steal anything, yes, but listen even further, 200 years.  For 300 years, 400 years, thousands of years, robbers used to come from outside and loot and go away. You know, invaders used to come, now the situation is not that bad, so yes there are issues of physical gold, but then it is with you immediately, you can take something by giving it.  And this is for contingent and listen to my two ways to invest in this, if you are in this space, if you are in the space of mach fund and space of Sovan Gold Bund.  I will not buy any more physical gold, okay then my second investment will suit you and if you understand the thing about physical gold, then I will tell you which physical gold to buy practically because as soon as you buy physical gold, someone will say, oh in this there is only 20 rupees.  But there are charges, making charges, GST becomes so expensive, so I am trying to explain the same, don't buy an investment, go and buy a new one from the shop, I also know that there are making charges at Rs 20 and  Yes, at many places it goes for 25 rupees, it is 18 to 25 rupees depending on the brand, so whatever is the prevailing gold rate, one has to pay this much and that is a matter of great pain, I also know yes.  So do you know then why are you asking to buy then I am saying that you must have seen it yourself and you must have done it yourself and you must have also seen that many women take old gold to the jeweler and give it to him and say brother.  change this  Two mother-in-laws had offered a set of five to six tolas. Sometimes the daughter-in-law did not like it. She had to exchange it. She said, \" Brother, take this and this and give me that. Okay, then madam will say, instead of five tolas, now it will be worth only four because  There will be making charges in this and it will go at the rate of gold. Yes brother, if you deduct from this then there are crores of women with such brothers, what do you have to do because look, it will take effort, I am telling you the best way of investment. Make an announcement in the circle of friends and acquaintances that brother, if there is any woman who wants to do this program, then instead of going with the jeweler, come with me and give it to me, her hallmark is the jewellery, otherwise it is very easy to check the authenticity of gold these days.  It is possible that everyone has kept the machines, you can buy them from him at the rate of gold or you will call him a jeweler, he is paying a little more money and is getting gold at the rate of gold. Give it to me at the rate of Rs. Now if you buy gold in this way, then what are your making charges? So you can practically make it your own. Friend, give it to your friend, it happens within the family itself, somewhere far away.  There is no need, the network of women in the families is very strong, mother-in-law, sister-in-law, sister-in-law, daughter, okay, that means all these are relations, all of them, someone's aunt, mother, aunt, aunt, all this.  Okay, so in this network someone is taking or giving, if someone wants something new then you can offer, now that is an investment for you, that is an investment for you, it is gold, okay, it is not in the biscuit form, it is in the form of jewelery but you  Don't pay any additional charge for it because you will go to buy coins also, you will also buy bricks, you buy biscuits and all these, you have to pay for these also, you have to pay Rs 15, 20, but you don't have to pay for these, 9, 10.  You have to pay on 11 14, in some cases very big charges, even if you pay somewhere, it is not less than on 7, 8, 10, 9. From what I have checked, this can be a very good practical method, Gold is Acumatica, second one.  Method: What is there in Instead of Sea Gold ETF, what is there in Mutual Fund that if the rate of gold is not increasing then you are not getting returns but now yes that is but we are only buying gold. So is there any other way that the thing which is linked to gold but is not gold then is it India's top jewelery question? I am not asking this question for you guys, is it India's top jewelery selling company which is not gold?  It also sells spectacles and watches. Its share can be taken as the same share which has given highest returns in Rakesh Jhunjhunwala ji's portfolio. You can write the name of that company. I do n't even discuss its name. Otherwise, you should say that to him.  Returns Because the organic jewelery in India is in the organic space, it is in very low percentage. This company's own market share is a high part of the organic jewelery but the organic jewelery as a whole is at 10-15 and as it is now India is aspirational.  As it is happening, we are moving into organized space, they have also launched office jewelery for women.  It has also been released and in a very good way, you can get good returns by investing in it, this is my belief, what is your opinion, it is the exposure of gold because this journey is still ahead, even after giving so many multi baggers, they say that  There is a lot of runway available ahead, the story is available ahead, again the story of the next 202 years is a very large company, it is a well discovered stock, so people think this is normal, how much more will it increase now?  There is also a lot of scope because all you have to do is research in India because I do not prepare everything, yes I am not going to give any research report after learning, you do three to four things within the organized space, within your organized space. How much market does this company hold and the total organization that it has? Just like how far the jewelery market has reached 100%, there may be scope for it to grow seven to eight times more. You can verify this, I am not saying this.  Seven to eight times this is happening in the next 2 years to 5 years. This is a journey of the next 102 years because the love of gold of Indians and Indian women is not going to diminish. The Britishers looted so much of India and started looting it.  Even before, a lot was looted, even then Indian women already hold many times more gold than what was there at that time. Whatever is held by RBI, this is our Reserve Bank and Reserve Banks across the world. Do they know anything?  Because they print all these notes, print inflation notes, if you are buying a lot of gold then buy gold and keep your portfolio at 5 to 10 depending on whether the portfolio is big or small, if the portfolio is very big then you can keep it at 57 if it is a little small.  The percentage may be a little higher but there is no problem, lockers are also available in banks, some lockers can be kept in every family, some can be kept with you, yes, it is a little headache but then there is the problem in everything, wherever.  There will be a real asset class, whether it is real estate or anything else, everything is there, it is just taking it in the form of air, I don't know what it means, it is the banking system, it is the financial system, but taking this paper and taking this bundle of it is also something to embrace your gold. Wearing a chain, then I do n't want to make you into a normal astrology person, but I can't help but say on this channel that Jupiter is strong, Jupiter is strong, those who wear a little gold, it is believed in a lot in the South and you will see the average in the sound. Gold holdings are also very high and physical gold is also worn, chain is worn, ring is worn, a little is worn, a lot is worn, I am not telling people to wear Bappi Lahari ji type but a little of everything can be worn, it is a good investment.  I have seen that women earn money, especially the women who are government teachers, I have seen that they have historically invested in gold. If I look at one section of the society, they have a lot of gold holdings.  If returns are kept then this is one aspect of it but it is more as it acts as storage of value. Even 500 years ago, during the time of Akbar, one tola of gold could buy as many goods as ghee, milk, wheat, the same amount can be bought today.  So it has kept up with the inflation for so long brother, assume one tola of gold is worth as much as it is now, as much milk and ghee units as you can hold and wheat or food whatever.  It happens that they could have bought as much as they can buy today, so 400, 500, 600 years ago, so it has withstood that time, so it has proven itself for that long, so it has to be seen that way only. There is more interest in storage of value returns. So I told that it belongs to the company because if you want to play in digital form only, then the gold available on 5 7 8 10 is from the company.  You check their returns, check their return on capital employed, check their return on equity, check their dividend deal, check their book value, check their cash flow, check their market share, check their holdings, promoter 's key at 52.  FIAs have taken it, DIs have taken it, public has only 16-17% holdings, so there is a lot of scope in it, FIAs and DIs are not selling.  Their holdings in that stock or all your mutual funds have taken holdings, foreign institutional investors, if no one is selling then only public holdings are being sold, you are taking, I am taking, someone is taking, someone is selling, this is what is happening.  And that too the holding is at Rs 17, so there is not much free float available, not many promoters are selling and they have kept it as a very well discovered one.  If they take out a scheme for 11 months, if they do this for the 12th month, then they take the money from the consumer itself, so the cost of capital is also not that much for them relatively, there is no need to deluge any equity, there is no such debt to equity.  The rest is for you to do some research on your own and tell us what kind of stock idea you had, what kind of investment idea you had and the idea of ​​real gold that I gave you, why are you going if you want to invest only?  Look, what happens many times is the new design, the new design, in that affair, you will have to give it at Rs. 20, only then the goldsmith will earn money otherwise how will the goldsmith's jewelery business run, the jewelery worker there will not make the design and will not make different ones for women.  If it is not made as per the requirement of the people, then how will it work? Well, it is working, but if you ask me personally, the designs are also old, what happens many times when the mother-in-law  If it is old then it has no value. Otherwise, the same design will be brought again in antique design and some exotic designs will be made and will be sold at high prices. Like I am telling you, give an example and see, by doing research actually, one thing is happening in Haryana.  It was used a lot. Okay, so what was the joke? If it was done like this, then many people used to say that it seems as if something has been put in the neck of a buffalo. But now this is the latest design and the Hasli's that are coming in it these days are completely hollow. The design of Hasli is that earlier it used to be maybe 5 tola to 10 tola and was solid from inside which was made like this because it was  I am making this video like a real grassroots leader. Send this video to you ladies too and tell them that you did not understand this, now it is coming out as hollow. Now the ladies have shown their original  I do n't know when the designs were broken, so there is a request to those women who are sitting with good old designs, do n't break your designs so soon, just because your mother-in-law has given it to me, so I have to take something new. That is the message, then you will pay breaking charges and if you are doing this, then show this video to your other women who are listening to me and say brother, listen, this is a very good video of ours.  If someone is going to break a joke of five tolas, then accept it, take it among yourselves, brother in law, brother in law, sister in law, it has nothing to do with it, similarly gifting happens, what is the problem in that, take it, make sense of it, there is no problem with it.  There is no problem in any way, take yours or brother, you take this money and will give it to the jeweler. Okay, then he will go and give it to the jeweler. You go and give the money to the jeweler too.  Do you have to give one lakh rupees of five tolas or two lakh rupees, whatever you want to give, if there is a thing to give two tolas or three tolas, then brother, you take it, give it to me, but I have 20 rupees left.  If I want to invest in gold, I would have gone and bought coins, if I had bought anything, I would have had to pay again. Please tell me how you liked this idea. Share and like. Thank you very much."

    "title": "02 Wardrobe Changes Whch You Require [sXEMJ1MKAHQ].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, D Youth needs you to follow these two things but I am going to tell you a healthy life practical thing, I don't think till now anyone has explained it in detail, two things, one thing is very important for women, the first thing is very important and the second thing is important for both. So, I will tell you listen carefully, first thing is footwear, women must forward it to their mothers, sisters, wives, daughters, everyone who is listening to this, ladies are wearing very uncomfortable footwear.  There are too many issues, too many issues are going on, then they are becoming a free cocktail of hormones and are bringing a lot of bitterness in life. Next, women of India should also wear good school shoes because is that sense not yet in fashion?  No, will those ladies still go wearing that chapel or the painting of hills or no one cares that the teachers or working ladies are caste wearing so much hill, some are also caste wearing it, it is okay but mostly party.  I wear such things but even the working women do some program of such height and they are getting very tired in their life, health issues are happening and men are also doing the same among them, I have seen such pointed shoes.  See, such people keep their entire legs like this, there is no comfort in it, there is no bottom, just wear a suit for style and that Ranveer Singh is the film actor, he is the most of D bill no, we wear him anything, he is us.  keep one thing in mind  If you were a westerner, you would have worn a suit. Under the suit, you would have to wear leather shoes. Those would be bed manners. By wearing Bharat shoes, I am not a nerd like Bharat shoes. Get them while walking, get good, expensive, comfortable ones. Get them from a good brand.  But you will give it and what will be the biggest benefit of it. Secondly, let me tell you one thing. First listen carefully, what will be the benefit of this when you are wearing very good footwear, whether climbing the stairs, walking for a long time, taking a walk in the office, drinking water.  You will feel like walking again and again because sweet are not troubled and when you go in the lift, even if there are three floors or two floors, you take the help of lift because you are wearing footwear like this, then you bill release date in a de aate n.  A place if you are wiring a good bharat shoes you bill and up walking on three thousand steps sir because of dose only because for any lady then it happens that if she is in Gurgaon  Like, why does Uber and Ola run more in the city? Why don't buses run more? Because of the power trekking here and the children who go to corporate jobs, now they can't walk, so they have to get off the bus and walk. The story will tell and then walk.  You will have to say that girls wear clothes only like this, they wear shoes only like this, there is no need to go too far in that. Today, by turning on the results, Uber and Ola are more popular. In this way, I am telling you after observing a city like Gurgaon, but that  Your lower part of the head, even if you understand acupressure, the points should be like G, fit, relaxed, it is in a very big condition, so before sleeping at night, feed by putting a few grams of water in water and adding salt, you must do this.  Especially women who have a lot of time to stand, teachers are ahead, teachers are ahead in profession, ladies are traveling a lot, what is it these days, the custom of sitting is no longer there in private schools, earlier my country was the same.  The teacher used to have a sitting system, I believe if I am not, correct me, this system is over, now the teacher has to stand and there are no such rest periods, in one period she is standing here and then in the other she is standing and then  If she is standing there then that IT Bill Take IT which is on your health may be young, no pain would still be there, there might be some issues but right now they are getting accumulated, then you have to pay them in your Fortis.  If yes, then don't do this. The second thing that I am going to tell you is also very important for men. First of all, I will tell you that even while roaming around in such tight jeans and such tight pants, your program in the coach area will be spoiled and then you have become such a mess, how?  It has become so tight in India, I do n't know the tradition of India, I will open it in South India, let the dhoti breeze come in North India and take a completely relaxed course, now I can't do that, mother, for some reason, such feats are happening.  Don't have any problem, do n't know why people have made it a rule that you can't go there wearing such a thing, you have to do less, isn't it right and if Ranveer Singh wears it then it's fine but we can't wear it, I don't want to wear dhoti.  I am saying this but I want to tell a word to women as well as men but the shirt is very comfortable, it has openwork, it has breeding, it is a bit expensive but there is money on value and it does not get spoiled by getting old, it blooms equally, which means it is like any other.  will seem a little expensive but  If you look at his life, look at the comfort, give more, believe in the value, which is the sticky environment in India in the most off-day time, like right now in September, the video is being made, still the environment, if you see, is sticky type, it is a relief, mostly sir, it is like this.  There is relief in the environment and down in the South, there is relief in general, so these linen pants have also come, it is very comfortable, very comfortable, women should not wear these.

    "content": "Hello friends, it is a very important topic for the youth. There are three things that the youth needs to answer and that they are not answering. They are not able to understand even the order of these to live a good life and those are the three questions. The first question in life is that  What will you do in life and in which city will you do whatever you do and with whom will you live when you do whatever and in which city you do it? Three innocent questions.  There is no focus on these three, call these three the pillars of life or say the same thing, this is the whole balance plate, what to do, don't know where you will stay, do n't know where you get something, go there, with whom will you live your life, with whom will you tell who?  Who will be your friends? Who will be your wife? Who will be your husband? What will be the relationship of your parents? What will happen to your sister? Recently, I got a lot of consultation within the UN. Who has gone to work in the United Nations?  You get a good salary while doing this, but brother, the postings are of such countries, now what should I name, bombs are exploding in those countries, okay, what is the benefit, friend, you were feeling good because you have focused, I want you.  You Don't Want to See the Full World May Be You Want to See You Know Europeans  A few countries, put one half of Australia, one half of America, although America and Canada have different conflicts going on, right now it is okay, it is very easy to say world, there are big countries in that world, so I want to tell that wake up youth, wake up.  Very Clear Were I Will Choose The Place First No How To Do If You Are We Will Behave Like Baggers Who Don't Have Any Choice Then You Will Be Treated Like One Don't Behave  Like that Choose your place That place has to be a decent big city Close to your language Close to your main area Where you belong to because you will be required to travel a lot I see people going from Bangalore to Haldwani.  The question is where do we land, meaning we reach home using all the transportation skills that we have learned in childhood. Not a good thing, even the ship gets used, then the car, then the bus, the train, and the tonga, and then the elephant, and the horse, don't do it like this, there is no need to stay so far away, choose your place first, it is okay to do.  What does it have to be limited and very niche and here I help in my workshop webinars to know how much you are worth if you are working, can you uproot, what can you do and your  If you can do some work, then what is the biggest problem? If you talk about something like a job, then what do people do? Business is not business, hey, who is telling you to do business, friend, someone must be doing his own work as well, is n't it, those who work on computers?  If you press such and such buttons, then this is an organization. Someone gave work to this organization, this organization distributed the work, it kept the money before that, okay brother, you will do the work and gave you the work and you got the money.  So, if there is a system such that you say, 'Jamura, I find it useful and the world knows about it, then that work can be given to you here and you can be paid for it, brother, this is a 10-week project because all these people are there.  By doing this, this etcher who does not have to do anything but just keep the accounts, the back end is fine, the admin, this building, all these expenses are incurred, then the profit is made, only then the client is charged, by bypassing all this, you can give him a good rate, but this is  Like people's brain does not work because as a youngster it does not work, I understand but when you have done all this for 5, 10 years, 15 years, then the perspective is off. Now I am not just telling about IT, I am telling in terms of if you  There is a phone company which sells phones, take any name and is sitting there earning money and giving it back. It has a system. Everything happens in every company and the money is made somewhere at the shop where the customer comes.  Is  Unless yours is absolutely yours, even if it is your consultation, you are the consultant, he is just bringing clients, so bringing clients is not a problematic thing in today's technology, you are listening to me, I also bring clients.  Getting customers is not a difficult thing after all, connect with people directly and earn more money but people will not think like this. Third thing is marriage, who has to do the marriage and what has to be done, for that there is only time.  No, because where to stay and what to do, it is taking a toll on the youth. In that moment, all your sugarcane juice goes out, after that you are too afraid that now I have no scope left. It seems that some girl comes like this.  Just take care of everything and give him happiness. The girl is also working somewhere. He thinks, who knows if I find a boy and he means give me facilities and if I get a job, then these three things have to be. Sorted Out If You Don't Sort These Three Things Out If You Don't Answer These Questions You Will Never Be Able to Be Settled as a Person You Will Never Be Able to Live a Happy Life People fall prey to success Five Ways to Become Five Mistakes I Did in 20 Ankur Warik Ji Like Na Do The SIP Kisi Ne A Kisi Ne Bol Raha  By taking a sip, you will move away from this, I am saying brother, decide three things, this is a river of fire, you have to pass through this, no one is left, set your three things, somehow, and don't overestimate yourself, settle for something, I don't.  Want to Settle for Anything Less I Want the Best O You Want the Best But You're the Best You're the Second Best Okay So You 'll Get What You  Deserve in the long run Why do you want something You are wanting something I am not that thing I am not going to come to you just because you want keep wanting Simply speaking I want this I want this Guruji I want this I what keep wanting wanting ka What do you want, what do you want, I want this, bring me the moon, give me idli do idli do Madhuri ji's song was long ago, it's okay, so select your city first, because I do n't want to go to other cities, how can it be like this? Oh, it's possible that you were taught, it can't be like this because you are made a slave, your city first.  Catch up, then catch up with the work, catch up with the office boss, same or not, but mine is there, but if papa is saying like this, then they would have got papa a job, these parents jump when it comes to marriage, we will tell the parents that boys.  marry who  Do it with the girl, why did you ask for a job, with whom should you do it, before that you were a hero, so there is no one else, son or daughter, do whatever you want to do in life, get married, we will tell you and after marriage, we will tell you more because if we do n't have enough time, then this  Very hilarious as well as very tragic, both the things are going on together, the situation is youth's hilarious too. Hey you decide, you are South Indian, find a city in South India and your life will end there. Find a little between Bangalore and Hyderabad.  If you are from this side, then catch Pune, Mumbai, hold the top higher, there are no other cities, no, there are no other cities, if you do not live a good life, then after 10 top 10 cities, no one exists in India, then only India exists.  Where nothing is happening, India is sitting there, protecting the religion, somewhere wrong things are being done, hooliganism is happening, time is being wasted, money is not being talked about and relationships are getting spoiled, that is India.  and very big  This is India, this is India, I call it Vela Bharat, out of 140 crores, 70 crores are ours, they have to do commentary, it is okay, they have to discuss over tea, they have to do politics, they have to do nothing, what are these people, mostly they are their or  So, she is giving them five kilos of grain, is they getting any pension, are they getting any subsidy from somewhere or is their rent coming from somewhere, this 70 crores is not decided by the country, what else?  The country will do this and after seeing them, people are deciding - father, mother, uncle, grandfather, uncle, wife's father, he said like this, brother said like this, what does he do, what does he do, what does he uproot, nothing, it was just a plot of grandfather, he left it.  Sold it there and then took two there and then left there, just sat there and made the inheritance better, what did they themselves uproot, there were clucks in normal PWD, there were clucks in SB, I told them.  Don't want to put down but SBI clerk will not explain a youngster who is it employee earning 18 20 25 lakhs package that I will teach you no you can't teach you didn't have exposure you have respect don't let anyone down but  You should stay within your limitations as much as you have exposure and leave all these things to the experts who will tell you and explain. I am saying this to experts like us.  They just tell me that whatever knowledge you have, work on it and leave it, the youth knows everything, these days there is such a thing that you type on the internet and you do not get the answer, the only problem is that you type 1200.  Calories will come from diet khat 1000 calories diet khat se Energy deficit required to lose weight 7000 calories 1 kg ok if i  Lose a 1000 calorie deficit per day by dieting 700 and exercising 300 then I will lose 1 kg weight. You have learned this but now there is all the problem in doing it to survive on that 1200 diet and exercise to lose weight. Here is the twist in the story, it is difficult to do.  To do this we need someone wise, this nutritionist, this gym trainer, this  He is not fit, how will his job work, everything is told in horoscope astrology these days, my Rahu is here and my horoscope is like this, but I don't understand how to do it, I get stuck there, what is stopping you? So external help will help you so own people can't help to sort out your world you will stay then till it will happen here only what ever  Will Happen That I Say Karma Bhoomi And Then You Choose What Ever You Want To Work If you don't get a job in Gurgaon then you are not employable anywhere You will not get anywhere if you do not get a job even in Pune After Using Choose  Do anything, do it in Pune, do it in Bangalore, do it in Hyderabad. Baba, this is a big city. If you don't get a job here then you will not get it anywhere else. So remember this thing and marriage is also like this when the tantrums will end and the request program will end.  You will go and get married. There is no shortage of boys or girls in India. There is no shortage of tantrums in India. Well, when the tantrums will end, the boy will appear on his own. Just as you are average, so is the boy who is average, so both are.  Both friends will meet, both are average, okay average people, when both average people meet at the right time, then life becomes below average, it is not one and one two, they become more than two and this is a big observation of mine but right.  on time If one gets married, then one and one average people becomes more than two, then above average becomes. I hope you liked the video, pay attention to this thing, two people are not giving importance, they are trying to find the best city too.  Live in best spouse to marry best job there is no best job no best husband no best city you have to choose. When the buffet is lying ahead, if you eat all those things then your stomach will get upset. You have to Choose or not, my friend, this is what I want to eat, then fill your plate.

Ask someone, brother, it is okay with someone like you, it is okay with a desi like us, that brother, the jam is perishable, the grind is perishable, do n't eat this one, it is okay, leave this one, that one is good, that thing is okay.

    "title": "03 Secrets About Criticism Revealed ｜ Interesting Perspective [qRf6YxFWr8w].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, this can be a life changing video if you guys watch it completely and understand it. I am going to tell you three secrets about criticism. I may question some old belief systems but I will talk about things that are going on in the present times and about the times to come.  Many of these things are applicable for them. I will tell you three secrets. Which one did you enjoy listening to and which one did you like the most? Which one will you follow more? Which one will you understand more? Tell me by doing 1 2 3.  The first thing I will tell you is, yes, criticism means there is also criticism. Normally, who will criticize you or whom will you criticize? I am giving you a formula for never doing more than you, doing less, achieving more, normally being in a butter position.  Your criticism will not help, you have to see that if you are here doing little and doing so little then the person sitting here who is doing so little will not do it, he does not have time. He doesn't have time, you see, in 99.99% of the cases, the person who is trying to do more in life and the one who is doing less, the more he criticizes and condemns, and you will see this pattern in the elders when  When there is very little to do in life then one of their default settings is everything is nothing, sometimes everything is nothing in life, but seeing this pattern when there is nothing much for oneself to do in life, then that  The vacuum is filled by others This is a fact in criticizing you. Check it out. If someone is criticizing you then check what is his/her profile, how much do you do, what are you chipping in. You will see some pattern and apply it on yourself also that you are doing the same.  Criticism: Now many people will say like this, hey, he is sycophantic, so how much more should we criticize him, that is, he is doing more than you, do n't get bogged down in whether good or bad is less, he is sycophantic more than you, you do it.  No, I don't want to do it, that is, it is not in your power, you don't know how to do it, or it does n't take any of your autokarita, I have given an extreme example, wait is very difficult to explain, it is a wrong thing, respect is vice, so someone or the other must be creating something more than someone.  In the situation, he must be doing something in excess due to which he is inviting criticism. I have given an extreme example in which people also give justification that otherwise he has reached ahead by doing charter kart.  Also, who has stopped you, you do it, no, I can't do it, if you can't, then don't do it, then the second thing is a secret, a dark secret, but to tell the truth, I tell you, there is a lot of pleasure in criticizing, this is a truth, what to do next?  I will tell you that I take great pleasure in criticizing people. Catch someone, the mother-in-law is criticizing the daughter-in-law, the daughter-in-law is criticizing the mother-in-law, you are criticizing the boss, you are criticizing the porter, you are criticizing a friend, you are criticizing. Need an external person for  What is social media etc. these days, brother, we enjoy it, it is a fact, if we say it, it is not a good thing, it is not, I am making a statement that we enjoy criticizing but we do not get success in it, if you do not want to live your life.  If you want to achieve success and reach somewhere in life and do something in life, then condemnation is not the word. Now, just as some people may enjoy drinking alcohol, I did not say that it is good to condemn, it should be done like drinking and smoking.  is n't it good to drink  Yes, but people drink because they enjoy it. Similarly, criticism is also the same. Enjoyment is what they do. Enjoyment comes but it does not take you anywhere. Just as drinking alcohol does not take you anywhere, there is something wrong with smoking cigarettes in life.  There is no reaching anywhere, maybe if you get some relaxation, then you say that you feel good, but many people are not in the region to get that relaxation, some say that the stress is reduced, everyone is different, many say that you have lost the habit, that's it. nothing full  If many people had the same habit then they would also have lost the habit of criticizing, there is no point in criticizing you but seeing you, if you want to reach somewhere in life, then criticism will not bring you success, it will definitely give you fun, so it is in these dose of D categories, now the third one.  And the last one is very important, if you have done this then it is implementable then the knowledge was at the level of the first two and the third one, I am going to tell you a very big thing, people say that a healthy decision is a good one.  I want to speak late, there is nothing called healthy criticism, there is nothing called healthy criticism, criticism can never be healthy and it is not unspe, in three to four five minutes I will tell you something very beautiful, wonderful, stay connected with the poet, do not leave, try to understand, settle down.  It takes effort to understand things, first you have to idiot, think that it is original content, understand it, then try to understand it in the form of words, if third  If I was successful in understanding the point then please clap me a little, write success, subscribe the channel and like it. Now listen. If someone ever comes to you in your life, brother, let me tell you one thing, will you not mind? It is possible that you may have said this in your mouth.  Have you told anyone or should I narrate it to you, first of all tell me whether you have heard it or not. Have a little participation from the audience. This is my request with folded hands. Only then will it be fun. This is a one-sided content. Good night.  It is not fun at all, tell me, have you heard this thing, friend, let me tell you one thing, friend, anyone can speak. A friend, if I tell you one thing, you will not mind, you have to answer immediately, friend, mostly I go, don't tell me, then the next person will say surprise.  It will happen because of this Never Hard Like This, I am telling you for your good, tell me not to do any harm to me, I tell you in the reason, you have to understand carefully, I am consultant difference between  Criticism and Feedback is the mask of healthy criticism that we wear. We want to show that we want to give you any feedback. You understand the feedback that is there. Genuine feedback is at least your sources are fine and it is you by date feedback.  You've made a channel You've done a drawing You've done a business plan You've done something You've done Professional consultant because I do  This professional consultancy in like date I understand why would I give feedback to someone by applying my mind when I have no benefit in it. Understand that there is joy in criticism. You understand that there is joy in it, isn't it like an addiction? If it is genuine, any man, then only two types of people will give you genuineness: your wife, your parents, your siblings, your children or in a relationship because the devil is part of you, then they will not ask you this again.  Your father or mother or anyone else doesn't ask like this, your wife or you, I am going to tell you, so wo n't you feel bad? About you, this is very good, this is good, that good, yours, this is very good, that's good, that's good, one line positive, after that but this but after that, what will you say now, friend, why should we not take this healthy criticism, what is wrong with it?  We have taught you to keep the cynics close and all that remains, brother, today we are talking about all the old notes of knowledge, change because what happens where it is imminent from you are not it is a procession, something because it will create a lot of self-doubts.  It will have direct impact on a selfie stick. It is very easy to say that mine is so high, it does not matter, everyone has it, everyone has it. You have started off from criticism and perform respect vice, these cricketers are Virat Kohli hai apne jitne ye to itna hota agar don put this to woh batting aur vendala hi nahi pakada jayega bhai you have started off that genuine feedback if there is any to give. So I take Sachin Tendulkar maybe give him that brother, bowl like this, your dance is like this, this is what is going wrong with you, now that science is a very professional one, so help the professionals. You can understand the expertise of the person who is imparting the knowledge, first of all, criticism is not what Lohi is telling, teachers are telling these things, second thing in the approach which they are taking during the season.  Know that it can be genuine, just as even a stopped clock shows the correct time twice a day, then nothing is ever 100 out of 100. In life, you may miss it. Genuine 23  People It Is Possible [Music] 97 98% People Will Make You Doubt Anything Start something in life Start something in life People will come to give advice on everything And they criticize because they can't do it Actually brother  This means that you can do whatever you are doing somewhere else. So the same criticise, this voice of yours is not right, your face is not right, your clothes are not right, tell me what about you will come out very genuinely, no man lo, you are wearing very bad clothes, it looks wrong in your face, your hair is messed up, in general, that  If something is visible, someone from your family will tell you when you are getting ready, your wife will ask what you are wearing or someone outside, your brother, sister or parents will give you something in bulk, that is for her, you are for someone else.  There is no need to weigh that thing which is too grocery out of yours, any thing which is too grocery out is known to the person himself, but all these people who will come to criticize you in this way will  By becoming a consultant, you will see that any good consultant will monetize something in it and it will benefit directly and indirectly. If I am making this video also, I am also a consultant, then my channel is mine, my subscribers are mine.  Monetization is my views, I am building my brand, I have a thousand things going on, I am advertising, come like this, shake you, do Nista Naboot, and I will make better videos in the future, how should I take feedback for you people, because when the turn comes to actually take it. Isn't it, no knowledge is gained because I am telling that trees are professional consultants, people come with problems, the brain is curdled by Congress party, you know I did consultation with Prashant Kishore ji first. Told them that there are so many slides in the party, one cannot take all the slides, sometimes what happens is that I do tree consultation, a kind of criticism comes out in that too, I am being professional, in that also the person feels bad, our role in being such a consultant is this.  Also, don't shake his basic self team, don't shake his base, he has to be turned on first, it's not an easy thing, it can just go out, if you tell him, then like you, whatever health advice is there, that too.  You don't take it from anyone, nor do you ask any professional on the go about what medicine to take, how to treat the disease, then whenever you come under criticism on any of these things, look at that thing. Have you asked for it from the next Banda? Advice because then a lot of criticism will come wearing a mask of genuineness, I am telling this and it will come from my friends, from the boss, friend, I want to give you an advice, I want to do it, in many places you cannot agree, in many places you  You can't start up but you can be mentally set off, everyone has their own agenda because it's a simple thing, these days everyone is so busy in life, why would anyone want to do good for you without any benefit, think for yourself, what can happen in the situation. Video of summarized quicklient finish: There can be only two situations, one is that you are going to the tree consultant, right now I am getting money, I want to do good to you for this reason and we will talk for an hour. You are interacting, you are understanding and that one is working less as a professional and the other is the blood relation of your family, your wife is your husband, who has direct and indirect involvement in your life, in your growth, in your success. They can be a part of it.  Just like you do it for your child, do it for your parents, do it for your wife, do it for your brother or sister, you can definitely take it, whatever you say, it is okay, he will never start like this, his own brother, friend, brother, yours.  Tell me one thing, will you not find this thing bad? Brother, who has such a role, if he tells you what he has to tell, then you will know that he is giving genuine feedback. Wherever in life you are criticized, think very well about you. That they have been taught that if you want to speak ill of someone then show them some good, this is this, this is this, this is this, this is Chindi, this theft is taught to the public, many a times this knowledge is also available on YouTube, it is also written in books, ho you want, you tell.  Something good about you, making him completely good, no one is so stupid anymore, feed that criticism, you are in a position of power, if you have any employee, then tell me straight brother, I give money to you and this is yours, I do n't like that.  There is a different thing, that you will have to bear because it is a separate relationship, in that you have to bear it, it is your relationship and that is your performance thing, so that is a jhinni for you, but as much as respect and vice. You can avoid people's free criticism, turn it off, nothing good ever happens to you, that means you have to turn it off, tell him brother, who gave you the right to criticize me, so remember that first thing. Who will actually criticize the person who is doing less in life? He may be doing more, he does n't have time but he is not reaching anywhere, so don't criticize others, if you don't succeed then how much do you do, share, like and participate. How about thank you in the comment section?"

    "title": "03 Surprises For Youth Who Will Join Govt Jobs After Competition ？ [BWNboDrNcaY].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, I am a people on free surprise and I am preparing for government jobs and if my luck is good then I am waiting for the date because no one is telling me. The coaching people are not telling me. Brother, you are preparing for the job and you should get a government job.  And here I am talking about Group A and Group B only because that is my audience and below that, in this note, the audience is you listen, enjoy, troll and write something.  That is a different thing but I have defined my audience otherwise everything cannot be applicable to everyone. So if you are preparing for this then there are three surprises in it. The first surprise is if you think and which comes to me in the comment area.  Because what a government man is is not to be written, it is such a thing that you will get a lot of it in a government job, it is not, no, but I had seen my uncle, my uncle, my maternal uncle, my brother-in-law, my his  Papa, the neighbor didn't know that you talk about 2030, that's why it's a surprise. What's the surprise? Brother, the story is nothing if you don't expect it. The second thing is that there will be a problem in your marriage and what nonsense is he saying? Everyone wants to marry a government official and these ads come and these memes are made and what do they do like this, he will not get married to the girl with whom you want to marry, you want G level, you only want this one, you will get something by doing this.  So it's okay but you have to retire the one inside you because once you get that, if you get a car, it will be parked in the garage, there will be depression in one year, clothes will not fit in 2 years, if there will be issues in it in 3 years, then that which  The woman you will marry should not be someone who has less power, if you are in government service because you have so many transfers, not all the jobs are there and if such transfers do not make up five percent, then we are not talking about them. Video 90%  The video is divided for 90%, now see, food, job, PSU, bank and the rest of the jobs, there will be 5-10% of them. If the story is set in one place, then it is set in a big city.  Due to the problem there, no girl wants to live without it today and after 2023, make a home, sell your designed restless suits, if they are not available in a small town then your market value will fall along with you.  This is the market value of government servant, the market decides how many girls, now this is the latest trade reversal, then go and realize what you are already facing, please write in the comment area that brother, we are here and you are absolutely right. Yes, the third thing is power and respect, it has gone much less than it used to be. Respect has become so low that today in our India no one is respecting anyone. No one respects anyone.  If there is, then you write only one of our brothers standing at the border, they are respected, they also need honey, apart from that, no one gives it to anyone, nor is the politician getting it, the doctor is being told something, everyone in the government knows about the bureaucracy.  The problem is that whatever the government does, but a government job is not everything, then how can it be that there is an organization that you don't like anything about and you don't know what you keep saying to it, but if you want to go, then go for it.  If you come from a well-to-do family and are from a big city and have your own household in your family and are not lower class or poor, then do not apply for these jobs. If you do not say that it motivates, then I am demotivating you. If you are getting demotivated then this is not the reason for you. Understand that if you are a poor person, you have no choice to jump and increase your social status because to reach this level, the government is there for you.  The job is not demotivating you, it is not demotivating you, but what is wrong with what many people are saying now? In India, in our country, in the next 4 years, everyone will understand it well. I was telling you this a year ago but it is wrong.  And there is a big drop who is preparing, he is already telling him that I am going, it is useless, then how will my Azimo Shaan Shahenshah happen, who is going to make my train, no, it will not be made real after 3 years.  He is taking the tissue out of the car like this, he is not going to become like this, he is not going to become, he is not going to ask, he is the one saying the same thing, no gram is burning in the pan, but the gas below it will be banded 2 seconds earlier, so now you will not.  Do you know that it is a gas band, Rakhi, you are thinking that if you have bread and sheikh, then you have to work on the tawa gum, right from 2023 to 2055, till 2007, till that time, the program is going down completely. Transit is like this, do n't waste, become a leader, if you become a government servant, then under whom will you work, if you do it for the public, then if you say you are a servant of the public, then the public will tell you, there has to be something like this, some man has reached your office.  To reduce this, today's government servant does not do anything like this, whatever is the role of a government servant, IT and everything is with the politicians to elect politicians, so when you have to get a job under them and you know this then it is  Become one, then there is no qualification in this, in 12 years you will become a small-time leader, with the amount of hard work you are doing for the government service, you can become a decent politician if your intentions are right, you are a good person.  So, you say no, this is not a good thing, then I am saying that this is not a good thing, then don't do this also, if you don't like it, then how can it be good? You think for yourself, this is the order of the day.  He will set the agenda, he will set everything, everything will be on his side, and this is not good, if you are not of him, if you don't do it, then you will fall asleep like you do, then the system of corruption will become such that you will not understand the politicians.  He is also very worried, what is he talking about today, hey, go and ask, many politicians are leaving politics, this is also a factor, there is nothing, there is no power, no money, no respect, no knowledge, next.  You will get tickets right now  Comedy is going on in the country, go and ask any politician, brother, you are getting a ticket, you will definitely get a ticket to contest again, no one knows anything, some are all roaming around doing this and that, so these are the things.  I am wasting my time, band and dog, then what should we do and to do good which is less than dead thousand, it means keep wasting time here, keep standing in line here, means keep giving more papers here, many people, many children, By listening to the taunts of your parents  From living in a small town, we come to a big city. Let's go to Mukherjee Nagar, we got rid of them, here we talk to our friends, youngsters, tea, water stand, and if nothing else happens, then at least we will have experience. They say that the friend who has studied on YouTube for 10 years.  Look, people with experience have no value; the experience gained has no value. ₹ 10 which you described as the crown of Palasi, happened in this year of Buxar in 1757.  In 1764, this is how it happened, then that movement happened like this, this is what happened: 2 kg chain means 2 kg, you cannot buy anything, you can buy the name, no shop, no one is going to give it the knowledge, no one is monetizing what is being taught. And after studying so much, there is no practicality, then the story is that you are not fit for a job, I have been preparing for UPSC for 10 years, I don't understand, how can people even play for one percent point, I am not  I will go, there is a chase of 50%, let's be positive, be completely optimistic because 50% of it is good point, optimistic for one percent, otherwise what should we do, do anything, friend, whatever the world is doing, you many people think like what to do.  Answer: No, easily, for free, Bhola Bhala will come on YouTube and tell you, then you will become rich through YouTube, one day ago, I was very poor, then I came to youth on clarity.  I and then he made me very rich for free without taking any money and did not make him say that you can earn ₹ 5000, you can earn 10000 just like this, then the right thing remains, what can I say, Akshay Srivastava ji has completed it, he said that like this  In this way also he is after everyone, don't give any free advice and if someone is not qualified then do n't give his advice, never listen to anyone for financial advice and invest only with me.  Listen, till date no one has become rich by investing. Money is made for use. The money which is useful and its free cash flow is very high. Meet the lion market. Brother, only the one who remained in the lion market and remained in the lion market is the relief.  The one who has a lot of money every month is not relieved. The one who had sent a ship to Switzerland to buy taxes, had done every education of his child for his life. He broke Gullak, Aamir Khan became rich. He is the lion in the market. The one who has so much money every month.  Money comes and he puts some points out of it, relief is there on the story in real estate or share market and if he does n't tease it then he comes and says that if he gets returns here in 15 years, then I will do this and this in this video. Your clip is left on the hanger on this one. If you want more aspect and clarity then do it but you are going to get these three surprises, do not go and discover these surprises, you got this and this, you got this, the first reward, they were showing one in Bangladesh.  Wrestling or boxing or I don't know what that is. He won a body building competition. He died so much that he made a body. He got the washing machine. The saree mixer of the washing machine. Washing machine is a big thing. He got the mixer and then he kicks it. Then after making it  You are saying that you have insulted us, meaning what award did you get Mixi? So when you go here, you will get the same surprise that I am a government servant, an officer, came here and organized so much competition, everyone is very happy.  He or she is middle class, you will not even ask if I belong to you, many parents are pushing, so do the pushing, there is no selection for you, there is some or the other selection, mother, I am selecting, send it.  Look at the thinking of those who select you. If I know that I am selected, I will look for one thing. By giving him a job, he is also a good fellow. Look, those who reach the interview stage where the final selection takes place, there everyone is the same.  As soon as it happens, because I have passed the paper, now in 19-20, I get a rank of 5-10, if it goes down in 5-10-20, then I would say that he definitely has more, his life will be clouded.  I am telling this, no one has told me, I have not been in touch with anyone. Nobody discusses but just think about it logically. If you have to select someone, both the candidates are fine but I know.  That friend, this is a matter of bread, you are also rich, there is doubt about it since yesterday, this poor guy is getting sympathy, why should he go to him, this is how it is, only a human being is sitting here too, because if I am in my organization.  If I am selecting for government or I look, I am not selecting for government but I am selecting for private, this thing seems to be applicable in private also, this formula seems to be there.  That friend, both of them are the same, he definitely needs more job, then his value will be more, on top of that, we can spot him more, the one who is not special in this food and drink, he will leave anyway, he is not able to get the job, that little pressure.  It comes to economics, get a job in private, a lot of recommendations are required in India, jobs in India are given by recommendation, so almost all the private jobs are available, these days it means there should be full recommendation because I don't have time to give any recommendation to you.  It is not worth typing, this is also the case in hair positions too, but there is selection in lower positions. In that, this thing which I have told you is a good caste, then I am this thing which people get disturbed after hearing, it is not politically correct, no one has told it, but brother, at least someone has.  Come and tell me, someone should come and give clarity, otherwise no one is talking, this thing does not happen like this, it should not happen, my friend, the biggest problem for me is this cry of the middle class, how long will this cry continue?  You will believe that this should not happen, exactly what has to happen will happen and the people who are behind making it happen are their incentives, there is logic, there is a star and that is yours, you will be wise that you are here in this situation, so now in this situation, your Maybe you don't have to lower your status to get the best. Now you don't want to come here because this situation is not good. If the man here is being recognized by you then he will feel proud of himself.  If he does, then he will have to be removed from this game, straight to the note, game, you play, I will make a video on this too, further games which unit you play, if you want, ok, thank you, subscribe and if you haven't liked it yet, please like it.

    "title": "04 Top Options To Invest In 2024 [KJnXMC5Qafo].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, I have said the top four things because I could not say one place to invest in 2024. I said four because 2024 has been rammed. I would like to tell you in four things, I will tell you in a simple way, asset classes are basically and how and what to do, I will tell you in this. Which one will you do among the four? You tell me, it's okay, I am not a SEBI registered analyst, nor am I going to give anyone's exact name, anyway, okay.  But what I want to discuss as a friend for education purpose is that the first thing you can do is buy some gold this year I am always a fan of actual gold, I mean I have made a separate video a couple of times about that.  They have made people give Sovan gold ball, take it, if it is ETF, that too is fine, whatever comes through mutual fund is fine, digital gold comes, that can also be taken, but beyond this, you can take it as per real gold.  If you want a separate video again, then I will make it. No, no, in that I had also explained the making charges, what are the charges for taking it, okay, I also know the making charges, they are fine, but still you can buy it in whatever way you want.  Hey brother, buy gold, okay, you should do good, okay, the second thing I will tell you, I will tell you one sector in the equity market, in the stock market, because look, there is a lot of run up, if you read something, then it is okay, then someone says it will crash.  Some say it will increase, some say  This will increase a lot, such stories are going on, as far as I understand, elections are being held in 40 countries, so this government will not allow much bad news to come, it will not call any bad news as bad news and there will be something or the other in all the countries.  There will be a feel good factor, now there will be no more noise from Israel and Hamas, the conflict that is going on, the media will also have such programs, Ukraine and Russia are also going on like this, the conflict is going on.  It is because there are elections everywhere, so to get votes, votes are not taken in negativity, they are taken in positivity and whatever is happening in all the countries, not in your own country, tell me in which countries there are elections today, within 2024, tell me the reasons for that.  There may be froth, there may be a run up in the equity market because that is also a factor, so one safe sector of the Indian stock market which I see where one can hide if you are very  There is no leverage. Again, I am not giving the name of the stocks here because here it is not that I am telling you to take this, take this much, I am talking about this particular sector and as far as I know, there are only four or five stocks in that particular sector.  Listed player is sixth and seventh, you won't even get it, man can pick up things even in the basket and that sector is G Insurance, we are still very under penetrated in insurance sector for the next 10 to 15 years. If we follow China also, the penetration in China is 18 to 20% of the population, which is somehow covered by insurance. You also know that insurance is life insurance, health insurance is life insurance.  Insurance, health insurance and then general insurance, car insurance, house insurance, this and that.  That too in hundreds of ways, the main thing is life, then comes health and then everything else, so there is a lot of growth in this sector, as the reason is financial banks are also run up, banks can also do well, they can do all that, but what is this?  If it is under-penetrated, then this is the market itself, which is this market because there are some companies inside it, but the size of this market is such that the size of this market is seen increasing in the coming 10 years, so there will be some run up, this will happen. Tell me how much you agree with this theory that this is a safe sector for us to hide because of IT we don't know whether it has increased or will decrease, what will happen in other places, there has been a lot of run up in mid cap small caps as much as this  This is a matter of life insurance, anyway, these are big companies, you will not find those small companies here, look at their corporate governance, look at their market cap, FII DI, look at their investments, there are a lot of them. Look at the regulatory thing, IDA is a regulator, that means checks and balances are there in your face, no one is small or big, companies are big, governance is also good, there is demand and sustainability too and the hangover of Covid is now gone. They are also coming out in all the years and you will see that run up has come in some and in some you may see run up coming, so I believe that this sector You can easily see in it, after that we go to the second place from the bottom. I come on real estate. Speaking of real estate. There is a lot of real estate. Real estate is a loose term. Buy a plot, buy a flat, buy a low rise, buy a builder floor, buy a shop, normal.  See Buy Office Pace, Buy Commercial, See Real Estate Investment Trust, I have told only a few things, further if you go into fancy things, then Warehouses, Godowns, Reets, don't you know that there are products of Bhati Bhati, when you say gold then you mean gold.  Like what happens in gold, you have to buy gold coins, you have to buy biscuits, you have to buy jewellery, you have to buy expensive gold chains, there is a little variety in it, look at how much variety there is in real estate, then if someone says that real estate will do good, just like someone says.  Yes, when it is said that real estate will do good, then real estate will do good for the buyers, it will do good for those who are making and selling, it will do good for the middlemen, it will do good for the banks, the government will do good for whom is the real estate? Brother, if it will do well for a loo and real estate, in which city will it do well, where will it do well, in which segment, where it will do well in a plot, then it will not do well in a flat, it also has a cycle, so now I am a particular thing in this.  But let me tell you that if you want to do real estate, here is a lot of my experience, call it wisdom, call it clarity, there is a lot of it this year, if you want to do it in any big city, wherever the name of the city is, then whatever.  smallest ticket size  If you get clean property, loan is available, clean construction, security, safety, rent is available, then you should prefer to buy such things. You can buy any small ticket size. In big cities, normally this goes through flats because there is a plot. Not only or very expensive, the smaller the ticket size, the more I have seen people making a mistake in real estate. People are very smart in the real stock market. There is a word used in the stock market called portfolio.  A Portfolio and I am in various sectors, I am invested. Like I told you today about a sector, life insurance is a sector, FMCG is a sector in itself, real estate stocks are their own sector, collision companies are their own sector, something related to defense is its own sector.  Finance has its own sector, Bank has its own separate sector, NBFC has its own separate sector, within that it means IT has its own separate sector, if you look at Automotive, it has its own separate sector in each of them.  If there are 1010 different five stocks then how many sectors are there and every person makes a portfolio in it by cherry picking that he picked this cement company, okay he made this equipment one, he made this automotive one, auto accessories are different in auto which makes light. Someone makes the steering, someone makes the seat cover, someone makes the seat, someone makes the mirror, someone else makes the inner stars, someone makes the engine frame, so many such things, if you go only in the auto sector, then you will get You will get 100 stocks. In every sector, you will get more than 100 listed players, which means there are companies that do different things. You will get a different company that makes axles. You will get a different company that makes shock absorbers, Gable India. Okay, if Auto is making this, then it is different.  Different meaning of tire companies, tires are also different, if it is auto sector, if you look at tire companies, you will find seven or eight of them, then a person uses his brain and makes a portfolio. People do not have this kind of interest in real estate. Why are people?  Family Wealth of 567 10 CR Is in real estate or want to build it Why are you stuck in the same city Why are you stuck in the same locality Geographical diversification Diversification of builder Diversification of the type of property Are all the plots the same people?  Or are all the people in the flats the same? Are all the big people or are all the small people or are all the people from the same builder or will they all buy at the same place or will they create separate portfolios for balancing?  From whom we will further get rental, we will put the rental in mutual funds in ATF in the equity market and they will create a cycle because people do not like real estate, they do a lot of stocks, you have to enjoy both, you should not take too much loan in stocks.  You cannot enter leverage here, there is leverage, property is created over time, after the property is built and I leave you with a hint, you have to concentrate here that brother, if the cost of fund is 85, the income tax is  On rebate small ticket, you can withdraw the entire interest of Rs 2 lakh and if the husband and wife have taken it, then he will get Rs 2 lakh, she will also get interest of Rs 2 lakh, then the interest of Rs 4 lakh will be spent on my property worth Rs 50 lakh. So try to.  On buying a property worth less than one CR, the cost of funds which was supposed to be 2.5% after taking out income tax, practically came to my 7% going forward interest rate.  There are going to be cuts, I will get the property in 3 to 4 years, I am taking it for 15 cycles, even if my rental yield is 4%, I have options at many places even for 6 taka, so 4 pax is 6 taka and I am  I have brought seven and in future it is going to reduce by one and a half, so this gap of mine is one and a half, two and a half, I can manage my cash flow comfortably and  Capital Appreciation Even if I am getting 10 12 13 T but the money is not going all in one go then I can get 13 to 15% return by paying sustainable capital where in the starting rental value is 444% end position. Till now you got 1617%, you got absolute, you got 10 to 11%, but the money went slowly, then you got 16 to 17%. When you get the position, it will not rise so much because the execution risk is over, now it will increase inflation linked. At 6 to 7, you will start getting rental, at four to five rental, at 8 to 10, it will double in 10 years. If it is 4 pa, what was being received will become 89 10 and the rate of rebar, the rate of cement, the rate of labor and the rate of land are all.  The price of goods like tile, everything is increasing, so if inflation is 5 to 5%, then the things have increased by that much because of replacement cost, so brother, when you calculate easily in this way, then you are steering at reasonable health returns. This is the return. Talking about stock market people, they also say the same thing, whenever there is rental calculation, they focus on capital appreciation and no one talks about rental. Brother, I had taken DDA's house in Janakpuri for two and a half lakhs in 1988 and 8990, the rent is coming at Rs 150 and a half lakhs. In which account will you put it today because you will not say, yes, yours is worth two and a half lakhs now.  It is worth Rs 1.5 Crore, according to that, this rent is not a % return. Hey brother, in which account is the rental of Rs 150 not deposited? No, how can it be deposited like this?  If it is there, we will consider only 3, right brother, because right now its value is Rs 1.5 crore, this is the whole catch, this is that no one will explain, financial influencer Wari Kuji never explains on Excel, Akshat never explains, I will explain without Excel, this is what I have done.  I am telling you that this is a channel only for those who have understood, I am telling you why there is any good college, there is good master, there is IIT, there is IM, there is no good college.  There is also an entrance test, it makes everyone sit that come, everyone come and everyone come, everyone come, then the Vivek Mandra controversy will happen, Sandi Maheshwari ji will make it in the future and if it is looted, then what am I saying here?  The thing that I told the calculation, those who have understood, this channel is for you only, it is a small channel, it is a quality channel, quality is in shortage and it is sold in shortage, so this is your benefit. The last thing on which I would like you guys to definitely invest.  Do that on yourself, you have forgotten to do that. Beyond that, I am telling you that we have forgotten to invest in ourselves. After completing your studies, learn some more useful things worth Rs. 200, 300, 500, 1000, 2000.  There are all kinds of things that someone or the other teaches at expense. You will have to invest in yourself. People are not investing because that college charged so much fees.  School guys suck so much when you get a job worth Rs 0000 What youngsters are doing What is this brother you take a job worth Rs 400 How much do you learn about investment You are not rich any place you will have to have a high  You will have to learn income generating skills or multiple low income generating skills will also suffice. Learn one high income skill, which is not very.  Easy but you can learn that also or multiple low to medium income generating skills which you can do simple, small things and that skill will have to be learned by doing any webinar workshop, this is what people do and not just by listening to something.  Even if it increases, there will be no need to do it, after that if Ramdev ji is doing Kapal Bharti, it is okay, he is doing Anulom Vilom and I am just watching, so my health will not improve by watching.  Yes, I am having a little fun watching this, I am getting to learn that this has to be done like this, this has to be done, but if I don't do something then do something else then nothing will happen, here the youth is getting messed up and too much of these videos.  Now stop thinking that if you do SIP of mutual fund like this, then in 5 years it will become this much, in 50 it will become like this, then crores will come, it is not known whether it will come, the content is a financial pawn, I will request all this.  Fin influencers now please stop making this financial pawn that if you do it like this then it will be like this why can't the focus is on learning that brother tell me the analysis of how the tile sector is doing in India. If brothers and sisters you want me to be a financial channel.  And what can I say about all these financial influences, okay no one can use such words but since this is a lesson, there is nothing left, how much is the market. What is the ecosystem, what is the accounting book, tell me the correct data, then the calculation would have been done in it, the stock would have been discussed as to whether it would be worth this much, take this, the whole discussion is on this thing, not on the process, not on the thought process, nobody in India.  This is teaching how to think, what to think, everyone is telling me, here I will request all of you, please invest in yourself. There are five to seven to eight intelligent people around you.  Keep it, if you can't keep it then keep it on youtube0 number. I myself call myself number one Shahana Shahana so that you feel a little bit because your fukare friends are not saying anything, they are neither claiming nor you. Know that because of this you will be just an average of two fine people who are in your life. You are in trouble, make friends with them. Trouble has come in your life, make friends with the idiots.  You idiots are here, calculate yourself, today I will finish the video by telling you something new, the amount of understanding you have to give, that is the average of the seven people you interact with, the amount of money you earn or your ability to earn, that is equivalent.  To just seven people with whom you interact, all of them are the average. Your peace, your happiness is the average of two seven people you interact with. So see who you don't want to interact with.  I can't avoid this, everyone can avoid everything, everything can happen to everyone, so this is something, I wanted to tell you, wish you all a very happy year, prosperous, we have to do it ourselves, okay, we have to work hard ourselves. I have already told on the astrology channel that 20224 years of wear and tear is energy, so wear out will have to be done, hard work will have to be done and I have just got a job, apart from that I have to work from time to time.  You will have to take out your high income or middle income or add your skill set, the employer will not give you time, he will take out all the juice, we are the ones who have to take out the time, so brothers and sisters, will you guys take out the time, if you want to join, then there will be my Subscriber Info Group, you can join in it.  If you are not already connected then you can take membership of the channel. Thank you very much."

    "title": "05 Investment Ideas To Sparkle Your Diwali ｜ इस दिवाली निवेश के लिए 05 अवसर [58yxtmbb97Y].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, this Diwali, five themes, five places, five things, whatever word you want to use, where you should invest, do it in all five, do it in the fifth, do it in the first, do it in all the places in which you want to do it, do it by mixing and matching.  I am bringing five things which are fine for you guys and you tell me which one was better for you and which one will you try, this is not an investment advice, I am telling this for education purpose.  This is my opinion and last time also when I had told that when he reaches for many stocks and many things, it feels good, even if he does not reach for half of it and does it once, but he will check how its returns are till next Diwali.  So the first thing is that you guys put these things on your wash list or beyond that, do your due diligence and tell me yourself which one you like better. So first of all, there are two or four reasons why I think silver is a run up.  One So Russia is buying it. Second, industrial use is happening a lot. Two things are increasing not only in India but everywhere in the world. One is the story of electrical vehicles and the other is of solar energy. Silver is used in both of them as a component of electronic items.  You know silver is used in various confines and quantity is fine but all this is increasing so silver has industrial use unlike gold and also investment use. You can buy it in de mat form in the form of Silver ATF, I am telling this for education purpose or you can go and buy some of it physically, whichever suits you better, you can buy Silver is something which is worth lakhs of rupees.  It has touched in the last one year, already good returns have come and it runs fast. Silver which we have seen in the past, so you can look out for it, you can understand the advice from your advisor.  If you want to take it, you can take it. The second thing that I will tell you about investing is a theme. I am not telling any one thing but I am telling a theme. And I see it doing a very good playout in the next year. And its  I will also tell you the logic, this is the theme, like we say auto answer in the auto sector that if someone makes an excel, then Jamuna is not asking to invest in it, I am telling the example that because by doing word auto answer, a  If there is a word, then in the same way I am coining a new word, I am coining a new theme, Real Estate Answer: If this is real estate, this is a house, then it is the developer of the house, then the one who makes the stocks of the house is DLF.  Okay, macrotech developer is done, Lodha says that Shobha is done, meaning listed Godrej is 10 12, so this is all, this is running up, the matter is not speaking on this, hold NCL. What will come in the answer? Your tile and sanitary ware people have come, your ply board people have come, your paint people have come. Check in this, do research on top player teeth and beyond that, post a watch list. The reason is that now their production requirement will increase.  And the demand will be very high because whatever real estate has been sold in the last three years 2022 23 24 has been sold at an all time high, that is why you see this. I have mentioned the names of all the developers. Look at the increase in their share prices because they have done the booking. Now when it will be completed in 2025, 26, 27, 28, so much material has been sold. Look, how is the real estate doing today, how is it doing the day after tomorrow, that is important.  Yes, but it is important for the share price of these developers. But brother, the goods that have been sold will be covered, tiles will be applied, fans will be taken away.  Copper wires will be inserted inside them, it is okay, ply boards will be installed, all kinds of things like this, whatever is used inside the houses, you can check the stocks, there has been a big correction in some of them, like the ones with tiles, up to Rs 1500, Kajaria, some.  It was gone, after that the correction has come, all these come in Sera Sateri ware, I am taking names for education purpose, I am not asking you to buy, I am suggesting a theme, you will have to work a little hard.  Look, it is very easy, come up with five of my 5000 stocks and tell me, it is very easy, tell me, but you can pick and choose by suggesting the theme. Housing finance companies will also do something very good. Whose book is being traded at which book value?  You like it more, how do you understand it, you have to check, so this was the second theme, the third theme where you think I should invest is in Medical, I know two stocks, so I  I am telling you for education purpose, if you can tell me better stocks than that, then tell me because as the focus of the government is increasing on insurance and some state governments are also bringing a lot of insurance, it has come in Rajasthan, now in Haryana kidney and  They have started treating everyone and now it is becoming an issue in the elections that someone should put insurance so that people can get treatment. Now when they get treatment, people will consider the whole system as medical. Wherever there were treatments, the two stocks as far as I understand are Narayan Hrudayalaya and this is my own since I live in Gurgaon, so I have an idea of ​​Medanta, so add it to your watch list. Where to study these companies?  What are their expenses, how many hospitals are there, how many beds are there, what is RE, please go to screener.in, make your watch list there and try to study all these.  The themes are being told and this is long term, it is not that their shop can be finished in two or three years, I do not think that this will happen, okay, so you put in this theme, Medanta has its own lion.  That something is going on around Haj, Narayan Hrudayalaya keeps running between 1200 Sas because when the video is made then it increases and decreases, so almost I told you, I have no target price, this and that, this is what I see, man, this.  They are good for 10 years also, they are good for 20 years too, so tell me how good you liked them and the fourth thing I would like to tell you is that you should invest in real estate. Everything in the cities has become too CR. If you want to invest for the middle class then wherever things are coming in lax because there are plots. If you are crazy about the plot then do something big in the plot.  If a good developer, a good city is giving a story plot, then the plot is available to a lot of people, take that or take a small flat because it is very difficult to get licenses, it is very difficult to get things, it is not easy and very demanding.  So in the things you buy in LAX, the ticket size is smaller. It is possible that by changing the definition of affordable housing, the government may hear that the price which was Rs 45 lakh, is being discussed to bring it down to Rs 56. This is speculative but it may be possible because the value of money is less, so the definition has to be changed, now if 45 lakhs were called affordable housing or a limit was imposed that below that, people have to pay GST on Rs. 1 lakh, then the government has to pay GST. Changes will have to be made because there is inflation, there is inflation, everything is there, so that thing also seems to be fine for me, so if something is available in this small ticket size in a city, then it has to be taken, many people say that no, it is a city.  My city is far away, it is here brother, look, when you invest money, the company is also far away, you will not say that you will go and live in Jamnagar, only then you will take it, but he has to see it and who else has the property?  Yes, a lot of property management firms are coming in the market. Where they will take care, they will become Ola. A lot of real estate will also come but before they come, there will be run up.  You will start seeing, we already know the names of the companies. If you want to do this, then Stan Living, New Zoho Life, all this, you check these names, tell me some more names, there are many more names, now these names have come to you, you are five-six names.  And what are those, you can write in the comment section, then you have to make this investment. The fifth thing that I will recommend, which I will also consider as an investment, is that in the comment section you will find some of my small courses, it is very good. Gives perspective immediately, you can earn money by consulting it, then I have a thing called pre-marital consultation, you will get discount on it, Diwali 33, happiness course is one, happiness course is two, both are different, they can buy, want to buy astrology.  You can buy Astrology's Art of Decision Making, it's only Rs. 00, there is discount beyond that, Diwali 33 and Financial Clarity for All.  There is a workshop of 50, I want to take a look, do the test and it is spoken in a structured way for two hours, it is told for one and a half hour, two hours, beyond that people have made presentations and given it to people and people are you no sounding very intelligent to the peer group.  Wherever they do it, many people have earned a lot of money from pre-marital consultation. 30 Golden Questions that should be asked by boys and girls before marriage.  Consultant so that both of them get to know because many people do not ask in Sharma Sharmi, the basic question is that workshop is mandatory, so you can take it, apart from that, take the rest also, there is a discount going on, so that is also an investment, you have to.  Invest in Yourself Also: You have studied school, completed college, got a job, now what if you are a housewife then what to do now, can you not become a consultant, can you become one, okay? What is the work of a pre-marital consultant? Yes, we ask the questions. Who asks the questions? We would have asked the questions which the boy's father cannot ask to the girl's mother, whether it would be such that the girl's mother wants to ask the boy's mother, but Can't ask so that it becomes clear, otherwise what will happen, otherwise it gets cleared later, then the shoes are saved, then the shops of people like us, like those of marital counseling, are running, so we are kicking our stomach and telling you that.  Brother, even when he goes to buy a car, a man asks four questions, but he should know that how much horse power is there, what is the mileage, what are the safety features, he asks some questions even before buying a mobile, same thing, same thing.  Pre-Marital Consultation So please invest in these things this Diwali. It is okay to spend money and these are all the returns. We will check which one will get the highest returns next Diwali. I have started my courses.  In that, the return on investment is going to be very high, it is okay because the base price itself is within hundreds, so by investing a few hundred rupees, you will get a lot more, but the rest of the four things I have told you are also very very nice and niche and among them  You will definitely try hard and sparkle your Diwali this time and continue you know watching the channel Liking Share in the comment section and write good as much as you want, write bad, don't write anything, write bad  There is no benefit, it is not good, let's make videos with great effort brother, if you don't like it then it does n't matter, but if you like it then please write and like, share and increase subscribers by becoming the only knowledgeable person in your family.  There is no use, many people say to me Guruji, I did not forward your videos so that I can become knowledgeable. It is okay that I have become more knowledgeable than my friends, but there is no benefit in becoming the only knowledgeable person in my family. No, because you will have to carry them also because many times, did n't father become knowledgeable? You became alone. Father has the money, get it invested. I alone became very knowledgeable. What is the benefit, you became knowledgeable, you became the wife, you did not make the wife.  She will be a little behind in her things, then see, it is not certain, there is no conflict like that, it will be better if both of them come together, there is a request to increase the number of subscribers in the family. Increase the number of subscribers by three. Who is increasing how many this Diwali, please tell me for sure that I am increasing two, I am increasing three. If you want to watch live, there are 30 live sessions, some will definitely be planned. Thank you very much."

    "title": "05 Mistakes Young Indian Women Making Which Are Eroding Foundation Of Indian Society [85rdpj6mLSY].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, this is a very important video, it is about women, but the whole society has to watch it, boys must watch it and understand it properly, girls also must watch it, parents must watch it, share it everywhere on family groups. Do this, this is a very important video, what mistake are these girls doing? Only those who observe the society will tell, only they will tell. Before this, I will tell you that I had made a video. You all must have seen two burgers, one movie and gold digger girls in it.  People thought that the video was for women and was against men. That video was for men and this video was for women. What do people say, they don't praise, they say balance in one.  Please do it brother, which channel is Shahrukh Khan's picture here, which will be made in many years, if the video is made, then today it is the women's turn, we have to tell them what is happening, then tell us how much is right and wrong, what is the first mistake that young women in India make?  I am doing  They are doing body count before marriage, it is very high, they are sleeping around with lot of men, no one is coming and telling them and I am telling this from my experience, I am not like this here, some videos of eating and drinking  By doing this, I am telling you in a very conscious manner, I have a very high body count, what is it for everyone, not for everyone, but it is of a high percentage and is of such a high percentage that a section of men observes it.  It is being done and has taken the form of a lot of pandemonium, it is very vulnerable. Females feel that giving sex to a boy. Nowadays, women are using it like a coupon code. It may seem like this in a little language but it is definitely important to tell.  It is important to use this language also. Some boy has helped you a lot in the office, helped you in finding a house, helped you in shifting your house, someone is removing your loneliness in a big city, he is showing you support, so brother, you should do that for him.  give sex  There is no need to give him sweets. There is no need to give him sweets in the form of sex. Another big mistake, I will tell you about such mistakes in four-five minutes. You have to listen with full patience. I am Guruji, people come and troll me like that, many a times hey go ahead.  So he will tell Janji, if we don't tell, then who will tell? You people of the stupid generation will share notes among yourselves, we will tell you brother, we are the only ones who do the consultation, we are the only ones who have the time, wisdom, discretion and consciousness. You all have it. Otherwise, we will tell you, I am telling you, so listen carefully and I want to tell women that you do not have to sleep with anyone just like that, by sleeping with someone, there is an energy exchange with them, there is emotional baggage, there is some attraction, there is your value.  Falling for a woman, her virginity or sexuality, whatever you think of it, is a big thing, once a man gets it, it is not going to be very interested. Now understand this, no one.  Will explain and I am telling more in practical terms than in morality and I will tell in practical language because what will you say next, I know a lot, I am a feminist and this one because what I told you, I am Nana Male Shamanistic, I am a realist, I am not coming as a moral science teacher. Should not be done, I want to tell you this, brothers and sisters, all the brothers and sisters who are youngsters, that brother, you are having sex, you are not using protection, no protection.  Hey brother, you use emergency peel, you don't use condom, you had a time of HIV AIDS, now you don't even feel scared, you are ready to sleep with anyone without getting tested, you do n't even use condom, you use emergency pills.  Yes, you keep your body count high, then your body becomes shapeless because of those pills, then you are not considered a normal alpha male, then you are a decent boy, you are 30 years old and your Your tummy is gone, everything is shaken because of hormonal imbalance, that 72 hour pill is age, if doctors who are sahiba doctors, male doctors, whoever they are will write it is some sort of an abortion only it takes a toll on your body it  Is supposed to be used as emergency pill not as contra Septim contraceptive is a different thing and this I pill is a different thing then  You have gynecological issues, then you don't know what other diseases are ahead of you and then you do n't get boys and in today's digital age, a digital character starts becoming yours. With whom did you take the photo, where did you take the photo? There was Instagram2 in which there was a Ratna Pathak branch.  There is some and there is some grandmother, I don't know who it is or Neena Gupta, maybe she means that when such things are made then people like that brother, if you do a test drive before buying a car, then a test drive is a test drive.  So the problem becomes that you people are not a car, there are no emotions developed in the test drive of the car, you drove the car by pressing the accelerator and did something and then went away. Human beings are evolved, does sex happen like this? There are no emotions evolved.  The problem is that the body count has become so high that when you go for a wedding, someone likes sex, someone likes sense of humor, someone likes looks. Someone likes money, someone likes home background, someone likes ambition, someone likes dimple on the left cheek, someone likes hair, someone likes personality, now you have done so much, now you are all of them. So it can never happen in one, if any man comes to you with any wish, tell me he has these eight traits which I have told you and even if there is such a person, then he will not marry you with a person with high body count because someone  Too  If you ask here and there, she was with him in college. Facebooksignup.in Women feel so pressurized. I am not doing any character assassination by coming here, I am saying why do you feel that you have to do it and  Mostly I will tell you the secret at the end, this video will be a little long, this is the first time I am coming like this, otherwise hey, you don't say anything to girls, you scoundrels are boys only, are these girls having sex with girls?  These are the scandals that are happening, they are also boys, the rest are boys sitting like this, they neither see nor understand anything, those mails are of their own kind, they are of a different kind.  This is a system, you have to understand that I am telling women that this is not the concept of lock in key, that I am just roaming around with my key, it is clicked with it Guruji, click with whom it will be clicked, this lock is also changing, the lock is a dynamic situation. beans are not the key  It will suit you, don't take double meaning dialogue out of it, but I am telling you that you are changing. Today, at the age of 21, you have started clicking with someone. Seeing this, in a superficial year, you got wise that oh, this is also money.  Something happens, other things also happen, love, wow, looks are not alpha male, nothing happens, he was going in a motorcycle, then these issues come, there the gym guy attracted you and was making you a fool. His income was 400 Haj, then you want good income for your income, so brother, what is happening, these people are earning money, they are doing their work quietly, they are not able to do it, when they come to them, those boys will definitely say second hand.  Third hand, fourth hand is used in such slang, I am not a trite put, I am talking about what is heard in the society, second hand goods, third hand fourth goods, so what are these boys saying the same thing?  I want girls to compete with boys instead of the fact that we have empowerment and empowerment means that boys can sleep with 10 girls, so we too will not sleep with boys. You should not lose your virginity and give virtue to many sexual partners.  The society has to be made such that even boys should not have competition, we should not have the chance to fall down, boys have already been destroyed, these days I will say boys have become [ __ ] which is called  In a way, it means that they are going to become princesses, that is, they are left wearing pink clothes, nowadays even boys are becoming like this, but it is very important to see the girls, it is to be seen that this generation is neither one nor the other, just like there was once a generation of rebellion.  Hippie generation is not sustainable because mom is not happy in marriage. All the previous generations have kept it as junk. Most of the moms and dads are also included who are the parents of the children. Will they ever marry? I was not happy, my father tortured my mother a lot, she had to do all the work of her family members, mother-in-law had all her issues, her mother always kept crying that you should do something, you should study, you should go out, you should do something, otherwise you will get bread like us.  This one will keep growing, that girl lives in a small town on India 95, then that girl has come to a big town, so these are the two secret things that I will tell you, keep listening to what we get to see even from small towns.  When she comes, she also gets very excited. She thinks that now in the big town, to please the boy, I will have to give him sex in other ways, he will not be interested, I have had so many consultations, I have so much experience and I am not just speaking.  Off my hat, they say, Guruji, we are like that if we do n't give him sex like this, then he will break friendship with us and go to that girl. This is what these boys have created. How are these boys kept? You say that a boy's daughter has become like this, so some boys have won and they go from here to here, from this branch, from that branch, from that branch, from that branch, from that branch, on 20 off the boys are like this.  And he has dated a lot of girls, meaning he doesn't stop at 20, he is neither a victim nor a hunter, I am using the word, I don't like that Guruji is a man, I am using such bad words, but this is how people are in this domain.  They are operating and this is what they consider to be victims, they say like this, fi down th down, how many are you, this is the count, this pride is going on too much and girls are being annihilated, body and soul, no one respects you, boy whom  You give sex in writing, don't take it, it was genuine love, it was my love, so tell me with yellow hands, if you don't have sex then your face is turning black, remember that sex is available in only two ways in India.  with yellow hands  I am also wearing a yellow shirt today, it is okay, you will get sex by turning your hands yellow or you will get sex by blackening your face, now it is your choice, then if something else happens to you, then do not say that yes, it has become an MMS, look at it, you should not have made it an MMS.  It was you never, the boy who can't wait, the one who wants sex from you in return by doing any work for you, then you have some sense friend, thank you, you can say this, you helped me in shifting, is it a colleague, is there any friend, I am not this. Saying, don't do friendship, don't talk to someone, you have to click with someone, marriage has to happen, some conversation has to happen, interaction will happen but do n't do these things like drive, friend, if someone 's testosterone is fine then it can be tested before marriage, check the hormones. People go and if medical test is done then the matter will be fine. People, is there a lot of lack of sexual education in India, then people do not know anything, how according to what, whatever sexual thing is done, it is o period of chemistry.  There is no such thing in married life, there should be fireworks right from the beginning because in my observation again, I have seen that girls have sex so much that they get filled up. Today I am going to give you a  Let me tell you one more thing, sex is like dopamine, God created it that sex should be fun but its ultimate purpose was to get pregnant, have babies, this purpose was this, relationship in all details, this and that.  I am starting my relationship course after Diwali. If I want to enroll for it then I need a consultant. There are 40 crore people in India of this generation and those 40 crore people need at least 40 lakh consultants, one for every 100.  If so, then you have come to Blue Ocean Opportunity, earn money and join the relationship. I will explain it very clearly and I am going to tell you a secret that more Who are the girls who are vulnerable, who are the more exploited girls, who are more messed up, then I will tell you that thing and for that, it is okay for you to stay connected, so the concept of small town, I told that there are issues there, it does not mean that in big town.  Such is the thing about Rajas, the girl who does not have a father figure in her life is missing the one she was growing up, she becomes very very vulnerable 11th In the 12th class, during the college time, and those scoundrel boys, they come to know that absence of father figure does not mean that father is dead, it means father was not evolved, father did not spend money, never gave respect, was not a protector.  Not man enough, it was like that I will have a daughter, I will take her wherever I want to go and the burden of the house is coming on her, that I have to do some funding for my father and mother.  On the contrary, a man has to be late, if not a father then it should be a brother who says that yes my sister, you will go like this, we will remain like this, you are you, when there are non-relatives, those who are not a father and a brother is not when they  I am telling women that you will seek help, and you are not married because when you get married, your husband is supposed to do everything. But if you are between 20 to 30, you are not married and your father and  If brother has no role in your life then be assured there will be many men who will be like that brother, we need this from you and then I am saying that these many boys are roaming around as movers and packers and help us.  It means please don't fall into such a trap, please pay up, today there is technology, today everything a female can do, she does not need to depend on anyone, just press the button in the mobile. paytm-in If you get married, then the child is not born because you have exploited that entire area of ​​your uterus and it has been exploited so much. The abortion pill there is fine and very very strange. Then you ate some of these things like this.  That there are many other issues like IPL, okay I am not even talking about that she is also involved in cigarettes, drugs and alcohol, because you have seen boys doing this, so we will also do this, boys fell in girth.  Happened  Gender is man, more than half of them have fallen, why are you competing with them? That saying, our girls are no less than our boys, is turning out to be true in a very negative way. Girls are now no less than boys in performing opposite and straight actions. In work, they are beating them at their game, that's good, you drink alcohol, I will drink more than you, I will also style, because this is empowerment, this is not  Empowerment Empowerment is What empowerment is Finding a good partner for yourself Having a good married life Settling down at a decent age Which is 2425 No, our career is not fixed Career will keep getting fixed No husband tears anyone's books and does not say this in an interview  She is married, everything happens, no, our job is the biggest mistake and problem and girls have disease, I would call it disease and girl.  Those with a salary of Rs 40,000 also want a boy of Rs 2 lakh. The one with a salary of Rs 40,000 is not happy with the salary of Rs 60,000. It should be Rs 2 lakh. The one with Rs 2 lakh will not value your salary of Rs 40,000. He will say leave it. Then you will say yes, this. So I did it for 2 lakhs, it's a matter of time, I want to tell all the girls and the  Parents the sex ratio is getting ok in the marital market Yes in 1990 lot of abortion had taken place because of that gender based natal test especially in North India Punjab Haryana Delhi Rajasthan UP and Maharashtra it happened a lot in this belt because of that there was delay  There are more tantrums because of missing girls. Because of girls, demand is more than supply. It is like buyer and seller if there are buyers in the market.  If it is too much and the seller is less then the rate of the property will increase. As its price increases, similarly the prices of girls have increased but all these prices Guruji from Gurugram is telling you I am a professional in this, I am not just an astrologer.  I make all the future predictions for 5 years on the day, this is the attitude you have and the tough boy you are becoming and crying and awakening the consciousness, intellect and conscience, brother, wait for two more years.  Do it and there are really good girls still no one is saying like this I am not painting everyone but I am saying that there are many girls in an eco system who are doing this so that in observation it seems that all the girls are like this  Look, out of 100 girls, this is happening in 2025, 75 are still very okay, but people are not able to see that 75 because in big colleges, they go to big cities and this is the culture.  So the same thing is happening there, this girlfriend system, what is a girlfriend, what is a girlfriend, one is a girl, one is a boy, both are friends, but within that, there is a movement that you and I mean, I went to the room and had sex, somewhere else I did this so much reporting.  It has happened and in that you are not using condom, you don't know any hygiene, you don't know about HTD, so mean, I thought 15 years ago, they are smarter girls about this time, that's how to do it. Whatever it is right now, there is no one to teach racquet, no one to tell, my body is my, it is your body but you are doing your own thing with your body and then you are crying in your 30s that I am not getting it.  I am not able to understand that this thing is visible on the face of a girl who sleeps with five six seven eight men. Today I am telling you that no one would have told that this has happened with so many people. It seems that someone would call and find out and do the same.  is fighting  Fighting boys and these boys, who are boys at 80, boys at 80, they are not into all these things, whichever boy you tell, who will be into all these things, he is preparing for the competition, getting a job, earning money, where will he do it from?  If you are able to do this, then the one who is doing this work directly is not able to penetrate into it and I have to say again and again, gym boys, gym boys, because this is the matter, brother, the body becomes from morning to evening. remained  Hey brother, your job is to earn money. Now if you are not a model and you are not going into film acting and your body doesn't suit me, I have to take care of my body. Hey body, you stay in the gym the whole day.  You are sitting hunting, will someone come there, I am telling you openly, that important thing of yours, the body is made by going inside that mirror, the body is made in the park, which gym do the wrestlers go to, which gym do the bodybuilders go to?  means  Everyone else also does theirs if it is genuine but this is what is going on, this filth is going on in the society. It was high time that some buddy like me came and called out because the plate is saved with two hands only. It is not that boys do anything alone. Women are out of it, you are controlling me, clap banize off, he wants it, no brother, I don't want clap banize, I am just telling you, madam, you can do it with sex condom now again and again.  By using it, you are not very disturbed. Yes, don't you? Why are you not afraid of STD? You are not afraid of HIV, you are not afraid of AIDS, you are not afraid of Gonorrhea, you are not afraid of syphilis, you are not afraid of pregnancy. By doing all this with your body, you expect that my  After all, now I will be a loser type of 30 years, I will be bedless, I will not get a job for more than 400 thousand, now I want a good boy worth two lakhs, now tell me why you don't deserve good.  Boy you are not a high value woman there is concept of high value woman and she is monogamous in the society across all cultures all religions all countries all geographical locations is always considered good the institution of marriage is not just like that madam and madam as well who  Boys are boys, I am telling them also, this is the last and it will still last, this is your hippie culture.  Like the body count is coming and it will end There will come a time after three four five years when you again that system will come that where girls will recognize this that friend this is all not to be done Apna Ok It is Rang and Jin Jin  I have also done this to you and regretted it half the time, I told you, there was no father figure, no one to support me and peer pressure and certain restrictions were such that now my  What should I do, I am being exploited by those who say these comments and write that people are finding it in corporates, here and there I am one female is doing it and they will lie with everyone the fact that I am still doing it now.  People will say that it is their choice. Look, you cannot make every choice about these things in the society. If you come, you will be told that it is your choice.  It is not a very great thing to make If Sambalpuri [Music] Do you know what earlier men would abuse and run away, now women would abuse and run away Which is okay but Sambalpuri is that you will not be able to do that His wife will divorce him  The marriage will break down. Whatever will happen to him if he gets caught. But what are you gaining? Is it worth it? Is it worth anything? How?  Can you commoditization is harmful for health, they are saying that mutual funds are subject to market risk, you have to write disclaimer, this is your waste in work and the parents here are cotton money, they are not monitoring anything.  What is happening, neither are you telling anything nor do they think that brother is doing this these days, take care of his body, his mind, what do we have to do, nobody is saying that you don't mean the fact is. Ultimately, how many test mic tests will you do? By taking one mic like this, with how many people will you do mic testing? You will become clear cut, as I told you again and again, your body has memory. Every time after marriage, you will do it with some buddy, you will remember that.  Big, because there must be someone inside him, meaning that the boy is right inside that kind of sex, who must have given you that kind of pleasure, then he will not forget you, who is yours. You will say, dear Munna, you will not be able to become a good father and a hard-working home-building husband, and where will you get married? Because this is how it will be, because you will not remember that when you are having sex with that person when you were young.  There was no stress there was no sass around there was no emotions so that was not that so when you get married then that  It may get better gradually but the fireworks are not happening which were happening earlier, so right from the beginning you will feel that it is not working out, it is not fun and the same thing is true for men also, I am here.  I have made a video of women, it is fine but the same is happening with men too, you have done it with so many, when you have someone to marry, you had to see such a package but there is a problem. What S package will you see? Personality will be missed by someone. Body will be missed by someone. Money will be missed by someone. What you have got now is a decent package but you are not satisfied with this decent package because it is nowhere in the six parameters included in it.  I am not a topper student, the package is decent, the package is decent, but you have given up, now by doing this, these men are seeing what else is happening to men and they are becoming losers, my complaint is more than that of boys, that people like you.  This is why women have become like this, this is also a fact, it is the fault of women also which I am telling, but this mistake is second order, this vent color of Patria and the sense of entitlement that we are born as boys.  So, everything will happen automatically for us, so these people have done that to them, unless the right things happen here and this demand supply mismatch does not end, then these things will definitely remain in the next society for three to four years, but  After 2028 you will find a lot of things changing back to good but I am saying that friend, do it before it happens, today I am telling you even today if the girl is listening to me, the woman is listening if your  1 2 3 4 5 There is a case going on about the body count. Stop it man, just because of four. It is going on about a dozen, that means 15. Do it make a difference. Today I went there for a walk. So this is what people told me, I am not telling anyone by name in the consultation, but I am breaking someone's pricy, but by the way, she went alone like a midwife and after seeing that, I met her there to get high and the one night stand was ruined.  It is not safe, it is crying too much, I am telling you this is such a crazy thing, all the culture, all the religions, all the people who say that Bhai Monom is the best friend, mix it will. Lead Two: Here you are becoming as stupid as men to become equal to men. You are becoming as bad-mannered as men. Men can never be defeated by becoming bad-mannered because the level of men is very high in bad behavior. Strengthen your character, you will attract.  A Good Man Madam All of the Females I'm Dressing You Will Attract A Good Man There Are Very Good Men Out There Don't Lose What Ever Your Dignity to Any Tom Deacon Harry Chalte Pharte Ki Ko Utni Aukat Ho Gaya Aapki And You Will Start Hatinger Yourself It's a Fact That Man What I Did Means It's Like If and If I Show You an Actual Feeling If You  Actually remember Priyanka Chopra's picture, which one was it in which Kangana Ranaut was also a model, but I can't remember the name. You were the heroine, no, not the heroine, there was something else, the name of the movie, you guys, write down in that movie, she is so drunk out of drugs that she is some kind of negro type like this, it closes and just she sleeps around with before that, she was going around with.  The Married, that is the character of Arbaaz Khan, who is okay with him and then what is his condition, yes, this is this, an average story is going on today, an average story is going on, like that Priyanka.  Chopra's character was like that, first she was her own, then a forest guy, then random and there was a good boy in her life, that meaning is the same and there is no one to explain it to the end because who would come to tell if the father is missing?  The father does not have the authority to speak to the girl. The father should never provide money to the girl, never support her, otherwise he was missing in action. From which mouth will he say anything, what are you doing? The girls who are raising half of them.  The family members have such scenes too, these scenes are also there, of course I do not want to do stereotypes and all that, but by doing this, I am telling one thing that where it is, it means that such things are not happening in other places. Look, never do anything.  It cannot be 100% true in itself, there are patterns, there are chances, there are probabilities that yes, this is what is happening in this section, this is what is happening in that, because if you live in that society, then no  No one will whisper to you, catch you, shame you, or feel scared, but as soon as you go to a big city, you get a sense of unteachable from a small town. You click the lock completely and see that the matter is going on and there will be divorce in two years. Because when you were living together, sex was good, we were not very possessive about each other, we used to do some work for money, it was a similar scene, families had not evolved, there was nothing, now the same living couple.  It seems to be right now, as soon as you get married, the quality of sex changes, everything changes, your relationship changes, everything changes because marriage is for a long term, so many things will change in it, casualness will not work.  I asked for that friend, I asked for this, what difference does it make, I did it like this, I did it like that, you came after meeting this one, you came after meeting me, what is the difference, you also stayed together, okay my body, my mind, today my friend is coming.  Are you a friend, if she is going to live in then it is fine, brothers and sisters, but that living in does not work after getting married, so when it is not working for her, then don't do this click test right thing, brother, this lock and key will click with her.  You will click and don't do this work with him. Too much, too much, do n't study behind the morality. That moral science teacher, I am telling you again and again that it is practical, it is not practical. This thing is not practical. Many generations have seen it before.  It was the puppy generation, people were pushing from here to there, someone was going from there, it was a dozen, it gives you happiness, it is not sustainable and makes you life miserable, so I hope the females and girls will not do this just because of what many people are doing. People see that she was my sister, my cousin was mine, she was his wife, if we are doing this then we will become rebels, this is the rebel thing that the dacoit did not run away.  Okay, which Paan Singh of Tumar was that? We are not dacoits, we are rebels. Why are we rebels? Because we are fed up with all these things, we have become rebels, so the girls here are also becoming quite rebellious, she is saying. That my mother is not happy, my cousin is not happy in marriage, all men and everyone do like this, yes, this is also a big problem of the society, you have made the women rebellious by doing your nonsense, these mother-in-laws who are the mothers of the boys.  Mothers are half and half, this is responsible, what are we doing, it is not like this, we will find the right one, we will crush her, then you get addicted to this one, then she comes and the matter settles somewhere else, then she gives only 498, then you do not understand. Because this matter has been spoiled by the society but I am saying that nothing happens in life even by becoming a rebel. Yes sometimes things are not ok in the system for the common man but it does not mean that you should become a rebel. Yes Society Is Failing Mostly Ill Se T Figures Are Going Men Are Feeling I Will Always Be Sosa I Will Just End The Video By One Sin And I Want To Make A Detailed Video On It And I Want To Address The Men And The  Women And Every Subscriber Every Buddy Listening Till Now This Is A Man's World Men Are Running It Anything Goes It  This is a man's problem, so don't worry about the number of rights that women have got, these laws should be made by men and they should be made better, but as a man, when his father-in-law fails, in a house, he fails his wife.  Don't say shut up and that is a lot of atrocities, thousands of women and girls see that atrocities and they see that we will become rebels and you will torture us only when we come to you, but the fact.  This is that after doing all that, you will get such a daughter-in-law whose body count is 10 12 14 10 12 14. You cannot shame the person with body count in such a way that he is not afraid, his fear reduces because he has seen everything.  Lia in life, this is the truth of life, then try it and then say, oh girl, you are useless, she does everything like this, society has not been created, yes, society has not been created, now in my life, whenever we discuss, I have such requests.  Why make it men versus females and all this? I teach something to the men and they run away wondering why he is telling us, so I told the women in this one, okay now boys will be happy and then what will you get?  There is a lesson from this, what will you do, today you will say, yes, you have made a very good video, you have shamed them like this, SLU, by doing this, they have shamed you by doing a dash, such people will say, if you have done something, then what is the benefit? What lesson do you learn from me? Yes, it will be very dirty, then and the same thing I tell girls when I make videos of boys, yes, they are very dirty, then what will you do, where will you get it from, I had told earlier also in the video about boys. The two burgers and the one made by a movie star, will the girls come from outside Switzerland and will you like the one from Switzerland? Do the comparison in terms of what ever, where will the girls come from?  Where will it come from, means you will think in your mind that you will be born, it is not so, girls are roaming in the society, what is their thought process, according to that, you have to see, otherwise where will you do it, where will you go and do it, the same girls have to think in the society. Don't Shame Each Other Gender Wise Girls Dirty Boys Dirty Boys Dirty Girls Dirty All Are The Same All Are Greedy Okay All Are Greedy Everyone Has Fear Everyone Wants Me To Do Something  I don't like it, brother, but this world doesn't work like this, this is the era of give and take, I will make videos on this in future also and I am not going to leave, I am a social reformer of the society, social observer, it is not like this here. I have to leave, I will take you somewhere. If you are together, yes, but something personally bothers you that you are walking on this path and are doing this, then you should never make a personal attack on anyone, that is a general thing.  To  We have to take the society together, the solution will come from the society itself, the society itself has to see whether we need the solution or not, what is needed, so I hope you liked this video, do write in the comment section and subscribe to the channel.

    "title": "05 Never Heard Home Loan Benefits ｜ Must Watch Video [16_8pZ4Xw3w].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today's topic will be very unique. Some unique benefits of home loan. General benefits of home loan. So you have heard that income tax return property and how you can protect your property. Some of the top benefits are the top benefits of any property of yours and you live in a big city. You have ancestral property in a small town. Everyone knows what kind of properties are there. Well, now many times it is in possession, it is in possession of relatives, it is in possession of someone else, you have it in the city.  NRIs who are not going to India may also have these issues. Okay, so the way to protect them is to take a loan against ancestral property. When you take a loan, whatever the loan agency is, it will scrutinize the paper very well. Many times, what happens? Now we are parents, it's fine and the paper work is not complete and when inheritance comes, you don't understand what happened to father and mother, many things can be solved while mother is alive, but how can those things be checked? Do it brother, take a noonal home loan, no one is asking you to take a loan of ₹ 10 crore, 5 crore, 1 crore 50 lakh, you can easily take a loan of ₹ 5-10 lakh, parents may get income tax benefit in that, although you  That's what they are doing, you can easily take the money for renovation like adrevise and when your documents are completed and they go to the bank, no one can do anything with the papers, no one can make the other disappear. Do something yourself, in this case, if any of your case turns out to be a matter of disguise, then it is easy to prove it in the court of law because your loan is going on, you understand what I am saying, the loan is going on, so the bank has given the loan to you, if the loan is going on, then the bank has given the loan to you.  If he has given that ownership right off course, if he has determined it well, then this is a very beneficial thing, very beneficial and east it ten help you and there are four punches and aspects of this aspect which I probably just here in front of this, I three-four  I am going to tell you the benefits  Which I can tell more openly any time under Wagner, who does educational programs. There is a real estate info group in the comment section on real estate. Info Group. If you have not joined yet, then you can join it. You will get educational things in it.  You will also get real projects and all that, so if you have not joined it yet, if you have done so, then there is no need to do so, but you can do it. The second benefit that you get is that if you have a home loan.  Normally people do not discuss, people hurry up in repaying the loan, your loan is quick in reducing it to zero, keep it pending for two to four lakh rupees, keep the loan pending and make its EMI Rs. 1500-2000 for 15 years. What is the benefit of it that you never  If there is an immediate need of Rs 5-10 lakh, then there is a cap for renovation and you can easily take the money for it. What is the down payment to be given many times? Is there an opportunity in life? You will get the check for the loan within 5 days with your different banks which have all the types. I want to tell one more thing to my audience if you are running any loan in your daily NCERT or have property or want to take it or  If you want to transfer the loan or want to take a new loan, you can connect me on the WhatsApp number given below. You can type loan, according to interest rate, according to civil, whatever is best for you, so was the service also.  I  Will be provisioning then you can type loan and load WhatsApp. It is okay if you have property in Delhi NCR that you can take it anytime. The third advantage is that you do not have to repay the loan again or keep it for a few days. See, your documents are always secured. It seems like this.  Is it better to go inside the house in my cupboard than in your cupboard, whatever is in the bank's locker is safe, it is a factory, anything wrong in the house can be a scam. I do a lot of consultation. Son, daughter-in-law, son-in-law, daughter, I do n't want to take exams like this, but it has happened in this generation that some dealers were caught with the papers and they did not take them and the fight is happening when the day of registry has come and those who are old parents.  And what is the point of saying let's take a photo? What is the point of taking a photo of what? Tell me, how does this big seller send the property? Whom to ask? Whom have you given? Have you given the paper original also? And that is what happens if the bank has it.  If you have papers, then no such child can play with you. One and a half lakh, names of many people, elders, we do not want to die with a loan on our chest, if the property is not ₹ 2 crore, remember whether the loan is ₹ 2 crore or one and a half.  It is worth Rs. 1.25 crores and you are leaving like this, then perhaps you will think, hey, I am leaving the loan and leaving, brother, keep a debt of ₹ 2 lakhs and one and a half thousand images of it are going. Just think of that locker.  pay the fees  You are thinking that this is a very practical tip, no one will give it, even those who take such loan will not give it because what is the benefit to the loan taker in this, if his loan of ₹ 1.5 lakh is not being repaid then he is not getting much benefit. What is the benefit to him in that he is sitting with paper, it is being misused, it is fine, so these are your practical tips in this one, then let me tell you one more thing, the benefit is that if there is a loan on any property, then if a person buys it from you.  wants  That property becomes very easy for him because suppose I want to buy a property, then the property on which there is a loan, then your ownership proof becomes good, otherwise it is a big fight that you are Ramlal ji, Shyamlal ji, Narendra Singh ji.  I am Amit Singh ji, whatever name is Rohit, Neha's name is the same, you are your property and those are the same issues, loan transfer cases on property worth Rs. 2-4 crore, very like you, I want to buy some property.  Okay, then I will transfer the property to you from there. The bank has the bank course, you know everything about the property, the valuation is done, you know its complete antecedents, okay and there was a loan outstanding of Rs. 2 lakh, 3 lakh. You said, it is of Rs. 1 crore.  The deal has been done, this is a loan of 2 lakhs, you have to give us 98 lakhs, you will approach the bank, you will also say, give me a loan of 2 lakhs and give me fresh 50 60. 70 80 10 5 Lakh, take the loan you want, there is no problem, it is very beneficial for you, there is benefit in selling the property also, in the property market where the loan is available, the price of the property is higher, I want to tell you this a little.  It happens that a person keeps asking whether he can get a loan, the buyer will get the loan, he will get the loan, he will get the loan, if he has got the loan then it increases his safety factor, so this is another benefit for us. Now there is another advantage of taking a loan, you are taking a fresh property, you are taking it from a builder, you are taking it from any party, you do not need a loan in it, the money has come from somewhere, it is inheritance money.  Windfall has happened, you yourself have sold some things, now you have money and you can buy things comfortably, you do not need anything, you have Rs 1.5 crores, you are buying a property worth 1.25 crores, now it says that you need a loan even then.  You Take a loan, take only a small amount, sanction it, take as much as you can, you will be charged a little processing fee, but that specialist will scrutinize all your papers, anything lacking will be noticed, yes, this allotment letter is like this, the initial letter is not this, yes, this is chain puri.  It is not registered or given to  The name from which I took it is different, there is something wrong in the middle one, just teach me the number, proper number has to be applied, the documents are not correct, now what is that vashikaran number, what is the one behind it, what is next to it immigli, the registry looks fine to you, you are an expert.  No sir, do you know the bank which is giving the loan? They sit on the panel every day, this is their check list, the photo of the man is taken, it is okay, the bus number which is entered in the registry is paper work, this is the sanction.  Is  The map is good, many times these days the sanctioned map creates laxity, the bank will check all this for you in the refund, so this is a lot of benefit, no one will do it, but you keep asking someone that brother, what do I have to check?  What do I have to check? Now you thought, I have learned this, I will check like this, no brother, there are one and a half thousand things which cannot be covered here, this will become a very long video, there are one and a half thousand things in buying a property, so you can contact a bank. Take a loan of Rs 10 lakh, you do n't need the money, still take it friend, take income tax rebate, give him the money, later take a loan and repay it, whether you want it or keep one and a half lakh like I did.  Who said that today you take a loan of Rs 10 lakh on a property? Who said this that after 6 months you will get Rs 9 lakh, now if the loan taker will take it then they will increase it a lot, so there is a need to share this video more. No  There is no creator on YouTube who will say this, I also say this in many videos, share it, share it, but brother, there is a lot of knowledge, there is no need to share it. Be my subscriber, you have taken the knowledge, there is no need of sharing it because many knowledges are like this.  If it increases too much, then it gets misused by some party and then the check balance gets added to it. Right now it is not like that, it is ₹ 5000 or so at times, as it is March ending, if someone says something, then every is this.  Processing fee is also waived, do this for so-and-so Dham and in the last tip, I will give you connect with van person for loan. If you want to transfer your loan, then that person should sit with your documents because it is a lot of lethargy, he has to fill the Form 162 again and again to transfer the loan. Then give your Aadhaar, two PAN and two properties. If you are associated with the same person and one agency, then you will not have any lethargy, he will transfer it, then what is the difference of your interest.  If the point is more than 0.5, it is technical but if you are a Khan then the point becomes 35 but 0.5 is a rough idea that the loan which is going on now is running at 9 only and you can get 8.5 in civil. So if someone is yours and that  You can transfer your without much hassle so utilize the services of van search person I am van search person ok I am also telling you this so once you can join loan  You can share these benefits on WhatsApp, there is no need to share the video to practical people, absolutely to your son, daughter and those who are in blood relation, your Dhanesh friends can share it to each other, there is no need to share this video on groups.  There is no need to give much knowledge, I do not want its views to be very high, I want to get as many views as there are subscribers, I just do not want more than that, this is deliberate because if the drivers are spread all over, then the effect will be more diluted, otherwise it will be concentrated.  I don't want the effect, I don't make this video viral, I came to know that it will not cost ₹ 50000, I know that I will not put anything in the algorithm myself, I will not put anything in those tags bags. Okay, so it won't catch much, it will automatically get consumed, the fish is so tight, I want to make a lot of videos for you guys, so if you are listening, now you are listening and listening and you like it, then please subscribe.  Press the button and if you want to join that real estate info group, you can join that also. Thank you."

    "title": "05 Stocks Worth Looking At For Investment This Diwali [2QTUalqKgxU].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, the Sam stock history that I want to tell you further is for education purpose, it is not an investment, give advice, understand, if you like the logic, then you buy but take the due date, it is yours, it is not my recommendation, I am further for education purpose, some things tell me.  It seems that I feel like discussing them, so let me tell you, first of all, last year I had shown this glass, okay, it is not water, it is about water, you see the story and I like it very much, I am the button.  If I give you a dhaba then brother, you ca n't buy it for Rs 1 crore, Rs 10 lakh, Rs 50 lakh, you should never ever invest on anyone else, conveyance, never investment, help you in debt, give you data because there are so many channels, there is something or the other on every channel. No one is telling, okay you will go, every person is telling, so many channels naammi, so many big houses in the village, this houses told by this share this houses told  Buy D share means 6000 shares, 500 are investment uniforms which meet the criteria i.e. proper ownership, corporate governance and all these, if you tell something or the other about all of them then this is a very arrogant Bombay Bo Gaya, according to me there is no advice in this.  It does n't make sense to tell so many things, secondly you will see my playlist, in it I have a playlist about stock market and along with it, on the same channel, on Clarity Channel.  I am not going to read both of them for decision making. I am not going to read both. It is okay to see both. You will know the technicality in it. If it is about distance making, then now I see India. If you go towards aspirational then there are some things which I do not understand.  Come, one, I drank water, you must have understood, the second is a company, okay, it is a clothing company, its market cap is around Rs 32000 crores, and it is a new company, which is selling old things in our India. Speaking Vedanta, we say something is right, so it is by name, okay, you study it, all of them, they make our traditional dresses, okay, and they make wedding dresses, and this maybe, I feel like it is like this.  Well this is my personal opinion ok he does n't have much history to check about him 10 years 20 years 40 has been listed recently very much you won't find him but records  Looks fine. Okay again it's not in investment advice. You discover the company and write the name. Okay, I'm not even telling you the full name. If you understand, then my channel is for someone who is a hardworking student. You understand.  I will not teach ABC's to the students because then what is the point of paying blindly, that does not happen because when the returns are made, no one thanks you, if they are not made, then why should we bear the brunt of it?  They say ok then this is very important in investment. I have been investing on your conviction again and again. What do you think that the country's thing is going away? Okay, I feel that the life insurance sector is very underinvested in India.  The data release is of four-five percent in India, maybe it may be less than that, then write in the comment section to collect it, in other countries it is 20-25%, like us.  This is the country, I am not talking about America. Penetration in other countries is more about life insurance. How many people do you think? Pick 100 people at random from India and ask who all are insured. So the employees in the organized sector are insured.  They have taken a job, they have not become an employer, they have become government employees. Those people are insured but they are not a very big section, which means that perhaps one person is left among them to come to India. According to me, in the future, the insurance sector can be of 10 sexes. Next one, the population will increase. Okay, on top of that, there is a very big government player who has a very high market share, the rest have this much, so if I look at this market cap share. So I see it growing because of technology and because of these other things, I am not going to take any name in this, take this company or take that. According to me, when the entire sector grows, it makes a difference in the entire company.  companies in it  If someone is 19, someone is 20, someone is 24, someone is 16, then it can be from 16 to 24. The company does not think that it means much, there can be a difference of 10-15-20%, so you can also approach such baskets if you are interested in this basket.  If you understand the sector then again this is not investment, how many are there in it and the competition is less, these are the companies which have been around for a long time and they have agents, people and networks, so they This is on kaspap, it can also be said on inflation point, okay, show too much data, I will show it like it is done on other channels, it is less of me, I don't go, I am an old traditionalist Guruji type that brother, you have worked hard but you wanted money, now it is there. Google tells you everything in the same way, but I am telling you what to search on Google, just understand friend, rest of the research is available to you, right, go to skinner.in, you will get to know about the company. All the quarterly data, all the terms, I have taught you, book value, P by turn on equity, you will get all the things in it, how much is the cash flow, how much is the operating cash flow, there is no investment, how much is the debt, if you go please watch the video technology lessons.  Take the sector which I am telling you, go to screener.in, adopt it, there is no expense and water in it, there is no expense and water in these two things and work hard yourself because the rest of these are in the newspaper by this by date by this by this.  Date this to me by this by date and that one paragraph has to be written a lot brother, if you suggest I start telling about a company in a proper manner then it will take at least 1 1/2 hours on one and these people here are punch six minute videos.  There are five-six companies that tell that they do this, they do it very well, well, I am telling you those stocks which you research, there is one more company which makes Excel of vehicles and towards monopoly in India because the listed player is again a  Used to be  There are a lot of people doing that on commercial vehicles too, so there is a proxy play for that, so I mentioned one about consumer goods, a little bit of glass, then I mentioned about one insurance sector, how much can it be in the sector, thirdly, I mentioned about the vehicle side.  I tried to take you a little, okay, after that let's move ahead, there is a company which manufactures air conditioners. I feel that air conditioners are very under-penetrated in India. Okay.  I have a lot of my own, I think if you want to make such thick ginoge, then only 10 is fine for me, it can be 12, 13, 14, but it is 10, it can also be 15, but it has a common thread. This company makes its compressor and its spare parts and what goes inside it and it also makes SIMs, so this company's market cap is around Rs 7000 crores, okay?  Its stock had gone around ₹ 3500. High, I think it is correct, it is quite good, so you guys should study it too, now it is hovering around ₹ 2200. I do n't see the plus or minus rates of the stocks which I take.  I have to keep an eye on business and in general keep an eye on the world, what does the world do, keep an eye on the screen. How much has happened? What would I advise you all to do? Do one thing whenever you look at it, do some rough math till the time this board of knowledge from the world is this.  Well share, tell me rough mathematics, ask your heart what do you see increasing 10 times in the next 10 years, then first of all you will release the thing that the way the phone is now, you do not see the ownership of the phone increasing 10 times because of everyone.  You see a phone in your hand, someone comes to your house to help, someone comes to do the work, you see everyone walking around with phones, these phones will get damaged, people will not take them, now they will grade, but no one can predict that it will increase 10 times.  Because if we have 100 crore phones then now it is not possible to have 1000 crores, it will break, then buy a new one, upgrade it and throw it away, but what is the thing that we have less of and it can be more, then you know such a simple thing, you use your mind.  If you have to invest, what can be included in it, what can be de-sexed, then regarding insurance, I thought that people will take inschurns, it will be understandable, health insurance will also be there in it, you are right, there will be different endowments in that also. Wali Aapki Term, there are different products but in insurance, they do not give home insurance loan, like there are goods and shows, there are many types of insurance, do you know, then gradually as we become aware of the country, we move towards it, I see all this.  And this is what I told you about some stocks and if I want to tell you one stock, okay, then you have to see this stock, this is a stock for the kitchen, there is a stock for the sinks in the kitchen, it is correct, see it.  It is a small cap. Who makes sinks in India? Do you understand that when you look for utensils, one thing is steel which is used in everyone's house these days. It looks less, is a little expensive, has good quality. Real estate cycle is going on boom. Okay, so these are the stocks that I know, what are the names of the stocks in the next year, someone will write that. I am sir, okay, Speculate, you guys, that is your homework, okay, which company makes it and this one? sync cards  Its share price is running around my ₹ 550, that means just look at it, this much must be going on, I don't see it every day, it's okay, you don't need to see the shares every day, you see the business of the company and the world is doing that, people see the price quarterly. Look three times a day, I am saying, look once in 3 months is fine because when your focus is on your pearl research, only then you will buy winners. I can neither control nor increase or decrease any share price by looking at it. Every share is an underlying business. If the business does well, then you will want the shares. If the business does poorly in the long term, then the share will go down. It is okay that the shares will not go down but will go up, but if the entire focus is on imparting knowledge through TV channels, then who will watch them? How to earn money from advertisement?  Those who don't tell will say, go every day at 9:00 and sit till four o'clock, at 3:30 the market closes, then analysis, then tomorrow's analysis and we all keep watching. He is the biggest guru of his investors.  This is Warren Buffett ji. You have had a computer in his office for 50 years, isn't it? There is a wooden one. And there are new investors in India, some who are teaching their best and those whose names are from China, I will take their names. Go to their office where  I also took their services once many years ago, they talk there and they go to the actual site and ask, check it, when you go to buy paint, ask how it is reducing the paint, when you go to buy some washing machines, they tell you dealer act.  The company and this news channel and they don't tell the reports, they just write anything. The guy sitting at the shop has no friends, he says, brother, he is beaten, it is going well, where you check, tell me my name.  How biker, which paint is which car, which car is it, which Japanese because given shares, don't change overnight, the one who has a portfolio, neither does the share of my portfolio be such that it is very high journal, once tell me yours and then make a video for the next one.  doesn't have to  Because that means you will have to give time, even if there is a tree like mango, it takes many years to bear fruit, so you have to have that much patience, but you definitely have to monitor the company's business and outside market, real in real market.  You have to do the same about the shopkeepers who sell their goods and the customers who buy them. And if possible, you should buy their products if you can buy the shares that you buy. It is okay if you buy a raw material company.  try wearing it raw How is the elastic, how is the comfort, then you will understand. Okay, so I am platinum members, you can go to my other channel and subscribe to that too, somewhere its subscribers are here, I know it is okay but you can do the reverse also.  But I keep teaching some extra things to those people also. For the people here, when should I open the join button, then please tell me. If you guys are ready for the join button, then I will send a special message to them.  Number and subscribe is fine, I can still do it but I am waiting for ₹ 10000 subscribers, so you can increase some subscribers, so for that also I can do something here for exclusive content.

    "title": "05 Things You Should Know About Your Boss [NpxhlB685cA].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, this is a very important topic for the youth, for those who do a job, because there are no problems, there is not much hunger, a lot of people are struggling, okay, the war is very burdensome for the one who is doing a job, the topic is yes, these are the five things about you, just these five.  You have to know the thing in your bus, why do you have to know, what are the things, they will discuss and I will also give you a test to everyone under which you will keep your bus on the bus, you will give that test basically.  You will get a lot of pleasure from that too. This channel takes pride in getting topics that do not become stories in anyone's place. Are such topics being made by any creator on YouTube? Tell me, because nobody is batting from the side.  Of Musaddilal At Times I Do Batting From D Other Side Also But Give On This Channel I Do Batting From D Par D According To Aam Maa So First Five Things It Is Not Very Difficult To Achieve Today  I will also tell you the reason, you are not stalking her, you will not bother her, knowing this will give you a lot of orientation in life, her boss has very good bosses, I keep everything about her boss after knowing everything that I am in your boss.  I am going to tell you this thing, these five bosses know about it in advance, they have easy rights and from it they have the advantage of relief, this is the advantage that I am giving to you today, at this moment, watch the video. Whatever comment you have after pausing, please type 'A' so that I can know what it means in the first 2 minutes, is it such fun because the views go but the excitement is there that if you want to know then tell me, tell me.  I will tell you in 15 seconds, pause and write A. Those who are excited, tell me such topics quickly, friend, which is the simple thing, let's start and it will be of great benefit to you and me, that test, that and so on.  Listen, what will you test that test bus? First of all, what educational background does your bus come from? Exactly, if you are into engineering, then engineering too has different pedigrees. If there is an IIT or an IIT, then which one is the one from Delhi, the one from Kanpuria?  He is from Kharakpur, he is from Chennai, he is from Ropar, he has something or the other of everything, as they say, where do these spices come from, where do these crops come from, all the information.  Only a few things will remain, you will understand first, first take the information, then you will see the patterns and you have to note down, and then your bosses will change, then you will grow in age, then one day you will become a consultant, then you will become someone.  I am teaching you to observe, patterns will automatically start forming, first note down the study type of your bus, check the old bus, then whatever knowledge you get further, apply it on that again.  Apply it on the template and you will automatically get the results which will be shocking. Whatever you will get told, then where did you get the education, how did you get into the system, on the basis of getting into this education institute, you have understood which one is this, he also does it.  This is because in the government jobs, those who come from among the Gurjars, they come to know that by doing this or that, but in private, many people keep their name only till Kumar and do not keep it in front, you understand what I am saying. I am six, okay, so I am telling you openly from which community he comes from which region, now people will say no, all the things do not make a difference, oh sir, it does make a difference, Baba, it is making a difference to him, he is telling you this.  If you see it like this then you will also be affected. What is the problem of middle class? Idealists are the ones who want women, don't talk like this that we have not woken up from all these things. It is an idealistic situation but we have not woken up.  There are patterns in it, we have to make our life comfortable, we have to reduce 30-40 years from the life of 50-6070 80 90 years and in the beginning 15-20 years have to be tortured till you reach the story, you can either  You will reach out and torture people or you will be tortured. The game has to be played for 15 years, minimum 15 to 20 years. There are some rules for the game that has to be played.  There should be an idea of ​​regulation as to how it is being seen. There is a pattern in it. IT Bill Makes a Difference. Which region will it bring the producers from? Which community will it bring? Which class will it bring prejudice from? Which class will it bring? Are you rich?  Poor, you make a lot of difference, looks don't say, you are educated, you are illiterate, you make a lot of difference in a particular drop, but when you reach the top, they think that you have returned, sir, you have worked hard.  So much of the work they do seems to be their own hard work and then they feel that you have not worked hard in life because you have worked hard for them, so you are doing the same hard work on the job too. They assume that you do not work hard. I don't have this dream.  There is a promise that I get to see on a regular basis in the consultation. Yes, what is the name of the task bus, where is it from, you see the pattern yourself, now you will say this, you will know that it will happen, then what will we do, we will change the bus in life. First of all  Analyzing where the problem is coming from and attributing it to you, at least you will not have self-doubts, it will not be able to gaslight you, it will not be able to show your negative behavior, it will not be able to cover up your negativity, your self-doubts.  If it will not create your self-esteem then you will know that Guruji had told you that these patterns are visible just like this and these are visible, so brother.  Last time also we were seen there, if we saw him with him also then you would know that brother, this is his problem. Many people in India have childhood problems and are sitting in positions of power. These things never happen in foreign countries in India.  So honey, it has started, we are getting confused there, all these sharing prints, all these psychologists and all these people are less active, we don't have all this stuff here, why is this happening, what is happening to them?  What name should we give to the pattern? They work hard, hard and hard, they do it like this, because who knows, they do everything inside you, then you will come to know that, it makes a lot of difference where it has come from, come to know. Gradually, it will go on social media, from your status on Facebook, WhatsApp, you will come to know how much fanaticism is there in his religious belief and his orientation too. Now we will not say that all these things are not definitely there, why is it not definitely there, we are at home.  come  That Aaj Tak and that ABP News and then there to play on WhatsApp, this is a disease in India, political ideology, religious system, thought process towards gender, all these things of yours are very important, third thing, where have you reduced the previous employees and when?  When did you leave the job, what position did you hold, who was there, the pattern, because sometimes people act so helpless that they have no idea what is happening to them whereas if you have this information from the first day.  If you keep it in the seat of the bus, then whenever your body starts moving a little bit, you hold it there till people release it, when the ground gets removed from under their feet, then they release something.  It happened and why it happened, they did not know why it happened, when it happened, how it happened, who did it, all this is the answer, you will see its pattern, you will see it, you will tell me, what will not change, if you are ready, the batsman will change, what will the bowler do, what are you going to say, who is Sharma?  It will be when he is standing on the Golgi and he is hitting the strike penalty strike, be it in hockey or football, only then you prepare, if you tell him the pattern that Bhai Saheb, he is like in the Chak De movie, Shahrukh Khan and I have to speak.  Not that she will hit right or left, love is going like this and she is killed straight away and then the captain, who is the heroine, who is the goalkeeper, then he tells her like this, just in a gesture, Guruji has this little.  He does it like this, only he knows that I have come straight and that's all, this is the only thing, I am telling you what he has to do from there, you can't control but you can be prepaid, if she comes, she will come, his family size, his wife, his parents information.  It is easy to know that you are happily married, it is a bed marriage because its flaws are within your control, and if it is not clear in the morning, even then you will suffer. Listen to me many times with love, Guruji. Many times they do it tomorrow, no no, the old children are all enjoying a lot, but sometimes what happens is that when the video is forwarded, they have not seen even one of my videos till date, they will board the bus, which will make them happy in their life by watching the old videos.  I have implemented it and it is not in my mind because the channel has only one claim - to make you happy and rich, to make you happy and rich, now no one says that what difference does it make to my life, Sir, it does matter, brother, it does matter.  Brother, that stomach is there in everything.  It will be clear bill make this difference ho ho your de gos if this is true or not then tell me no man it doesn't affect if his wife works you are a lady women yours is a man bus he is also a woman of man bus  Does the job work on the story or does n't the bill make a lot of difference, what happens to you, you can change it, you can't select the bus, this is the husband's knowledge of the working wife and is the wife the only one who is working? Brother of understanding, there will be less for him in the house, he will definitely perform the Aarti and he thinks that all the women should be like this and only then I can go to work secretly, he neither has to bring vegetables, nor has to take children, nor has to bring bags, nor has to do school work.  Have to do something else, this is Texas right, we have controlled it, you also control your woman, and what is the problem, and he can spend 12 hours, 14 hours in the office only because there is a woman who is doing it.  Yes, she is rocking, she is doing it happily, she will not always be known but she is doing it, have a little idea, see what is happening, why is it being divided, it will definitely make a difference, whether the parents live together or not, many come and go.  People are worried about their parents and they take pride, such are the foolish processes, my father had surgery, I did not take leave, I did less, you are asking the most crazy thing, you are the one who is not yours and is not ours either.  The one who is not from your family and cannot be yours either and is a selfish person, stay back, you cannot make many changes with him, he is not in a job but his character is making you realize that he is not yours either, he is yours.  If you find something out of it, then do it, this is not the kind of person, okay, even the bus has to be tested whether it is intelligent, it is useless, it can be fooled, it cannot be made, that too is important to check.  ki intelligent  It is okay to speak, so I will tell you that test also. Stay put. The fifth thing is that the mindset about the workers and that in the office space, he likes it for himself, if he does it at the top, then he will like it at the bottom too, if he himself  He is a nonsense type and he has to keep his scenes to a minimum from his boss and he is open in meetings, he is creative and he is assertive, he is high on self, he has knowledge, he has to give by men.  An N Good Day After Tomorrow You Can Love You Friend Things And He Bill IF You Pose You Stratus He Bill Also An Appreciative Friend Rates Because You Can Align You Are Chatur Khar Ho Your Bas Bhi Kar Bhi Sad So You Know That I Also  I will do this to this person and that to him. You are getting to know the syllabus. Here we don't have to cry about what is the ideal in life. Neither is it to meet an ideal spouse, nor to have ideal parents, nor to have ideal children.  Ideal is not a situation, nothing is ideal, I am telling you the trick of how to do best in whatever situation it is, so now I want to tell you the last thing, if you want to test it then get the decision making done.  Make him [ __ ], make him [ __ ] for you. If he is a fool then he will [ __ ] right now. You take him with you every time with two things which will help you whenever you have a government job, a private job or anything else. Come sir, here he has come.  This is the data, this is the input data, bombard it and use it for decision making. If you are a fool, then most of the fools think that take it according to the easy problems, if the easy problem is fine then it may be difficult or not.  If there is a chance on Kareena, then he will say that I get the money for reducing this, which means he will smack it right there and send it to you. If there is a chance, then you will know that the bill is through IT. Why should I tell you? Your less is fine, but if the police is there and what happens to it, what is the psychology behind it? When you try to help him again and again, he feels that he has got the feeling that the bus driver, yes, I am doing something. Just reached there, they used to do something very good down there, now time has made them sit there, now if they have found such a person down here, who is comfortable and lies down, does not do anything like that, he does not give them much feeling.  If he doesn't give it, he wo n't be very happy with it.  In fact, we remain happy with such people. Sir, please help us. Sir, whatever guiding person you have, the person who helps you in one thing and is ready to do it, will be ready to do more when in the prism.  Will be ready to do the same and will be ready to do it in the future too. He felt like this because that is also the retirement of a person, just that I have done something there which is actually taking the company forward and making the nonsense greater and numbers and he is ruthless.  He is going to see everything, he will apply it, but you test it in the beginning, whenever you come, test it in between, always give him the choice, take this decision, sir, which Lancer is this data, sir, what to do sir.  I need your guidance on something, by doing this you can do this video, not that one, send it to many people, you should have told me this in the beginning, okay, membership will also come in the future, so open up all these things in a different best.  Class and explain it in it and it will be explained because what is knowledge and information is relative, everyone should know that thing, now Sir Besan will know this video otherwise it will be known that he is a student, he is misbehaving with me in future too.  There is one fact, okay, even if not everyone should know the whole thing, then after opening that separate shooter, some thing will be told in the skull, should you learn it now like it is taught in coaching, date is D.  Plane you bill see me membership plans coming in by d time this video getting release you you know okay to your job and please get all the information as per your capacity, you guys get all the information whether you will do it or not you can do it and write that you should do it.  It should not be done whether it was beneficial or not. Those who benefited please write the type okay and those who enjoyed write the image. Okay then it is not necessary for Jagga to become a spy. The whole thing is very easy to know about caste these days, there is not much difficulty for you.  So she knows it, she has all the data, she has a nonsense college degree, she also knows it, you also try to find out which category your bus belongs to, where it came from, how much it is, how much it is, who was there, who can be found in the college. Someone will go, meet their group, get some information, you will know that you too are okay, then when you know, he will put a little confidence on his face and he will also come to know that you also know that he knows these things about you.  I know it's ok so that's it  You should know a little bit about who has what orientation, what kind of character he has, what are his weaknesses and strengths. You people should have a general idea about those bosses, all the ideas of one employee, when one bus has the idea of ​​30, 40, 50 people under him.  You can do it in your mind and do it for profit, so can't you keep a bus, it is too much effort of yours, every person has a bus, there is a super bus. You can't give a general idea to just 2 people, I have n't been sitting with so many for 50 years, it's okay, so please work hard, it is beneficial, these things are not beneficial, thank you very much"

I want to tell you one thing  Never ever try, you are a balance seat, whatever you want to understand, you don't have a balance seat because it is lying on the side, that's why you know that there will be stress in balancing, and if I say this, then leave the car and start walking now, and there will be more stress in life.

If you understand, I am the one who gives tips. We have to steal life from anyone. I have no taste. The seventh point is very deep, important and life changing. That too can be learned.  It is okay to take it, tell someone to your friend, brother, sister, family at home, start applying from tomorrow and do not worry yourself, so called, this balanced life will be visible, whenever you go to the office, one glass every hour.  Drink water. If you drink one glass of water, you will drink eight glasses of water throughout the day and if you drink it every hour, then you will have to go there too. The bathroom system will be clean every time when you go to the bathroom, which is farthest away, which is over there in the bathroom, which is going to be clean slowly. and reflector  On date you will have to go less often than one on one. What will be the benefit from what you should know in minimum day, you will pick up and go and have to do that, no one can rock it, no you can rock it even if it is inside the meeting and no one can rock it either.  On time you reflector open what is happening during d they what is happening in your left a little bit you have to think but there take your time no rush come just to and ka what is happening with them in life Everyday routine magic bill happens in seven days only. Now see exactly what will happen. What will happen, see for yourself what will happen. You have to think about it on time. This is what you have to do. The second thing is the meetings in the office when you wait.  Whether someone will come, it will start, you are getting time in between, you can pay him on time, you are the one who is caring for your daddy, whether he is in a government job or in a corporate, someone is in C, I am telling him that the job is ok. I am telling this for business people, it is fine, I am not telling it for business people, I am telling it for employed people, so when you are waiting in the meeting, then have your something and in your mind, you should be thinking of something personal.  The agenda is to give him time, what is my child, okay, it has returned, the wife's work has to be done here, do this thinking process in your office, what to do at home dear, I will also tell you separately, this sir tension is the same. What has to be done and what can be done, who had to do it yesterday, someone has to make it shorter tomorrow, do it for 2 minutes tomorrow, on due date time, your on benefit, sit in that time and do not do anything else because that is the time and waiting you bill get date.  Type: 3 minutes, 4 minutes, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, sometimes you get 15 minutes, 20 minutes too. If someone gets late, then you definitely have to do this. Third thing do not waste other energy and time in gossiping in office too much.  We have a habit of chatting as if we were in a meeting, we are going, time is passing, this should not be done at all, you have to keep a serious look, of course you have to keep a serious look and do not talk about any of your things in your life. Thinking about yourself in the bigger picture and in the bigger picture, the energy keeps you stable. At this time, whenever you get time to gossip, in whatever time you get, make payment on your phone, pay it on your bill, whatever you do like this.  Many of the Minutes Dead Minutes  Very few are those which you have written in the morning. You came back after writing in the morning or you wrote them at the time of the meeting when perhaps you could have honey but you could have written. Who knows what you are writing in your code words. Your mind is running.  Okay, you have to pay its bill, you have to pay its fees, okay then you have to book that movie ticket, then do one or two of those five and then when it was the time for the gossiper to be a little alone, then you executed those two.  Do this in five to 10 minutes  You can spend 1:30 hours comfortably within the frame of 8 to 9 hours and you will get a sense of achievement. You will find many people who will go to this, but every mother does not. Right now, you are just sitting there with CCTV in your hands.  So take the day, what kind of job are you doing tomorrow? If you are of this type then government people are not there, they are so tight and they are fired even in corporates. If there is time for power then there is also time for doing good and writing diary.  There is time for this and the phone  But to send a message, to do it this tight, no less. If it was happening so tight, India would have become a developed country long ago. If we were actually reducing this much, then such countries are not doing it.  We are wasting time and we don't even realize how much time we are wasting. The fourth very important thing is to be an enigma in your office. Your personal life should not be like that. What is the biggest mistake people make?  Let's do it, then they say that life is life, everyone has their own Andaman egg, everyone tells me that I have a wife, I have children, my wife does this, my parents are this, my house is there, I have this much money, I have a car like this, I am among the poor.  I am rich, you know all this, not only you, but your colleague also knows, today your face is down, what happened, you must have had a fight with your sister-in-law, sir, people have told me everything about this.  have experience  I am giving more by squeezing and also saying that please do not forward it because brother, I am giving knowledge with great concentration, this is a real thing which will not be achieved by any teacher who will give you heavy Puri on a job of Rs. 30000.  Make one crore within 20-30 years. People are not going to become millionaires by implementing such videos from tomorrow. Sanoj Jhingalala will be happy in life but quietly tell anyone Enigma anything.  You should not tell anything personal about the question, no one should know whether you are married, happy or sad, do not have children, what are you doing, the world will ask, do not tell anything of yours, you have to remain so busy that you should not talk about it, it is very difficult to do but one day.  To be happy in life, stay happy, this is it, it is simple, this is the formula I am telling you, which is simple to execute then it is not this, I am not of cleaning, this is the thing that I am telling along with it, it is easy for you.  But it is very simple, why do you have to be dependent on someone, why do you have to tell him something, this is what you have to do, extra time or extra will come, he will just ask you to stay late in the office or do something extra, you have to make him feel that that is enough.  She felt that I asked for a kidney from her. Normally, we behave like this when you ask her for leave that mother gave me her left kidney. You should feel like this, today you will have to stay after 6:00 and after 5:00, one thing for that.  You have to come to the office on time. When you come to the office in time, you can't do everything. What do people do? They come 5-10 minutes late and then only the elders stay 10 minutes early and one thing, the traffic will back up, your life. IF YOU ARE JUST BY PEOPLE BY 10 TO 15 MINUTES DATE IS THIS TIME WHEN YOU CAN PLAIN YOURS ALSO EARN THOSE 10-15 MINUTES EXTRA SONA BILL NOTE TAKE  You come to the office 10-15 minutes early and when you come to the office, you go around and show it, don't enter your cabin for 10 minutes, be afraid of people again, this is always going on at 8.50 pm, this is what it is always, friend. Fear and oil people tha no date you come early your colleague here everyone should know after that he will be established then you also have leave just do it like this you tell him like this sir my  So sir, I have to go with her, I have to go with her, then I will have to go in a taxi, the money will be lost, show her like this, always show her that you have something which will be spent, do n't do it happily, which is called making faces, money. Wives also say this. Wife is in a bad mood. She wants to short you out. You have taken her to the best Italian restaurant. You are mixing her delicious pasta. Everything is going well for her but she is not smiling. She is not happy. some other time on that  Videos will also be made on these things, it's okay, your choice is good, I have brought it in a good restaurant, everything got yellow, otherwise the mood gets spoiled, what did I do, how did I do the same with the bus, why do you do the same with the bus, why does the bus do it with you only? So he should feel that now you will not eat, that's enough, every time, every time, whenever he says, how much should I do, I don't have to do it, it doesn't seem to force you, even if you have a maid, women will understand more, which she will interrupt again and again.  go that  That sixth has gone to the little beet face and you bill have the degree of difficulty in giving every extra, a little bit of testing is done there also, a little bit of all this is Indian, we have hired the person whose terms and conditions are made to the face, when you are a fake caste and  You are not leaving, I am not saying this, I am throwing that much because you are in a worse condition than most of the middle class job seekers, actually because I will get six employers and will leave here.  There is a little problem, what do I do? I don't see the mark, there is no mark to be seen, I am becoming smart, I should never say, leave the job, whatever I say, I should do less actions in such a way that she just leaves the job and goes away because. This is from the train, hey, you have been made such a slave that the one who freed you from slavery is the one who is batting on your behalf in your team, don't troll him, go away, you are not the owner of the company, will you tell me?  Wrong  He is teaching me that my employees will have soldiers in their streets and I am ready to bear the trouble. I have to write the video to give freedom to those who are enslaving you because the conditioning is so strong, he is teaching you people the wrong thing.  There is nothing wrong, everything is right, it takes 2 minutes for Malik to sell the company, it takes 4 minutes of his life to fire you, that Bajju is firing his ₹ 10,000 people, how many thousands of people?  Now, see what kind of ceiling was there by putting a gun on his temple. You know that startup which was there by putting a gun on Ganpati and see, in the meantime, no one even has sympathy in the society, whose jobs are being lost, Nobody Likes Brother.  Employees and who they are from, they don't know, they won't look like they are employed because they were born and lived in such a toxic environment, they should not have done such jobs anyway, I will make a video on this so that if you How is it in this environment that you are being asked to do such a thing and you say brother, what should I do? If you do a job, it will become different but you have understood that you do not have to do this. Five things, sixth thing, always for the sake of coming to the office and living.  Do a pull ride or a thirty second taxi, never drive yourself every day, whatever time it takes for you and the person to come into your life, from one date to another, 2 hours defending on who? Used to be  It is one to two hours, minimum one to two hours inside the big lions, it can be up to two, because maybe it is more up here, one to two hours, you can use this time for refreshing relaxing time on YouTube, like me, like me, I am here. I will request all of you people, now the video is like this 20 minute video, I put very good videos, according to me, they change your life, you people also agree, when should you watch this, this is the best time, why are you coming to your home and watching it?  Home  I waste time with my wife, okay, relax at home, these are the words of knowledge, these are the things of happiness, these are the things that are empowering, I am telling you these castes, should I do my video, go and watch it in the morning, if you come, then watch it, okay.  Not only this, well, if you give me a day, I will also read it, I am one more like me, keep some of the things that you think and correct them and you will automatically come up with ideas for tomorrow, this is the idea of ​​​​tomorrow, now I have given the history with you, Guru.  those people of ji  This is also what you have to do, start blackening me, start doing it slowly, then utilize the date because you have ruined my life, meet me, this is what you are watching at night at 12:00, is n't that sleep?  If it is not being fulfilled, then it is your duty to do it, but the driver is not hired from you, you do not hire a taxi, you do not run the clutch, brake, accelerator, you cannot think of anything else, if not, then if you are going in the metro, going in the public transport, going in the overalls.  Are you thinking, put something in your ear, you are thinking something, but still boastful, something like this is the thought process, something is going on in your life, it is relaxing, it is your mental sensory, it is excitement, everything is not relaxed, it is late date.  IF YOU CAN AFFORD IF YOU ARE APARTMENT CLASS ABSORBED WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF HIS DRIVER I COUNTED SEPARATELY OTHER VICE HE IS GETTING TIME YOU DON'T THINK THAT MONEY IS GOING HIM IN MONEY  Whoever is going is yours and it is not that the man goes in his own car for free, he has to park there, he has to run on petrol, that too will not run in the air, then he has to buy another car, then the car for his wife will be at home. Travel your time in this, now don't make too much logic about me because there is not much overlap in my subscribers and if any of you have not subscribed on Clarity, youth Sangolife Sutra is my big channel inside, that is not done.  So do that because I give a little bit of logic there but people there don't understand much logic but by doing it they are happy in life, so I am going to tell that thing, the remaining 6 points were like yours, I am showing something of Sangolife in Sattva. Two further you clear the video of 36, I have already made it, 36, its sign will be available in life, 42 is pending there, at the age of 36, you will get the idea of ​​​​actuality in life, my friend.  What to do, where will taste come from in 42, you will be able, you can clearly execute this, this is N6 air gap, if you are at 2830, do n't yearn forcefully, idea will come in 36, because in 28, you will jump left, right, then only that experience will be generated.  Which is called not success, Divya Kriti ji says, I don't like it very much, if nothing else happens then the experience will be great.  This is the statement of losers, they tell themselves to them, to students, by people, are you taking names and oil, why don't you give it to others, oh brother, such a big influencer, such a big line, they will give such great clarity, if you do it for 7 years then I will do something.  Otherwise, there will be experience, Chatung Experience, I will eat it with the bread of experience, there is no point, then it will definitely happen, which without experience, I have learned from the morning without any testimony.  There is power, with time you can get a job, but this thing should be discussed in detail. A separate video of 15 minutes will be made on this thing, what am I trying to tell you, you are not too old at 36. 22  23 years old, came out of college, got a job, did an internship, got married, 30, 31, are having children, are doing second, are doing first, are getting settled, at 36, I can breathe, there is action.  There is a little bit of astrology in it, basically everyone understands the meaning of Saturn, they will understand it earlier also, it does not mean that I belong to it, but in 36, everyone will understand it, the majority will also understand it, there will be many who will never understand the thoughts like this in life.  There will be 5-10% who will never understand anything, they will keep on suffering like this, there will be some brilliant ones who have exposure, guidance, mentors, gurus, they understand things in 27, 28, 30.  They will go but majority 70 to 80% people realize it at the age of 36 and if they start taking action then it takes 6 years of time to do what their mother did, till then you have to keep doing this grind.  You ca n't be like patient and cry, you have to take out life from the time you have and the remaining time is life itself, then a time will come in life, brothers and sisters, like I also realize this thing.  I will tell you the example of what gold is, then we enjoy making the video, more people will watch this video, good comments will not come, what will happen, the subscribers will increase, I am getting the results in making it, this is the pleasure, I have taken my results from this. Took the fruit in the action itself. Karma is such that it gives the result only in doing this. Now what you will get is the bonus. So how much bonus will you give? Tell me, you don't have to do it at all, you do n't have to do it at all. You can do it with a brother because of blood relation.  please do it with me  You can, it is not necessary to share the knowledge to more people, you have to do consultation also, sir knowledgeable, everyone has got everything for free, then everyone will be knowledgeable, then everyone will make this tight, make it tight, the story rule will come out like that chain was done in Gurgaon. Before removing it, Twitter had been installed and it will remove the rule that CCTV cameras will be lost and if anyone catches anything, it is important to share more knowledge but one thing is that no one can force you to socialize and be very. Extremely happy with your you know bosses and Puli, keep quiet, your Khali has no friends, see that yes, you cannot create the atmosphere of a city any more, you cannot be ill-mannered, but do not enter into each other too much, do not know this because when you  If you ask someone yourself, what is yours, only then will he ask you. If you ask someone, what does it matter to you, what is your calling, what does his wife do, what do his children do, whether he is rich or poor, the house is his own, it is Red's.  Read the big difference, it is a very beautiful thing, videos will be made in future also, you have your own house, your parents have a good house and you live on some floor of it, your bus will be jealous of you, you will climb that friend, I am sacrificing my life to buy a house worth Rs. 3 crores. And he doesn't know that there is relief in phase one and seeing that the car comes so much during Diwali and now I mean there are such feelings of prejudice from inside, which are very prevalent these days and this too from a very humble background.  have come  But people get disturbed when they talk like this because these are the things related to class difference and many people like them in this. It does not seem politically correct but it is a fact. Many people are doing jobs with a windy vindictive nature. People who are not doing this say that they have not worked hard, I have worked hard, I took that exam, no one will say that you took the exam, you got the crutch in it, it is the one who has the knowledge of things.  Had got the crutch of word Why don't people use their full name? Why don't they use their full name? Why don't they use their full name? That all this is within the government job and there all this is that, no Baba, there is something different and fact and it's note and about. Date it is about someone and from a different community or class which is not enjoyed, date someone makes comfortable with prejudice in a very similar environment  Born in a rich family, he doesn't understand what it means to help your wife and you don't have a servant, you have to bring vegetables yourself, IT work is always like this, so I am telling you in a neutral manner, I am always on the network. Happening 1980 percent because people from very rich families do not even do jobs but are in business but still they will be 10-15 percent, that problem is that, I am looking at the remaining problems.  Let's face people, this is coming from this place and the same it is coming, the same it is coming from this day after tomorrow and this situation, you are going for half of the problems and your time is being taken away and you are wasting your time like this.  You are watching your life passing by and you have not got anything in return and that time has gone and then you realize that this is a 26-27 minute video. If you got something by watching this video, then you  You will not get disappointment and if you do not get anything from them, then there will be disappointment in life, if you get only one time in the given time, then every time is the cup of it. The last sutra that I am telling you is one point, that whenever you give time, be conscious.  Of what you are getting and is it worth it is it worth it the story is not like this, save my ₹ 100 by keeping a dead hour line and if I save ₹ 100  If you want to save money, do n't wait in line then check if dead hour is worth Rs 100, see this example, watch this video, subscribe to this channel, utilize your time when you are waiting in the airport for a flight, ok.  Hai you are waiting on your transport tu kam taxi tu kam vile traveling kaan mein lagao apni doosri duniya me chale jo aur usch duniya mein learning sleeping aur har video se  Like I mentioned here along with you, if you are sitting near your phone with that pen, with which you can write or type like this, create a folder, type two small ones with clarity photo with learning spot, what is the first thing, go to the office, drink a glass of water in the office.  Will not waste time in meetings. Will not gossip in the office. Will not discuss personal life in the office. If you give extra time to the bus, you will increase the mistake of the person. Not like this happily, other time, me time is free, you have too much date brother  There are other agendas and programs in my life and then coming and going in the office, I hope and how many agree will you do at the snake, tell me who will follow these seven things. If I tell you, we are 13 and 6, so we will follow.  There were and 24 and 7 on this new me and I bill follow and seventh I have told patience 36 and 42 vote in 36 so everyone will know ederwise 34  Even up to 35 can be detected which is a bit shiny, so hope you liked it. If by mistake the video has been forwarded to you, which I told my subscribers not to do because what you tell them not to do, people probably do more.  Please subscribe the channel and then do not forward this video. Thank you very much."

    "title": "07 Predictions In Next 07 Months For The Middle Class [hLhk8pIZ2yM].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, interesting topic, next 7 months and seven predictions, give it to the public, make you rich and happy, which is called money and peace, subscribe to the channel, just get it, try to hear how much you think is true.  There will be and in each of them I will tell you what is your role and what you have to do. What I do is for the middle class audience, this is for them, there are predictions for them. Enjoy with the next one, i.e.  August, September, October, November, December, January till February are the main things of the month. Listen carefully, the seventh and seventh ones are very important. It is important for everyone, those who are employed. The seventh one is important for everyone. So, listen to the first one first.  Prediction is my going forward no negative will be set This is the name of prediction Political party Too much mind space will be occupied TV channel News channel If you watch, you will not band Curd of mind  It will seem that suddenly everything is in danger, this is about to happen, now we will not enter into this, these people are sitting with one vote, vote for whomever because only if you save your time and energy, the country will move forward.  90% of the country will be engaged in this, especially the middle class auto rickshaw puller, the rickshaw puller will not be engaged, he will continue to do his work, he will continue to earn money, the rich man is keeping himself rich, he is getting it, it does n't matter and those at the very bottom, they are theirs.  These I will not call the middle class the last one because they already have very little in their life. If we see, their children, marriages, children's homes, these points are very less for the middle class, but here the escapism will be very strong.  I will delve a little further on this point, the agenda will be set, you will be completely attacked for the eyeballs, YouTube will become a battlefield, news channels have been created, social media will also come over this moment, WhatsApp is full of people.  Videos will be filled, will be sent from here to there, narrative will be set, whatever you want to save yourself from these things, date will be the number one thing, there will be time waste, second thing will be big bang announcements, something like this will be Rahu type thing, middle class will not have any difference.  Reader, do something free, do this, do that, nothing is going to happen in your life, I am spreading it here, I am telling you realistically, your vote is already decided in the eyes of the political party, they know which one voted for whom. if it is  You are not interested in getting young, now you are not D, those new lovers are lovers only and do not impress each other. You are like the chickens of the house are equal to pulses, wouldn't that mean you are a married lady or a married mother?  It is as if a married man has no relief, no wife, no caste, she will be there, and if there is a wife, she will be there too, he is not the one with money, he is less from the middle class, so yours is less, but there is no use of running, you belong to her.  Then either lower yourself, take a class and then you will come to do something, buy a washing machine, install something like this, install something else, get free electricity, you cannot do that because you have reached here, it cannot go beyond you.  If you are going then tell yourself that Dhaba's time is going to be wasted in India. Select this team. Bumrah is not well. Is the game okay? Rahul should come or should not come. Rohit Sharma should be fielded like this. Don't feed Surya Yadav. feed backup or not  Is it Ishan Kishan or is Sanju Samsung? Is it a team in dream 11? Is it politics? This is yours. This is going to be so curdish. World Cup is going to be tough in three-four months. I don't see India winning again in the present situation.  So I would like my country to do everything on my own. Some situations don't happen. Look, the team of 9 is set, the captain of 9 is set. If Virat Kohli has done that then thank you for his presence everywhere. That team itself is in such a flood that till today, do the setting, do the watching, do the bowling, do the batting, do the watching, keep doing the setting, because there is so much influence, if there is no unity in the team, then it is a waste of time and mutual conflict.  If you look at him, he is becoming an IPL king. No one has come on you, he doesn't say hello, earlier he used to do this to the street, now he doesn't do that, now he is yours and you are on him, will you keep wasting your time, sixes and fours.  nice to do  If there is a match, then watch it, I am not assuming that India is against Pakistan, but do not do so much preparation for it as if your board exams are going to happen or you know IIT preparation exams are happening or  CAT is happening, don't do like this, then watch it when it comes. Don't give such opinion in Match India which will come. Tell someone first because you will get into doing it, that's why I am telling you that all the youth and even those who are not youth are in this cycle.  In  If someone tells you in advance if you enter, then you will be caste because now that mall will be built, it will also be built here, this environment and this one, these two line things will occupy your mind in the next three to five months and if you take measures then these three things will happen.  Fourth thing which will be a good thing and it will not create so much noise but you will be happy, it will be that inflation will be seen decreasing, you will see less interest coming in, this will bring your opportunities, statement in stock market, 'Garden on D' garden does not mean look out on this garden.  So first three things have to be done, for this you have to look out on IT CD inflation data see what is happening in October inflation, how much is August's inflation, what was the base effect of September, what was last year's, you will see all that decreasing and Liquidity will be seen coming, full good factor will be seen, India shining type feeling will come, something-something will come, Puri is awake, it is true, it is false, how much money can be earned on that, you have to hold the trade, take care and that. You will start watching Fool Good Factor from November, November till January till February, you will watch like this. Okay, fifth thing, any movie like this will come, things like this will come, but again there will be a fight when any movie of Veer Savarkar comes, whether it is someone else or someone else.  Some kind of thing will be made in such a way that you say like this, it was like this, this was like this, this was the movie, that is, I am feeling like this, within January, there will be a movie about that hair type too, where who will fight?  She is becoming C too  Today the atmosphere will become good, I am not against it, this is a prediction, it is a good thing, everything should happen, Tantra Mantra, everything should be good, okay, but do n't even think about that, it means prediction, this is to see, taste, this is what is happening, you  Everyone sitting with one vote, I want to tell you loudly, vote like a poor, I will not tell whom I will vote for, I will make the one who will vote for me and will also see the fight on NPS, Old Pension System, New Pension System, what is right and what is wrong, you will discuss on this.  If you want a video, then for the sake of clarity, I am ready to make it, which is not good for the country, but it is good for the political party and any individual, now everyone forgets the country, when power comes, it is not good, who knows? Middle class, we have to be aware and we have to set the narrative tomorrow. They will set the narrative first for us. They told us not to talk about this nonsense, we have to talk about the old pension of One Pension. Whoever takes it will bankrupt the state and all. If you take the status, you will become a country, but who is standing or not, we will not vote for you, if you do not take it, because it is being given on taste, then it is being given on free electricity and water, it is being given on some religion.  Someone is going for something, everyone is enjoying their own place, why don't you set the narrative, then it is up to him, otherwise how will he be twisted a little and will be wooed towards you, then an atmosphere will be created, pictures will come and some memories will come. One picture will come, now there is a Rakhi open hammer in it, I have not understood the meaning of Geeta ji in it, took a few lines, the Indian is very excited, yes, he forgot Geeta is a bachelor, after seeing the whole contacts, you said, there is no respect in her.  The thing is to find respect in everything, then someone said a line from one of your scriptures, if you look at it completely then what else is there to say in English and Hindi, our country is suffering from so much loss of self-esteem in everything.  An Englishman travels. If someone does something for someone then he felt very good. He killed the middle class. She travels with a team. The rich do n't do it and the lower class does n't have the strength these days. The saree is fine which is a good thing for me.  Happy is the population of the country who is in the attitude of I am ours, the middle class needs us, someone should say ours, say that, but how much is he saying that this is a very good thing, please see the context of how much.  good thing  What is happening to him, what is his English, is he IMDb, I have become the IMD's death, this is the deluded illiterate middle class, okay, Chhath is the most important born, be already ready, you are the one who is activated.  Your maternal uncle, your uncle, your uncle can also be your father, no one, no, this is not right, in a country like this, they will do your work like this to attract votes.  For inside the house, you will see this page chief, this chief and all the workers, you will be afraid to open your mouth, you will have this atmosphere inside the house, you will get angry, the same aunt, mother, maternal uncle, uncle, uncle's father, should your child get married?  No one is losing his job but he doesn't care. Tell anyone, the government is divided for 5 years, keep discussing about forming the government for one year and after that, state elections are held every six months, then keep discussing, this entire country is ours.  Will Nitin remain in election mode? If you do n't do so little business, then people bill do it. My advice is, is there any video of mine for my subscribers? 50 lakh 1 crore 10 crore people will watch it, not 20 30 50 thousand people will watch it. If it is fine with you then you who 50000  Or ₹ 1 Lakh, whoever is watching this video, at least share it with yourself, at least the right thing is being said, you should do a little bit of your own fox in your life. Join whole India is focusing on irrelevant. Thanks, if you focus on things then you will see in life that in 6-8 months you will go ahead of people. You have saved your time, saved energy. There is no delay in the arguments. The seventh point is very important. Don't remove it now.  It is very important for the employed people to listen, okay Fox will come into your life very well, you will know everything what is happening because whatever will happen in the next 6 to 7 months. After the election results, Neel Bet will forget the silence, everyone will forget what happened Jitendra Chillam Chilli and the accounts will be settled, some hair results will come, some may wish, anyway the story is getting tight, this is not a very interesting match like India vs West Indies.  So in the first match, India won 115, who knows what happened in the second, so this means it is like this, it is not less interested, okay brother, this is already known, no, no, water will get stronger and stronger, I am you, the customer.  Yes, this is a service provider, you are the water, you have to sit like this, yes, and dance well, tell us, we have to relax, say no in advance, all the water workers have become pampering each other, speak to you like this, yes, why should you explain to me, brother?  Sir, we will vote for you, but you tell us why this one is good, he feels aroused in his mouth, have fun with him, and do n't make your own mind, don't be your own, do n't go and say do this, do that, do n't force yourself.  Apply it because any wish will be fulfilled in your life. Nothing can happen in your life, anyone can become a donkey, it doesn't matter anything, even the story, anything will become. If people are asked today who is their MP, then people do not know the name of the MP. Ask yourself and you don't know about the neighbor at all and they are sitting with nothing but that fund of Rs 500 crores. That MP Lite worth Rs 5-10 crores was also confiscated from them in the court. It is okay because you are making as much money as you can.  ok my someone  It will be beneficial, I am running after so much, let them run away in the sun, I don't know if the election story happens too soon, just for the sake of it, that too, I was not a prediction, but that too can happen in winter, first try to find the most likely one.  It is supposed to be on time but it can be told in advance also but that is not the text of my prediction, ok so I am not doing it at all. The seventh and important thing is that you are a working person, your life is going to be tight. Story: You also do a job. Now it is not easy to get a job, but after taking control of your life, they make it so tight that you are putting in your resignation, this is a trade which will grow in the coming time, there is a lot of supply of jobs in the market and there are some minor jobs.  Which is a top job, where a lot of training has to be given, it is a very specific job, your specialist is there, retirement is safe, but most of the jobs there are 60% of general category when there are so many children in the market.  It means that whatever you are doing for Rs 70 thousand, people will be ready to do the same for Rs 30,000 or Rs 35,000. In Rs 40,000, that person will still be there, I am a little late, he will reduce more than this, how much experience has he gained, now he will make you like this.  If you can't remove it, then it is being explained from above, you should think that I have written the question paper first, then if it is just troubling you too much and doing it unnecessarily.  The writing on the wall is that children, now you will have to look after your jugaad from someone else and because this one will not leave it, it has been explained from above that because if you fire someone then it becomes big news, caste, this company is doing cost cutting, 20 employees are fired. 225 This office, this office, tell them to put in 2 extra hours in the morning, less presentation on Saturday, if they will automatically leave 10%, then how will they cut and say which week is this? Which theory of Charles Darwin is he applying? Survival of the fittest is fine, so the week that is there will go away now. If it goes to the story week position, then if this is happening to you, then mental health, stress, anxiety, all these effects will happen.  But for this I have Aunty Dot, I am that person, I say this, do n't leave your job so soon, don't be shameless and fool, think that no one will come and physically attack you.  This is not happening, it will be mental, so the game is mental, you will be a little shameless, you will take a little pearl and smile and if you smile, he will suffer a lot, there is money for two months, three months notice, he will have to pay all that, don't speak bad about this.  But more content will be created if you want and if you want private consultation on this, someone is getting sad, someone is being made sad, they make a lot of rules and regulations and I am  Will not give relief, will not give sir, all this is nonsense, it is everyone's wrong practice. If someone signs your tax story that if you have not done a good job, then your father's house will become mine and if you sign it, it does not mean that it is father's. Article 15 of the Constitution of any country will be home. That too seems to be a story. Tax people make some children sign. They are fools, they are not fools. They make you a fool. Whatever people are signing, this means they.  If you want to withdraw, then give me a note, you have oil date match but you have bill, you oil, check that, what is there, you check it, no, how much fear will you give me a job, once you are giving me a job, write then give me how much fear.  If he will not come on Sunday but will write the story tomorrow then give it If he will not do it on Saturday and if he will do it on Saturday then write that too till now, if he has not written the terms and conditions in your tension condition then brother you know note pick up the phone after that  Indian is that old slavery, there is no story embedded inside, it has not come out yet but it is still in the DNA, it will be raised tomorrow, I will tell more in details on this and will make a video, it is very important, it will do 7.7 with the people.  thank you very match"

    "title": "07 Reasons Why Youth Should Move To Big Cities ？ [574thpBdBow].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, voice small town people should move without city or small town vs big city or if you are listening to me in small town then you should definitely go to big share, the topic will be seven reasons, I will tell for you people, I know there may be some controversy, caste.  It is good for people not to live in small towns. What will happen if they all move to big cities? There is population in big cities. Population is more. I am addressing my subscribers. If you have understood the thing then  Tell me, everything is nothing, all win gold medals in the Olympics, all do not even go to the Olympics, all do not even play for India, all people sometimes nothing happens, so if you are listening to me and you are my subscriber and this is my subscriber, today I am now  I too should open my batting a little, do n't I tell you some content out of so much fear? Listen brother, if you don't have the same opinion, then go ahead by subscribing because now when the content will be released like this, then the audience will be scared.  Hints, understanding, fear, middle class, middle class government together, now Guruji has come and is talking directly. If you want to live in a small town for a lifetime, then a small town is a small thought. Let's start the discussion. I will tell you all the small ones first. In the urban Indian context, we live in a time walk. Time walk is fine. Google it in English. What does it mean? We have not moved forward with time. Not so much, all is not a debate, listen to the whole thing when together.  Sanoj will come to know 7th then your market will change Satva region is such a big region which corporates have released business in the world outside the world it is everybody release this about India and it is high time you also release others like this Roti  You will go on preparing for a government job, you will go on eating the teeth of your parents, and you will not understand anything else, what to do, no matter how much I am doing.  I have to write the audience forever, what to do, what to do, Guruji, I told you what to do, so today I am telling you what to do, leave your small town, why these are the reasons, you never move forward with time, second, small town, small thinking, big political in speaking.  It seems to be incorrect, it doesn't matter which votes do I have to take, which elections do I have to take, we will see when I have to take them, ok later, if we are in a mood, then we will talk like that, brothers and sisters, it is ok, I do n't need your votes right now, I am young. movie review  Had done, there were some lying in it too, witch is fine because no, now I know which one is which from mother, where is it, those who are living in a small town have to loot your money, somehow you have to do that, let's move ahead, the third thing.  There is a lot to do, there is a lot of leisure in a small town. Yes, how many life vegetables, life of eight was talked about, there was a meeting of 6, all these things are very much, what is your color in it color, if you want to grow in life then you have to go there only.  stay as you were  If you want to live in Time Walk then it is fine and you should stay because there is no space for all of them to come to the city and among the lions, the useless person who has no productivity is nothing less, so he is not needed in the city, not in the big city.  All of them have become small cities for all of them, they will feel a little happy but for the sake of young population, I am telling the youth on clarity that I am addressing you, it is okay for father and mother, the one whose going is okay, the fourth thing is about small town.  The worst thing that seems to me and I am a very close social observer is that of social reformer, that of scientist, that of Joe, that of petin's again is an English word which I am not able to understand at all. It is fine in Hindi, which is like the words of a man, Vocabulary.  It has been happening since, if there is enmity on any small matter then brother, there will be enmity, it is not that there are no fights among big lions, here there is no saving on parking, shoes or any other spices, this is Dr and Order.  There is no issue in me, there is no retirement of police, everything happens, there are all the scandals even among big lions, but still if you are my intelligent audience then you will understand that there is no patience, there is not that much time, it has been defeated by PTI.  There is complete leisure in a small town, which you will not be able to put even in the doctor and order, about which you will not be able to complain, you will not even get a happy opinion, is it a patience or not, you can read all the points.  People who do agriculture, those who are agri scholars, you note agri with three, strongly agri with four, keep on writing, write according to a point, agar jo mera kar audience hai teacher guruji type notes makes HD men's strongly disagree, to badi, gave you a choice with one.  Let's move ahead by saying that there is peace in a small town. Superficially it also seems like a comparison, but I want to tell you one more thing, there is a human tendency within you, tell me.  It will also be good for your parents too, you must have felt it, I am telling you for the first time, despite everything we have, we have to spread a level of raita inside our house, this story inside our life is as per our wish.  Whether you live in a small town or a big city, we have a level of stress, you are there, we cannot live without him, we cannot be in a situation of bliss, for him we don't know how much Guru Tattva Jagan post will go and a lot of things in life.  also this  Never without like a date in a life, so it is like this, a little salt is needed, a little is better than cholesterol, it is okay to add a little gee, those muscles, they move their bones, so a little, everything is like this, now that cap is in the big city. So the default setting is to just live in this stressful big city. If you have some accent, then it is your own relief, not forced, but in a small town, you must have seen the serious ones in the movies.  There are not many ladies like Ekta Kapoor or the ones like that, give them the example of a housewife, I will make a separate video on this too, but it will be like that those women are the ones in the house, they make the house everything, friends.  What happened in Sod, what did Gopi Bahu do, what did he do there? Why was Mata's post not set up properly? Why did he become a bad omen? Now you extrapolate this. In a small town, this is nothing to you.  You can make something here from any thing and it will feel like a big relief, just like every housewife has the trouble of her level at home, for her it is the same world, husband goes out to work for money, there is collection outside in the world, what is traffic jam?  It just happens that what happens in it is never for him, so the house itself is considered very important and everything becomes the same, so in this way this Raita spreads, people who have flats in their mother's place in small towns do not have productivity.  In a big city, you have to take the venue stress, you know that stress is there for you, something is coming in a small city, you are not gaining anything from it, this is the message, higher order video, I am sir, my audience is used, if all this  Now, after so much involvement, if you don't understand anything, then you are not me. Target audience date is also brother-in-law, you will not understand everything everywhere, you will go to every class wearing a professor's saree.  If you do n't understand the things, those who are able to understand, they are enjoying, write that i.e. I am saying with confidence and attitude that brother, it will be fun, you will learn a lot, many people have learned a lot and don't be afraid because nobody will comment these things.  It was said that from home, we will go to a small town, we don't go, my thinking will become smaller by going to a small town, but among IT people, I have to open my laptop and do less at home, so in a big city, it is equivalent to a rickshaw. Brother, then when they do not see your face, there is no networking, they think that you are a small caste and those of small town people, when you jump with fear, who went on the road with a very high system and who did not turn off that pressure cooker and what is this?  Gaya and this will be insulting give you bill be like ki yaar go there thoughts same de real state is very hi big city na because so me people no want tu come and it bill cup going up also so understand de  Next Point Next Point This is also a very important point. Ladies, women in a big city, they have got a lot of chances to be employed. In a small city, when they have opportunities or employment opportunities, or one more big thing, I want to say and that is with me.  There will be a lot of links to the points, the seventh point is very important, you have heard it till now, it is okay to go after listening to that also.  Ladies do not get earning opportunities in small towns because there is a lot of scrutiny there and those opportunities are not there. Maximum the number of teachers in the school is less than in the school because the population is less so those opportunities ladies, you will see if anything.  If there are 100 females in a big city then you will see their employment like 25 30 means out of 100.  25-30 years employed in small lions, these are out of 100 defending and IT bill very from city you city bill be vision people especially in the middle class middle class IT bill be vision look and I am telling you in today's day I  I am telling you these and these cases of lower class where these ladies make less of maids, you will see a city like Rohtak, Rohtak will be small urban, Kaithal will be a small city of Haryana.  I am telling you the city, you can share the rest. The maids available here are less and expensive and in a city like Gurgaon or a big city, there are more of them because the employment chances of their husbands are better, so those ladies are from small cities. Some people don't come because their husbands don't get that much money, so the thoughts are the same, this ecosystem is also another reason why there are opportunity ladies and ladies in the lower class. Also, the employment rate of maids is in Gurgaon city because women work less in Gurgaon city. When a woman goes out and does a job, she will definitely need house support, so that is a system which is very simple in the best way.  I am telling you the Harvard level things very easily, this one about management, that one about economy, very easily, brother, in a small town, he has to kill that himself, in Rohtak.  I know many people who try medical treatment themselves because they do n't enjoy it. I am not pointing out to them, but I am telling them how black you are. I asked the maid that after applying it, I know that people will read their own horses and those who care about me.  You know, it is okay, so they say that if you are hitting it in the form of exercise so that your stomach remains thin and you do yoga type while sitting, then it is good, it is okay but there is no other vice productivity in it, is it okay?  applied and still you  Reach out, if you know such people whether from Rohtak or from such a small town, even after marrying a woman, he is still harassing me once in a while, then please write. Okay, and the last important point is in the seventh big city.  You can do knowledge based income, you can do consultation, you can reduce it in such a way that small town people will say, well, if you tell so much then you are after this thing also, you are only after this thing, the fee for telling only this much is different, meaning small town doctor.  He is ready to pay the money and said that he will write on the slip 2 * vd3 * A. Look at the writing by writing the standard that has been made, hit the stand, take it away, no one should make them sit like this, you can make it mine, my bathroom will be here, mine is like this, my fencing is like this.  Hey, fencing is happening in this small city of Vaastu, small thinking means small thinking, will there be a plot worth crores, crores will be spent on its construction but if the old one is stamped in the map for Rs 2500 then it will be taken away.  There, if you are an architect in a small town, then this is your 1000 dead thousand story. You are not going to become some big great professional, then you are there, that is why in a small town, this is the biggest and the biggest region which I am telling one more.  I am not on purchasing, I am telling you in a small city, in a small city, take the top 7 cities of India, Delhi in which your Gurgaon, Noida will also come, Delhi NCR, the whole of which becomes big cities, like big cities, then Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai. In this you add Pune, Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, then add some more in it, State Capital, 15-20 top five cities, okay brother, India has 14 crore population, about 10% of the specific population lives here, just this less population. But everybody knows everybody is getting this star, earlier he used to come, I am telling you the latest test, you have just seen it in the Economic Times, in the business, in the news, in your own mind like this.  He must be going, he has become fed up with the numbers, the numbers do not come out of him, that Bathua Rahat, he has not risen above these things, Shiva ji, how much is this, how much is that, how much is that brother-in-law, in this you date, only nobody, this note.  Targeting Dame, be it your Zomato, be it any big company of yours, everybody has phones, whatever thing is targeting, this is the one with mass numbers, Hindustan Unilever has entered into it that it has to be sold. That kind of country gave the touching point. Yes, there is a company which wants to distribute even up to the village level, but the date bill is distributed and their separate system is running. Date is I think just 10 20% d latest whatever is the latest test.  Whatever direction I am telling you, everyone starts drawing it with small lions everywhere because everyone was sitting in the numbers and got it.  Subscriber's revenue is low or customer's share is very low today, their fixed cost was getting very high, losses were reduced from the margin and they were getting closed because it is very demanding and price sensitive, very extreme.  Small town man, big city news, big city man has the value of time, he knows that if my time is being held back by this service, then only this billing is on you, this small town man. Note Winning Tu D There is no shortage of time in that city He goes 4 km 5 km from one place to another There is nothing in his life After that Rijiju There is a lot of time and he is not going to give money No this is D Message you me  For subscribers and special youth, leave your small tones. If anyone likes the sound of this thing, then let me tell him another example: When you live in a small village, you go from village to town. Even if you go from a town to a tehsil to a small town, you still see growth. Manoj, if you people from a small town have liked the video, then tell me, it is better to live in the village than in the city.  You do the same comparison between a small town and a big city and when people go abroad to study from a big city, when the community is different, would it have happened in a small town surrounded by other community on people on cast on?  There is no prejudice in the thought process, it is glorification within itself, we are this, I am taking note, name of other community in cast, but it is across, below, above, below and all this has too many elements, this is regionalism, religionism.  And this community and I, you, these 13 Sir, I was saying my surname in patience, it must have entered my mouth at that time or I did not take it out because  What is the point of saying that the husband who has been watching the video till now should finally open it and tell him that the husband has done all these things, so it is not that such activities do not happen in big cities or there are no such people there, that everything is there.  Sophisticated, all educated, all great which I did not name but relatively and percentage wise because their horizon is different because they actually interact with different people and different community this this community this Interesting with this one this cast is interactive of this and they release ki yaar human beings come in whatever shapes and sizes or community se kuch nahi hota meri wali mein bhi baavdi hai doosra mein bhi hai meri wali mein bhi shan meri wali mein bhi shan me Surname which is attracting from Shan is doing Hajj Gan meaning de surname de cast ka naam which is surnames hai de assam great singhniifications and  Significance in small town today as a result a lot of energy and time is wasted in it and such youth you have no come out of it and what is that then too much of it is being rationalized or too much of this kind of war is also happening in small towns. Because then you are becoming a part of someone else's agenda because if you are a small town of vote bank, then what has happened, MP collects, if he gets, he selects, this is what democracy does and one more thing is wrong.  That is happening, I will probably do some more research and tell you some other time. My another channel is Guruji from Gurugram. If you have not subscribed to it then please do so. There I understand all these things and one more thing is going wrong if the population is already like this.  No, migration is not happening, I am making this video, only then people will go to their own, everyone is going, and what happened to his life, I will share it in details on Guruji from Gurugram.  And L and D video with this data, if you look at a city like Mumbai and see the percentage of population and compare it with Maharashtra and if you look at the constitution of Maharashtra, how many people go there, the total is fine, it is 288, whatever the number, see it as much as it is and Mumbai. How many months are made in a month, then you bill relax, villages and areas are more represented and cities, despite having more population, the representation is also less, hence that's what I want you tell.  With this, I will come in the rest of the details or I will leave it in short hand that this Sir, politics and all this is more concentrated on small towns because it is easy to mislead the small towns there, I am openly saying this to mislead the people of small towns.  And entertain me with this comparatively big city, people of big cities, you understand that it is shining, why won't you make eyes even this much because it is going big, I know it looks big, hey, what are you saying, I am in such a big city.  After all these years, if I move to a smaller one, will I become a commissioner? It doesn't happen that way and I live on such a sustainable basis and even if it doesn't happen, you will have to bear it from a big city, but yours will be surrounded by people.  I am not that shy, your skill is so good, there is no value in the line, this is also what I am trying to tell you, you understand, now you will not argue, when the small town guy goes, he is also Kamshana.  But if he goes to a big city, whatever is his Shinde row status, every person goes to 0200, no one is 100, no one is zero, so if you were 60 in a small city, then you will get the value of 60 in a big city, then 60 is the time.  Here everyone is equal and everyone is busy in trying to bring down the average, every sounding video is so good, I also like it but the day is important, it is certain that not all will go to my audience.  My audience has to be 25 crores. The people I am teaching, I am teaching someone to you people, do n't you go to every coach a little, how many people does he train to win the gold medal in the Olympics, he tells me, he understands that only the selected one is mine.  The audience has to understand my button because when you ask this, I don't know what to do in a big city, what to do in a small town, you have to prepare for a government job except in a small town.  Is there nothing in it? You spend 10 years in it and that mummy keeps making parathas, food is available, clothes get dusted, age is 21 to 30 years, there is caste, then job is lost, if not, then keep doing it like this.  If we keep having the same problem then tell us that we do not get employment. Where there is employment, where there is less, where there are people with brains. By networking, you can earn money only in big cities. What is networking, these people are in small lions.  Don't know or do you know that good networking is something, that might be calling it network marketing, I am not calling it network marketing, I am calling it networking, network marketing is different, okay, I am calling it networking with each other.  If you go ahead in life by joining together and collaborating, then I hope you will take it pragmatically. I have to learn all these things gradually on different platforms. You can join me on the telegram channel which you will get in the comment area. Some do three-way destruction, some do trees, which are  can understand How should I do this journey, if I have to do it from the city, if I am in Bengaluru then which nearby city can I come from, if I am from Kerala then I can go to Cochin, if I am from Rohtak, Bhiwani, Bahadurgarh, then I can go to Gurgaon, Palwal, New Mewat.  If you are from Gurgaon then you can come to the nearby areas which are 24 Parganas and the one from Asansol and Kolkata. People are coming to Guwahati also. Now big centers are being built in India and even in North East, if you see like Guwahati is Bill Wickham, back center does not mean that you should leave it at all and just grab the nearest big city to you, then your 50 100  You will find a big city in India within 200 kilometers and by big city I mean absolutely big, I am calling Delhi also a big city. If you expand a little, then you can find 25-30 cities, the state capital is big in every state.  It 's okay and there can be more cities like in Maharashtra, you have Nagpur, you have become Pune, give respect later, Mumbai and Indore will be in place, it is okay, so in Tamil Nadu, we will not stop only at Chennai, we are merging them too, okay.  There is not only Trivandrum in Kerala, it also has coaching. Okay, so every place will be different like this, if you go to Andhra Pradesh side, then yours is not only in Hyderabad, you also have yours in Vizag, some in Visakha, Patna too.  You can go to Bihar and Lucknow, you do n't have to be stuck only in Patna, you can also come to Agra in Lucknow, you can go to Kanpur, you can go to Noida, it is okay for you people, so this is it, you have you.  Approach it but there is no choice you bill have you do it you bill have you do it you bill have you leave if you want to do good in life otherwise you will be stunned even after asking till date no one has made a video like this I don't know that it was made but now I also know that it is correct for the sake of politeness and all this happens like this, people get angry because of maximum audience and subscriber base, there is relief only in small villages, is n't it India?  Right now, in villages and small towns, the people are busy cutting them down and saying that if you stay here and become more famous then they will not be able to control them. People in big cities don't even vote for the politicians.  I am not even from here because if you see in Gurgaon, you do n't know how many people are sitting outside and do not go to vote after taking leave. These people are from different regions due to which all this is being done. Okay, so you have to understand that.  Your biggest wish is money to progress your life Sher"

    "title": "07 Signs Which Tell That You Were Emotionally Neglected As A Child [GgeOBRbX9NM].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, this is a very important topic. Seven science witch bills tell you that you are emotionally neglected. A child is very important. In my consultation, I have seen trauma. These symptoms occur in even the most normal of seemingly healthy people. If you see, you see inside.  If you are there then you can see and introspect about it in your childhood, 7 sciences are very important, it is very important to see and understand your  Applying for pay, if it is one of the intake, then off course, if it is 1/7 degree, then one can always without exception, but two sciences are visible, then it seems that yes, there was something, three kar auto intake, you can identify with five out of.  7 six out of 7 and 7 auto 7 to ratio I am sir my audience is not getting bored see understand that all seven of the set will also be very rare and zero out of seven.  Bill also BN and Score but according to me, let's start first thing, there should be an over achiever over fever, everyone tells them yes, something must have happened in their childhood, maybe it is like this, they say so but those who are over achievers are very rich.  Have become a lot, have done something in 25 years. Have done something in 30 years, have done a lot. Sitting in a fire lake and always want to achieve in everything, then it is a trait, no conclusive rate is necessary. You have to associate it with other things also, but this is that it is constantly roaring with ease, coolness, pause, with pleasure, a little less today, now it is good, if it is not in the mood, then it is a good thing.  Will not do because psychology is a psychological thing, everybody can be a man, can be a boy, can be a girl, it becomes very important in the way of girls, especially when girls are in childhood.  Parents, especially those who do not get love affection, protection and involvement from their father, are Casanova type of badass girls, they understand this oneness, their strike rate is visible, only then they say, 'We are very sorry, now we are here'.  I am revealing something, please do not take any illegitimate advantage of this knowledge, but the girls and boys here are also fine, work both vests are fine.  Agar aap u find syncing tu match ki jo jo dekh hai na praise me on insta, do me a lot, why is it happening, there is no security inside, I did not get love from my family, from my father, from my mother, from my siblings, I did not get it in my childhood. I was also hot looking or she was too cut or exposed as you like because if you are happy to have your photo clicked then you don't go this route in front of thousands of strangers.  Administration and all this is a very deep thing to do but today's topic, each topic can become its own very deep 15 minute topic but I am not making it today because today I have to make this thing which of these. You can tell the audience what you need in detail, one to three, seven, you can tell that is fine because I will reset it for 15 minutes, it takes more than 15 minutes to watch YouTube, so give it to me. Points are done, okay this is what you have to remember, the third one is that one is extreme, understand these two extremes that this person who has emotional issues has been neglected in childhood, he would not like to be dependent on anyone at all, I do not want to be dependent on anyone. Sir, I have to do my own thing, I do n't need anyone else, then this approach will be like this or in its extreme, the group will be busy, will I go to my friends, spouses, without them or leave them?  You will go to me, you will become this, either you are my friend, you will support me, you will not leave me, you will not leave, you will not go, you will not do this, you will not do this thing, these two will remain in extremes because that is the normal calculation.  People, you know, in between, you have to be dependent too. Sometimes you say to someone, 'Friend, can I make tea, is it okay? Or can I put my clothes on, or I ca n't get my clothes, I can't get glasses, I have to be a little dependent, that means Idli, it is n good.'  think tu  Have to read B Independence, they live in ice cream, normal think, you are also some times dependent on nature, otherwise this one has to be seen a little extreme, do it with them also, only then you will connect the story and dot, in this video, I want that which is very old of mine and subscribe good.  Make small notes, watch the video Sanoj, three-four names will pop up in your mind, it could be yours, it could be a relative's, it could be a friend's, and you will enjoy doing it like this, yes friend, that.  Independence is neglected, yes, it was neglected, someone will have confirmation, someone will not have it, you will joke a bit, you will forget, there is no learning, then further I am telling this template, brother, I am telling this from the stomach consultation, on this there can be nurses in the stomach also.  But I am telling you right now sir, this is not to be done, if you have to give content, then increase its value, again and again I am saying by doing like this, clapping like this, do value, Terris.  Do it okay for yourself and there is no need to forward it too much, take some for my subscribers who can watch comfortably, don't give it to everyone, otherwise people can also take wrong advantage of it, it will go to too many people and the other  You can cry for a long time especially because when someone's pain points are hit, many people go towards self-acceleration in life with the realization that yes you are the one who denies the reflectors, it is very ridiculous, then my  There is an audience, I know that you like it, but it is not necessary to send more messages to other people. Fourth thing in your life, you try to do so many things but you never fully complete, this Chauth is the simtem, should I do this too, do that too.  I will take it from within, I will not make us astrological on the channel, but that thirst is there, like you are a thirst, I will make a topic sometime, okay, it is not heavy, that means there is no taste even in career, then I got something.  I am not getting anything else, I have to invest. I have to invest. I went for jumping. There was no salad there either. Story, I am not getting the taste. You are going there from Bihar. You are breaking off the relationship. I did not like this girl with this boy. This boy is not good.  Now that one is not going, then this one, then that one. Changing cars, changing phones, means you can eat, sometimes you are going to eat here, sometimes you are going to eat there, means you are changing clothes again and again, you do not like luxury.  where you are  Note feeling complete and you really don't know then this is a big reason if the general pattern is giving times in your life for 15 days for 10 days for 10 days every normal means the day after tomorrow bill also flower days no one did this  Some people will never get this feeling, but if a pattern is being formed in your life, it has been 6 months, 6 months have been considered as a pattern, after one or two or three months, we can think that it is okay, no problem.  Okay, six months, it's a pattern, year, off course, okay, so this is a big thing. Fifth thing, people around you, your porters, friends, relatives etc. do this. Man, this is an English word. In Hindi too, they might say something like this or don't be.  So hard on yourself, once we take a lot of care of ourselves, many people must have seen you, no, I am dirty, I am not better than me, it did not happen like this, it was my fault, I have to do something else, you Sachin In childhood, when you lost an eraser and your mother had invested money. Can you have a problem in astrology and there is a small market in it? If today mother takes your paan, is it a discovery of the pencil or a loss of thousand rupees?  It will happen if the car spits, it is not a big thing, it is not money, it is [music] When you are denied a good teddy bear on a birthday because it was expensive, the parents wrote it, thinking that he will throw it up in a few days.  Will she throw away the expensive one I bought? I bought this one with coconut hair and that too gets traumatized in adulthood after 30-40 years. Then you pass it on to your children after spending a lot of money. It has been seen that I will not do this to them anymore.  Or I will do it, I will do it, this is the pattern seen in your childhood: You know, you hear this many times in your childhood, as if you were crying for a water bottle, i.e. Indian parents, poor people, middle class people, that  Take a useless thing to save money, it means that it is a waste in the name of children, who decides the waste, the child has a desire, Holi is coming, he wants a pichkari, it is very nice, I have seen it in real life, it will be like all the examples. A little expensive, it is okay on time, you are not bought, they go and come out with issues many times, friend, it is like this, it also means so much, where is it, I have just done it, I am enjoying now, Chhath and seventh are very important.  Very important is the sixth coming but that you are capable of showing love without that of money means you are only with money only, apart from that you do not know how to express love with traditional men, take clothes, take mobile, take a lot of parents and who  These days, you guys are having a test, I am late, but I had such emotions in my childhood that brother, now it can be done only with money, brother, if I don't know, then take this for your birthday. Here I have said this because look at the story, there is no such person who was not even a little emotionally negative, then such a Kamini can happen. Not a single one of these seven things is happening to anyone from my audience including myself, that if so much Childhood was great so brother clapping your lucky your blessed is ok but one or two will definitely happen, it will happen 100% even after that but there is no need to raise alarm. You people, you people do n't have to do this or that, I talk a lot on these things, there is a lot of healing in my button, there is healing in the button itself. It is by the grace of someone that it is okay but those who want to do healing like here I have done a lot of healing.  I told you something like this, the seventh point is very important, you can take platinum membership, I touch these people, I am going through this and I will also tell you the best way to protect them from this, then I tell you the seventh point, the most important is that  You are not able to express your feelings in these words. There are many people who remain like this or the person who has been emotionally stable in childhood and will talk comfortably will clearly tell in a few words that I did not like what you said like this.  The food is cooked well but there is more salt in it or the vegetable has become a little more secret, will he tell clear cut meaning that and because and his brain thinks very helpfully at this point, it is found 78%.  People Pomegranate Country Falling Feeling This is a very important point and test it on yourself, the seventh point is the D most, many people are not able to explain it to anyone, but you don't understand me, it means people say that you understand it yourself. Because you were never understood in your childhood, you did not have the vocabulary to understand because as soon as you opened your mouth, you were banded, so that whole of you was not taken out. Emotions are fine, meaning there are many like this.  Right, with the parents, you listen to me, I am your father, I am mom, so the children who say this, you know, you listen to me, we are your children, then do such things, I too find it difficult to say, listen to me, papa. Option Back Always Hut From Hai Papa and Grandpa Papa Hai Had From Hai Papa and Grandpa Everything Ye Hum To Har Aap Hain Hamari Baat Suno Main Tera Aap Hoon I Am Telling You Do It Your Father Is Telling You Father also telling why what happened is not equal, does it mean Hitler is needed, is this a different pain of Indians in homes because nowadays I have heard from children to whom I have taught things, they speak and children are better than this. What is just imaginary parent and your child the moment you shoot at her and show these four things then he feels that whatever he has done will be equal because if you articulate it and say it then it will be a disaster.  Let's go to dangerous mother I bill him D word mother is a slightly different relief of only ladies, in this article it means that he is not like that body is pearl and will hit and shouts and is not angry and two and a half kg hand which man lovingly gives one or two  Convey something clearly in three lines, even the bus gets nervous, the wife also gets nervous, the relatives also get nervous, the friends who use their claws unnecessarily also get nervous, IT people, you reset the stage. IT CAN BE TALK IT CAN BE LEARNTY First of whatever you released brother, this is a bit of a mess, this is it, man, some parents did not do it intentionally, their syllabus was also such a week, no one told them, nowadays these English terms have started coming. We started putting some terms on all these behaviours, earlier this was happening with us, we did not know what we call it, our soul knew us from inside, our conscience knew everything, that is, something is going wrong. This is not right, anyone was doing this, what is gas lighting, what is NRCISM, what is the name of the parent and these things did not exist, what is control in parents, what is control in life, I have done better things in life with it. -Good people who have reached good places in life because of these things are not sorted out because they probably have no one to tell you that brother, this is your problem of 22 years, 25 years, 28 years, since childhood.  9 years 10 years non-changeable when you were 9 years old, you did not get her in the fourth class and you kept on suffering and you were told that your father has no money but later when you came into adulthood, you were released.  No, father, it was me and so many others who have money and we have it on time to give it to Ba ji for his life, to have money at that time to have a party, to end all that for the saint.  There was no money for my bicycle. That time cannot be returned. Now this man is roaming around with a Harley Davidson but that Harley Davidson is not giving him happiness. This is a trauma. Many a times I am making videos right now because all this is real.  Means emotions are coming in the eyes from the example, remembering those jeans consultation, Harley Davidson is not giving happiness at the age of 45, at the age of 44, I am getting free studies in life and a lot of money. Appearances are wide open, everyone is roaming around, we made it like this, we intervened there, we made it like this, I can't say anything to them, I can't say that I am happy with Harley Davidson, now I start doing something, I start giving them money in a different way, then they  Those who go to 76.5 then they have nothing but money to give love to their family, now their children will have different spices because they will get cars, now they did not get love because this brother is just a human being for not giving love.  Same  Will he give to others what he has? IF YOU HAVE ONLY MONEY AND YOU DON'T HAVE EMOTIONS LOVE COMPASSION PYAAR MOHAMMAD HINDI URDU WORDS, YOU DON'T HAVE ALL THIS SO YOU CAN'T GIVE IT TO SOMEONE, IT'S A SIMPLE TALK AND IF YOU CAN'T GIVE IT, THEN  Now he might be making a different story about some other consultant, after 30 years or 40 years, my father had given me a car and by the way, this is what you have learned by watching the video till now.  There is only one way for healing. Date you know these things and you start helping other starters. You are not alone. People have many more stories than you. There is a lot of pain. Let me share the pain of the world.  To reduce, go, regret, being a pet concert, turn, tell the world, understand that it is like this, this is all this, I am teaching one of my happiness courses, it is very iconic, you can take it.  By taking platinum membership or taking it through you, whatever is your wish, there is a very iconic Happiness Course 1.0 for platinum members but it will be in winter, okay, this is not the season, come and eat some sweet milk.  And do wine workshops like this and it will be cool and it will be fun to learn it, meaning I do my happiness course in winter only, so the last one is also in winters, so all.  The weather should be a little cold and I will do this one too in this. Many classes have been going on. Last time it was seven big work. We way destruction. One half is almost content. Okay but many people are becoming mini consultants from it. Others are doing well.  There will be more fresh topics in this one and it is in a very practical way, you will not get the story, it will not seem that Guru ji has read an English book and just made it into this as if the public is doing the rest, isn't it completely original? First Class Exactly according to the time, according to today's book, what nowadays, life has become so dynamic, another changing fast, much of what is written in the old book, which is 10-20 40 years old, is not applicable, yes, 2000 What is written years ago which you people do not have access to is application, what is written 2000 years ago is applicable and what is written 30 years ago is not applicable so please  You will enjoy it a lot, okay, keep things together carefully, there is no need to share them too much because share this video, I want you to observe it, give respect to it, everybody can note, only people who have now got so many subscribers are enough.  There has been a decent number of people who are connected and many are enjoying both of them unnecessarily, by showing this inside their family group, they will tell a different story again. You don't know what used to happen, yes.  Don't know tell me what used to happen then you bill get in you date which note required happened 20 years 25 years 30 years ago so now you can't find you empty paan by making them say sorry from their mouth or by making them do something and embarrass them. Emptiness: Will they say yes or will they say that you didn't like anyone at all? You know, okay, so many children are roaming around who sometimes have doubts that they belong to the temple.  The story was not found on CDO like it was shown in the movies. The old ones are not like this. Between you siblings also feel like this. If people have it then it is not like this originally, it is due to their own biology, but many people have spent their childhood in such a feeling.  This is also a subject of pain, so the more we explore it, the better we will understand. In India, no one talks about it outside, still things have happened, it is okay, things have been heavy, witch is good, it is okay with us.  Actually, bread, clothes and house will reach the stage. Now you can talk about all these things because on an empty stomach, all these things cannot be said in English. But my audience on power is middle class. Uppal are coming to this stage and you cross this date, it is a long time back, so you.

    "title": "07 Things Middle Class Needs To Avoid To Become Rich ｜ Know This Secret About Investments [8x8GfvcKXJ4].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, this is a very important topic for youth. I would say that people below 40 years of age or even those who are 45 years of age should also take note of it. It is very important. You have to spread this message and there is no competition in it that if you get to know about it, then someone else will also get to know about it. So if you are lagging behind then let's start with seven things which youth should avoid doing and if you avoid them then you can become rich and these mistakes are being made, I will tell you seven mistakes, fourth, sixth and seventh are amazing, it is amazing, you will enjoy it, it is quite original  Content is one or two things, you may have heard it, let's start from the beginning, which you may have heard, but it is important to repeat it, but you may not have heard some things and you have to do it. Which are the best two out of these seven advices?  If you want a number, please tell me that this is the number and this is your best, please tell me, as a content creator, it is very fun to get your paper checked from the subscribers, so the first thing is not to invest time and little money in upgrading your skills  I see that people of 22, 23, 24, 25, 28, 32 years of age want to invest, they want to invest, they want to invest, increase your salary and money making capacity, when you become old then that capacity will not increase, there is a time when it can increase  Now, by doing a SIP of Rs 5,000, Warku ji has glamorized it so much that you will become a millionaire in 90 years, and by doing that, this mutual fund, this stock, this multibagger stock, hey, if you do it, then 50,000, 10,000, 200, 50,000  No, it will become long in the long term, there is too much focus in this, I am saying just do it and get rid of it, buy an index fund, buy some ETF, do it and get rid of the rest of your energy in learning more things which you can monetize, if you are thinking about investing  If I have to learn a lot then learn so much that you can earn by giving knowledge to others because if I earn Rs 5000, 10000  I am sitting with Rs. 200 and up to Rs. 1 lakh and I am learning it myself, so brother, only Rs. 50,000 is working, Rs. 20 lakh is not working, now FD of Rs. 50 lakh will any day give more returns than anything put in mutual fund  Which is like 5 lakh, 10 lakh, 15 lakh, try as much as you want, but after 40 years it will happen in the long term, all of us are dead, okay? Leave the dream of 90 years of SIP, invest in yourself, another thing is coming which is missing out on  Real estate because by getting into the debate that whether this is good that is good not realizing that real estate is an assured expense you will have to pay rental but rental rate is always at Rs. 3 it will remain at Rs. 35 4 life long because if  He is on this base pay 3 so when this base increases the property price doubles then the rental also doubles and after that Even after 50 years you will hear the same stories, so don't listen to them, the property which was worth 20 lakh rupees 20 years ago has now become worth one crore rupees and still gives 000 rent  If it comes then if the rent is 000 then it is % only but how much rental did the person getting 000 rent 20 lakh get, tell me whether it happened on 15 or not, brothers and sisters, we should not miss out on this thing, we should not get into the debate on this that  Hey this is like this anyhow take money from father and mother and save the marriage from mother in law and father in law and take wife and husband home in the beginning he will give you a lot of freedom in the future you will have the courage to say no in things, let's go ahead in the third thing which is not Children and youngsters are not able to understand staying in one place, opportunity will take me there, then I will go there, I will go there, rolling stones are gathering, no masses choose your karma bhoomi, be initial two-four  It will not happen in 5 years but by 30 at least be very clear where you are going to make your money and stay in your life by changing your family, living at six or eight places, father is here, mother-in-law, father-in-law are there, he is there, she is here  My brothers and sisters are here, the children will be here in future, I am here, my wife is here, nowadays people are doing even these jobs, then you will keep asking the airlines for money for coming and going, you will keep paying money to the railways and the opportunity cost will keep going down because you will set up separate homes  So no money will be saved, living in one place is very important, I am telling this to the government people also, the wife is a government servant, the husband is a government servant, you are living far away, a separate video will be made on this, if you want then tell me, living in one place is very important  It is important now the fourth thing which I had said is very important which ones did I say fourth sixth and seventh now this is going to come listen carefully the fourth thing which I had said was compounding yes we know about compounding friend I don't tell you about compounding  Staying 1 P r to the power n, this compounding in relationships, which term is this, compounding, compounding, that is, we have learnt it, I know, they do not understand compounding in relationships, youngsters will keep running after frillless relationships, living in boy-girl, then it was changed friend,  They have changed their place also, the place is not same and hence the network is also not same, there is a lot of compounding effect of their relationship, make less relationships in life but stay with fruitful and intelligent wise people, you will find them and there is a lot of compounding  A relationship that gave great returns, more than the returns that came in real life because of that relationship, that was Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett's relationship and which other relationships do you know like this, you will see a lot of actor producer actor actress okay  You will see such compounding in businesses, you will see many such relationships that took you from one place to somewhere, some years ago there were two men in Gujarat, one used to drive a scooter and he used to sit behind with a poster, it was many years ago brothers and sisters, more than 35 years ago  Now who is she and where have they reached, where has the compounding of that relationship taken her, brothers and sisters, tell me who is she, relationships can take them anywhere, understand their compounding, today keep in the back of your mind through this video, which are the relationships that  It is compounding you and which takes you down and you keep changing, the sooner you get married, the sooner that wife or husband comes to you, the more you can concentrate on further things because that compounding effect of intimacy will start coming soon  And all the things have to be understood by taking a leap of faith and the youth is not understanding that they have become a ghost out of fear of 498 because a separate video will come on that, why one should not be afraid, what are the benefits, but today this is as a concept.  I have introduced it and apply it in all relationships, then comes the fifth point, we can call it in short language as inability to say no, but if I explain it in detail, then wasting time in running errands, we understand small tasks as mother-  Father would use them as servants He was picked up from the railway station, dropped there and came back. The work can be done in 10, 20, 100, ₹5,00,000, 000, if you don't do that work, our parents feed us and keep us entertained till that much, you will be able to become a man and this will have to be given to your parents.  I want to make a child and the parents also feel that it is good for nothing so let's get something done to recover it but this is happening with a lot of war, small tasks, many times the wife also traps me in such circles because I address  I am doing this for people up to 40 years of age, have you seen one thing, the religious wife who is there, wives, I am talking about middle class women, there will be big things for them to help in the house, if they are housewives, they will come with brooms, cleaners will come  The utensils seller will come, I am talking about the middle class, not the poor people, if your husband cannot give this to you at home, then you must remember that you are poor, no no, we are very much out of choice, if you are saying this out of choice  so % are you  Otherwise, everyone comes to the house. In many, everyone has hired a cook or a chopping lady. Some ladies who dry bedsheets or clothes gradually outsource all the work. The husband comes after earning money, there is no outsourcing of that. He still has to take his wife to visit his relatives where he does not want to go and is tired. If he is going out for his own trip then it is a different matter but the husband is tired of doing such things where he does not feel like doing them That husband spends two or three hours on Saturday or Sunday, attends a workshop, attends a webinar, relaxes, makes some notes, books, adds value to his life, the wife will say, now you go from Monday to Friday, then you will be the boss's boss You were obeying my orders, now you will not obey my orders or else I will obey you, meaning this looks very youthful in it and I am not saying this against women, I am giving you examples, it can be applicable to the female gender  Also that you may be asked to do such Mundan things, if you can outsource them and earn money, you can earn big money, you also want to earn, learn to say no to time wasters, there is a party at my place, there is a Mundan ceremony, this happened today. B I am going to everywhere and cannot say no, one has gone, the other one also has to go, the third one also has to go, there is traffic everywhere, brother, do your own thing with your families, I said that families should stay nearby, whose are the rest?  If you call the friend of the friend of the friend of the friend, then most of these middle class youth are wasting their time. The moment you cross into 40, then you realise that there is not that much time left in life, then stop wasting this time.  You will do it but you will have this feeling friend, if someone had told you earlier because that relationship did not go anywhere because I had told you earlier about compounding of relationship, there can be only three, four, five or six useful relationships which can be compounded by many people who are living in very great positions  I have arrived, they have kept one and two only, one and two with their family members  One or two of our outsiders and through that we can reach places so I hope you also understand this thing, the sixth thing is very important in which this mistake is made, so on IC 95, people doing may be more youngsters, okay and what about youngsters who are not so youngsters  Also doing goal based investment, this is the way to loot money from you, goal based investments, who is he Rohit with Sharan and he, you have to go for a trip here in two years, save this, buy a car, save this, buy this, do this, this Miz Mable way  This is the way of living, you will keep going, you will be 50 years old, everything will be fine and nothing will be left, no that retirement is also the best goal, put all your effort in increasing and earning money and the capability to add value to your life is the life of the world  I should earn money from it like these people are earning, where should the world make gold based investment, you can earn more money from it, doing epic [ __ ], doing this, do this, do that, do that, do that, make money yourself  Earn so much money that you don't even think about the expenses, brother, you have to go to a foreign country, how much will it cost, 5 lakhs, 10 lakhs, hey, it is like this, earn for 10 days, earn for 15 days, go for that and then you will get used to earning big money.  So this urge to run away left and right also reduces because when you start understanding money, then when you buy an i, you do n't say that it is worth Rs. 1 lakh and I am saving for it. Yes, you calculate it like this, I will do the calculation and tell you, suppose you want to buy a phone worth 5 lakhs, then brother, it is like this, if you want to buy a phone worth 5 lakhs, then you will get it only after deducting tax, whatever money I have earned, that means I will get 2 lakhs  You will have to earn because it will go into tax at 33 and 30 per cent so you will have to earn 2 lakhs, ok but the 2 lakhs that you earn should also be savings, so the savings are based on how many hours of my work, so start taking out the phone in hours' time two for example if your  If your salary is ₹ 1 lakh, then you cannot save more than 50,000. For that 1 lakh salary, if you work 200 hours a month, then you save another 50,000, which is equivalent to 600 hours of your work.  Calculate the phone cost of 600 hours in this way that if you get your mill grinding done for 600 hours then you will get a call and suddenly you will say that friend, I will buy it for 20000 only, 130000 is saved, 130000 is saved, so I have saved my 550 hours, these 550 hours would have been spent somewhere else  If I invest then I can do something else and earn more money. Every time when you buy something, do n't think how much it costs. Think, calculate my rate of earnings, then calculate my rate of savings and buy things from the savings only. Whatever remains is given to the government, the petrol  I wasted the electricity, I wasted whatever I spent on clothes, whatever is left, will you buy from that only, won't I take a credit card, interest yes, so calculate that too, calculate the interest, that too will be taken out from the savings and the interest will also be given on the money that is saved  If it is there then you will come to know that you will not spend a lot of money unnecessarily, you will not have to ask anyone how good it is, I had said that sixth is very good and seventh is the final which will be a lot of fun, youngsters are making a big mistake, they are travelling, I am not saying not to travel  We do it but we are doing it in the wrong way, let me tell you how, we will go travelling anywhere, we will go to Goa, let's talk about India, some destinations are going to Goa, someone is going to Jaipur, going to Agra and tell me some other place of Indian tourism, Kashmir is going to Himachal  This is going to Kullu Manali area and then this one from Mussoorie has come, Nainital has come, Uttarakhand has come, this one is going to the South, Kerala is going, these are Indian destinations and if you take some foreign destinations, many people are going there to visit in the wrong way on  You are travelling, I will tell you what is the right way of travelling, wherever you go, don't just go and take photographs, be curious, where can one get paintings, where are miniature paintings, where can one do business, where is this yellow house, where can one get sarees in Varanasi, which place in Karnataka  C type sarees are available on the Ranchi side, which paintings are there, where can Madhubani paintings come from, local art and craft, bring numbers of 50 people, do business later, collect things, from where, what thing can be sold, Maheshwari saree is this  what is it, what can happen inside Madhya Pradesh, how can you tap with other countries, you can make blogs and photos of that place and also earn money from youtube3, then it is fun, you do n't get to travel, you just go and come back  When you go and come back after eating, find out about the food, what are the benefits of the food, put its photographs, its blogs, travel blogs, photographs, videos, friend, you should know the way of travelling and go to all the places with ease, spend some time, one or two days extra because it costs a lot.  Your place to visit  You have to come and go, don't run around like this, just go around doing that Kabaddi Kabaddi Kabaddi Kabaddi Kabaddi Cuttap, touch ahead like this, Kabaddi Kabaddi, don't go like this and a day will come that when you will learn to earn money by travelling, then brothers and sisters, go around  It will increase even more and by travelling, tell me that if you go somewhere, ask about real estate and gain knowledge about it, gain domain knowledge, wherever you go, such a big book or a class plus or someone's book, like nowadays there are notebooks etc., any one is good  Take a notebook, take a good register and fill it with notes, then scan it and put it in your computer, so that if the book gets lost, the data is not lost, write it in your good handwriting, not your good writing  If it is there then get it written in wife's handwriting, sometimes the writing is not good, like when I go somewhere then I dictate notes, I do not understand my writing, that is why I have to make my videos like this, I cannot make them in writing.  You will not be able to understand your writing, you will have to read it like this many times  Many times one goes for pointers, so what am I trying to do, look at travel in a different way, think that it will be a trip here, it is a trip to Bhutan, now people will come and go, not many people have gone there, so how did they go, how did they reach there, what a good experience  Was it a bad experience, where money could have been saved, where good investments could have been made, do a review, learn the local economics of that place and also bring relations from there that whenever I call you send the goods to me, brother.  Order any item and monetize each item, make a website and put everyone's stuff on it, if you want to use your brain more then everything of yours is sold on this amazonbusiness.in, there is a place between Gandhidham and Bhuj, many heroines wear it  The suits from there are of 500, 600, 700 rupees many years ago, bring them to homes, it is like this that if you buy 15 suits, then you think that I will do business or I will gift something like this, the family members rob it like this  relatives are your own  K means wife, his wife's sister or someone else, they have so much craze for someone, like take them to Rohtak, take them to Jind or Jha, what is that thing that ladies like the most, see how nicely I am explaining the same point  The seventh point is very important. Ladies like the most that they wear something that no one else has worn. So, if you bring those Bandhej things from Haryana and I am forgetting the names of many sarees.  They come like this, you get them pressed later, oh amazing, where did you get it from, where did you get it from, I mean here even if you give it to him for Rs. 5000, he is ready to buy the thing worth Rs. 800000, then you have to create a supply chain, you have to call him for the paintings  I want to talk about things, I want to talk about mud art work, anything, sky's the limit, next time whenever you go, go with your eyes open. Youngsters, even in travel, there is money and happiness in everything and this is a mistake but  What is your focus? Just sitting here now  No, you tell me exactly, hey, next time keep your eyes and ears open, talk to the taxi drivers, sit down, what is here, what is there, what is this, what is that, give Rs. 00 extra to the taxi driver, he will take good things, good, cheap supply chain sir. I take you sir, I take you, I take you from there, then you should have 15 numbers, whichever city you visit, 15 number is of the hotel owner, stay in good hotels, always stay in a good place, only then  There will be a way to earn money where you can save a few paise or a few paise, those are the places where there is some crowd as well and many times while travelling you will meet fellow travellers, I will tell you one small thing and I will finish it with a  Great tip I have learned a lot because of that I travel only in economy class in the plane because there is no business class in the plane and it is very expensive, I do not travel in business class but even in economy class, there is a front seat beyond which there is no seat  There are no seats there is more space like 1a 1b  There is a seat number 1C, okay, the first row in which you can take out the seat and eat something, then you have to pay more money in that, always try to book that seat by paying money because in that the chances of you finding an interesting fellow traveler will be high.  B he too must have paid more money, the person who is ready to pay more money for comfort, you can do something by sitting with him, whoever these money saving people are, avoid them by chirping and screaming in life  When I did the company in a relationship, because that is what you have been taught, this is a good thing, I am not saying here that after taking money, you should start doing this, that those who are doing this in front of the mare, then make a relationship with them, I am like this I am not saying this, I hope you all have enough sense to understand that I am not talking about those who are wasting money, taking away people, doing such things, but those who do not live uselessly, those who understand good things, try to  you should try to be friends with them  Learn from them, try to be sponge around them and do that. I hope you will do these seven things in your life and you will enjoy it. You will get immediate effect. There is also compounding of all these seven things. The effect which will be seen in the first year will be seen in the second year.  The effect of the first year will be the effect of the effect of Chakravarti interest, this is interest and interest by the time, you keep doing following these things in four to five years, you will realize that life is changing, you have not wasted any useless time, if you are taking knowledge on investment Then sell that knowledge brother because nothing is going to happen by just consuming it and the knowledge which cannot be sold and no one is ready to give you any money, now like this is a video, if knowledge is given in the video then it will be known from your likes  From the views and comments, you will get to know what my status was and which one did you like? I had taken a promise from you guys earlier that out of these seven, whichever one turns out to be your favorite, you would say that I had not thought of this one.  From now on I will  So write down their numbers like ten and three and four and two or one and seven, whatever you understand, like the channel and subscribe, inside the comment section you will find some small courses, Jansa wala is very cheap  If you can understand it more, you can take it after looking at the topic, again it is compounding of learning also and it will be very beneficial for you, thank you very much"

There is a lot of difference between the personality of the children. Now they say that they accept the child that whatever I do, Children consider it as freedom that if I do a little something, then when my peer sings the song, he will say, Hey you, this is big, this is how you are feeling, but it is a memorandum, so children do not do it.

    "title": "10 Mistakes To Avoid In Your Whatsapp DP [HZYPNOET17U].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, it is a very important topic, your DP, WhatsApp DP is the topic on it, 10 mistakes, what are the 10 wrong DP's, I will discuss them in detail, I will give the reasoning of some, I will not give the rest, it is your own choice, do it with your discretion and intelligence.  It is very important for you to apply because you are being just and being watched. However, the country is free to apply whatever you want, who can do anything to whom, but if you are free from this society.  If you want something from the people of the world, then listen to this because this channel is on this people, I want you rich, very like you are in motion, which is not at all sitting, it is less that brother, do n't do anything, if we stay here, then it is different for them. 10 DP If you belong to any further group, share this video because 70% of your family's people are in this category. 10th person should have an amazing DP. So, which should be an amazing DP, then stay connected till more. Share first. DP is wrong that people pose on the side as if it is shown on their website and not a big leader is going and photo from behind back side tu de world don't show your back side tu de world do show your this image also like  I have shown that movie in that foreign movie, that Jai jaate time, such a photo, side pose, dispose date post, not this, this look of mine is not very good, not a side one, another thing, people put it on the DP of small children, you should not put it on your children.  One's photo should not be posted alone. People say about the child that I love you very much, that you love your child, there is no need to show it to the world, the child is now in the display picture, after a lot of reasoning, I will not go into it again. There are many dandy nuns in astrology who are like this in my lap.  Who loves children, you love children, everyone loves children, everyone loves their children, okay, put it on the screen, keep the photo on the mobile, keep the photo in the gallery, take a printout, keep it in the purse, keep it in the house, keep it in the heart, keep it in the world.  It is not necessary to show it to the world. You are showing your own display picture. You should not show any child's. These people are making a big mistake. If you have put photographs of children in the display picture, then please remove them. Guru ji, tell me.  If you are saying that, I will make it in great detail, then it will become an hour long video. Okay, I will explain that in detail also in some webinar workshop. You can remove this. Okay, the third one is for two or three people. I have seen Youngster.  There are girls and mostly I am telling openly that the girl is not that much beautiful in her eyes, in her eyes I will say that she is with the other one, now you don't know when tomorrow is coming, this is coming, this is this.  This is this, why not this, this is my friend, you also have to see the picture, there is a heroine in it and the one on her side is the one on the side, to top it off, she would have taken a little, first Guddi Maruti ji had come, you know.  Does anyone's fasting make sense?  No, he is pretending that I am in the body shop. I am talking about psychology. I am talking about psychology, why this game is played and how it is played. The fourth thing which should not be there is that there should not be a night photo in the background.  It should not be night, it should not be dark, it should not be under the light, what kind of darkness should it be, darkness is visible in front and behind, you are the one with spotlight, do not put DP of dark night, do not put night photo. Fifth  I will forcefully tell you, the one with OT or the cut DP. Cut DP means these are three genes. There was a photo in it. You put yours of both the cats in it. It was visible. Hey, don't you have a photo at all? Nowadays, it means that every mobile phone has a dead thousand. People keep taking photos like this and on the third day, put one of your own, friend, you definitely have to put a cut one, I am telling you, these are mistakes, do not put a cut photo of yourself sitting with someone and please do not put such a photo.  Put a glass of liquor on your chest. You are getting intoxicated with the party. Food is visible while sitting at the table. Food is visible. Liquor is visible. Glass is visible. Juice is visible. How can a party be done on disability state or not? It seems like a big power to many people. There is a party going on behind the scenes.  It was a big hotel or something and he was feeling as if I was being a stupid judge, don't drink too much, brother-in-law is giving something to you, you are trying to get hair, you are his lot, she is a lot of people.  They are judging the jobs if you want. These things are coming in the interview. They are being judged, that is why I am telling them. They are getting judged just like us, that is why I am also telling them. I am not dreaming of making a video, after all.  Why do I need a DP, who has to put it, who has felt it is right, who gets the story in life because it is very similar to you, whenever you apply for a job, it has nothing to do with learning, it has something to do with it, first of all  DP changes. Who is this? DP, what happens on Chaturthi, Shakti, I will tell you. Also, I told you that you should not do this with sunglasses. You must have seen Banda standing like this, doing this, saying something sexy behind, expensive or something.  I have not taken the photo with many autos, it is good, normally it is fine, so with cars, it is not good with scooters, either BMW must be with it, Harley Davidson has been taken by someone or there is something at the back which will never be supported by anyone.  There should not be any support in the DP. You should have taken some kind of lamp or vehicle behind it. You should not take that support. Your DP should have some support without any support. Plants make a tour of barbed wire. Sometimes what happens is nature.  There should not be too many things that can be shown to nature, it is okay, at some point of time, change your mind frame like this for a few days, you have to plant it, and many people, thorny bushes, anything, animals, animals, this kind of thing.  You don't have to put it, it's okay, listen in the 10th, what is there in the ninth, don't put anything religious, many people put it, you are religious, your innocent is Shankar, your whatever is Hanuman ji, you are a devotee of Ram ji, you are a devotee of Krishna ji.  These are very respectable things, everyone should have them, everyone should shoot them, they are very very religious, there is no problem, it is not necessary to show it on DP, you don't have to, so hey, do you have to see it on DP? Keep it on the screenshot, listen to the mantra, keep it in the photo, keep it in your home, keep it in your heart, keep it in your purse, keep it in your purse, keep it in your story, everywhere, everywhere, keep looking at your DP the whole day, no one has gone to see your DP, it's that small.  Anyway, when there is WhatsApp voice calling, she looks very ok, otherwise nothing is visible, keep the DP there, do not keep it religious because it will cause harm, tell me openly, tell me, I will not tell, this is to please the wife.  You are saying that your wife has selected your DP so that other women consider you married, what is the logic, in some things I have not said anything, in some things I am saying something, there is a lot to say, okay, but I will tell you anyway.  I am there, ji band, judge, judge to see India, we say no, don't judge, we will be judged every second, ji, I am making videos, I too am a judge, how is he speaking, what is he speaking, who is not there, what is his age, how  what does first  What does he do now, what next, who is there, I search for myself on Google, many times I am curious, I cannot take anyone's name, with wife, with spouse, if you are taking a photo with your wife, that is your phone number, your WhatsApp.  Is there an ID, was it drawn in the passport, is it something like that, so how should it be, I am also telling you, don't think that your wife is my wife, why is there a wife, then what is the need to tell the world that she is my wife, is it in the passport, do you have a driving license?  But have you used Water ID?  Do n't seem to be engaged in anything. If you are alone everywhere, neither do you have to be alone here too. Why are you afraid? Why are you showing off? Have you ever been there with your grandkids, with your children, with your wife, with any of your family members? Don't draw anything with anyone. How should the DP be? Listen, in the DP, if you are looking straight and smiling, then it is very good. It should be a day time story. If you are drawn outside in the natural environment, then nothing like it. You are a person with less business.  You are a man like me too, so now my channel is there in my DP, you, the business people have to do that, they have to do their identity, then the photo is definitely not yours, it is my channel's, if it is going in the DP then  Bye men, this is my religion, my work is my everything, that is fine, so the one who has less business is a big thing, so if you have any business at any place or you have any profile link then you are showing it.  So that's your that to the next guy because the next  You have to maintain the same relationship with the person, even if this is my number, I suppose it is my public number, then now this is our only relation, you understand what I am saying, it can be so, but Idli is made normally like you do.  There should be a clear photo of you inside it and then what do many people do? It is not necessary to show your body with paint till the bottom, you should not show your shoes because pass this, what is more important, you know how to do this, you will also see patterns and you will understand that  Who  A man cannot show his face, it is a basic thing, it is a basic thing, it is okay to show his face, these blue pics also come, right, YouTube, if you send this on WhatsApp, if you want a video on that too, I will tell you, after this I would also like to tell you the status.  I am also an English line, people have to write, if you write someone's number in it, then something has been written in it. Many people have written something and many things have their lower level of thinking, they come from within as a youngster, some have said something.  And  It must be written that it may be anti-female, it may be a bit more like that, you are being checked, yes, it is not a deviant every time, many people are getting divided, you can understand that according to the normal ideology, even if you are there, it is not necessary to show it every time.  It is not necessary to show the place, many people are sitting inside with many opinions, by showing them you are not reaching the story, I am telling mine to the one who has opinion, everyone has belief system to make a call sound on Agri, that position is caste, I, we, resume.  More than DP after DP because that is your reality, no man will like it, no, what does it have to do with me, what am I supposed to write here, what is my system, brother, you are a human being, right? You studied in college, so you are in sixth form, now what are you today?  She is telling your DP that what is your thought process today, did you take this degree, did you ever get ahead in the world, what to do with that, it is okay that it was an experience, that too is okay, no one goes on Facebook, earlier Facebook was checked but nowadays.  so much Who has that much time, nowadays everyone has numbers as they are, add this, do it everywhere, confirmed this thing in interviews, the one who came out with this thing, came out with the first impression, many people are smart, the one who came out with the first impression, is called a thing.  Now, I am not talking about UPSC interview. UPSC people do not see the jobs worth Rs. 40,50,60,70,000. Whoever goes there and anything less is required to have a human child, basically to reduce it.  It is easy to know what kind of person does one want to have a child with. Advise brother-in-law is no less than you, this is the job you have to do, you have got a degree, this is what you have done, people have come for this post with degrees in different things and anyone will do because of this.  Some such specifics like your degree and college education are not applicable here, it is applicable as to who you are, who you are, this is decided by DP, that is visible, the viewer knows that yes, he has to see this, after seeing that, he forms some impression from it and gives his opinion.  write question  It is late, by asking those two questions, the impression can be wrong which was the initial impression but normally it never happens wrong. Okay, so it was very important to tell me this kind of thing, because the topic I am making is clear, such eyes are not found on YouTube. Guru ji, don't say number one, I am talking about clarity to myself, no one is making it, no one is making it, no one is telling me, I am batting from both sides, all three sides, from everywhere, I am telling you that baby, roll like this, your bowling will come on you.  There is a gap between the middle term and the next time, some leg is visible and the yorker will go from there, do it, you garden yours but this one is ideal, I didn't even know that I told anyone now, now I know.  Now you do n't have to do it, it's your choice. Now the one who is sitting at 48 years, 45 years or 55 years, it does n't matter to him, all these things are fine, but brother, transactions are happening for you too, you are also doing business. You are also giving money, you are also investing, you are also interacting, now if I have done this thing 10 times, then you yourself, now you start watching this video of yours, who is like what and what is this which I have done 10 times.  There are many more things mentioned but I have left it at 10. It's okay but this is a mistake. Seedhi Sadhu has become his own. No matter how mentally twisted people are, sometimes it is the opposite too. Show me the world is on the good side. Becomes Prominent When a person does this by showing a photo of his backyard, isn't something going on inside him too, that's why that photo was taken like this and his mother is trying to show it there because your mother is doing something, then you  You are showing but what I am saying is that by doing what I am telling you, you can change your mother, it works in reverse also, date it is not true, you teacher, everybody you do this.  Show this day is the best site, it is ok, so I told you how to be the ideal DP, Shakti, yours is ok, now please don't check mine, I get a lot of messages, my one is ok, you should look normal, the photo of your day should be from outside.  There is a photo, there are trees and plants in the background, there are some normal eyes, it is a good thing, otherwise take a picture in your park, draw a story in your garden as well, you are smiling like this in the office park, it is okay and not this, why with the wife?  no pull  You can ask your heart why you are not getting the position and also look at those who are with you, no, there is nothing like that, I have a lot of differences, I don't want to be judged like this, is it okay with my wife, tell me a photo with such a wife.  You have taken a photo to show forcefully. This is a forced show. You have taken a photo with a grand child. You have three grand children. What about the rest? People want to show a lot, this is also a fact, they are not such fools.  is people  Those who do their DP, show it on their status, show it on their outings many times, want to tease someone about how I am being cat, it is not necessary to show it on the status also because you have to show that you do not need to be loud, I will make a video sometime. Ok class, I have come to know that a person can have class even without money, if he knows the basic thing that this useless dancing is of no use, ok, so many people watch and understand, for now I have told you enough, some more day.  You will be in a mood or on some other platform or sometimes on a workshop, and Silo Psychology will analyze you as to what happens, then you all see, then after this you start seeing, dog, how is mine and how is the world, okay mine. How is that one, easily take a straight photo and put it on, friend, and I will tell one more thing to the women, if they have tax power, then I will tell the ghosts, please do a private consultation for the women, without makeup, a lot of makeup means small and fat.  If the lipstick is not working, then what program is stopped in yours, it will open, try it and then give me feedback again in the comment area, comment is spreading there, something like this, if you feel like this is spreading there or like this, then don't think.  Do it, but your mind has gone to sleep, why is it wrong to show a straight face? Question yourself why is the mother acting like this, why is the mother trying to take support of someone else, of a child, of a dog, of someone else?  a friend's car I also told the example with so much love that if there is no one with you in Aadhaar, neither is it in your passport nor in your water ID, then it is this date, it is your DP, your number, your identity, if there is less business, then your daily life is something less. Keep posting the status accordingly, people also change the status of the people with less business, this is mine, this is like this, do this, do that, I also do it, everyone does it okay but this is India, everyone is sitting here to do less, it should be done. shouldn't be done but it makes a difference"

It's not like today is zero and in three years  After that there will be hundred of them in a process, who is first  Housewife, you will have two options. After 3 years, I am telling this to a middle class housewife, there will be two options - sweeping and washing utensils at home, those who live in big houses, either do it at home if you are mentally prepared, or work outside for one year.  You will have to do something, it seems very painful, it seems very painful, I know that no, no, who will educate the children, it will be available, it will happen automatically, if there is inflation, you will have to take it out by taking off your saree and showing your glasses, okay, take it out of the house,  Work hard, earn money, will you study to earn or are you ready to broom and wash the utensils, do that now, yes I have been doing it, okay but this fear is true, you will see it happening in 3 years, if your husband cannot afford it  If you do not reduce it, it will not happen. This is the biggest thing. The second thing is that spending money on higher education will be stopped. All these fancy colleges and schools that are opened, money will be spent on them or on higher education. Middle class should realize now.  There is no use of spending money on this thing, it doesn't give any use to the money Start wishing for something at the age of 21 and ask them for money, that good education, best education system is over, this Kota will fall, this one will reduce the courage of the people, this ITF IT will reduce, practical will come and it will come, looking at the door classes. Because that bus is sent next to you, what was it earlier, middle class used to drive, even in their rare view, lower class was seen, middle class is driving, it is not visible even in the rare view, you are not even in the rare view  If you are visible then red red we middle class people are now in rare view and they have grown up like this and if you do not press on the accelerator or your car does not have power then you will cross one and you will be in a new state.  They will become lower class, by the way, now everyone has understood the definition, I have been making these videos for 1.5-2 years, these ones are fine, now other people are doing these videos that I am making, I promise you 3 to 4 In a month you will see articles on all these things on Medium and you will also see YouTube bros.  You will also get an off in this because the content is very less original and not original so you should be happy that it is telling you that you are hearing it for the first time till date by typing it the fastest, first of all I told the predictions on my higher education  If it will not happen after 3 years, then if you don't want to do it then you can still see it, those who want to take admission now, think about it now, okay, the third thing will be more focus on public transport, you will be able to buy your own vehicles and more for walking  The cost of running will go up a lot, so now when you buy or look at anything or think of living, the public transport bill will become very important and there will be a push from the government as well, more focus will be put on public transport in today's country year  The fourth thing that you will see coming is home buying, it will increase. The middle class bill will definitely be released. If I want to stay separate from the lower class, then people can buy a house of a certain size in a society because maybe these people cannot buy it right now.  Because they do not have leverage  The lower class has the same cash flow as the middle class but due to lack of financial history and lack of civil score, they cannot leverage it, so they can't get into the right place where the middle class can, so the middle class can realize this in  You are a three year old girl, only because what happens, nobody is coming in checking your bank statement, nobody is coming in checking how you live at home, what do you eat, what phone do you have, what people generally get you, where do you live, so  This home buying bill is increased brother, when you take the rate, if after reading your budget it becomes one crore then for that you should buy the one crore one, buy some red one so that it will be good later, at least I will tell the poor people  We will not say that there is relief in the society, this thing seems to be coming, now this and this inheritance money will also be spent quickly, you will get speed in buying assets, whether you buy their shares or buy banks, today I am telling you an education that I can see the trade and you are going home  Do that as per your wish, but this is going to increase in three years, this is going to increase the realization that so the only way I can say myself from being called lower classes, I get to a space where people from here must be middle class, cash flow is gone to hell  It will be seen that it will also decrease because these small families of lower class who have five to six people together and are living in a particular place, there is no shortage of their cash flow, the only thing is that they are not able to monetize it  By doing leverage it, because there is no financial stream, their financial history will also be gone in two to three years. The next thing I am going to tell you is that fifth important time, within the middle class, the divorce rate and marriage bill increase is a matter of pain, but it increases because I said stress.  There is stress in marriage when the housewife has to sweep or wash utensils or she has to go out to work, that is a comfort factor, I will talk about comfort zone only, middle class women who stay inside the house, do not work  There is a comfort zone, people do not feel pain while working in the sun, but the company needs, so comment, the biggest need is to comment on oil, our female participation is less than Pakistan, it is much less than Bangladesh, people have to write in my comment area. Bhai sahab, don't compare me with him, why shouldn't I compare myself with other students, there is a big problem in comparing with other students, many a times what happens in the class is that you think yourself intelligent but your marks are less than the weak students, so brother, I made the marks  Is it a fault in even telling this number, check it, google it, I am telling you wrong, throw the women out, why are you lagging behind them, this is what I am telling you, it will definitely happen in 3 years, it is a simple thing, so prepare mentally now Start preparing physically, start preparing emotionally, the middle class is a very large audience, please share, there is already stress in marriages and what will happen due to this, there will be a delay in the marriage as well and many people will not even want to do it because that stress will be visible marital counseling bill wickham  It's a good profession. I am not asking you to learn to earn your bread by exploiting someone's pain. I am saying that this pain and suffering will come, so for this, you will need people to guide you to overcome this pain and I am already in  You do this and I want you to teach this think if you are very happy now listen to a primal counselling workshop I will conduct which I think most of you should attend of course it will be a big deal because it is a cheap thing it is not being distributed for free it is okay but  It will be a very nominal price, those who want to attend it should subscribe to me in the comment section, there will be a lot of notifications, see what issues will come under this video, what opportunities are those issues giving, I am also telling you that and this  There has to be the next topic. Let's move on to the next one. Seventh, which is my topic, is on marriage. In the previous point, I said that there will be a flood of Democrats in marriage and people will not get married or will delay it. The next topic will be that, which according to me will have a very positive impact.  Expenses on marriages will reduce. Middle class should not become a Just Titan society and I am saying this for the last two-three years that brother do it, do it, but now this will happen in three years, we will not spend more than Rs 5 lakh.  50 people took photos, wore clothes, took the fair, he is not asking you to do a court marriage, do it as per the rituals, call a pandit, take the fair, take photos, do everything but the program that was happening was not there even for 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 lakhs.  There will be some useless dealings, Shobha ji, there will not be any, the child will invest the money again in real estate or some asset saying, brother son, you have got 10 lakhs, take it from me, take 10 lakhs from him, the payment will be made, take a little loan of your own  Look, I have gone back, got income tax rebate, your rent is settled, this is done, let's take out yours, such a famine will come automatically in the middle class, go away, not yet, the attitude right now is that the middle class thinks that I am rich  I am becoming a class because the forest story is not down  The lower class is catching up with the middle class. The lower class is visible in the car that is moving, but the rich class is visible ahead. The middle class is not in the rear view of the rich class. Your seventh important thing is catching up behind.  The thing that will happen and that is linked up with my first point about housewives, the school fees will come in a stage, it is not that the school fees will keep on increasing, they will keep on increasing, a stage will come when the middle class will also raise its hands, we What will happen if you cannot teach, there will be a change in the education system, I am doing a period now, my field is very big, if I can earn money from this, if I can use my mind, what will happen, see, physical retirement from school will always remain, I will make a separate video on this,  No amount of your thinking, technology can replace it, there is also a reason for that, but I will probably make a separate video, it separates it, there is a reason, you will have to go physical, you cannot keep it at home like a crush, if the mother gets to know about it, she gets beaten up at her job  If you go out then you have to send a story to your child to release his energy and keep him busy, so studies are also for seconds  Third means it will lag behind in the schools, okay but find the bill change in the school, as far as I think, the schools will be such which are not your Kiran stores with cheap fees like the bread and those ones next to it, some such mushroom  We will read multiplexes where schools are studying 50 100 50 100 but they are cheaper there by just two I mean there can be such schools as well I mean I am visualizing okay where there are only two classes it becomes ninth by doing something like this where  A big school will not be anything, it is the same, there will be such schools as well, you will do only 6th to 7th classes, this one next to it has 8th and 9th, here there is 10th, 11th, what happens now, if you get hold of a school and do that, then this kind of thing  There will be places where the fees will be reduced substantially and the government will have to do that or something will have to be done, otherwise the fees have become so high that these big schools will not be able to sustain the middle class and if the government does not do anything, then the power will not be able to improve the condition of the government schools. Either there is a lot of politics on this This will become a big issue in the coming time. School fee bill will become a very big issue. We will not talk about gas and gas and will not do this. There will be some attack on school fees, some attack on school education like the one given here and a lot of changes in the structure.  A big change will come, a very big change will come, a very good time is about to come for teachers, if you are a teacher also tell this because today the school takes away everything, money in the school means the fees are so high, the salary of the teacher is low, means IT  Something like the ticket price is very high and the hero and heroine because the teacher is the hero and heroine of the school so let him get the money, the producer is taking the ticket fee, I mean the movie ticket is kept for ₹ 1000, the hero is there  If the heroine is not getting money then the hero and heroine will also use their brain and that will be the eighth point which the middle class has to look at and work on, after three years the value of hand work will increase a lot, if you know how to cook then it is a big thing Learning to cook will become a thing if you see that India has a population of 140 crores  So if 20 years back there wasn't much survey and data on this but as an example I am giving SN observation, so if suppose the population in India was 140 crores late last year and 100 crores 20 years back then it was 100  All the people who were mixing food by cooking food for the population of crores, used to eat food, when the population of 100 crores used to eat, when mother made it, whether cook made it or maid made it, tea is available in the hostel, whether man made it, dhaba made it or ready-made food is made, today also brother-in-law and in our hands  Feeding these 140 crore people, what I want you to do, you have increased this by 40%. If there has been a population increase, then there has not been a 40% increase in the hands that cook food, there are many hands, women's hands, who don't cook at all, that's a picture I saw  Thi is Gunjan Kshetra, in that her father's dialogue is that did I ever send you to the kitchen, did I ever do this to you, meaning do not cook, the topic of clipping for the girl because only then she will become a pilot, I know many pilots who  I have learnt cooking very well, okay male pilot, even such things like flying itself and cooking is also not, if you can learn one, you can learn otherwise, it is also a skill of the hands, where I have to fly in whatever way I have to land, I have to do it like this  If I have to do that then I have to add chilli and salt to the food, add that too, so anybody I can cook well, can fly velvet also and I am telling as I do both, okay let's move ahead, other things are not a tailor's work  What a short thing it sounds like, it sounds like a lot, will you tailor it, take the suit, what are the current rates of stitching of Raymonds, you can go and check it, and what were the rates two years ago, 3 years ago, I monitor it like this, you can check it.  Check the suit, ladies, if you are listening, how much did the suit cost, how much did the modesty cost, what was the pant, what was the shirt, you check all these things, any hand work, even gardening is also a must, learn hand work.  The more people work hard, the more they do n't get depression  And the middle classes are suffering from a lot of mental issues and are going to suffer in the coming times. I have not written this in predicting it, even if there is no negativity in it, but this will remain, this will also remain and by reducing the pressure of hands, you can see anytime, whoever you are  You will do hand work, you will make bed seats, you will fold, you will iron, look at the press man, friend, there are lot of opportunities, look at them, you pay ₹500, you pay ₹700, you pay ₹10, you give 25 days of court, so what is the rate, write it down friend, and what was the rate and  From where to where the rates are going so this is what it bill change 9 point is mine entertainment is consumer bill change this movie tara bill is the last of the d star which Shahrukh had already forgotten I am the last of the d star this is like this to you  Film stars will be seen making trains on YouTube, that means I am telling you and not boasting but I am telling you that it's not a boss, people like me am saying this and not with an airplane, people I am at the value  Bill get more respect Bill have more followers Bill would send more rather than this film Tara film Tara you did not ask middle class whether it will release it because middle class said that brother I do not have time to do all this, my story is not going to reach through this aspirational Instagram Those which are there will be finished, Instagram will also end in India because that too is a lie being spread, it adds stress, no one lives such a life, I have seen people because I have to be in place where these fancy cars are dear  And I Kapp Singh people are taking photos, I know he is not there, you have to tell him that he is taking photos there, his voice is not his, you know the car is with him because he has to post it on Insta, so now these people come  This is how knowledge is explained, look at my car, look at me, look at my house, look at me and if you want to kill them, these people will also fall, people will not be impressed, people will be just impressed by real things, real conversation, real content, real things, middle class  Bill no should this wait who says it is a burden  And it will go towards clarity. Okay, now I will tell you the next tenth thing as well. There is heat as well, and I think again it is on this D butter. You must have noticed that whatever 10 things I have told you, if you look at it properly, tell me the tenth thing.  I am going to say that everything is happening but there is nothing negative in it, it has to happen for our good and the tenth thing, brothers and sisters, the discussions between religion and politics will end, it will reduce, it will reduce a lot, this game that is going on between politicians and religion, Your eye balls and brain are of a curdled caste, their power will fall, people will become pure, in 3 years the middle class has already started cooking, if it has not started cooking then there is something wrong, there is something wrong with you, people don't know whom all they are protecting, yes  You seem to be worried about your defence status. You don't know what will happen. Which party is it? What do you have to do with it? It is a party which is historically strong and will become stronger. The results will be better immediately. India will be in a very strong position.  And you will get the contract of India's head You don't need to take it, just tell me take care of yourself, take care of your children, take care of your people, take care of yourself, the country will automatically prosper, that old Karan Johar one, the one with families, that date think bill return par D  Middle class, I am very careful in living near middle class, using the word D, pass, not together, close, from society, tower, floor, the family will live here, the relationships will also be like this, we will do the same for our daughter, we live here, you also live here,  There will also be a trade pick-up because people and shed assets will be released in the middle class. If you have kept a driver in your two-three houses, then he is giving you a lot of utility by paying tax on each member because women are also working, this is also tax on mother.  -Fathers also need taxes, but they cannot afford it every day. So instead of keeping 5 individual taxes, you bill these three cars will be reduced. You will take each other for outings, you will stay close, there will be security, this will be there and those of the middle class  Kids are here again it's 12th trade ok from 12th trade  I will ban it, okay, the middle class kids of 11 to 25 years of age who don't do any work inside the house these days, they too will become strict because when their mother will be strict then they too will have to be strict, so they should start doing this from now onwards  Tighten up, I had earlier posted a video on 15 things that children should learn and do because these are the biggest villains and nothing happens to them and you will see them here in the future, they will come into the workforce and they don't listen to you, they are not in anyone's control.  We will accept that nothing is going to happen to them, the 11 to 25 year old kids who are sitting at home and don't do any work and due to which there is relief from stress on marriage, there is relief on stress on women, there is relief on stress on men as well because he is going out and working, he comes back  If there is an orderly house at home, then he would also like it, if the children's books are spread out here and there, the children do not take care of themselves, do not take care of their clothes, all of that will be made separately, again a video will be made on this thing, how did you like all these tips, please everybody  this welcome you copy dem is ok and it feels very good  This is because your platform is big, and if you have many subscribers then the message reaches more people, many times a person feels that my poem has been taken and the clapping is being done by someone else, okay at least I thought it is okay, I thought because the ISP gives you  There is no copyright equal to MC², there is no other patent, where should I go and get it from, these are the thoughts, yes they come originally from me because I observe, I observe, I talk to people, I see this is a professional work, this is my work, this is my work  It is not that my content has been outsourced to someone, no one else should write my content, I will write it myself, the content is written by me only, if you share it, this thing is very important, this trend in this, this is already there, if you look carefully  So this story is out now, what is called trends, some are at 10%, some are at 20, some are at 30, it has to go up to 100%, I am saying that in these three years, this thing which I told you about will happen.  you very easily You will see it and if you see it, then if you prepare for it from now itself, then it is like your teacher prepared you for the exam in advance, the syllabus will be very beneficial, please share it and increase some subscribers so that it reaches close to a lakh right now  So it is close to 50000, 50000 on the channel, so please help me a little bit, friend, okay, people sitting there are millionaires, they have to come to me to find content that is 540 times bigger than my channel, okay, and they have to come for clarity, and now everyone is telling about clarity, That sounds good but increase it a little I would like to increase it a little more if you are listening to me and want to proactively increase yours then do subscribe to the dog proactively here you subscribe there are only three-four people in your house all of you are one in your house  If you go to one page, then decision making will happen, it will not happen that it is father's order, it is father's order, then the children will also feel that friend, this is right, you will become poor in the middle class, it will happen like this  I begin to lower  I increase the productivity, I increase the GDP of my house, if the GDP of the house increases then the GDP per capita will increase, the house will increase, when the house grows and the family grows, then will India not grow, then is it not serving India, so please thank you"

    "title": "2 Stocks Which Are Recession Proof And Need To Be In Your Watch List [DTaAJbWkWpg].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, two stocks in the same sector which need to be on your watch list, we will talk about two stocks, they are not a recommendation you should study and we will talk about the sector and on your watch list, you should study this sector itself. Will do well but I came across two of these stocks in my research, so I told that you guys can also do research on these two stocks and after that what you will get.  You have to take the decision or your financial advisor tells you, then you should take this. This sector is G health care sector and the names of two stocks are Global Health and Narayan Hridaya. When this is being said, their price is Rs. 1240, Narayan Hridaya is almost this much and  Global Health which is a Medanta brand hospital in which their main hospital is in Gurgaon and also in the rest of the city, its price is below 1100 to 1080. Around these two stocks, if you are looking at balance sheet debt to equity, if you are building a hospital or opening a hospital, then you will discuss about that, then you can do it by looking at the balance sheet and all this, you have to go to screener.in and  By rattling like this, it can be told that RE is like this, this is like this, but here I am telling something by doing some scuttle butt, by doing scuttle butt, it is a phenomenon of its own, googling up is like seeing the future with your eyes. Indians are facing a lot of diseases in time and are also going to come. Life expectancy is going to increase. Health insurance itself is increasing and it is not easy to establish a hospital. Medanta has to acquire land when it is not seen as a hospital. I don't see it.  As a hospital, I see it as a great piece of real estate, say what, friend, you mean real estate in everything, it means stock, it is a hospital because look from the city. People will not go 50 km away for treatment. If anything happens in the city, it is a timeless property in the middle of the city. It cannot be created. All that is happening. You people will read the annual reports and do research. I am not that mature.  It is okay to give and neither is it mine to give, it is okay, it is not even according to the rules and regulations, for me there is a discussion on tea that there are two stocks, like someone tells in the newspaper, see, see, if you understand, such people, but I  what can you see  I am seeing a 100 Good brands are emerging, put both of them in the watch list. I think in 10 to 20 years, our population will also get old. Right now we are having demographic dividend.  Let's talk about the population of India being more than this, the percentage is less than 25, less than 35, whatever it is, brother, it will get older within the next 15 years and India will become a higher income country, at least a little higher income than the current income.  If there will be GDP growth then it will include these two brands, solidify of hospitals, rest of the brands are also many, you can check them out but like Narayan Hrudayalaya has made its own Insurance system has been started that if you give this much money, your treatment will be done like this, you do it like a subscription model, like membership of my channel etc., you will also be free, give this much money every month, then whatever happens.  If it is possible, then this is a very innovative model and Narayan Hijal is focusing on that kind of surgeries that it is done within 6 hours or 10 hours outside, not like this, it has to be kept for 10 days, there is no interest or money from the room.  It is making it cheaper to earn and it is becoming quite affordable. These outpatient procedures are called something and there are many of them. There are many such ones inside the small body that someone came and did something and you walk away, meaning off course, run away.  You will not go but someone took you in a taxi within six to eight hours or maximum one day hospitalization or did the procedure in the morning and out in the evening. This is a very close observation of mine, very much, I am not anywhere in this.  He did not bring the numbers but kept talking as if those programs are happening but this is the thing which no analyst will check because they are sitting in Mumbai or those who are analysts or youtube1.  How is medical? Come here, get this test, then go there, that test means it is a sucking job for him, we can do it in such a way that we can do it as much as we can, then what is the point in that, otherwise the man will go somewhere else or his  The brand name will not be that much.  It happens that friend, I have to cure sick people, I am telling about a vision, I am fine with the vision, think that I have to cure sick people, the off courses will not be free but I will not take illegal money from them as much as I will take reasonable money and  This will increase my volume, the brand will increase, people's loyalty will increase and people are innumerable in India. There are so many customers in India. The base is so huge, so once you have the experience, it will be a good experience. This is the truth of life.  If you have a good experience with a doctor, a hospital, a place and it is at a reasonable rate, then you are not going to try new stunts every time that it is not that restaurant, you should try that one. This time let's try that one. In fact, even a good restaurant has its own loyalty base that after trying two or four times, they come back and want to eat there. Okay, so this is it.  MC Seeing Coffee Brand Loyalty in these 10 hospitals, I am telling what I have seen with my own eyes, as there are many branches in Gurgaon, Narayan Hilay's is getting quite a few, Medanta has a different level, I think the market cap is such a sweet spot. This means how many years will it take to reach Rs 1 lakh crore market cap. If you are very young, it may take two or four years here and there, but the opportunity is big, what's I.  Want to tell it's a very very big opportunity which we are looking at and add them both to your watch list that is first second is read their last year's annual report and the way to read annual report is to read the oldest one then Look at the stories that were told in this one, the commentary, what was achieved, then the fresh stories that were told here, then what was achieved in this one.  You will see the pattern whether they are verbal or not, we will do this, they will do that, then come to their matrix, how much is the patient revenue per patient, what happens in hospitals, whenever new ones are built, the cost of making fixed assets is very high. Buying a hospital and building it, the equipment is so expensive, then bringing in that manpower is not easy, the best doctors, then the nurses, medical attendants who speak, then making the whole system, both within the brands.  I would like to praise the staff inside that I have seen, there is a sense of service, it is good to see that too, man, it is not like that feeling is not there here, okay, so that is my observation which I have seen. You people need to do your observation, whatever you see and keep watching wherever you are. If your next time, what happens many times, if you have to go to the hospital somewhere, then see brother, yours is listed.  What kind of experience is this because this is this experience which is why in everything I say no, do everything in such a way where you can have the opportunity to earn money only if you go to an OPD and check that man, this is just a little ask on this floor of Ortho.  Let me tell you the method, do you know that one knee replacement is being done for two lakh two and a half lakhs, assume that the procedure is okay, what is happening, how many become like this, earlier there used to be so many nowadays.  So this much is done, okay how many are done in a month, okay, I am making notes like this, I am telling you the method to check, then you know the total, now you will go to each one and do this much, it will be more.  Also comes out but generally what is said, everyone has to taste some vegetable, rice has to be cooked and raw, one gets some idea that how much footfall is there, how much cleanliness is there, how is your experience, medical tourism is happening, you are seeing African countries.  From  Even from Pakistan, people come and go for treatment because there is medical tourism, so there are people coming from outside, it is not like if I talk about Medanta, I come to the field, it is not like only the people of Gurgaon come feeling ashamed, the world has come, you have  I have seen that big leaders also come and if anyone has any problem, then study both of them very well. Your problem is with numbers. I am not telling you, I did not even tell you the market cap. I just told you the price of the share.  The day the video is being made, the share price is this much, then let's see how much it will be after many years, but even the market cap is not telling, neither return on capital employed, nor return on equity, nor book value, nor debt to equity, nor any annual report, so hard work.  You have to read the reports of at least one year. The minimum is very old. These two do not have much history of even 20 years but if you can analyze the chart then it is very good. If you can't do it yourself then make a little chart. Ask the person doing the analysis and he will get an idea of ​​what is happening. So apply a little technicality, a little fundamental and a little common sense. These are common sense videos. Okay, so I want to make such videos. I do n't get confused every time. Want to do it because I see a lot of popular financial influence like Akshay Srivastava ji, come every day and tell me 10 stocks, okay every day, sometimes say bye, sometimes say sell, sometimes buy again.  Sometimes sell again and then say I depend on you and this and that. People went crazy in the comment section. Now once you reach 20 lakh subscribers, everyone's mind will be crazy. What can I say if the stock increases?  I told it was by ghat jaye to bol it was sell by sell by sell by sell by this aa I am not kidding people will say no condemnation because datchi raha hai in making finance channel because man  Can't make it every day, can you tell me from where? Now I have told you two stocks, these two stocks are good from me for the next year too, they are good for 10 years, so there is only a limit, can you tell me, come today, you should.  Buy it today you should sell it today Hey brother, try building a hospital, this is what happened today, brothers and sisters, do you want to build your three-storey house in a good city? It is not possible to build it in a good city, there are 50 rule regulations, it is costing money.  There is no labor, it is not easy to build a hospital with that kind of equipment, what is the equipment, it will be expensive once it comes, then you will not buy it again, you should not buy the ultrasound machine, in the beginning there is capital expenditure, then money is money.  After that Babu Bhai, it is okay, that means look at his model, once you have taken those good doctors, doctors also become fat, you are a good doctor, like doctors R means one who has a lot of skill.  It is set like if an airline takes a pilot then the plane cannot fly without a pilot because you cannot bring such a person that 10 people were flying the plane, now 10 people are not found like this from anywhere, pilots are not found like this brother, doctors are also like this.  Those who are top doctors are more expensive than pilots and are more in demand and pilots are rare, so still go and train somewhere, but a doctor with 30 years of experience will take 30 years to come.  It seems okay, you are understanding what I am saying, what would be the age of a 30 year old doctor, 23 24 25 26, if he is 54 55 then these 54 year old doctors are the same as the 50 year old ones, they work till 60 also.  It happens to him for years that people say that he is a good doctor, Rajagopal is such a good name, he is very famous for ortho, so now I have to get treatment from him only.  If the name becomes like this, when I have to get it done from him, then brother, now the hospital that keeps him is the rock star, so he is not the one there to get the operation done, you will go to him only to get it done once you get it through word of mouth. And when there are so many brand recalls that people go crazy about the doctors themselves, it's like, brother, we have to have him in the picture, the picture will not be made without him, otherwise that's what's happening.  It's my personal observation and it's all scuttle but let's say it's all. What are you seeing in the numbers? What are you seeing in the technical analysis? What is your risk reward ratio? Where are you in the portfolio?  Everyone has to decide, you all have to decide, then there is a request to those of you who have taken these stocks or on these stocks and if you have any extra knowledge. Please please write in the comment section because if this video works then I will make more videos like that so that we go with the combined knowledge that yes Guruji, we have also taken this one, I am also aware of this thing, you are this only.  I told you that my experience is like this and other people will also see it like this, I will also see it, then everyone will learn, then in the future, they will bring some other stock like this, slowly again.  It will become your watch list. Watch list is very important for the stock market. If the market has corrected, then what to take now, what to take now, brother, if you had some stocks in your watch list and you were ready and you had that price.  If you touch then now you know what to do, then this is a method, it is a very simple method, so put both of them in your watch list, do research and understand about them and if you have understood some extra, very good thing, in some good way.  If you can put it please  Please do subscribe to the channel and like it in the comment section. You can also take membership of the channel. On this, I have included very basic and very informative videos on the stock market. On the membership page, the members will get those videos. It is very good about the stock market.  There are basics which do not even have the idea of ​​basics, they are very well explained and mental models are embedded in them, it sounds very high-fi but those mental models which  Charlie Mangar's are famous models, I taught them the way by doing Indianized version and complete desi version, but perhaps no one in India has told about the examples, so my examples are famous in their own right, if you people know then do watch that too.  If you can afford it, you will have to watch the membership once. You will learn everything in the time it takes to watch a web series. There are so many videos in small quantities.  In quantity, 1520 is one, 15 is 20 and there are many more, so membership bill is very highly recommended and you will get it by pressing the join button. If you don't get it, then you ca n't see the join button for me, but for everyone else, I can see it.  Is it okay, otherwise you can do it with a non-i phone or you can subscribe from a laptop.

    "title": "5 Things Middle Class Youth Can Learn From Akshay Kumar [fDkcoFJnMYI].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, very interesting topic, five things which we can learn from Akshay Kumar ji, we will discuss about Akshay Kumar ji and let's discuss five learnings about Akshay Kumar ji. Why did I make Akshay Kumar ji? Recently, you must have seen that it has been a long time since his picture flopped.  Flop pe flop pe flop ho ho baring oh my god if you look at his previous 1015 movies all have been disasters the makers have suffered a lot of losses so they need to learn something  We will try because most of us go after success stories. I have brought five things which are the things that go wrong after becoming successful. You guys tell me, do you agree with all five out of the five, which one did you like the most? Please write that.  Which was your favorite one that you will apply in your life, it is not necessary that you are in the film industry, if you ever go anywhere in life, the first thing that will be there is productivity, which we are used to, we used to tell people.  That I do pictures quickly, I remain disciplined, I wake up in the morning, I do this, it is not necessary that it will translate into success all the time. Many times, what happens when a person becomes successful, they ask about your success.  What is the secret? When they are asked, what is the secret of your energy from a top leader, then he tells you anything. These days, many a times he says that not biologically, I am divine, but it is the productive power that I have.  They focused a lot. Some times it does not work in a creative field where you require time. There will be times when you are doing certain things and it will take time to do high quality things. Those who chase timelines every time are not necessary.  The product is that good and that becomes the reason for not having a connection. Earlier, they made toilet, a love story, shoe string, a picture with a budget of 18 crores, earning 225 crores. This is what happened to them, not what happened earlier, it is a 18 20 25 crore picture, it used to earn 100 150 200 crores, now the reverse is happening, it is a 100 150 200 crore picture, it is earning 18 20 25 crores, so there is a change in the whole story. I'm telling this so what got him there won't take it you further because now that  People have to realize that the audience behavior and what your clients talk about or the ecosystem of your industry has changed, so this is one area of ​​yours, second is not the second thing in this which I will point out is not changing with times, first is productivity.  Cleared Not Changing Win Times Your age is above 50 52 53 54 55 Their age is above 22 Pairing up with 30 24 25 28 year old girls, they don't understand, some times you will have to know this thing also a little bit, and your audience has changed, all this is Indian after Covid.  The audience has got an exposure to high international quality content also and our own OTT content is coming very good Apne Pankaj  Tripathi Manoj Bajpayee, these are the actors and there are many other small actors in it. Okay, this is Subhendu Karke, who is from Mirzapur, Guddu Bhaiya and more, if you are different, I am not able to remember all the names. There are small actors too but.  They are very powerful actors and suddenly it is seen that no one even knows how to act, they are in the same tone as their Prithviraj Chauhan Aayi Toh You Could See Prithviraj.  Chauhan, you could only see Akshay Kumar on screen, so not being with the character is the best thing for the character, remembering his character and asking his name, who is the actor, like Jaideep Alabad ji's name does not come immediately but  That Hathiram is fine, which character did he play as a policeman or whatever characters he did? Remember from the name of the character that it was one of his Kareena Kapoor movies which was released on OTT again.  His name is not coming to my mind immediately, I know, I know, I did something but in that he did a good role of Teacher Ji or Teacher Ji and along with Teacher Ji, he is also the other actor who played Tyagi in Mirzapur.  Chhote Tyagi became Big Tyagi Vijay Verma Verma I think that Verma is ok again the name is not remembered like that but the character is remembered so if it does not change with the changing times then we should also change in life. Third  Choose your public image and public friends very carefully. The way Akshay Kumar ji did Pro Satta Pro Modi ji interview and all that, he got rise with him when Modi ji became popular but brother, it would have been the opposite too if you had remained separate.  So things were different in your own way, independent, that toilet was in your hands, a love story, Padman, social subjects and after doing all that, everything went well with them, after that, the public was satisfied from there too, and the public was satisfied from here also. So this realization has to come that we do not have to get carried away in life, that we have to go with the power and we get carried away, okay, so this was the biggest thing, the fourth thing which I would like you to tell is that this thing is portraying a deflating image, depending on money. They have portrayed an image that money is not so important for them and they are very health conscious and they take up women's subjects. In fact, if you see them, you will ever go to the cinema hall to watch a movie.  If you go to this ad then you must have seen Akshay Kumar's pad wali na yeh teri 0 mein, such pads and tu fu fu fu like this, he has done a very good ad, that means, although I really don't know why she comes because it is cinema. Such an ad should not be seen in the metro, in the hollows where you have bought a ticket worth Rs. 1000. Yes, in small centers you can show it, but if that ad is still there then people are showing it. Whichever ad it is, after doing such ad, you start doing Juba Kesari, then the image of one conflate goes, you cannot do both the things, you have to hold on to one side, you either see the image like I talked about, like Modi ji.  K sa association, either Kangana got runway, brother, I have to become a politician, I have to become an MP, Kangana ji's picture is not becoming a hit, a similar program happened with her in 'Choose Friends'.  That if they have caught hold of themselves, then if they have caught hold of them like this, then if you want to go the route like Kangana ji, then you can go, it is perfectly okay, but it does not belong anywhere, it should remain like this and the fifth very important thing is that it is for everyone that whenever there is success in life.  If you meet what is called one, the going is good, then again do not go back in emotions. To shine your public image, come together with the ruling party, like they did with Rs 25 crore when Covid came.  I think in PM cares etc. a lot of that Band Baaja Baaraat was made, I had done it and I broke my investments and done all that, now look at this you people will say oh no, it should not have been done and after doing all that it is okay, no one remembers. This is learning, that image was different at that time, it is a different matter that for 25 crores, you may have got tax rebate by paying 10 crores etc. but still the money is gone, 15 crores is still okay.  So I don't think that by withdrawing it from my savings because the going is good, now it is not good, now their pictures are flopping, the government is not coming and standing with them because of the losses they are incurring that you had donated a lot.  If you have paid a lot of tax, then it is you, it is your children, it is your life, now you don't know how the children will work out, how great it will be, where will they get opportunities, then never enter into this and say no, don't donate.  What should be done is just do everything, let's talk about practical things, rest of the acts, they have also done something, everyone has done it, so it should be done, but this is such a donation that you cannot even see that what is happening next. Can be avoidable? It is a bit against science, it is practical, it feels very bad to speak publicly or not, it should be appreciated for that, where is the appreciation, people do n't even remember, people don't even remember and  If the trollers will still troll, then a lesson will be taught for them because the calamity will come again, then give 25 crores, then give it, put it in this fund, put the fund there, put it there, someone has been martyred, someone put this cause, take it as your own.  Even if every person sacrifices everything he has earned, it will not mean that India will become a developed economy. Everyone has to do their own work, they have to do their own work for their family. Earned money with a lot of hard work, worked hard in the morning and evening, everything is done.  And if you don't know further, then this one is my personal favorite, so this is the fifth one, if I want to take learning, which one is your favorite among these five? Please do tell in the comment section. Like and subscribe the channel.  If you want to take membership then you can get the key for clarity, you will get exclusive access to many workshops and webinars including mental models and basics of stock market.  So you can definitely take membership by pressing join button. Thank you very much."

    "title": "A Big Difference Between Doing A Job And Own Work Explained [HhY8JuSycUo].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, when have you seen my videos on Clarity's YouTube channel - Jungle Ka Sher and Zoo Ka Sher and Jo by Date, today I want to tell you a difference that when you do your own work or do someone else's job.  The basic difference which you realize only at the age of 40-45 years when you have reduced from B to 1 year, will be your journey for 15 to 20 years which everyone is discovering but I am telling you this.  I am telling you in advance that your war may have taken only two to five years. Basic difference between both the things. Now if you understand this basic difference, then you are going to benefit a lot in this, whenever you do it, even if you have a government job. Even if it is a private job, it is okay, there are more jobs in private, I will tell you with its example, for government also, you can extrapolate it to mother, it is okay, Harrod, see, whenever we do a job, something or the other is sold, it is a product. Even if you are working for the company, there must be some product or the other, whether it is your service, services are also a product, you are providing some service, you are solving someone's fear, if it is an institution then it is a company.  The startup is that system, that setup of which you are a part, that part is given to you by attracting people and less is distributed to you and you make it in the wheel or wheel in the English, that is the part of the D.  the game is fine  So, as you move ahead in life, you may be changing companies, your posting may be caste or transfer. Now I am speaking the non-official language. And here, if you change city or change company, then there is no stickiness with you. You earned the love of 15 clients, they love you, they respect you, they give you a good opinion of the company because of you and they become repeat customers but because of you and you void their increments and you take away their bonuses.  You got his variable pay, this would be your promotion, you would have got that, you would have benefited but you have moved ahead, now that stickiness is not there, you had opened the bank accounts of 15 people, someone had got demat accounts opened, you are doing a job, what happens in your income?  What is going on in your life is your slow study pace in the beginning but that is your snowball effect. In your life, ₹ 100 is reduced, ₹ 1500 is reduced to ₹ 1500, it becomes ₹ lakh, those people join me now and  Is there so much here for anyone? You are so practical here, you can give me your example and see for yourself. Practically, I got subscribers on YouTube, I liked the content, I joined, so I joined, this platform is mine, I have less of it now, as long as I remain conscious, intelligent and wise for as long as I live.  Hey darling, it's okay, you make something that adds value to people, the stickiness is the stickiness, the one who has been following you for 10 years and liking you, you have made an impact in his life.  If you have provided some service and added value to his life, then he has always been a good and new person, but when I am not like that and do not realize it in the beginning, then in the beginning it seems that it is not my promotion.  It is happening but that which becomes such a big figure after some time, which is called compound interest, it is compound interest when for you there is simple interest and in simple interest and compound interest, all the stories are heard, that is all the stories. Whenever you did something, you did talent, I too, after four-five-six years, you left him and did something of your own, initially he would be one man, then he would be two men, lady, whatever is fine and then two, five, 10, six out of 10. Very Happy and Satisfied 400 Find Value Six Were With You Atlist No Six will give you further reference in life and if people join you then that is Jagannath Chala Rahat as they say and  IF YOU SEE LATE I WILL TALK YOU NOTE ON NOTE ONLY WHEN AND TWO LOOK DIFFERENTLY IN YOUR COMM LIKE YOU SEE THE POLITICIAN'S ALSO THE POLITICIAN HAS STICKNESS, THE FATHER IS ATTACHED, THEN THE SON HAS GONE, THE DAUGHTER HAS GONE, THEN SHE ALSO IS A MINISTER.  He is becoming a minister, people already know that he is stickiness, the whole party roams around with a tax water bank, BJP is more today, Congress is less, but when you see the votes of Congress are like zero.  No, you are walking with one caste, if he has reduced it, done it well, done it big, but he has done it, but what I am trying to do is over a period and time is there, people are with you when I am not in this thing.  We don't discuss these things because what is this when I do it? Yes, I will definitely get the date, we will get it, but one thing is certain that your snowball effect will never be that much, it will pass and the stage will come once you acquire the date. You  Have Restart Inflation Point In Life B D 35 36 Ka Aadha Ise Sweet Aadha Do You Know Take Date Leave From Doing When Sambadi And Doing Your On Think Date Because From Start Man Reduces Because What Happens It Whenever And It's Hint Also  One URN, when you keep the numbers of everyone with whom you have good relations, the number has changed, the mobile has been reset, what should I do, its date is the day after tomorrow.  Regarding You On Date When Which You Did From Us From Date Institution Today One You Do Your On Think He Bill Be You Happy You Joining Only You Don't Have This Number Because You Never Thought Like Date De Way MG Guru Ka Kam Market Template Dena  I have to kill it myself, it looks less, I have to do it myself, exactly how to do it, what to do, tell me after doing it, sir, I will tell you through some baby R or someone else.  We will also give you exact templates but I am giving a hint here. Here I am giving you a hint. You have reduced the number of car salesmen. If so many people have come in the car, will they never buy a car again in their life? You had their numbers, you had everything, you had everything.  But when your mind is set, employment is set, then when you start your work, then people do the same, then consultation with me, brother, where will these customers come from, who did I think this is?  You are 40 years old, 35 years old, so our 10 years, 15 years, 20 years, when there is experience, no one has you, no one knows you, does not know you, I was a very employee of D Math, what happened after I became an employee of D Math?  The data goes with the company, the company has the stickiness and all those images, all the phones, all the numbers, they go with you but Happy Birthday Discount Offer Buy Again from the company. They keep sticking to the loyalty bonus and you keep changing, the employees keep changing, if someone from below you is with you then this is a big difference, you are doing the same hard work but when you are doing it for yourself then it is happening for yourself because  For yourself, as it is happening, you have seen 80 year old Bittu's tikki, his chart, his samosas, no som samosas in Rohtak, now they are som samosas, so speak in such a way with the one who can reduce the labor.  The caste is gone and it must have changed 100 times in the last 40 years. Dad is the father, if he is the next one, it happens everywhere but people have stickiness, who is the father's name? Grandfather's name was the next ball.  People know but people know that brother Rohtak has Som Samosas and there we have something there, that stickiness and brand bill note come in the date when you are there but the relation.  Else so who of you am listening to me am am the subscribers am following me am the like d content aapko aate some stage in your life you bill have you switch over and make yourself a brand small brand only koi pehle day atabh nahi badhni apke up  In Bihar, the normal oil and detergent, their local brands are giving competition to your big FMCG whose heroine has come in advertisement.  I am telling you that it is a matter of numbers, it seems like a small brand, but if it is a small brand, then you are taking small money and for small people, this brand is a little different, for some system, every friend is one.  It is necessary, I am just giving a hint, I hope you guys are liking it, understanding it and having fun, it is very important for you that I told you this thing, remember this this is a very big difference but date then means date.  you start here ho  It is possible that you did not do a job and in the beginning for 24 to 30 years you were busy in Sticky Next which I heard in English, then from Tiki you reached thousands of people in just 6 years and you worked for 30 years. Till the age and 6 years of job experience and even if you start now, you will reach thousands in 30 to 31 because you will realize that for 6 years you were not doing the job after listening.  You were doing everything plus your experience comes and you will be able to serve him things with more butter because now you know how to speak, you know supply chain logistics, you know how money works or you have also done a job. Know how to do a job through the department, know how to reduce the bank of your department only by doing it like this, what is the point in doing a little like this because if you want to reduce your own tomorrow, then two others should also reduce.  It should happen and there you can know with great love, yours, how do you do it, how does this happen, how is this Bharat, everything is possible, but what do you do, you are the one with the employment set, not only you, but you don't even know about me.  If you want to do it then you are just engaged in it yourself, I will tell you this thing in the upcoming video, how did you like it, tell me, this is a very good journey, the subscribers of the channel are increasing but the request is that a little more is fine and like and share.  Thank you"

    "title": "A Big Mistake Which Youth Is Making In Their Conduct And Communication [uW_Cd0HAq2A].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, I will talk about the one who is fighting a mistake in conduct, because perhaps no one has told you, perhaps I will be the first person who has told you this thing so openly, because many people get trapped in political characters and you are making this mistake.  If you are then you are lodging and big time and many people I have seen doing because I am in corporate time in training I mean you selection interviews mentoring guidance many more less  I am fine and I see a common mistake in it. I would like to tell you all and listen to it carefully. Those who understand it and enjoy it, those who will follow, then write and those who like it, the rest, if you are in a mood, then you can do your work.  From your side, you can take your own example and tell us what you have done by doing someone else's and that is the typical North Indian problem, it is more in North India, what do most of the people do, they call uncle to some, uncle to others.  Uncle Uncle, you will reach the story from him, you will not get a reply, you will not get a job, nor will you understand, the day after tomorrow, I am telling you about the mail, or by the way, the day after tomorrow, we put 'g' in front of this sir or Guruji or his name and 'g' in front of the name. You are also facing a lot of trouble, so take his name, the name is simple, it is big, it is spoken in America, picture, height, this is my height, age is above that, age is that, do that, brother, you are becoming English, you are becoming more modern.  It's okay, whatever you want comes out of you, if you have caste, don't worry, there is no problem, but keep doing it, uncle, uncle, do n't enter into anyone's privacy, now speak about it, it is not our values ​​in India, tell me the old thing also.  I have been here in India, if you ever walk around like this and tell someone your uncle, you are giving us respect, you are not giving respect, do you know, you are entering the question base. Fear are people don't want you to be and uncle because they are actually match under your father and just a little bit older than you and sa and if they are they don't want you to be related to you you come from date social creation and something dem  Note B Very Comfortable You Kant Ko In D NDA Image Which Small Lions Which Are Lying In Good School College Good In D Sense Modern And Expensive Okay  Now, are they modern, expensive and good? I yes, it is like that because these are classy things, I am telling them for the sake of those who will understand, those who are getting angry in this, it has been happening anyway, I am not getting anything, you are right, intelligence. Chetan Vivek wakes up again, the story is nothing, neither is he getting a girl for marriage, nor is he getting a job, nor is he getting any money, and everyone knows that you are my uncle, my uncle is my dear, Amy is doing like this, then it has nothing to do with it, good manners are visible, no one told me.  This thing to you and you tell someone else  Saying like this, you are like this, you are like this, keep roaming in your attitude, keep roaming, keep roaming like this and one day again you will become an uncle without having this attitude also, talk to someone like I am trying to understand. So I am telling them to make it big, it is okay, it should be made big and the improvement is done by making it bigger, which is butter because from whom you want something, want to know something, that is your guru ji, Guru ji has said it sir.  If it is not there, then live in front of his name or does he have it, say hello, write, write, say, many people like me, my friend, you speak Sango, tell me an example, it will be for everyone, but you cannot enter his private space, when you go to America, boy.  It is not like this when we go there and call someone uncle, he will try it like this, after going there we do not say tu tu and here I also tell about Haryana and the people of Haryana have more love in our hearts, we also have special love for the people of Haryana.  The people of Haryana are looking for private jobs and begging for this thing. Left and right personality is very important. You just came from this because that's what is happening with these people. I myself make fun of English people and accent, so date is this extreme because  It is not necessary to be very or even English but it does not mean that its opposite is rude is n good think very means rude like this  Now that barbarian has said to the villagers like this, yes because they are less, we do not want to do farming, if you come to the city then people have shown it big that there is something in living like this, the story will not reach, you will win one and a half or some award.  There is a show on TV, like this your mission will be done there, this kind of attention has made that ₹ 100000 ki tere yaar ki gadi hai, it has come like this, people take lot of pride by doing it like this, I don't remember all the songs but  some ears  Sometimes they enter in, there are also such types of undertakers, do it amongst yourselves, it is a language, if you are a Tamilian and you come and speak Tamil Tamil in this accent and in normal Hindi speaking, then it is bed manager man, you can speak.  A Language Which Ideals Can Also Understand and Don't Do Too Much Yes Everybody Including Myself and Other Bodies Cannot Escape  Everything will be reflected in the pronunciation. It will be reflected directly in the voice. The butt will shake. Don't force it. You are understanding it as it is. We will not force it as it is. We will not forget it. We will take pride in ourselves. Take pride in the language so it means a little bit. Now if you understand this. Addressing women, I am giving you an example in my own language. You must be saying something wrong in your language to someone from Bihar, I am not targeting only people from me. Area, I love my people very much and Saree is my people, right now my Guru Tattva has got a little place, so I will increase it a little but I am talking about it as an example because maybe if I take the example of Haryana people, then the people of Haryana  Do n't be too angry because even I have n't been there because nowadays you have to be a little like this too. Okay, not too much, do a little political, so I will tell the story and but this is applicable every way, it is applicable on everybody you.  Have you come, you are neutral, think, learn, address people, if it is a woman then say whatever their name is, if you know it, you are not forceful, sister ji, today, if someone is going to take a job, you sister ji.  You say me, madam, say whatever you feel, if someone calls me madam, then it is like madam sir, if you don't say madam sir now, then even if a man is like me, then he calls me Guruji, it is okay, it is fine if you  Madam, you don't want to speak, in which setting you have to talk accordingly, everyone can't say women like Uncle Tai and Sorry Aunty Tai, Uncle. Well, on the lady's side, it is more clear to you that a man cannot be called brother, if I am you, then you are.  If I am there then give me yours, I am coming for you, you were taking bananas, give me your uncle, no no Usha, if I am not there, then I am not, then I will only be with the one whom I belong to, because if I have a relationship with those who are actually mine, then whose I am.  I am in a relationship with him, I will keep him for him, how can you take him away from me, just by saying to me that no one will give me like this, I will get irritated today, will not give anything else, I am telling this and even after doing it personally.  I am taking out here, most of the time 95% of the time I am correct in the address Rahat, but if you because I have seen people being around and they are forceful, you go and call them, Uncle Uncle ji is the Prime Minister of every person, then it would be a big thing, that I  I told you the extreme example, but you have to have something to do with all the people below that, that is why you are addressing them, you are not even giving them something, you are actually asking them, you are demanding something from them, so when  If you are asking for this, then it is his personal space and he will allow you in that space. When Salman Khan comes, he is older than the ghost's uncle, so you know whom to speak to.  So many people who speak this Ford type, they also know that if they don't speak in a foreign country then I am from this address, this is the address, uncle, you are not uncle, you also know that you are not giving respect, but when you  If it is pointed out, don't say respect. If every man in your life is an uncle, every man in your life is you, then think for yourself, how are you living your life? Can everybody be like a date? If that element is there then  Then she will employ you, he will make you sit on his neck, he will support you, feed you, he has done this, you want, you can do this, this is a discussion, this is mom, this is my uncle, this is mine, say like this, this is what some politicians do in dreams. They have a different agenda or reason to seek votes. In real life, where you have to interact with real people, there is a formality that keeps you there. If you want something and don't want it, then why are you interacting with them? So  If you don't do this and you don't forcefully correct your language a little, a little, a little, in your local direct, there are a lot of foreign people, even then it is global, so much of it, bill travel, people travel in foreign countries, also because of this, it's a fact.  It is not that you speak English, people from outside have to do that, I am not saying to forget yourself, but whatever address you have, keep it for your family, do not come out and walk across any color which Because there is a lot of difference in what is said within all the colors and many jokes can be made in this too or there can be a problem, there is power, in Haryana it is called uncle, it is uncle, uncle, my uncle, in Punjab, exactly on the border, there the child is called child.  You say cake oh cake, do it like this, in Punjab the child is called cake and the next border is taken out of the stomach of this one, taken out of the stomach of Punjab, in Haryana 66 they speak differently there, so it is not necessary to know very far, if you go to Bengal. Dada, this is considered brother, it is okay, so Dada, if you come to Haryana, then Dada is not a normal Dada, where is who, what is the meaning of whom to keep, brother, the national integrated diversity is very high and so much there, if you take mother, take mother, if you know the language there.  Even if you know its real meaning, even then there is no need to forcefully enter. Ultimate Jane, nothing is happening, you are feeling like I will tell him big, you are my brother, so friends, I should speak like this. You are my brother, no one is anyone's brother, there is no other brother except the two children born to a mother from Shivaay. Cup this relationship and find their address. You are like my brother, you are like my sister.  My mother is the way you are, you are the way you are, you are uncle, don't do this at all, don't do this, cup these emotions, have you been so strict in your original family or did you make this much and forcefully make the small town people adopt this as your local language?  Have you learned Hindi? If you are born in Hindi, then there is no great thing. When a Tamilian has to learn Hindi, it is a matter of clapping. If you have learned Tamil, then it is a big salute to you, my friend, aren't you? Language People.  TAKE PRIDE IN KNOWING VOTE KNOW WHAT IS SO GREAT IN IT IF YOU ARE BORN IN HARYANA AND YOU NEVER KNEW ENGLISH NOBODY WAS CAPABLE OF SPEAKING ENGLISH IN YOUR ENTIRE FAMILY AND YOU  Picked up English and you can speak decent in of English and ghar mein jaake aapke jo ek ek greater kar raha ki english kar raha tu ke kar raha date is not tu be taken date is not something tu be appreciated bhaiya ladka hai here  He was born in Learn English Date Is Suppose You Be Celebrated You are not seeing any sign of someone coming to Haryana or someone in UP or even in your story, it does not mean that it is the opposite which I have  Someone has learned English, someone has learned English, someone is speaking English, someone is speaking some other language, there is a little bit of culture, there is a little bit more, then its fast because it is made, this is very wrong, now the extremes are different because what is it, first of all  People were suppressed that they did not know English, English itself was different, everything was different, that too was wrong but it does not mean that she was here, so now by going here it became right, not learning language, talking in a new way, improving communication skills.  Buttering things Understanding global language IT can not be ridiculed You are wrong to go from this extreme to this extreme Tree you learn things If you want to learn a little at a better level then you can join the Webinar Info Group Comment  It is written in the area that you are subscribed, I will make these things a little better for you guys and I will tell you what all the physical things can be put in an actual inside the mouth.  Due to which, if your age is like this, then a little bit of that may happen, no one is wrong, genetically, due to some reason, eating or drinking will be like this, then someone like a singer, he also does something of his own, so all these things are considered to be something big in him.  It is not a matter of keeping it at this level and keeping it full time and traveling in selfie low from inside because when you are not able to communicate correctly you go heavy accident you people do something like this then take selfie from inside.  If there is a stick and you get angry, then you have shown it to him by doing something else, I am like this, you will say like this, do this to your father-in-law's house, do this to your mother, it is okay to say, I will do this to others, with love and with a base feeling. And while doing flowers for you, I am telling you something politically correct, people are going to read such a code in the video because if you go and add chilli to someone, then why do you have to speak like this, he will also come and add chilli, it is it, it is backless.  So it happens, but just understand from where it is coming, it is coming from lot of love and affection and sincerity brother, do a little something, it is not a big bad thing, it is not necessary that you use some words, dialogues and English, whatever.  We learned its bonds, we can learn because of us, do we have to live only here, we have to talk to people, we have to tell the story, nothing else, learn and talk, now your direct someone will learn, learn and understand like an international audience, so that  Advise is very important, you will get involved in identity crisis, I have seen it, I have seen it behind the car, I have never written this till date, you write what you have written, it is okay and I am late for the test, everyone's list is in Haryana, Delhi.  And here, although Bye Dr is a challan deducting thing, it is still written on the vehicles, What have I not seen? On the vehicle, I have never written till date, Sharma Bye Aggarwal has written, 'It's a relief, it's okay, why did he write that it's a relief, I have n't seen it till date.'  address and  I am telling these people about myself, let me tell it openly, how diplomatic I am, it is being said that everyone has to go on their own, Jat point is by Gurjar bye Yadav, why do you want to write a party, I have told mine, the people below should speak again.  So why did I say why do you have to write that brother, the car has come, it means you have gone to the match, Ghani, it must be a big thing, why is it necessary to write, which one is the first, meaning you want to get intimate, what does it mean, what is coming out from inside you.  Yes, see this, name it, which one is next?  The person in saree will tell you just by looking at your face. It is okay to take so much pride in taking so much information and there is no need to tell the information. Write it on the account as well. Write it here too. I hope some of you people are not big enough.  Mother, because I have to make it bigger, I have made it bigger, so that if it becomes bigger, then tell me a little bit, so that it becomes bigger, so that next time I don't do it too much, but I wanted to make it bigger, I have to tell this thing with great love, friend.  if no one tells then no one  Told that you are being in sync, if the people around you are not saying anything, then I do not mean that you are getting a lot of appreciation and this food thing is going on in the social media and a lot of them are saying that they are so intimidating.  It's no color, your friend, this is yours, this is yours, this is not a color, even Haryana has no color, this is yours, this is yours, I belong to you, I feel that it is not checked by asking that this is yours.  Bavali Bachi  Hai Ye Isi Dikhe Saare Ke Sabre, their songs are known now, Ragini bhi hoti hai achhi bhi hoti color bhi hota hai, Date is important just because of you, Tum apni language mein kuch gaana bana Dog inki aayi also hoon Belong tu date language and date color  And date community I bill come in appreciated beat a both both good food prepared what has been made story meaning chori thrahe ho story are you talking like this brother Takkar  You are killing the story, you are becoming a friend, you are behind everyone, you are running the story, you are doing this, brother, all this ear catching is not an elderly person, some body needs in the community, so comment, think, apply, I really don't know. Below in South India, there are different casts, like we are taking an example, even if a play is happening there, it may be happening there too, now I am all from the Sari community.  I ca n't take the contract of the society, I can come and tell you the template, can you give clarity that brother, if it is not yours too, then you need you tomorrow out, it must be happening in South Indian also, their vehicles are also raised and there such songs are being played.  I am going on, this is happening here too, because of what happens, sometimes the video is made long because you give an example and tell me why you did not tell it, I did some review of a picture, I said man, this is fine.  There is so much noise, okay, why didn't you tell that to the other one, it has happened here in India these days that if you want to say something good, you have to make a 150 minute video, first tell them all the bad things.  You go brother, take the signature of the one who wrote in your hand or in your brother's hand first, then I will sign it. Well, you will do it only when I will take everyone's name, then I will remove everyone's name, then I will remove the name of the car, that has to be bye.  very big  The thing was, you know madam and Guruji, now you are changing, you are changing quickly, artificial intelligence is coming, you will have to raise the question, if nonsense is going, then write it, so that such content creators know that I need to be more emotional.

    "title": "A Big Secret Of Job Market In India Revealed ｜ What Is The Future ？ [tSHwXToctZU].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, A Secret of Job Market and Future of Jobs in India is going to be a very amazing topic, only some secret will be revealed, there is no click bait, you will not know this thing, I am sure because this is not a cut copy paste thing, from the original observation.  The thing has been revealed and you tell me whether it was a new thing for you or not. Like the channel. Subscribe to the channel. Let me tell you in the beginning that earlier I did not speak nowadays, so people do less and like the topic only.  So let's start first, what is the secret, then we will talk about what I see next. The secret from this secret is that this 89 10 11 12 hours job is done everywhere, here if you calculate genuinely, hand on your heart.  Most of the work in the job is done for three and a half to four hours, not more than that, if you are waiting, the conference has not started, the presentation has not started, the boss has not come.  Okay, you are chatting yourself, taking a break, now something has been told, now we will do it, now we have taken a sleep break, now we have taken a tea break, now we have lunch break, now all these things are in between and that work remains spread out in between.  Maybe at some point of time you may be thinking but actually if you audit the work on a daily basis then there is no work for more than three and a half hours or it lasts for 10 hours. Many people are happy from within or not.  this is not work  You are doing such a good job. The secret is that this structure has been designed. Ask yourself, why has Luminati designed this 8 or 10 hours? The organization that runs the world is not really in the form of a human being but is an energy.  This whole system is running, why was it designed? You think you are winning, you think these employers are idiots, these people running the system are not idiots, why is this same thing happening?  Will not happen in the nature of jobs which I am telling in the coming time, there will not be so much of it, you try to understand what I am telling and we have to go there because this is the thing I am bringing out to you today.  People will also understand, everyone will understand and we will reach that place only, so why is this being done, this is done so that you do not miss time, if you miss time then you will be relaxed, then you will get what you want.  No  Because if I take out these five hours from your forest, I mean you think that I am the person who is running the world and he is a trained person to teach under the example like a Guruji or a teacher is trying to teach, let's.  Ajum, if you do For example, there will be a mixer, it grinds the chutney quickly, the taste of the one used to be made by grandmother is fine, but a mixer and washing machine is fine, it is also needed, isn't it a matter of time for all the things, a car, a fast car, public transport.  All your wishes - booking on mobile, saving time, Sugi Zomato, just imagine, if we have only time in life, will Sugi Zomato work? Tell yourself, we would have done everything on the premise of time. This made us.  It will come or keep a maid for dusting also, do that too. If you have time left in your life, then for the sake of economy, as you are listening to this video now, even while listening to this video, people try to do it at 1.5. Don't watch my videos, even if the sound gets louder, you wo n't be able to digest it. You are not going to reach anywhere by saving time here. This is life changing for you but our focus is on saving time everywhere. Always and that focus remains because in reality our time has been stolen a lot. Earlier the pace of life was good but first if you go 100 years ago the economy was not fast and we are sitting comfortably. The gravity is falling and it is being discovered. Today's work is not easy, there is no time, if someone does not have time, then the relationship is not working, there are relationship advisors, there are marital consultants, there is astrology, why what will astrology do, that too for you.  It will help us in utilizing time and energy. We are going everywhere where our time energy can be saved and that is the premise of our time energy, brothers and sisters, because we are stuck in the job only, if there is any genuine work in it.  If it is for four hours and tell us some genuine work, it is a defined work and you come quietly and leave after nine to one. If you are far away, then you don't know what many things you can do personally in life, but this system will collapse.  So that is why your 4 hours are spread over a period of 10 hours. You will come in the morning, there will be a meeting, then there will be a break, then something will happen, then you will be called at 5:00 in the evening when it is time to go, then the work will be given to you. Feedback will be sought at 6:00 pm, then what happened to it, then when you reach home, where will you get the mobile, there is no need of energy, I am not going to come and speak, I am divine, I am biological, but I am this. I am saying that I have my time, there is a lot of time, even after that I get bored, there is so much time and so much work gets done because I don't have to work for anyone else, I have to do it for myself, so future.  Off the jobs is coming out from here only. We will move to gig economy. Gig economy is what we call plumbers, carpenters and electricians. This is gun money. Getting paid on hourly or project basis.  To meet according to the time or to meet according to the work, I came to install these two fans, this much money to install the fans, this much money to install the AC, this much money to clean the AC, this much money to do the plumbing work, the tap was leaking, how much to fix it. Money will become like a doctor taking money for consultation. This will become the nature of jobs and this is where we have to go and prepare ourselves. Those who are thinking to themselves, I will get settled in one job and will get a job.  You, Mijbil, I prove through my webinars workshops that if you pay Rs 60,700, Rs 1 lakh, Rs 5 lakh, Rs 2 lakh, Rs 2 lakh, then the amount increases a lot. Rs 2 lakh is also a very high amount, but a salary of Rs 1.25 lakh is not enough.  This is how you can earn your equivalent money in India. We have reached here and I am proving that in 30 days so many people can earn so much.  That work, this work will get 00,300,500, such people automatically become agreeable and if someone talks like this, then the nature of the jobs will remain the same, this one will go to the economy and that will automatically.  Are set up on a job and will be very measurable in their quality of life Please set up yourself or we have about five years more the moment we cross 4 a half hour  Capita GDP, which is currently at 2400-2500, will cross 4500 and go closer to 5000. All the work will be done like this and the jobbers will cry. Doing the job will be like the work of the poor, which as we say, today we call the poor as gay workers.  They are maids, carpenters and plumbers, they are considered poor, so whoever is in the gig economy will earn more money than the employed girls, tomorrow after 5 years  Would like to marry gig economy people, she herself would be a gig economy worker and that project could be anything, like me, you are writing for something, I will tell you a small thing, you go to a hotel because I have taught you this work.  I have done it, I have also taught you, I am also a foodie, so I ask you a small task. If you go to a good restaurant, if you go to fine dining, then you must have seen the menu there. Something is written in the menu, the name of that dish. Below the name of the dish, those three to four lines are written in English, These are true things cooked in this with this sauce and giving you this, I do these things, I have also taught them that brother, after reading that, people will feel like it, why?  Why should the waiter tell you what is in it? Write it like this. In writing this one, it is cooked over charcoal and deep cooked and done this and softly and that. Not in English but also by artificial intelligence. Maybe I don't enjoy work as much as Guruji would have taught me because I tell you how to feel, that one will be your Lachcha Paratha, about that also Mint Pudina Paratha is cooked in this, those three English lines will be there.  It is always written in such a way that it is a big task to tell him, there is another big task when you open the menu, the dishes should be from expensive to cheap, they should be random, how come the veg should come first.  Where should the non-veg starter be written? How should the dessert be written? How should the rotis be written? The ₹ one should come first. The Rs 80 one should come first. The rice should come first. This is the work of the brain. This is the gig economy and one gets paid for it and this work can be learned. Can and no one is teaching it in any college, is it being taught in any college or university, no no, they teach it, tell me in which school they teach it, they don't teach it in hotel management, I came there also by mistake, there they will teach everything about food.  Put this, do that, and the waiter should come like this, the plate should be hot, in winter, it should look like this, and the cutlery should be kept like this, they teach all the things, but they do not teach many things, these are the brochures printed on real estate, I am in it.  The one who for the first time guided the builders that why do you put these pictures of British people, this product which is beige, till when will you do this, then two builders listened to me and said only Indians, I said why don't real people put up ours, then people with such faces will remain ours.  I have put up photos of those foreigners, your caste racism has not gone yet, that girl must be fair, she must be swimming like this in the swimming pool, you will never see such a girl in the project there, but why are you selling me?  Why don't you sell it like this fat uncle is feeding his grandson with his fat belly and teaching swimming? This is real isn't it because if the second generation does n't get time to take a dip then who will teach these things and even the money for it?  see you  This is gig economy, you get paid, you are following, you are following, advice is practical advice, whatever happens, stay as you are, you are such physically fit people, they are jogging like this, I said, such fit joggers, yes, people will look intimidating.  If I go and say, half of your people don't buy out of fear. Do n't know how many HiFi people will be installed here. People will remain like this only. We Indians are the ones with fat stomachs, strange poor, our looks and jogging.  They are doing it like this and they are not running away from the trade mill. Those who are running away from the trade mill are the tenants, the youngsters, the poor landlord, the one who has earned the money can never do this work, the country itself is like this after destroying the body.  Money is earned whose body is not his money. Okay, so the one who is fit will be the tenant, so I said to the tenants, you have to sell this property, you have to sell the property on rent, then you have to sell the property, then this is me.  I am telling you on the example, what can happen, how far can the consultation go, I am telling you about the economy and the future of job, there is a great need, they would have learned reverse marketing, it is not working anyway, Pralad Kakkar, one of my  You get inspiration from this and learn from it. Well, what works in India, there will be many such things, there are many jobs, I am bringing these things for you people first.  I have also brought, becoming a user is also one of them, take the membership of the channel, learn and withdraw some money, if the school fees of lakhs have taken you nowhere, then by charging fees within Rs 100, they tell me, it will be beneficial or not.  If you join, then before asking for pizza he asks 10 times whether it will be good or not. Before watching Lahaul Singh Jadd, I had asked Aamir Khan whether it will be fun, if he doesn't come, what will happen, don't come again, I am saying, it is fun, people say.  If you are interested then you can take membership. Workshops are currently planned. In the comment section you will see plans on many things. Tell me on which one you want because it is a possibility. The recording of my pre-marital consultation which you can watch is two and a half.  The price of the hour is decent, it's ok, they can buy it, I keep it as expensive as the pizza, people are making money from it, a consultation from a thing worth Rs. 80000  000, you get peace in your soul, what can anyone claim more than this, 30 questions and going on, people's shops are opening because if you prepare for the economy, then in two to three years your shyness and hesitation will break and you will take money from people.  Ask brother, give 00, can I tell you like this? Yes, you get it, you will start getting it gradually. At some point, people are like this too. When is the fan set in astrology? Brother, this is India and I laugh like this, you can do any work without astrology. Guru ji says, we are just giving you money. I said, friend, I mean, I am laughing at this thing.  You need money for everything, but brother, people in India can earn more money like this, this is what I am saying, earn it by doing Shik Shik Shik, I don't show much things, my production quality is not that Shik Shik Shik, so this is  That's why people are me  They say no, you should do education, Akshar Srivastava has done well, Warik has a team, this is it brother, you do not have a team, this is not it, this is why I am teaching you this because do not get intimidated, before this, he is my second.  There was a sofa, it has changed, now you see something else, I am tired of sitting on the sofa, so now I want that wooden chair, not that good one, that proper one, the good one, I sit on this one, and sit on the other side.  Brother, when you started hurting, sitting on the hard sofa is also good, you have to make videos, you have to think, you have to do, so now I have changed the location, I hope you are not missing that sofa, I was missing it because sitting beyond that, no.  It was said, sitting here, initially no sound came out, okay, a lot of people have complimented me on this painting and what a wonderful thing this is, brother, this instrument.  By doing it like this, you will get happiness, peace, prosperity and money like this. Do you know the science? Is there any science behind it? Then these people die. Explain science to them, then physics and chemistry and then the man says, why should I explain it to you? What is the benefit to me? So what is this?  I feel like telling you it is a very soothing thing, it has a lot of design in it and it is a very expensive thing, it is ok and when I bought it, it was very expensive and now it is not available at all, it is of this level of quality.  It's a nice thing and learn to be happy. The most important thing in being happy in life is to understand things as they are, not you know thinking that they should be as per what you like, life will work as per what will happen, how can you get rid of all those things.  You can bring prosperity in your life. Do n't despair. If you don't have a job then it is a good thing for you. You don't need a job. Now tell me. If you are not getting a job then what is the best thing you can do? Teach others how to do a job.  Be Practical Na Be Practical Go In Places Were Nobody Is Going Like I Said How Many People Are Competing To Write Menu Of A Good Hotel Agar Aap Bolo Me I Know I Will Write Aur Woh Khan Market Me Achhe-Achhe Wale Ho Na Delhi Mein Jao Restaurant  This is the soda water bottle seller, this is ours, look at that, what is written about it, ban maska ​​and cutting tea, Iranian tea, this thing, dip in this and that, Parsi.  Something is written in the language, they look like me, brother, this is what I want, this is what I want, this is how, this is also called copywriting, this copyright is not an art in India yet, there are many outside, many people have taught me but.  This dozen works because it works for those who are from outside, now the people of India are different, we are a little different, so we need a local person like me, someone who can teach us, then I will teach you all these things also, I will tell you.  It is okay for people and we will tell you about these things separately. These are all practical things. If you get all this knowledge about small tasks, then this gig economy is the future. Brother, wake up in the morning. People joke, what have you become of Duggal Saheb today?  It's fine with me, Duggal Saheb, today it can be like this, you can take it as per your wish, one by one, each person was teasing me or some acquaintance, you have to earn money.  Like this Bande and earn money in Haryanvi Na Banda means you just say anything and tu to hi hi namaskar I said very good then I said come camera lights action you speak then only released that even he can't bond I said see you bond also  You can't even speak. If someone else has to put you down, then what is there in India? People will come here to put you down. Hey, it's very easy for you, it's very easy for you. Hey, whoever is easy, you too.  Learn it, I have come and told you not to do the easy thing. I have told you to do the hard stop, which picture was that stone broken, mountain broken, do the same thing again for the whole life, so this is why can't you learn easy things because of that.  They will learn all the things which are not being taught and which have value in the market. This data comes again and again on 51 people are only employees.  49 Are not employed force data out Indian education system is bad Education system has to be fixed Why brother, no one can fix the education system, it has to be revised every time because the world is changing so quickly, you learn it here, right, you get education.  If the system is fixed then your competition increases. It is always better. Be practical, the government of the country will get tired. Modi ji is there, Rahul ji is there.  Akhilesh ji, you system is useless, then it is a good thing for you that no one has any education, everyone is talking nonsense, you have learned something right, now you have an advantage and you come and teach the knowledge to the people.  If you say so, then friend, you are a practical man like India's India. Brother, I have only one thing missing in my life, that is time.

If you give a page of newspaper, then you keep it with respect. The smooth paper that comes with it, the free one from Mussoorie, goes in the dustbin because it has no use.

Yes brother, there will be a speaker, there will be good food and drinks, there will be some event, then after that everyone will go around taking each other's numbers, the problem is that the network is yours only for those whose valuation you have done or have come in direct contact with or have done any good to them, that much  You have a network where you can roam around with number 15005000  Are you doing this nowadays you know you can get numbers, there are many such systems, just give me the number, give me ₹500 and take the number for ₹500, there are many such systems running, there is no benefit in doing this, genuinely they have to do it for your retirement. If you add some value to them, then only it is your network. Going to networking events is full of hardship because everyone has come there to build a network. So everyone will say, okay, give me your number. You can do something for me, I will do it for you.  I will do something for you no one does anything for anyone when both of them have to get something done everyday for their own benefit you bill have to make it harder they feel that this is the benefit when there will be some mentor, there will be some guru, there will be some guide, there will be devil  Here charge consultation fee and they bill you have some course and you have to do something but they say something in return they add value to you that you will see nothing will happen in free fund went everywhere took email id did cold calling sent email yesterday  dali i want you to come with you sir i Really like, you did it like this, what is he getting the benefit of, in this way he doesn't have to spend any money, he wants to do it for free sir, I want you to do it for free, but why do you want to do it for free, will his brain get tired, his network does it  What is its modus operandi, what is its algorithm, for this he wants to ask you people, it is not that long ago, from where the network has definitely run, there are many benefits of relying on it, but the solar approaching long inside place which I find  This LinkedIn is overrated, no one is sitting there to do good for anyone, everyone is sitting there to show themselves and many times what happens when you have to do a search, there is a LinkedIn profile, if you want to know about the job like I  I note on the link carefully because you want to share knowledge, if you want to share some great thing then you want to show your great thing, I am here, you have done it by setting this, then if you add any cherry, then look at it, if you add any cherry, then let me see it  Still it is of no use  That is your vanity that yes I have followers, you are doing good or not, is any good happening to you and all those who are in LinkedIn want a job of their own and if they don't have the strength later then there is no point in putting this X, everything is for you  they are moving ahead with the help of crutches and that system is such, if you ask directly then you will not know, brother it is not like this inside YouTube, in the space of YouTube because if you are making sense, although here also people move ahead by doing a lot of things  Yes, you know that I was an ex-founder, this business did not work out for me, this business did not work out, some businesses did not work out, now my business is running, I will teach you how you should do business, I am Hari, so such people also  You are using it a lot but what I want is that you don't eat the paste on your current form, how is your current form, you cannot eat the paste bread, you were a very good cricketer for many years, how you used to hit choke sixes, that's it, you even liked it a lot  You do n't have any idea, now you are not imparting much knowledge because if you don't have communication skills then you cannot become a coach  Maybe someone else is becoming something else, you can also see in the cricket team, the greatest batsman is not becoming me, I had to tell him and understand how his natural talent was, so network when you are to network install fight and fifteen intelligent individuals In whose life you can add some value, who can add value to your life, don't do this, waste of forced time, waste of brain juice, don't run after people, not them, someone will do good, some person will do good to someone  Friend, this is not going viral on social media, there are so many sites like LinkedIn, in anything every person has his own agenda and you have your own flag, if those agendas are matching then a win-win situation is happening which is called rose  Okay, otherwise if you think that from the point of weekend, you can catch hold of someone with a point of strength, either he/she is your brother, relative, friend, reference or he/she likes you, if you have good luck then it is a different matter, otherwise normally nobody is going to you help you is d message to  The butter in this is that you will have to try it, spend money and try it and eat it, this one said it is useless, this one said it is bad, someone will tell you the right thing or you can take a little juice of each and make something of your own or you can get something from that also which is a lesser thing because  The thing about less has been told so much but your less will be this much in it sir, nothing can be exactly yours because if there is variety of audience, someone is taking this out of it, then that out of it and someone else is taking this out of it  If it is being taken out from there then the date bill depends on what you want to do next but date hard work bill be brother IT bill not be straight line life story done event got 100 marks and you got it out very good this thing soft  A lot of money is going on in these networking events. The organizers of these events earn a lot of money. I also get offers to speak. I know I deliberately don't know that if I have to go then I have to pay the fee. Then I will buy that item.  The number type has reduced, you come and do an item number, take money and tell the public something like this  There is no roundabout stickiness, my sticking is such that if I am trying to make a profit and I want my benefit, then you should be directly asan pradhan, what is the need of you, what do I need of your platform, so whatever will be the right thing in your life  There will be proper networking and everything, put this filter in it, okay it is not like that only the organizer is going there, you are just enjoying the cool breeze there, a five star or four star event is happening, you are getting some food and  They waste a whole day of their life and half of the speakers there, I also attended the event, I had to speak and I would like to speak only in English, Artificial Intelligence, Oh my God, by showing slides in English.  And everyone comes after doing this, I said friend what fun it is to come, I mean it would have been better to sing a song here, the one that Tamanna Bhatia is doing with Rajinikanth, it would have probably been more entertaining, which is happening today.  Meaning, if you are wasting so much time then it will not come and you have to give that event by taking good money, it is not as if it is free  It's fine for you, you give money, you eat and drink, if something happens then don't waste your time in Dehradun, he tells you things, in such events he has a friend, that ship is above mutual funds, tell him about the work, you come and do the same IF  You will invest in this with this and this bill will happen and you will do this setups these six packs bill will come in these days okay start singing like this and do this means you are seeing like this friend this much qualification so much  It is sitting here that we can reach it means okay I am not sitting with any qualification and like this and confidence English full style complete court type and wear it well speak good English and the audience yes brother even if you are not able to understand everything while listening then it is good  The people who have come after paying a lot of money are going away and then they see this again and again and then they get disappointed because the money is being wasted everywhere like this 500, 1000, 350, 5000  There are rates here, okay, they say that the sarees are the same, this is not practical because after attending 5-10-20 shops and spending 10, 20, 30, 50 thousand, you feel that the story is not like this.  All those who are doing events, they are doing events again and again, they are just working for money, again and again. Okay, we will teach you how to become rich. Okay, we will teach you how to become rich and we ourselves will become rich. Okay, this is a practical video of mine.  It is one, if you have seen that you make one crore in it then the work that you know is simple, it is not easy to look at, what I told in it, if you have not seen the video then watch it, but it is not a cut in it, how will the government get the clearance How will the rescue come for it then what will be the problem in it, oh brother you will have to do that, how much easier is it in India, if you want to earn 1 crore rupees in a month, then life comes out, that too is through networking, in a way I am not talking about network in marketing  That means I told you how to get a job outside For this, you must watch the video which is done in between the people, if you haven't seen it, if you haven't subscribed to the channel yet then do it, practical things will be told and you will definitely reduce practical things in life, but it is not easy, it is so simple. You will also understand the difference between simple and easy, it will happen in your life too. I will give you a small example, for losing weight, eat less food, do more exercise, there should be calorie deficit, weight will start reducing, this is very easy  It is simple, it is a simple rule but it is not easy. So whatever my content is will be very simple, I bill not cleaning it, rest of the people, Alam Balam is going on in the market and many people are involved in it, so I said once You guys should give some clarity in this aspect, please do this every time, check one or half of every cricketer because it is not necessary to eat all the rice whether it is cooked or raw, even a little bit can be found out, okay? You can make your notes and find them  Your day after tomorrow is the best thing for you thank you [music]"

    "title": "A Dating Advise Which Will Help Young Indian Men [MWNnOxV5t6g].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, a dating advice I want to give to the boys, main dating means it is not like that of the British but like dating is also done in India these days i.e. boy and girl, roaming around, eating and drinking, hi hello hello boyfriend girlfriend my girlfriend, the advice means about that.  If I am giving it then I am giving it to the boys, girls can also listen, it will be beneficial for them, if the father is listening then tell it to your child also and it is very important, very wrong.  What are they doing and what mistake are they doing and then they cry later boys I tell them what happens is a boy if you are a person who is in the range of 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 you get pocket money  You have a job, you have a scholarship, you have anything, you must be doing something at the age of 22 to 28, okay, that is your actual status, this is yours.  Let's accept the status, this is the proposal, okay, now what happens you start dating a girl, did you meet somewhere, hi hello, gone are the clothes, these days children walk around wearing such a joke, tell me how much money her father has, this is a fact. I am not too judgmental on this matter, whoever wears whatever, it is okay, everyone should wear it. If you can wear it, then it is okay, then I am not being judgmental beyond that, but these children suggest that they know it, right?  Their status is this. Now I am saying this as an example. If your status is to take the girl to Sagar Ratna restaurant then take her only to Sagar Ratna. Do not take her to something higher by investing more money or doing something other than your normal comfort.  It is out of context because it means that you are shy from within. Whenever you are going into a dating relationship, the first thing you should think about is whether it has any future or not.  One night stand is not a job, nor does it mean dating, you have to go, okay, that is a different trivial useless job, so you want whether it is a girl, a woman, a colleague, anyone, and in many cases, you see.  It is said that like my colleague is a girl, she also works in this office, this is also her status, this poor girl, her status is also this but this is a match, I do n't know where he is taking her, now she also says, take me brother, okay.  is showing something Is feeding, giving drink, giving anything, then don't do this. Man or woman should not feel ashamed while bringing a girl into your world and if you are feeling ashamed then it is not a good system if that girl comes into your world.  Once or twice I went to a restaurant with you, said Hi Hello at the level of your friends, Hi Hello at the level of your house, came to know about your colony, which house you live in, where you are, and after that she bit her hand and found out that she was not there.  for you  I came to know from the very beginning, but you are crazy about the dimple on the left cheek, you are crazy about her curly hair, one strand comes here and you live like this, and beyond that, you have spent too much, okay, get it from somewhere and then now  He is smart and all the girls too, now he will tell her, not today, not tomorrow, but the day after tomorrow, how long will you hide, it is like these pictures, one has to think that yes, we were fooling like this, how foolish we have become.  Even if we go, the smell is coming from a little boy, he is wearing good clothes, he is also speaking English well, but by doing this and that of the society, one is behind the other, the system is different, I am not being classist here, here I am among the poor and the rich, I am speaking my brother.  If you go beyond your limits then you will be met with sadness. It is a fact that it happens only in movies that I have to play poor poverty, Papa, I have to go there and then Mithun Chakraborty is dancing below like this, we are also respected and disrespected. We poor people have such a friend, he was in the pictures once upon a time, I thought, today's youngsters do not see that, we had seen that at some time, okay, but is there no such system or not? Whatever you may have, it may be your sense.  Off humor is good, your personality is good, you are a multibagger stock and he is ready to invest money on your horse, it can happen but you tell me which horses belong to which stable, it is necessary to show you, I am not Arabic.  I am of the breed, even if it is not of the Arabian breed, the horses may be good, but your local horses should be there, the local horse also wins, if you get a good jockey, then it wins the race, it is not like that, but you do not need to force it, that is what I am trying to do. Because You Will Set Up For Disruptor Right From The Start And Relationships That Are Built On Deception From The Start And There Is A Requirement For Mass Adjustment Is Where They Fall Apart  There are relationships which later on take place in marriage too. As a marital expert, I am telling you that will always require adjustment. Best of the best. Married as equals. Same family. Everything is fine. Even then there are daily adjustments and conflicts. But brother, when and in that also.  It takes a lot of effort but if you have done all this then it is much more. I am going to teach this very easily to brothers and sisters in a two and a half hour workshop on 30th March. Come and learn. Because my relationship webinar was in great demand, it is the end of the month at the time of financial year ending, but there is no such fee, your fee is like a small pizza, if you are interested, brothers and sisters, write R on the number given below, R is for relationship.  You will be informed about the process of registration. For that workshop, please come. Otherwise, I am sad here. That girl left after breaking my heart, and the girl did not leave after breaking my heart. You have lost my status.  There was something wrong, I invested so much money, then who told me to invest the money, I made you spin so much by using me, what are you going to do with it, you were making it spin only, what do you mean, what investment was it, you will get that too on 15 rupees in mutual fund.  He says, read the offer document carefully before investing, I am teaching you the offer document, read the offer document carefully before investing, we have not read the offer document.  What's the matter these days, everyone is fooling around like this, book a bike somewhere, borrow one, take this, take this, now some ute is coming out, some ute is fine, it is from Haryana, his father is saying this.  That his car was borrowed, he was roaming there with his own cars, he is sitting with so many lakhs of subscribers, so now things come to light later, you know, the lifespan of a lie is not very long, you can fool all the people a few times, you  can flower fu  People all the times, you can't fool all the people all the times, Baba, it is not possible to form these relationships easily and well, it is very important, I am a doctor of relationship, I will explain, I will tell you, personal consultation is very expensive, if I  There is some very rich man and brother, if you want to have a lot of money as it is called, then take it, but it will be 40-50 times more expensive than the fee of this webinar workshop, so attend this, test this.  Try it, okay then why go beyond that, then one on one treatment is done for you, but come here, learn the templates, learn your own behavior patterns, the day we come to know what is our status in the market.  If we go then many issues related to relationships in life get resolved, mostly we both boys and girls are in misunderstanding, the more misunderstanding one has, the more unhappy one is, it is okay and in the long term it is okay when  If you are in misunderstanding in 2425 then it feels like the world is at your feet and something like Rajni dirty world is at your feet, this is the feeling of Rajni dirty world at your feet but as age increases, whether the girl grows or the boy grows, then the boys also grow up. I have also seen here that I will address it for girls because relationships are women for both boys and girls. Don't think that boys have to be given separate knowledge. It is very important for girls because boys. If your parents still get your son married by saying that it's done and the boys have few requirements, the girls are waiting longer and are missing the trains, then if you are 31, 32, 33 years old.  You are also getting older or you are going on that path or you have an elder sister and you are feeling that if I don't love her then how will I be then you must attend this workshop. Subscribe on the number given in the comment section or visible on the hashtag. Beyond that, you will be on WhatsApp only for 2 hours, it will last for two and a half to three hours, queries will also be answered, interesting and good things will be told and it will be told very clearly. It feels so loud to end.  There will be fro and it is all worth it, the fee is ok, you can imagine it will be as much as a small pizza, thank you very much."

    "title": "A Decision Making Formula Given ｜ Use This Template [pRzj00P5ltI].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today's topic is a very specific formula for decision-making. I am going to tell you a trick in it, the decision making process will become a little easier for you. Whenever you are not able to take a decision in life, an answer is not an answer.  No 16 is for that matter, be it for marriage, for job, for buying a house, for investment, you can write any number of other decisions related to this, but there is something in this.  There is a condition which will be discussed and what is the condition that whenever a decision has to be taken, we can gather whatever information is physically possible related to that decision. If I have done it and there was nothing more which they can know. Get To Know And Still Am Not Able To Take A Decision Answer Is Not To Know What Normal People Make The Mistake That Now  They start asking people They Never Know What Is This How Life Will Throw Things That You End Even in Jobs Who Have Higher Salaries Ever Dare Will Always Be A Situation When There Will Be Complete Guarantee There Will Be No Meditation, There Will Be Falguni, There Will Be No Sounds, Everything Perfectly  It will be crystal clear, if it is so crystal clear then the decision making will happen. Whenever you get stuck, it means that you are afraid of making a mistake in that decision and with the amount of information you have, your mind is not able to process what should I do.  Or if I don't do it, then I am giving a key formula in that, whenever there is such a situation, you should not do it, you may have to regret that thing, but this is your generality, when you think like this.  There will be situations in which you will find no as the best answer because if you are able to take the decision, you are able to take it easily, that is, there is conviction level support, it is all about conviction of all the information thrown at you all very good collect.  Information 10 Does Not Increase There Conviction For Why Every Day The Answer Is Not As Next  PM of people wants to five percent and remains a victim of delay 12345, he is not able to take a decision, that is, he is never able to take a decision in any situation where even normal people will take it. If there is no video for those people, then the video is made for the majority. Army Chief Variation is there in everything so for two percent three percent five percent nobody can make every and video details different case that is different.  You should deal but if you are in normal condition, your normal level to take decisions, your family is above average IQ, you are fine and you have generally also not labeled anyone as a person but you are not able to take a decision in  Some Situation Death You Now We Enter Prepaid Debit The Answer Is Paris Nothing More You Can Do  There are many people who now go for confirmation by C and say that then the decision is taken according to the votes, what do you feel, what do you feel, never ever in life take decision, this is the best wealth and property, this is your conviction.  If you talk to people to improve the things which are depriving you of taking that short ball decision, then it is a different matter as if a girl or a boy has decided to marry a girl.  If there is a job, then you are inquiring about it. Do like it from any of your old acquaintances among the employed people. And the problem is, but it's the decision. If you are appointed under this decision, then this is the flower of your color. What is the Haryanvi word?  Flat Hindi and English tweet that I will you no Ladua new ok I will hang up on you if I went wrong did it get fixed or not thank you very much, my decision was mine, it was an ultimatum.  Write So Don't Want Such Decisions Out Source Information Cross Check Information Cross Check Detail Data And Once Every Thing Is There Weather See Weather You Are Able To Take A Decision So Not Able To Take A Decision Answer Will Be Known Till Cost Of Preparation Time Singh  When even after getting everything they are not able to take it normally, I am the decision makers, your general people know that even the minutes are being cut by this.  Note 4 Me You Can Bypass Skit Next Ok You Can Always Stand Out In Me Too Because Sometimes What Happens In Weddings Is Decision Making You Are Not Able To Understand And You Because Something Deep In Your Subconscious Is Something Wrong Witch  Haven't Been Able to Figure There's Something Not Feeling So You Yes Steve Wire Sometime Servy Subconscious Level of Think That Process House and Feeling  Also clear this something now that Vitamin E wants to put in life may let you release when convention no will be beneficial in 100 days time Select 20% You have been saying yes and no but it's okay long-term decision making process still they are  After no feeling, you will feel a little that for all that you avoid tears in your eyes, thank you"

    "title": "A Good Clarity To Youth From @ShriPrashant [lzze96f5SUc].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, there is a video of Acharya Prashant ji, I watched that video and I felt his knowledge was very good and I want to take that knowledge forward. You see, this is a classical thing, that something is better than those whom you consider your opponent. Come and accept it because even on this channel I say the same thing that BJP, Congress, don't do this, there will be no progress in life, so what is the talk of Acharya Prashant ji? Someone asked him about something, in response to which he told about cricket. Took the example of why India likes cricket, it is said that it is a team sport, but if it was a team sport, then why hockey and football are not liked, why only cricket is liked, because he said a very sweet thing that cricket is the only sport, it is called a team sport. Take it in which one man can win you and 10 people can hide behind him, some bowler comes and he does a good spell and takes six, seven and eight wickets or some batsman comes and he hits a century, double century or on 50 balls. Saran Mar Diya and will make you win. Cricket is the only game where one person can hide the shortcomings of 10 people, whereas hockey and football are not like that. Neither in hockey nor in football, one person can make you win because every second is the development of many people. Cricket  You have seen that one is batting, one is bowling and the rest are fielding. Well, these shows say something about the Indian audience and Indians also that we need a hero that Behind which we should hide, it is a matter of psychology, it is a deep thing, you guys understood it well, you liked it well, you understood it, do you align with it, then please write in the comment section, I align very well with this thing.  That yes, this is the only thing because if you are in individual sports then you know what the situation is, if you are playing badminton, playing table tennis, playing lawn tennis, boxing or doing anything individual. It is you only, whatever you are in it, you cannot hide behind anyone, but in other people too, people want to do well individually, even in cricket, but you can hide, so somewhere there is the psychology of hero workshop, like Gautam Gambhir is one of our batsmen.  Then he became MP, now he got that from MP, now he has got some success in KKR, he also says like it is 2011 World Cup, it is like Dhoni has won because he hit a six in the end whereas in that  Yuvraj Singh had a lot of contribution and other things also contributed a lot, so in a team game, we have the default setting of hero worship in our country, whether he runs after a leader or we run after an actor, it is okay if he runs after someone then it is  One is the psychological problem which I feel is that we like The Very Fact. The Very Fact is that Australia has won so many World Cups of cricket but if you go to their country then only cricket is a popular sport.  There is no hockey and other sports, there is a lot of focus on Rabi etc. and other sports, so he tells about the individual as well as about the country. I hope a little bit, I am feeling the deep video type only, that was his thing to me.  I felt very deeply that Acharya Prashant would have been a very close friend, if his thoughts about marriage and children had been a little different then we would have been friends, but now we are not, so we are not friends, but it does not mean that if something is said good. and it felt good and understood  And if you keep that with him then this is the growth in life, that is your own mental growth that yes brother, I do not believe in these things of yours, I believe in these things, this is what I want my audience to learn through this video that no one  There are different stories in the books, there are different chapters, like there are 50, 50 stories, 40 stories, 30 stories, this is how you come to read a story, if you don't like one, don't throw the book, you will like another one, then you will like something else.  If nothing comes, then it's just because in life, if you do n't like something about a person's aspect, then don't do with him. Nasruddin Shah ji is his political views. If you don't like his political views for some reason, then people like his acting. Look at the acting. Now you can see this.  Why do you say that if I don't like your political views then I will not watch your acting? This is the problem in our country. If you like someone's song and do not like his words, then his song is not good.  Do you want to listen to what he says in life? Polarization has taken place or polarization has taken place. Okay, so we have to separate this thing in the times to come or not, he said it like this, now I will talk about it.  I will not suddenly release you, you will run out of people or run out of you know entertainment or run out of time pass or run out of topics or run out of everything if you live life like this then then you  Will just go to one person, only that person can be anyone and then you will see everything only of that person and your intellect and conscience will not be awakened because according to me a human being can never awaken the intellect and conscience of anyone.  Those who have more bandwidth in life, want to listen to everyone, want to analyze everyone, which is called a proverb in English that let's you know agree to disagree between both.  Of us or anyone like let's agree on this or we will disagree on this and if disagreement is going on then no problem because these days these disagreements seem to be affecting the relationships a lot. I am getting many such cases from you.  Just because not a single person agrees with your views, all or some of the views, if you just stop talking to him, then who will be your devil's advocate? Then I have seen some couples like me.  I have come to couple counseling many times and they say that if the compatibility is very good then one husband is making fun and the wife is also not making fun, there is no one to check her, we will go for driving at night in the mountains, let's enjoy.  So someone is needed, no check, we get along very well, we are both equally stupid, we are driving 1515 hours a day, right now my cases are coming like this in my knowledge.  They are coming in such a way that brother, there is no balance on you, your family is not there behind you, sometimes this happens, sometimes it happens that the wife is a fighter wife, the wife who does not agree with your thoughts is the sweetest good wife of all.  If he says yes to things, then why would you be the one to say no because the one who is not married will now say that what is this, the one who is not married and is busy alone and no one has the courage to interrupt him, why only the courage?  There is a wife among those who have a wife. She can be whoever you want.  Go, as per your wish, the big leader or the wife in life, you may be doing or saying any nonsense, he will come and tell you otherwise, there is no one to interrupt, brother, if you are someone's wife, suppose someone gives such a dialogue that Mahatma Gandhi  Ji, no one knew this without the picture, now no one has the courage to go and tell Ji, you are saying this wrong sir, look at this in 1930, in 40, look at this, by doing this here and here, the United Nations half  Had started the mast when Gandhiji was assigned, only after that he was not the head of the state, he was nobody but still he was a popular leader and unknown face of that time. Everyone knows everything but if someone has a wife then go.  He should tell me what did he say, no one has the courage, I am giving an example, don't make it political but I want to tell you whether it is brother or sister or not married.  Be it a relationship with your sister, or a relationship with your mother, or a relationship with your siblings, or if you are close to someone who has the courage to come and speak, then always whoever is your opponent in life or you are someone's opponent, get to learn something good. So you should learn that is the message, I hope you liked it, share it, like it and no BS from each one, learn learn so that whatever you get is useful, you will get it useful, you and those people who have learned like this.  you are like this now  Can't say that no, I don't like this country, if there is a poet from that country, I won't even read his poem, I don't need to be like this, I mean, are you understanding that no, his ideology is not similar to that of that country, okay now?  We say so much to China and every time Diwali comes, if something comes, we tell it that no, we will not buy girls, rest of us are buying everything, those who buy clothes of Japanese companies, we do this or this.  brand in no amas stool  You will also get the clothes, the company is from Japan but on the other side it is written 'Made in China', so go anywhere you want, there you will see the connection of China, not you, it is a US company, it is a US company, yes, this one is in it.  China is investing, the profit is going to China, today you can do it, I think if I am not wrong, India's maximum trade has been done with China, it has beaten the US.  Please check it, I am not going to bring it by hiding like Dhruv Rathi, so brother, I have to live otherwise someone should speak in this, they are firing bullets at our soldiers on the border, the money is from where those bullets are made. We are giving, this is the problem of today's life, this is the complexity of the whole meaning, it cannot work like this, without making noise, yes, it is a fact that the pill is also being made there, we are also giving the money for that pill and  V  Can't Run Away, no one will discuss on this, no one will discuss that they have kept the monet, they will take the mangalsutra, they will take the buffalo, if anything happens in Galwan in China, then whatever China is going to do, it is the soldier's tank that it is getting. Are we doing Indian trap? It is a matter of thinking, so what not to do. What am I saying? I am just trying to show how much complexity it will create and you are financing it and you have nothing to say. [ __ ], I don't deal with you because there is no choice. Shipments come as per your heart's content, you buy goods to your heart's content, don't take a look, make it in India, if you have to do land reforms then it is very easy to create a ruckus.  And it is very easy to create enmity here that I oppose it but if we find something right from somewhere then we should talk about it. Have I raised the issue right or not? Tell me brothers and sisters, why don't we discuss this?  Why does it not suit anyone to discuss this because if you keep discussing about low IQ then more people will come into the debate because if you talk about high IQ then how many people will be able to influence if I want to increase the subscribers of all the people?  If I have to do 20 lakhs then the more I talk about the low level, the more people will understand and come, and in talking about the low level, if you talk about polarizing whether it is dirty or not, then everyone will come even if only a little. That's why I am saying about high level, I am not getting YouTube1 test and not getting degree, not getting certificate. Dozen means the quality is not high. If you people discuss high quality content and such issues which no one is discussing. I am not saying that my take on every issue is final, it is a very good take or my ideology is very good or my thinking is very good but I am saying this at least for the sake of teasing the topic. for you that  To make you think, you have to praise. If you want to praise, you can do so openly in the comment section. If you want to criticize, please don't. Many people say, don't even criticize, no, do n't criticize.  Brother, you don't want to criticize, if you want to praise then do it because there is criticism, that's why I am saying that criticism is not necessary, come and check, if you do n't like it then don't eat, it's okay, but I am saying that every person like me is very appreciative of Acharya Prashant ji.  I have made videos against them, mine is different from their ideology, I am a person of family and family man, marriage and children and you know that but if you agree on many other things then you should say please share it, thank you Yuri."

    "content": "Hello friends, young mothers should note this mistake in their grooming, that is, I will tell you about one of the things which is a big mistake, you should not make this mistake, correct it and see its effect, no one is going to tell you, there are many reasons for that too. What is the mistake? Are his boys 20 or early 30? They are bearded and he is of Virat Kohli type because he follows icons and he is like this.  They keep cutting, meaning that beard is not like that because Baba Ji's beard is also like this in the street and Baba Ji, no no, it is some kind of sexy beard, from here it is cut, it means if it takes four-five minutes to do it normally. So it takes much more time and money to maintain it but still the war mother is doing this. Don't do this. Shahrukh Khan will definitely have to keep a beard because brother, that loose screen is there to read the story.  If asked, he will stick it to his beard, you will see this in many movies, but he also looks like a youth icon, other actors are also seen doing it, Kabir Singh was also copied, so this trade has been made, but now I am the latest test.  I am telling you the latest test and I am telling you like this, I understand girls, I am telling you that you understand everything, what is good for many people in your screen, what about some people, some acne is acne.  There is cutwork, he wants to hide that too, oh from that and that disease will spread and will be invisible and there will be irritation and there will be issues, whatever is yours, you come clean and you will see its magic happening in 60 days, if you have this wrong back fire debt which will do.  No, it's okay, you bill you look, many people say that you look a bit old, they also want your mouth to be scrunched up, not to be conscious at all, this is something that you are wasting great amount of time in energy and  Those parents who are listening and whose sons are working, brother, tell them, remove them, now I am going to launch too many astrology channels and a few in both, I will explain it to you better, those who want to understand there, but still there are many.  Things happen after doing too much of them, struggle, frustration, bitterness, not getting work done and all this check, this is a lot of your energy, this beard that you have kept is taking away, now there will be a little bit of it, now someone 's pulse in it, that pulse sack beard.  In  One gray hair has gone, someone has become something like this, then they have to trim it, then it is taking away all the energy and I am telling you, even your girls are not getting attracted to it, I am also telling you, and neither are you great sexy.  There is a psychological reason in forcefully showing masculinity that the story and program may be spoiled. You are feeling it or it is subconscious. You do not need to show this. This is the latest think because of the reason. What is the reason? You go to a bank. Those who go to any event, all the youngsters are all alike, you are not singing any different, just see today in the boys young and those who look like sarees, they all have the same hair style, don't do too much, Ketu will also be translated now I  But I am not going to tell it in detail, but with a little bit of poverty, there is poverty in cutting the whole thing, I finished my work till the time I woke up in the morning, did not put any mind to it, now this is my one like this, mine is like this, try it for 60 days.  If it doesn't make any difference then please tell me, I have to give clarity to the bill follow me device, there is no imposition, I have to give a clarity that yes brother, it is very open in many things, why am I not told a little and Tell me 10000 reasons for this, I am from where I am, try it, it is a family farm, it will not happen again, if you gave a beard to a cat, it will never come again, I have caused harm, it is not like this, just look at the cat once for a month or two.  Enjoy the look, after that you can see how people are now, not that, I have applied it on my passport as well, I have applied it on my betel leaf as well, my religion is also applied everywhere, so I just have to maintain it, don't cat, lo cat.  Take this D message and see that when you are getting selected, we have to sit like us in the interviews, there is a lot of analysis behind it, the man who is mine has to suck all your energy and I know that your energy is going in maintaining it.  How many  I am also going, I am going, you are too mean, you are doing that, when did men start focusing on luxury like women, I don't understand, I am going too much towards vanity, it is a man 's job to note and wish.  It is not a man's job to desire money to force himself to look great by doing different styles and it doesn't look bad to cut the beard anyway but these people have involved themselves so much in it and do n't know what else he or she is someone like me.  one this one and this one Brother, it is being said that you are a model in the film, it is a compulsion, some director has said that the demand of the character is different, it may be someone's matter on the basis of caste, I go into the profession, money is useful but if you  There is no money from this beard of ours, which is not the most of our youth. What money is there from our beard? If you cut it like this, then please tell me that you should also clean it and if it is not there in 60 days, then what?  You can subscribe to the channel, you can only say so much on YouTube and can you change my name, I will change my name, it is not practical, no one is going to do it, so brother, by keeping so much of your meaning at stake, because  For a YouTube, the number of subscribers is the most important thing for them to become my subscribers, so I am giving ad-de-cost advice but wait for 60 days, do it daily and then see.  Positive effect will be visible in everything. Meaning will be visible in health also. It will be visible in relationship also. It will be visible in job also. The way you are will be visible in flowers too, so will people look at your wife. There will be a difference in everything and you will feel it yourself. Is it so?  You yourself will feel that this was a very good advice, why not earlier? Please follow me and change your DP. Then whoever else will follow me please comment in the comment area. Write that yes, we have already told you, so just follow Guruji because there cannot be much harm in this, it is home farming, it will come again but follow and give feedback. Thank you very much."

    "title": "A Harsh Truth Which Young Indian Men Need To Know [jWCOaQeXU28].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today I want to give very important clarity to the youth because I have a lot of attention in the comment section and on social media in general, especially The Young Indian Man. Today Guruji is going to tell you so openly without any shyness that your eyes will open.  Will go because these people say very casually, this is the thing that I am going to tell you, brother, Guruji, when milk is available in the market, then what is the need to raise it? ContextLoaderListener They thought that children should do like this, we should get married like this, there is such benefit, they will come and say something so obscene, naughty, vulgar and something and the other person will be shocked and since he will not be able to answer, then they feel that their belief system is there.  It's okay and it's going well, so listen today brother, Nish has come to kill someone. Will someone come to marry the married people? You have made it like this, brother, why should one get married? Girls like this, go to Bangkok, go to Bangkok, go here, do this, do that, brother, listen carefully, sex in India is obtained from two colors, Guruji will tell you now, remember the two colors, sex in India is two colors, one is yellow and the other is Haldi ceremony is done by blackening the hands. Get the marriage done by blackening the hands. Do this or do it by blackening the face. It is your choice. It is very unfortunate that people are very excited about it. It has to be done by blackening the face whereas I  Feeling pale hands is very nice because of culture, religion, institution, marriage, no, you are not afraid of AIDS, because you people know condoms, right, and you know what safe sex is, you have researched on gonorrhea, you have done research on bacteria. And the terrible diseases should be enumerated, photos should be shown with sex workers, age should be told, an astrological thing should be told, they need healing, elders go, those who tell Ram Katha also go. Very good spiritual people also go to do this, but when that aura comes to you with them, that mirage also comes to you, have you ever felt it because I have this knowledge to a very high level, there is this very tree of knowledge inside me. Well, it's okay and maybe this is one of two videos again, which I don't want to show more for whatever reason. It's okay, sometimes this happens. Have you ever seen that there was a boss, a rich man, a boss, an influential, powerful person.  If a girl is sexually harassing a woman, whether she is married or unmarried, then from inside he is doing all this work because his lust is awakening, that is why he is doing this or that thing. So, sometimes a question came to my mind because a question came to my mind.  I did research, I did it practically, I went and asked people, I went to people who used to do this and also asked them, think about this level of research, why don't you do paid sex, why are you teasing me? To someone, because you know that there is more risk in paid sex, if you don't want it, then I am teaching this to you, who go away after saying such things, saying, Guruji, this person has slept with so many kinds of People Criminals Pedophiles Psychos He and this guy understand more about all these things that they do And I had this thinking and knowledge but then I was surprised that they also know this  The thing is, don't go here, they think that this hunting is okay, speaking all these words, taking examples like this, it disturbs me a little, but it does the same to me, but no one like me talks like this.  No one teaches, but to teach, someone will have to come, some crazy person will appear from above, youth youth youth youth fools, who is teaching you, who is teaching you, you have learned something from each other. Throwed it away, no one could answer you, you don't want to be misbehaved, you want to spread diseases, you want to make your scandals, you want to get your MMS done, what do you want, in what wrong place do you want to get trapped and on what basis because you can't.  Handle Other Things You Can't Handle Independent Women You Can't Handle The Fact That Women Are Becoming Powerful Mentally Physically Emotionally Financially Because You Are Used  To see the mother generation, the previous generation which was not that much, was very dependent on men and was in a way a financial slave on men, did not have a mind of its own, I have discussed these things in great detail in my Happiness Course 2.0 which will be started by me.  And let me explain that even if you are not a youth, you have to give clarity and mentorship, you have to become a consultant because of happiness.  Why is it not only to make you happy? It is to make you a consultant so that you can earn money and you can teach people and not for free. Not only to the misguided youth, but to the one who will come on his own, will bow his head and say 'namaste'.  Please help us, we are in trouble, there is no one to teach us because our parents only scold us, no parents have any logic.  For what reason should the children not do this, just don't do it, we have told them, oh we have told them not to do this, this youth will not understand, this youth will understand with this language, will understand with this logic, because when they throw logic, those people which I have given as an example.  This big show stop can also be a very good video, it can also be viral type, I really don't know where it will go, or it can also be pushed like a sparkler, it was very good, the more I saw, the more I really  Don't know I really don't know whether it is necessary to show this thing to everyone or not necessary but telling this thing is too big, just like Arnav Goswami says India needs to know wearing a tie and glasses, so I too wear a tie and glasses like India.  Needs to Discuss India Needs to Know Will you share this video or will you be ashamed, ashamed, ashamed, what have you done, these diseases are filled with frustrated mind set  I am roaming around and come and speak like this, I am a marital consultant of India's top lady, in marriage you will get more in this three letter word which starts with S, ends with Why Won't You Get More This in a Misbehavior Tell You Ever a Misbehavior Teaches You True Things But I've Had to Come Out  Because I was seeing this and that, what happens to me, it seems to weigh heavily on me, when I bring content, then I keep quiet, a comment has come and you ignore it, but they feel that if retaliatory action is not taken.  This was Guru ji's counter attack on the people who think that you are smart brother, no you are not smart, you are not smart, what are you, why are you a professor at the place where I left you after becoming a principal so many years ago.  You are not even a professor right now, you are probably just a student and you think that you are a professor and nothing else, neither do you have a job nor do you have a partner nor do you have the power to attract, so I have this character of loose talk.  This is all about making associations, talking nonsense, defaming a gender, because if you had something, you would say, girls are doing like this, she is like this, so who are she doing it with, she is doing it only with boys.  Who is it  They are rich people like this, so you become rich, no, no, how will I become, I ca n't become one, I can only cry, you become attractive, I'll be teaching these people have got it, what women want, I know what they give Want, now tell me that right here, no no no brother, free key, free key, free key is not respected that much, this one may not be for you people but I will tell that in Happiness Course 2.0 itself, it is very iconic and Telling the knowledge that will not be found anywhere is knowledge itself. Telling those things which have not been known anywhere, neither written nor spoken nor thought. Such things can also happen because we are used to eating. I have written those things.  I will tell you what is not written anywhere, what will be written, you listen, you write, all the things cannot be like this, okay, I do n't even think like this, Khan, ask me about anything, why this is written, brother, nothing can be like this, which is not written anywhere.  It is not written somewhere yet  There must be an origin, all these things have been written, all the things have been written, then now there is no need to think anything, if you are in life, then this was the message. Those who want to register for Happiness Course 2 can click here. Starting in November end, you will know h2 on the number given below, you can whatsapp2 500 only, five classes of two hours each over period of one and half two months weekly class doubt sessions  We will also clear you how to monetize that thing, it will also be told how to become a consultant and what are its values, it will be a very beneficial thing and this thing will be explained well in it, don't miss it because later you will get recording to join directly live.  The fun is different, watch the match later. What is the fun in recording? It is more fun to watch the live match while sitting in the stadium. Okay, so it will be a live thing, there is a chance. Do h2 in the context of what is your gender and what is your age?  Because if there is clarity then you will get clarity of life and happiness will come from it and then you will give it to others thank you very much."

    "title": "A New Narrative Which Has Started In Corporate Employees Circle ｜ Full Clarity On It Given [nPnIXaaTK0Q].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, this is a new story and narrative to explain to those who work in the knowledge base economy, those who are very educated, wear a tie, a coat, a tight court, wear nice pointed shoes and go to jail like this.  By wearing hair and beard like this, this crowd of people are writing that these people are earning so much money or yes it is going, everything is nonsense, they are writing like this and we are in real jobs and we are  So I want to give clarity on this, first of all I want to tell everyone that earlier 2 years ago, momo sellers used to say that momo seller has earned more money, momos are fine, vada pav seller and this vada pav girl and  We tried this way and saw that by doing this job you can become good and these people also did a lot and many videos were made of these people too, we earn so much, no one earns as much as they said there and the hard work is very much.  The same thing I want to tell you here is that not only is it a mistake, it is also the mistake of the tubers and also the mistake of those who earn by doing this, that if you consider their jobs which are like yours like ours, very  It's okay to shame and if we sing our praises too much then we will get angry. Okay, it is a fact but I am telling you what is happening here who are coming like us and saying that we are survival survivors and our channel is still running.  Many people have opened survivor ships. Bias is visible. Whoever comes and listens to the story, you only get to hear the success story. People do more jobs in jobs. I absolutely respect the people in jobs. I always say in the videos that job is important, but  I say that it is not necessary to do a job for 30-35 years but it is necessary for 5 years, 10 years, 15, 20, 42 years, I say that it is a compulsion to do a job, do not leave it so soon.  All these domains in which we operate like us are simple but not easy. If it was so easy then everyone would have done it and here also there are many cunning people who do not add value and spend their time doing something else. These are like sparklers, they will burn like sparklers, you must have seen that even big creators have their time, they reach their peak at one point of time, then they stop adding value and the shop gets closed.  Just like the one with Flying Beast, we saw that there was a very peak time, it was Nikhil, someone used to start by doing bikers, there was success even Mr. What is the name of Sandeep Maheshwari, he also does n't listen to you much, in between he had a spat with Vivek.  Bindra ji, Vivek Bindra ji, everyone's peak is hit. Here, there are very few people who keep walking quietly. Well, people like us also think that we do n't know how long there is oil in the lamp, how long will it last, so that is a feeling. Yes, there is also a feeling that If silently you keep adding value, Bande Bane Nahi Toh (which is a word of Haryana) and don't do much like this, and silently keep touching genuine things in the lives of people, remain relevant, keep changing, then yes, the shop will keep running, this is also a fact. But still brother, we are doing this work, no marriage can be done by doing it like this, earlier Holi was about marriage purification, now we are doing this work, otherwise by doing it like this, one does not get respect in the society at all when it is zero.  You start with subscribers, there should be some business, after that do this, do this with them, towards this, I want to do this at some point of time in this month, how to become a user and how to open your own, I want to do a workshop. If you people are interested in it, then send me a message on whatsapp-web on given number. If you want to come in this way, then do so and mostly those people who are doing something in life and are sitting there should definitely do so.  I think that if I do blogging only from here, then you can let it be. You mean me, I do not want anyone below 25 years of age to come to this workshop. If you want to pay money, there will be a small fee, not more than a very small pizza, half a pizza.  It will be less but if you want to come then come but I am saying that if you have some work then it is very good. If you know something then it is okay if you are above 25 years of age, if you are a woman, a man, a housewife, a most welcome teacher.  You are a lawyer, a chartered accountant, a professional, a doctor of any kind, an architect, you are anything, you are okay, you are working in a corporate too, you are a businessman, you are a dietician, you are a nutritionist, you are anything, you are a yoga teacher, this is one because you have seen one.  Does not run any ads, does not support anything, no animations, nothing external, no expenses, no water, only you can start if there is nothing else beyond the way I will teach you, that's all It will be completed within one and a half to two hours, so if it is there, then let us discuss further on this thing, why it comes from within, because it comes from within because you worked very hard in your studies, prepared a lot for the competition, now you Tell me one thing, taking the example of a girl, let me tell you, she is a girl, she went to school quietly, studied well, took out competitions, worked hard, was focused, went to college well, this one went, then she went to some job in a tank, there the soul is sucked, every job is  I saw that case of Late CA Buston Anna, we heard about other such cases also, SDFC Apple died there. If you earn more money by doing so much Rath Saptami, then brother, you will definitely be jealous and that jealous person has to tell the fools that brother, you have spent this month.  Tell me how much was it last month and do you know the next one and what is your average of 12 months and do you know whether it will run further, it will come and tick at the peak rate, was there anything earlier? Now even those have stopped, if some thing goes viral, then they do it and everyone thinks that it belongs to everyone, like in IIT, not everyone gets a package of one crore, it is only the one with the headline that the average comes out to be ₹.  This is the news of IIT that people are not getting placed even after paying lakhs and 25 rupees, so the truth of it is that it is not so profitable but it is definitely not so bad that nothing should be tried at all. It is important to learn and understand for a person who is on.  The Other Side Because I Am Also Into This Knowledge Based Earning System Ok So Please Come And Learn Is My This Thing And Getting Irritated Will Not Help Some Stage Of Time You Will Have To Plan Your Exit From The Job Exit Plan From The Job  So you will have to do a job, this is a necessary skill because everyone writes that if everyone does their work then who will do the job? Hey brother, not everyone can do their work, not all the time.  You can do it, but if you do it after a stage, then it is beneficial, otherwise, we should do business. Business is not one thing, one's own work is one thing, job is one thing, business is Papa's business, someone else 's business, shop, manufacturing is one thing. You can call your work self- employed or you have employed two or four people, you have employed five people, you are creating something, then to get those things on the side, you need hard work as well as patience, before that both you need learning.  That  Isn't it easy to leave the job, I will leave the job and become a user and then what is my monthly earning ₹1 33 and then I will lose from there and then I will be of no use now I will go to the job again as a loser and then  I will think like this, how to do it, what to do, how to earn, how to approach, I will tell you that, I am saying it again and again, it is very simple, it is not easy, like becoming thin is very simple, eat less.  Eat more exercise, maintain a calorie deficit. As soon as the calorie deficit comes to 3500 calories, half kg will start losing 1 kg in 7000 calorie deficit. Reduce 2 kg in a month. You can lose 20 kg in 10 months and you will have to walk.  We have to exercise, we have to create calorie deficit, we have to eat, it is a very simple thing, but brothers and sisters, it is not easy, no, not easy, not easy.  Okay, so that's it, but once someone tells me the method, tell me something like this, what is this system, will it work with only 5000 views, is 10000 subscribers too many, can work be done with only a thousand?  So we have to understand these things, I am saying this, do not hate other kind, don't be jealous, always come and see how green the grass is, how much ghee is visible in others' plate, how much.  Exactly Ghee, come and see and understand and who has refused, the country is independent, India is an independent country, anyone can do anything within the law and all these things which the whole world is doing, you also come and do it. Most welcome why do you have to.  No no, ours are the real jobs, these people, this is not a real job, money is money, hard work seems complete, hard work seems complete, working for someone else for the goals of others.  It is better to work for yourself than to work for targets. This is a very important thing in working for yourself. When to give yourself time off, when to give it, because I will tell you the difference between you and me.  If I tell you that you are employed, then I will get jealous. This is what I was teaching you: Don't be jealous. Sorry, let's change it again. People who do their own work or do freelance work, they wake up in the morning and you are employed.  where do you want to go in the morning  When an employee wakes up in the morning he thinks, this one who does his own work is right, I am not my example and don't look at me, I wear glasses so that my eyesight will not be visible, it is okay that these people wake up in the morning and do their own work.  We work and wake up in the morning and say what will I do today, what will I do today, today I will do this, well, I will also do this, today I will do this, the employed person wakes up in the morning and thinks what will happen to me, got a lot of pain and pain, troll is not doing the pain. this is the one with the job  I wonder what will happen to me, I will be jealous in the presentation, my boss will give me a poor target, if I go out, I will get stuck in a traffic jam, the person doing his work does not leave at 9:00, he knows that there is a huge traffic jam outside, he will leave at 10:30. Then he does not come in 530, he lives somewhere in a different system, many of them do some work in the house itself, many of them press the mattress while sitting here, the family members.  Saying, change the sofa, you will have to change it, even such a good one is pressed, sitting, sitting, coming like this, it becomes such a pain, while making the video, Bhai Saheb used to say like this, friend, we also have to go somewhere outside, meaning  I started having pain. Literally I am telling you, go out and roam somewhere. What does that employee do? The employee says, 'Hi, what will happen to me, he doesn't know, so can you tell me what will happen to me in life?'  what will i do i want to go  Brothers and sisters, you will have to join, you will have to enjoy, you will have to take membership of this channel, very good things have already been uploaded, the videos are there for you, this is a journey from here to here, it is okay, it is very simple but not easy, okay, no one will ever say.  Leave a job like this, the job is dirty, the job is a necessary evil, it is something which you have to go through, but then it is  Friend, you have completed 20 years. Brother, if you have not got freedom from job even in 20 years, then you are not going to get it again because you will have to be ready to play second innings. Here you cannot just walk like this, all the intelligent people who  I have seen that they leave in seven years, there are average people who leave in 12, 14, 15 years, all leave in 20, they are also average, they are absolutely gun cases.  They are those who are not able to leave and will feel bad if they look like you are not VP and AVP, sorry VP and some CFO or CTO, then it is a different matter, however, they too should be left. Otherwise wise, in corporate, you will be retired in 45 years, you should be careful.  Look, you will not see old people with white clothes, one half of them is senior to you, you will see five people of one count in the office, otherwise you are 45 years old and you can retire.  You will be given how black should you make your hair, how much botox should you apply, how beautiful should you look, how slim should you become, how fit should you become, if you are more than 45 years of age, if you do not have an IIT-IM pedigree, a good degree from outside or a good degree of your own. As some people say, if you are not of blue blood Linnaeus, you will be fired from the job because in the salary you are drawing at the age of 45, three new boys and one girl will be hired, each of whom will have a different salary and their full salary will be Rs. Mocambo are ready, O Mocambo doers, if you find them, O Mocambo doers, fire one of mine, you are getting three, so many arrows in the pumpkin, no one is doing very routine work, it is not at all like those rockets of Elon Musk  He had gone up, he took back such work and there is a lot of attrition where these works are being done, there is also a lot of attrition because it will be such that they will say that thinking at the top of the corporate which is my  The idea is, this is my own opinion, that friend, if you have not burnt out yet, then you are not worth anything, you are the same, I will not use the word, it is ' Khor Khor Karke', it starts with 'H'. And when the thief comes, it is you because you have not sucked because if you have worked in a corporate for 15-20 years and you are still ready to do the job, then brother, you are not that capable person because if you  Genuine would have been a good player because that's why I have said it, Sir, to survive, work at Rs 70. Many of my videos are very appreciated because after going to Rs 100, he will say, accelerator and accelerator, now you don't even have that leave.  If you have then work 70% always but that thing will be caught someday then all of you who are listening to me start thinking of your I will not use the word retirement.  Because these other creators are my favorite Ankur Warku ji, they keep preparing everyone, do SIP for retirement, do SIP, this much will be done in one year, expenses become this and at the end of 4, then do withdrawal brother, this is not how money will last for 80 years.  You will have to earn what is good at the moment from you, I will earn for 80 years, all your calculations are lost, you will have to keep doing something or the other. Life is boring to stay relevant. If you sit like this even for a month, winter will come. Go to Goa. You cannot stay for more than 10 days. Moong dal and then that tea from home with ginger and all that. Can't stay there. And that sea is there, isn't it?  It is also feeling a bit cool because the sea feels very hot right now, that too will get cooked, it is nothing, there is a lot of boredom, look at the mountains or look at this, they look good only when you live in a place where you can see far away.  To  If you don't get it then you get to see far away, it feels good but there is no taste in staying there, try this, you will not be able to stay for more than 10 days, I have tried it many times. Hotel is a good hotel, the best luxury, all brother, I  I will read a book like this, I will make a video, I don't even feel like making a video, the truth of this life is the fun, this is the fun, it is not the fun, I have tried it all, I am inviting you also, try it and you will go to do it, right?  so what's the problem  If you go there, you will spend so much money and the salary of the job is not that much and after spending the money there, if you do not enjoy further, then learn to be a creator and producer because anyone who produces anything is the one making money who has his own platform. You are working for someone else, there is only one problem in this game, brother, you have learned it, where will the customers come from, why do you work in your company, because why should the doctor go to someone?  He works in a hospital because the patient comes there on his own, he gets money, he does not have to search for the patient, but there are many people who are hunters in the forest, it is okay, they have also opened their own, they come forward on their own, I am giving an example. People are not calling doctors hunters. Our society has become very touchy and the sense of humor has diminished so much that the edge creator feels very scared that if he tells someone, the only problem is that he will treat you like a circus.  I have to live like a lion, I need a ring master who will whip me and in the afternoon I will get a good lunch and I will make the audience happy. By showing my duty, if the target is achieved, if you do n't get food, then you get a whip and then you will get food the next day. Government zoo people.  These are the lions of the zoo, they are exactly like this and you are getting three times there, you don't have to perform anything, you just have to sit, people will come and watch, the public will come and do something, even small children throw stones, it makes the big heart cry.  I said to the younger ones, why are you killing me, it is a lion, it is not afraid of a lion, the most fun is the lion of the jungles of Africa, which wakes up in the morning, what to do today, what will you become today, Duggal Saheb, what will you become today?  The deer is in a mood today like a wild animal, I mean, I am telling you as an example, here too, people do veg and non-veg, these days in India, we have become very cool, make anything, people will hold anything and write anything as per the sentiment.  What the poet is trying to say is understand that there is no choice for all of you but to get in to knowledge based income and there is a lot of C. If I get into acting then it is not necessary to become Shahrukh Khan. If you are going into cricket then it is necessary.  No, you have to become Virat Kohli, the work can be done even with Manoj, Pankaj Tripati also earns well and there are smaller actors than him, Manoj Pahwa is fine who came recently.  He became a negotiator, which hijacker is there, there are people who survive with little bit roles, little bit acting, that's enough and it is more long lasting, big top stars came and went and disappeared, meaning something, who were they?  There was Imran Khan who was with him, his Amir Khan's Amir Khan himself, if it is okay then it may mean that you may not last that long or you may not be able to reach that level, it is not necessary that you are for the Indian cricket team.  Play, even if you play for the Ranji team, even if you play two-four matches of IPL, you will spend your life coaching and watching many children. You don't have to become the best baker in the town and the best singer.  Lata Mangeshkar ji and Kishore De have to be followed a little, okay sing a good song, sing in the wedding, it is okay for you in Jadugar me woh sarkar jo hai who hai PC sarkar beat them a little  You have to learn so much magic that you can get 5000 rupees in the birthday party, you have done a children's show, you have arranged for a gift show, that also works, the problem is that if you say something, if you want to do magic, then PC Sarkar, if you want to play cricket, then Virat.  Kohli, if you want to act, then Shahrukh Khan, Amitabh Bachchan do it like this, people, brother, work is going on here, I am teaching you, here you don't have to become that, top carry, become Minati, that too does not work for you, you also have Bhoom Maan.  You see, the shops are closed, everyone's is closed, you keep driving comfortably here, your Alt is slow, at a speed of 60, the mileage is going 24, the best car in the mountains is Alt, if the other vehicles struggle a lot.  Big and big and I have seen Alto in big mountains, it went like this, it went like this, its street Alto is coming out, the lowest CC but brother, that car is also light, two or four people are sitting lightly, pressed down.  She is moving up, I will not spoil the rest of my vehicles, she is struggling to climb up there, so I hope you understand the essence of this message Lincoln, don't put down people like us and people like us also have many mistakes which  He is very crazy, he keeps showing some of his income and that to me again and again, because he is our master, he is our leader, he is the same, Ankur Wari, he will tell me all his income, I have done this, I have Don't tell me that I have done this, I have done that, not everyone is lucky enough to be able to do business even for less than that, so if I don't do business, if I don't do this, then everyone will come like this, I have failed in my business.  Went here, failed here, failed here, failed here, then the lost gamblers are gathered here, there will be such a feeling, then they teach how to gamble, although that is true, the lost gamblers understand the game well.  This is also a fact, it is okay, the one who gets divorced does not know how to avoid divorce, it is okay, but the fact is, learn things in life, learn the other side too, if you understand, then do as much as you understand.  If you do n't understand then leave it, everything can't be done for everyone, everyone can't do everything and by bad mouthing someone else, you will get nowhere by criticizing. I always say one thing, brother, do you enjoy criticizing a lot? I  I also criticize. It is a lot of fun, but I realize that I cannot do it full time. It is fun because you do not reach anywhere. I am not going to reach anywhere by criticizing anyone, Ankur Warku ji.  You know that I am not going to reach you, I have a feeling, yes, why do you take names while doing this, hey, I do it to add subscribers, oh you have fallen a lot in our eyes, that is why you do it for your views, yes, then kiss.  make videos for  You have fallen a lot, okay, this is how you take names, you should not take from those below you, you should take from those above you, the day my subscribers become more than them, I will stop taking names, oh this is what you have done to yourself. Dropped yes [ __ ] in my eyes, dropped it many times, that's why it has to be called because of someone, if someone is setting a template, that template is messed up, it is made of pied paper, then you have to tell me whether it is a rat or a pied paper.  What is it, I have to tell who is taking the food because inside I feel that when will this cook stop ringing the bell, okay no problem, okay then please write in the comment section Like Share Want to subscribe to the channel Subscribe  Let's try to learn everything by being a sponge. Yes, I agree. Ankur ji and we get to learn a lot from him too, but we can learn it once in four hours because the whole game is based on SIP and mistake.  There are 20 ways beyond that, you will have to learn that too, so share, like, thank you much."

    "title": "A Practical Advice For Middle Class Youth Starting Out In Life [uS6lIPUs88I].en",
    "content": "Sir, I had asked one thing, let's take an example from the middle class. There is a 25 year old middle class boy, starting out his career, what advice do you have for him, from relationship perspective, that his life should be sorted and  And relationships are essentially the two major problems in life and if the rest of the problems arise, they germinate from there.  From there it starts, so what are your advice to us? The first advice is that a 25 year old middle class child is not even starting out in his career today because he does not know what career he wants and what career he wants.  It is seen that lower class people are also starting with the same career, so in lower class, if the father was earning only Rs 253 and the child is starting with Rs 40000, then that is the reason.  There is celebration in that household but if in middle class the father is earning two and a half to three lakh rupees and the child is starting a startup at the age of 35 and 4, then that is not a cause of celebration. The result is that many middle class children do not even start.  They are saying that we will do something great because the child who is roaming around with a mobile phone worth 50 60 70 8 thousand one lakh in his hand is equal to two months' salary.  The phone that is available i.e. 35 4 Hajj means he will not do that means the money that he has, he can buy half of the phone, he can only not buy the whole phone, so this, this, this, this, whatever is the problem, this is the problem, we have this problem, we have  We have to address that first of all we have to tell the middle class children that whatever so- called career you are getting, start it because if you do not start at the age of 35-40, then it will never happen.  If you don't reach 50, 60, 70 and keep waiting, then first of all, instead of giving some great financial tip, instead of giving some other advice, first of all, don't feel entitled in this world that we should get this much because father.  This is the biggest thing, after that one should focus more on upskilling in the beginning instead of investing because if there is a SIP of Rs 10000 then it will beat the SIP of Rs 1 lakh.  You can't start it whenever you want, everyone tells stories, the most important thing is the quantity of money you have, what will you save in the salary of Rs. 0000 in the beginning, you will be able to survive with difficulty, that's fine but your focus should be on that, that I can make my  How to increase earnings, how to develop skills now, how to learn new things and as far as relationship advice is concerned, the advice for relationship is to keep all these at the same starting point.  Point of time is also an advice for any good girl of opposite gender, she should go and get selected for the boy and get married. Many people think that if my level is this then I will get a girl of this level because it is normal to get it according to the level.  So if I increase my level then I will get this level, do not be greedy because this is your level, it will take time for this to happen and along with time, time also has a value.  You will not look as young and energetic eligible as you look here. It plays out more true in the case of females. The desirability question of females is at 24 years, 25 years. That of females reduces at 28, 29 and below at 32.  It goes and from 25 to 32, she has reached the upper level but now boys are not found at that level because those boys are the first to book.  Yes, it is our status, which people feel bad in saying, but people should be very situational aware of the situation, what am I, where am I coming from, what are my parents, what is my status and its  According to me, I am finding someone suitable for the opposite gender to partner me for a relationship, so I should take it. Don't wait too long here, I will make my salary Rs 1.5 lakh.  And then I don't know what I will get, this is the biggest advice, every buddy is wanting some dream girl and dream boy that brother, whether that girl or boy comes, Chaka Majesh will be fun in my life, that is not going to happen, you cannot think this.  No, I do n't want a rich father-in-law to take me out of my poverty. You are not going to get that rich father-in-law because you are not going to become worthy of a rich father-in-law's daughter so soon. No one is explaining this so openly.  At this age, they are just getting callous calls; tell them, brother, look at your face in the mirror every day, check your pack balance, check your status and correspondingly, now your level is also increasing, then the satisfaction rate of this girl will be very high.  Friend, I married him and the level is increasing, so its enjoyment factor has increased. Respect for your husband, you went from here to here, you were here, you went till here, your own tie tie.  Fish is enough, now you got the girl here, now you got this girl because your level was here, now your level will not go from here to here and it is possible that due to economic condition it may come here also, as soon as she comes from here to here, she will be dissatisfied.  Once it starts, there will be trouble in the relationship, whereas you had got married at this level, you had gone here, now you have come here from here, then this girl who was at this level, after getting married here, she is still satisfied because her  Corresponding level is better, he married you when you did not even have a house, now you have a house and a car, so if the car is not bigger or a bigger house is not taken, then it was already better.  If the situation is fine, then this is the relationship advice - brother, reduce your tantrums and take care of yourself on time, this is the message."

    "title": "A Real Estate Decision Making Clarity Given For The Youth [oKZbPPCLJro].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, there is a very important clarity of real estate for the youth which will be very useful in decision making. If you want to buy real estate and you are in your late 20s and early 30s, because beyond that, their decision making has become the most liked.  Is this regarding buying something in a city where in your office is at a larger than a product that comes in your budget by doing it the other way around  Let me tell you that the office you want to buy nearby is beyond your budget. Take the example of Gurgaon or Pune or big cities like Bangalore. Wherever there are office spaces, there is a lot of real estate there. Old time office spaces and popular areas which have become expensive like Golf Course Road which is fine in Gurgaon or some area of ​​Hinjewadi inside Pune which has become expensive.  It is an established area which is an old area, the rates have run up there, you want to buy there but it is not in your budget, you are a youngster, the thing which is in your budget seems far to you, then the advice is to listen carefully to the things which are beyond the budget.  You take the one which is within the budget and is physically far away. The moment gives this advice. The first action. But it is too far away. So who told you to stay there? You are still in your 20's and early 30's.  It is possible that your city may change, that is the only thing you can buy if you will not buy that also, it has also become expensive and your office may change after three to four years and this office  Even if there is no change, the other wise of yours is that many people have been thinking that in the last one and a half to two and a half years, they have not been able to take this point, real estate has gone up by 40% within Gurgaon itself, if you  Look, there has been a minimum increase of 40 to 50 rupees, if not more, I am telling in average, in many places in the primary market, the price is 7080 rupees, the things which used to be launched for 8000 rupees are now being sold for 131000 rupees, you know Gurgaon.  I am telling you the average price and the resale market off-course has increased less, not as much as the primary market, but if you apply an average then it will be 22.  Analysis has increased from 24 to 24 in the last 2 years, your income has not increased nor your savings have increased and you have been watching that things will only get more expensive in the future. Whatever products will come, they will come in small sizes, not big ones.  If the end ticket size remains the same, then practically the thing is becoming expensive, it is also called shrink inflation in English, the thing of shrink inflation is getting smaller, it is becoming dense and you cannot buy it there.  If you can't afford to live where you want to, take it somewhere else because the rent there will subsidize your rent. You can get income tax rebate. You will be able to save on interest if your wife works. Wife will also get income tax rebate and you do not have any other choice. There is no other choice, so now in the growing market, if you do not have a choice and have to buy real estate, then you have to see that You can never beat real estate by investing in mutual fund, because real estate starts with one CR and mutual fund starts with zero, so it increases at 8-10. Real estate is 10 lakhs whereas 10 lakhs. If you have invested Rs 10 lakh in mutual funds, then you need 100% return and to make Rs 10 lakh equal, it is yours. So you understand what leverage is.  If there is, then you will have to take it and what will be the benefit from it that you will stop paying the rent you were paying here because you will start getting rent from here, put it in a mutual fund and as time progresses, your salary will increase if you keep track of inflation.  If you are out and about and your wife also works and you also get promotion then yes then you will be able to come to the inner part of the city like they say in Mumbai, not that they start from Virar and then come to Andheri. Then Kande Valley, then Andheri, then they come closer and finally reach Lower Parel and South Bombay, that is, this is the story of Mumbai, so in the same way, if you are not taken out now, then you will not be taken out, then you will not be taken anywhere else.  Then you will never be taken in the city, then you will miss the train, then if you miss the train, then do not miss the train just because your office is somewhere and you want to take it somewhere, there is a possibility, with this possibility, you should not do that, live on rent near the office.  I am also against kissing long distance and long time. Life is very short, so time should not be wasted. Three to four hours of life is spent in commuting. This is not a good thing. Two hours, three hours, whatever, that too is not right.  But do n't take the property because I want it here and I can't take it here. If you can, take it. If you can't take it, take it somewhere else in the same city. And for many people, this is working out in a way that is not in that city. If you can take it brother  Take it in some other city and the property from there should be within that asset class because the rents will increase according to the same formula for the whole of India, where you are paying, maybe you are paying Rs 30,000-35,000. If you buy any other property, you will get only 15000 rent there, but if your 35000 someday goes towards 50000, then your 15000 will also go towards 253, then your  They say hedging, at least there will be some hedge against inflation and money and smaller units. Now I do n't want to make this too astrological, but we just did a very good workshop on astrological real estate and astrology. That it cannot be bought from many people for yourself, it is your kind of star energy that you can not only buy it for yourself but you can buy it for investment and if you want to buy it for investment then you will get it.  Will also go and will take it and they are never able to tick the box for themselves, sometimes they don't like it, the wife doesn't like it, she doesn't like it, then she likes the rate, so take it for rent friend, give it the rent and it will also excel.  Then it will be yours or in 15 years you will be able to buy something expensive, your mind will be resigned to the fate that this is mine and I have to survive on this much and this is the need of respect, something will happen.  In these 15-20 years, you will get the realization of your status. 15-20 years is a big journey, so if there were tantrums in 25 to 30 32 that you have to take it here, you have to take it there, then by 45-48 you go down that way or  If you become rich then you can take it anywhere and if you don't become an athlete then brother, you took it here, there is something, there is something, something is better than nothing, never make the best anime.  Of better I always encounter people sir tell me the best thing, the best thing is the best thing as you like, it does not exist and if it does exist then you cannot take it, so take it better, whatever is your present situation right now or not under my roof.  I don't have a roof over my head at home, so I have a roof over my head, even though I am not sitting under that roof, but I have it, so if some bad life event happens, there must be some place worth going to for the family because  He Mutual funds and they will remain small in demat and they are not even that much, I am not yet to see anyone in 20 30 earning normal money not earning something like 10 lakh per month normal money like salary is 5 thousand lakh 1.5 lakh two lakh this is the normal salary  This is a normal salary earner, no one lost Rs 1 crore in demat in 25-30 years. There is no one's money in a year, money is not put there after a limit, the market is corrected, life is lost, it does not happen in real estate that if you buy a house worth Rs 1 crore, it becomes worth Rs 80 lakh in 15 days, this does not happen by correcting the market.  If there is time correction, then there is no shock. It is okay for some people, the market can stagnate at the same price for years, but there is no shock like this in the stock market and when there is a shock in the stock market, then actually one should buy more but did not buy.  This is also a fact, so those are the emotions which you have to deal with, I hope you guys will understand this thing, youngsters and please share this thing.

    "title": "A Secret About 9 to 5 Job Told [yhPoI-TK9Js].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, when I would like to tell you the Never Hut Secret about 925, please understand it properly because I am deliberate in the market but I also felt like this from my content because it is necessary to tell only one clarification and DD secret to everyone so that the youth does not get distracted.  Have you heard that from 9 to 5, a negativity is being spread every day, on social media and everywhere, and there are very strong agents behind it, now I will speak.  You also listen completely, listen completely, only then I am telling you what is happening in clarification and detail and secret, if you have watched my video properly, on this channel I never say that one should not do job but I definitely say that  I say that you should not always do a job, I have also put 36 and 42 on Singular Sutra on my channel, you have to understand the difference, whatever children are watching 20 22 23 24 Startup Studio, if nothing else is happening because of you.  The push of the car never starts, if we talk in a little astrology then 47000 is not activated, your horoscope itself is not activated because you are sitting inside the house because either you are preparing for the good time which will give you power and respect.  Will she give it to me or are I wandering in doing something of my own that someone should give me the money and if I do business with them or do something then it is very important 925 When I am a little domineering, reduce it and be a little smart. Do less, but by working, you have to be prepared, go to office, follow time, meet people, write emails, make phone calls, do all the etiquettes, handle pressure, all these things will help if you want to reduce yourself tomorrow, then all these things are needed, do not do it in isolation.  I can't help but brother, I only know how to talk. If you are a rude person, then why do business? People reduce their income, people do an economy, people do freelance, if they can't do anything then they put the job in a pattern. Now what's wrong with a 9 to 5 job?  The thought is that either you will come by saying big things to him, like the Devgarhvi guys came on Morning This Match and you also, it doesn't happen like this, friend, run, you start asking people crazy and show which Ferrari of yours is the car that I have, the man who owns it.  If some person attracts you by showing you a good car or by showing his health, then he is definitely a scan, that is, what is he attracting, he is attracting you only to earn money and is showing himself that he has earned it and he is attracting you. No one is talking about adding value add skill set and brother, money can be earned by working hard while studying, no one can give so much knowledge, there are no shortcuts in this, someone is making my investment like this, someone is making a millionaire from investment.  Someone is making millionaires on sale. Someone is making millionaires in his own way and 9 to 5 jobs are being made redundant. When this good comes from which you adopt it, how does it reduce the entire system? How do the employees manage each other?  How does it reduce the accounts, how does it do sales, how does marketing do, how does supply chain logistics work, wherever you are working, these elements would be going on that how is GST paid, what is it that tomorrow you will get something of your own. If you do it then you cannot be like that if you were in sales then you went to do your work because Sher Bhaiya, you don't know the rest of the things, if you do your work then you will do all the work from Chapra but because you are the one, you can do whatever you do. You should know everything about the organization, how to talk to people, how to talk to juniors, how to talk to scenery, what are the soft skills, what are the communication skills, when 925 is necessary for that, now I will tell you one thing in this.  I would like those who are very smart to figure out in 7 to 8 years, you are minimum for 7 years, if it takes then by 30-31, you will be a topper student.  After that if you are an average then it is fine till 12 13 14 years. After the age of 36 years you will get an idea of ​​what you should do and you will also start working towards it and 42 years is the cut off date.  The people who have joined the job should leave the job for that, when you have decided in your mother that at the age of 42, even a week student will be expelled if from 42 you become 45, 43.  After 44 years of penance, you will never lose your job and the most precious stress in life comes at the age of 40. In mid-forties, it is called midlife crisis because at that time, children grow up and their expenses are flooding the mother.  -Your father has health issues, you also have new healthy shoes, there are promotional programs, life seems to be passing by, you are no longer young, is your dream fulfilled?  It didn't happen that 20 years of your life were spent by everyone on you and your time. Note it with you and give it. Demand is increasing and you have a lot of money to spend. That thing is most important. Now, do you think that 45 to 60 years are the most painful?  Having a job from 22, 23, 24 years to 36 years, 35 years is not so painful because you are still learning in your youth or when you are young, you have experience in job.  If it is less, then some mistakes are forgivable. If there is caste, mistakes are not forgiven. If there is any data, it does not seem that big and if the target is to ask you to do something, then the target also changes because you are not married yet. Your 24 25 26 27 K.  Two stars are performing right now, in your second thing, will we come or not? Children are being born 28, 29, 30. People are having children from 31, 32 to 33, so that is also the responsibility.  The child has not come, he is small, the pressure of his class has not yet come, the pressure of studies has not come, he is in a small class, it is not that much, but gradually all that has to increase and if you are here then, then there is a program to remove you from the job.  If you don't do it, then there is disappointment. Application for those people in 45, 46, 48, eight, no, there is no child, then whenever that 925 is not there, then it was one thing in which you have to realize that you have to start, I have to learn.  is there and in that Change jobs in Dhaba, no no, then what will those other people think? Will someone think about the company? If you have the guts, you will keep everything. There is a lot of demand for yourself. It is not necessary to give a job for 12 12 15 years.

    "title": "A Secret About Share Market Investing Which No One Ever Told You [8CQDU-0M_0o].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today's secret about share market which does not tell in any way, in fact, the fine influencers tell its opposite, all tell like this and crores of subscribers are being added to all of them and that thing is making the whole war go astray. Those in the middle and front are also telling you wrong. I will explain this thing to you very well today. Be patient and listen to it completely. The most defaulters who remain engaged in this all the time are a big thing, one Akshar Srivastava, many people.  Ask me, today I will teach you this thing and along with this I will also teach you many more things. Friend, why are you following Veriku ji? Why do you take the names of three guards? What do you mean by their names? You tell me your thing and we will see for ourselves. You do not know the names.  Take this, first I will teach you Sikh and then I will also tell you the stock market and I will teach both things well, so yes, I want to subscribe, what does it mean to subscribe, never panic if someone message you about your ideology, believe system knowledge. If a big party is giving a big wrong to its opponent, then you will have to say it openly, there is nothing personal against anyone, there is nothing personal in politics, they need votes, we need subscriptions, you too have fallen, this is how you have become. Rise above this thing, don't become a moral science teacher or let anyone become one. This is a big learning in your life. There is competition everywhere in your life. You will have to be told in front of the bus what you can do well. And the one whom he is praising is very forceful, what is he doing wrong, sleep is very late, it is not decided like this, you can not decide which one he has to do, which one he has to do, it is you who gets selected, not you.  Know which property to take, which home loan to take, which Pepsi to buy, which Coca Cola to buy, which place to go to the hospital, it is told to you, it is explained to you, the expenses are taken care of, I do my marketing myself, the only difference is that I am not someone.  I don't send you, no one does late marketing, I don't do anything, I come and send myself, date is the difference between me and give but, what is that mess, why is it the lion's share of the market, I am explaining to you now, please understand carefully sir.  The channel is theirs, it is a relief, take 5000 children, take 10000 children, take a sap child, take a child on axle, do this and this lion marketing is a wrong thing, you will inflow so much, you will invest so much money in the lion market, then in so many years this much will happen like this.  It will go as it will happen, this is the story, nothing is going to happen, I am telling you, I am not yours, but it has happened, this is the pass data, this is the future, this is the economy, listen, listen, no one told you, this is the clarity given by IMD number one.  Do n't speak like this, listen to your speaking and then judge me whether this statement of yours is correct. Whenever the expenditure is a substantial amount, the market DOESN'T take you.  Anywhere because out of ₹ 100, if some of it is deducted in tax, ₹ 20 ₹ 30, then some deduction is taken in life insurance, some of your remaining are cats, then your ₹ 50 ₹ 60 ₹ 40 is spent in food and drinks, so now why not save that ₹ 10 ₹ 20?  Guruji, yes, take the child, but by putting that child in the stock market, it will not be worth much because then in life you will have to buy a car, get married, spend on children, this piggy bank will be broken and every person's life will be broken every year.  The piggy bank breaks in two years or three years and if the money invested in the market goes away in the market for 15-20 years, but if it goes away, then no, it will not go away, no, our income will increase, with every move of yours and when you are Fan is increasing your responsibility and also increasing in this matter, now people who will understand that he is not even marrying, he is on top, will not have to say, he does not marry, then break the piggy bank.  If you want, then the child doesn't do it because he has to go to school. You are not reaching the story. People are under 40, their children have grown up. If you want to put them in higher education, then you are a lion market. You have to put two years in it. The market is taking time. The market is taking time.  Now I have to marry my child, the market is low, when you had to go for a vacation, then I will spend my life like this in five years, because of this, you are not becoming a rich mother, this energy of yours is being wasted a lot, that is 12 14 15 16% return, whatever.  There is a promise that it is an average over 10-15 years, between 3 years and 2 years, if people wake up, at many places you will get positive returns, at many places you will get negative returns, at many places you will also get four-five%, see the returns of what Sensex was in January 2008 and what it is today.  Lo, you will come to know on your own how much it is, the biggest problem is that now they themselves show influence by showing their portfolio and that too by taking their name, like Akshar ji says that mine is Expenses are only one or two percent of my income. Brother, that's what I am teaching you. When your expenditure is two percent, then you do n't care. That 20-30-50% of your income is invested in the market, right.  If it is, it is falling, it is decreasing, the portfolio is flooding, it is okay, you were not able to deal with it, your retirement, the remaining expenses are as they are and you are relaxed. Because your income is so high and your expenditure is less, that is why the middle class has been investing for many years. It is something like that earlier Dhirendra ji used to come to value, those mutual fund people are fine, this news channel is very good.  Now there are YouTube channels of people from all over the stock market, then these are the people who have always learned this, you are also there, then why did you not get this freedom of the middle class because you have concentrated on increasing your income and money. I am not fooling anyone, if your income is Rs 7, 8, 10 lakh per month, then you invest money in check HD, you are the one who invests ₹ 1 lakh 2 lakh in mutual fund, always be ahead of the story of the one whose income is Rs 2 lakh, because I can do anything.  Do the calculations, it's okay, so concentrate on increase in your expenditure income and expenditure cannot be reduced beyond a point, invest in that life, invest in that life.  Only I have seen people so much because they will go to Starbucks for coffee ₹ 400 I am late there child, I will take this cap, I will go on the bus, I have to go there like this, bye and I can go, but I will go on the train, 2ac in the train  I can go but I will go in three in one. I can go in three in one. I will go in sleeper class. He will exchange so much of my money. He will spend so much of mine. It sounds good but it has become a habit in life. After that whenever money  joins in  Still, there is no expense, I will try to band by giving one knowledge in life and you all will enjoy, although it is a Sangolese type of knowledge, here I am posting the channel on Clarity Farid, if not, then subscribe, do that also because there  Pay this one more thing and let me tell you, listen carefully, it is difficult to desire money, it is not easy, it is not very easy, okay, it takes hard work, it takes the mind, it becomes more difficult than earning money, saving money because the expenses are very high, this is another second.  Money is a difficult thing  It becomes more difficult to save money and invest it instead of the right way. Those who do n't break and definitely keep going, it becomes more difficult to save money but invest it instead of the right way. Here all those influencers come, some say right, some say wrong, some say wrong.  Don't know in totality because there is 360 degree perspective but the most difficult thing in life is to enjoy the money. Here I came in play D number one clarity waver, everyone will reach till here, money, how to wish.  What do you have to do, then you have to save like this, Chindi, take a child here, take a child there, someone will remain, invest in such a child, go like this, how to enjoy because you don't know how many parents have you seen in life, now when people say  People with money don't enjoy a dialogue, what do they listen to, what do they see, look at their parents, those who are sitting with money and HD are living a miserable life because they did not understand at the time how much they have to enjoy.  We have to do it again, let's go to a different extreme, this is the caste of the people, brother, I will do bungee jumping, you milk, that is a different one, that is going on, they are also studying in despair, this is the thing of the second verse, this is the trick, this is a great gap in teaching where  I want you to come today, a teacher and a fool, this cap is not telling the gap, no one here is doing a live life, we are one's financial freedom, hurry up, retire, come this retire, this was the one  Are you in a dilemma Ho I am retired This is Ho I am retired Anybody Uses Ho I am retired Hajj Not retired That is how you have to retire Income in this Hajj This is not a practical thing Too much more practical is being told in a lot of space Too much and  The children who get very relaxed after listening to the talk of 2003 year, tell Diwari that ji has told us that we are shipping, we will become millionaires in 30 years. Because it will happen like this, then next time there will be movement. Mummy needs money, there will be some emergency at home, I want a car, iPhone is the only thing I want in the market, etc. people are connected to earn profit from iPhone trading. Aayat 1.5 I have gone. I have bought this or Samsung's Fold, I have bought this, and all of them are less hard, which is not hard, real money is earned by working hard and having real skills, this is done again and again in real life. Attract me, I have just made two videos, I had to delete one, which I posted was practical, Ho Tu Make One Crore Scheme, removed it within 24 hours, and another one of mine is still posted, Ho Tu on One Crore in Six Months 15.  20 people did that on the cap, the idea that I had given to them, but date history is very simple, this is the notice, you ask me, you tell me how to do it, I gave the idea, don't do it yourself, I do it every time.  I want to say that if it is such an easy thing, then I will check your account, I have an idea, I have told you to try it, all these videos are going on which tell that they will give you 5000 rupees for the work on Excel.  Give 10, give 14% return, you will get 14% return. If you get 18, then 14 yes all yes yes let's do it. Hey brother, who knows what you are going to get, what is going to happen next, where can you get extra polite cricket.  Match you just at least India is talking 120 in 20 overs and 100 is going on 6 Shubham Gill is out Rohit is out and Virat Kohli is batting and is 120 and six and 120 is one and six  If the run rate is 50 then 300 will be made, instead of 300 you can go to 450 and also you can get allotted at 1170, both things can be life.  In all this you sit and become that commentator type, isn't it a time pass, it is shown that if runs are scored on 8 runs, then this much money will be made, man, such an important tax has also been put into it, so why be happy by doing a math in this? When you imagine, if you  You have to consume and know the story in life, otherwise you enjoy seeing such a country, it will happen like this, but Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, who are sitting there, do not have that thing in their mind that if I even make it together, it will be like this.  on that  We are looking at the ball on merit, it is a dynamic situation, be it rain, there is power, there is wind, there is power, there can be some strong bowler, he is playing according to that, then slowly means style, all that too on the move, let the moments come on.  D Peace D Release's brother, this is a tweet in the story and this is what life is, you really don't know the pitch, how will it be in the future, how will the bowlers be, how will they change, content on this  Don't waste your time again and again by consuming, that's why I'm late again and again, that's why I have to say again and again, watch me more, yes, become my subscriber, bring people from his channel to me too, vote for me, make me a leader, I will become MP, I will  I will win like this, this is how it happens, don't even be shy in this, don't be nervous, don't get distracted that Sambdi is doing this, you are taking name, you don't have to do anything else at all, brother-in-law, this is something that you bill decide no you bill not decide you  They are forced to get it disassembled and are told with force that this soap will wash well, this one will not cut the woman's hands, this one has acid in it, this one has acid in it, my toothpaste has charcoal in it, this one does, this one does.  The space is tight, the eyeballs are attracted, even the politicians will do it, the stars will also do it, the advertising people will also do it, we will also do it on YouTube, social service is not working here, it makes you feel like a human being.  A little relaxed, has white hair, Hello friends, I feel like this to you, O time is passing, time is retired, nothing brother, no one is retired, nothing is ruthless capitalism is being practiced on YouTube I bill behaved the way in his life which was leaked  People behave, now you have fallen from our sight, now you have risen. Every time you do this and you want to settle down, order thinking whenever you do this, you are ideal.  You are afraid of debt bill, do this, you get a result today, you are not able to do so many things in life, you understand progress, brothers and sisters, now you are thinking about this because you think like this because I do n't want to, my audience is my audience.  If anyone among my elders is criticizing me on any channel or saying something to me like you should enjoy date also when I come and say this is nonsense I am ready good think like this  This is how it should be, so you should have the power to take it all, the moment you come, and this is a message for you too, the moment you want to come on a public domain, the moment you want to do extra politeness. This is this in life, IT bill should be reduced, if people are not criticizing you, then you are not progressing, then yes, they must be progressing. If they criticize all these things, they should progress only then they are being criticized. The rule of social media is the player below.  Vrikuchi gives five to the player above, otherwise he said that nuance, on this, Grover had said in a more dirty way, I do not say bad words to him, nor do I use bad words to him, I attack on the message, I never attack the messenger.  So the message is under attack, there is no attack on the messenger, the messenger is good, the day after tomorrow, everyone is doing their own business, they are doing it as per their own convenience, it is okay for their own benefit, the public should also benefit in it.  If it is then it is a very good thing that the situation in life may benefit you also, the next one may also benefit, date it is the best, so if they are also trying the same, then do not get distracted by these things, it is important to know the basics of stock market but understand it.  If that money cannot stay in the market for 15-20 years, then there is no use in investing so much in it, there will only be anxiety because the year is 2 years and the IC whose salary is only 40 thousand, 50 or 30.  60 or 70, then is n't it just a child? Yes, save but he ca n't extract the juice. This D message of the market is constantly focusing on the market, how can I become a master of returns, which is better than that, focus on yourself and increase your income. Forget about it.  Market, I will learn, I will give mutual fund, first I should be eligible and I should increase my value giving capability and my skill sets, you should be able to on  N big income should be D fake debt is D message earning 40000 and spending your brain juice and Rijiju time and Joe in learning investment is meaningless because debt is 40000 child is not going to make you rich story invest story invest story then lottery tickets  It is better if you buy it or open a lottery because ₹ 40,000 can be converted into ₹ 50,000.  Even in lakh rupees and if you are earning ₹ 1 lakh then you should focus more on building assets so that it becomes your thing, you will definitely reach a stage and if you earn more income then only that money works, money is big, money is rich.  Only those people earn, whose cash flow is very high, free cash flow is very high, they earn a lot of money in the stock market, this is an alternative philosophy, the details on this can be a winner in two hours. To understand this philosophy, you can watch this channel.  You can become a member of or normal, when I am in my Telegram group, you can join it, a notification will come, it can be explained within 2 hours, please tell me about it, I equate this philosophy when you are on the mountain or  If you see someone doing rock climbing or someone climbing up or anyone climbing Mount Everest, what he does is he goes everywhere and stops something there and then goes further.  This is so that if mother takes the gear from here then it cannot go down from this point, this kind of thing should not become a free fruit because I am moving from here to here, everyone wants to know, everyone has to go but take such a long jump, go quickly. Brother, even if you fall, how to put safety net at every point, I will make Wagner in the best way and will also be on top of decision making and that will be according to the Indian context. Many people have knowledge of books from outside and have been forced to listen to the war.  Is  That's because that chip is going to other countries in the West and IT was never in India and the bill was never in India because of heart's different settings. They used to come for outside but now the Chinese people have made all the converters but that's the story.  If you come from outside, you do not go to Indian Heart, it is 50 rupees here. Whatever electricity works differently there, it will not work with you. Whatever you bring, this is not the knowledge there, you have to give the knowledge here, do not give it here.  The original here is not being given, everyone here picks up the story and listens to it there, picks it up and does it here, in future also you will get videos like this, the knowledge from there is being wrongly explained here and I am explaining it very logically and well.  I will explain to you, there is a Rich Dada Pur Dada book, you must have heard of Robert's Ho Sakoon, the most abused knowledge is that, is Robert's knowledge very good? Is his knowledge very good, but it is a mess here in India. What is there in it, if you want in it then you  Rich Grandpa  Dada, I will tell him how to get the actual knowledge because you know who is the master of real estate. Guru ji, okay, then I will also tell you how you liked this video and if you get distracted by what I say.  If you feel criticized, then brother, you are not my audience, you can go by subscribing, but I will tell you before the message and there is a dialogue, this is a dialogue on that, contributions used to be like this, earlier 3000 from today.  4000 years ago, there used to be a philosophy on things based on religion. There was a philosophy of blessings and blessings. Everyone used to say everything was brother-in-law and people are doing this, Jai this, enjoy this, I am doing that with a name, there is no problem with a name, they were without a name.  It is also fine but that message is being sent to so many people. You are sending a message to so many people. It is sending a wrong message. You are wasting your time wrong. Do you agree? With this whatever told you enjoyed please give it in the comment sections thank you very match channel not subscribed got forwarded by mistake am watching it for the first time so please subscribe thank you"

    "title": "A Simple Unique  Idea  Which Can Earn You Rs 2 Lakhs Per Month [OkJbIGeJSRo].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, an idea which can earn you about ₹ lakh per month very easily, I have already made two-three videos like this, my intention is not that many people should know this because then that idea gets defeated, try everything, I want.  Those who are associated with me should understand that if they can then do it. The last two ideas have been very hit and they are available for paid members. This video is also paid.  It will be available for members after some time. How many people will do this? By the time you guys have heard it, if you have heard it then press the bell notification so that if such videos come in future, if you watch them on time, they will be discussing the idea.  The idea is again applicable in big cities. There was a video of mine on why youth should go to big cities. Big people made fun and trolled the role that it is not like this, everyone will reach and those who were in big cities said, Guruji, why are you calling?  They will definitely have competition. Hey where do all of them come from? Who takes advice? These advices are like eat good food, sleep on time, respect your parents, have a good relationship with your wife and don't drink alcohol, don't smoke cigarettes or do that. If not all people do then they will not do this either. People will reject this idea at 99 and those who select at 1 and work hard will earn money. You do not need much qualification for this. What is the idea? Sir, there are many elderly people who are alone, in their 70s, in their 80s, they require this service, they require this support, and you can get an income of Rs. 1 lakh by getting at least 6 to 7 clients, not more than 10. Maybe in six to seven years, there will be off-course in big cities only, people from small cities will not pay Rs. 45, this is the thinking and I made it clear to me in that video, but that pain happens to small cities.  No problem, I am not here to please everyone, there are many NRIs whose parents live here, there are very rich people whose children are abroad, they are rich themselves and there is no support system, there is no one to talk to, so what will be your work. What work can you do in duties? You know how to talk, you go to their house and do their work. In terms of where any bank work has to be done and you are already police verified plus you are in touch with their kids and  select you  It is done properly if you do any work in their house, there is repair work, the elderly have a lot of work which at some stage they become asphyxiated and they feel like crying, including taking them for their monthly medical check up, see, make them cry.  A driver will do it, taking them inside the hospital, holding their hand, talking with them, chatting with them, telling good things, I teach these good things on membership in any way which gives peace in oneself.  A very big thing in itself is the way of talking, they require the company and they have the money and they are willing to buy that company and those 200 and these ideas have been implemented, they have crossed more than the pilot project, the only thing is this.  That when you do this work, you cannot tell this to your future father- in-law, O son-in-law, he does this so stupidly, what kind of work is this, what kind of respectable work is this, but this is a practical work and this  It is much better to earn Rs 40,000 per month by doing your own thing. You will be in a good company, you will live in a good house, you will eat good food. They may not have real sons or daughters but they will treat you with great respect and they are very rich people, they need people here. I am not talking about social reform to serve the poor people, there are many people, now how will they meet, what will they meet, where will they do, Guruji, tell me everything, give them their address, then I will also put money in the bank account and this work is done by me only.  I can talk and do things but I also know how to do them well. I am teaching this thing to the people. First only this idea is given to them. Only the Guru shows the direction. Not everyone can earn. I always give that as my example. Guruji Jaa in Amar Chitra Katha.  There was a dead rat. He told the disciple that if someone has brain then he will become a tycoon from this dead rat and a man overhears the talk and he tells him the whole story. It was very good. I had read it many years ago. I am fine, so this is this.  Now how to do that, you see, it is very practical, there is no issue in this, they will be afraid of us, hey brother, there is also a person who sweeps the utensils in the house, he takes away their lives, police verification of everyone comes, in fact all those things are verified.  Will do it because there is no one to inquire about the physical well-being of the elderly, there is no educated, safe and well-intentioned person, no relative is gone, sometimes someone is gone, and sometimes someone is gone, someone is taking care of their bank's FD.  Will anyone steal? Everything is controlled nowadays, but its photostat has to be updated, it has to be taken only to them, sometimes they too would feel like giving it to the elderly, sometimes they would feel like giving a movie, go watch it with them and you are the only one.  You need seven clients. Six to seven to eight to 10 and they are not needed every day. You, an old man, no one will give you Rs. 2 lakhs, a couple will not give you an off course, even he will not give it. Even in India, only one person is not so rich that he is giving it to you.  but you  Ratan Tata ji's assistant, you have seen him with curly hair, you have seen him melt it, when I saw that photo many years ago, this idea came to me and I have been running this idea for two-three years but I am coming publicly and telling him now.  I am saying that this is what you have to do, first tell me what an idea you have, don't go into the sexiness part of it because you ca n't define it, can you?  You are an assistant, you are a shopping assistant, you are an assist living, what are you and after that you can have such a good network, brothers and sisters, you can do this agency and your only game is to bring clients, if they come, you will recruit five under you, their verification will be proper.  The procedure will be done for all those elders, their children, wherever they are, they will be connected through technology. Today my father and mother are going there, they are going by car, just tell.  I am an elderly person, does she want to go to the temple in Kashi Vishwanath, how can she go, she has the money, who will take it, who will make the arrangements, oh no, tickets are taken from them, they are not even talked to the travel agent, even a person reaches such a stage.  Do n't know whom to talk to, whom to give money to, what accounts to settle, now Ramlala ji will be ingrated in Ayodhya on 22nd January, there will be reverence among many among the elders, son, I feel like going but my body is also failing.  But there should be someone to explain that we have to go by train, we have to go by plane, we have to get down at Lucknow airport, we have to take Innova from there, we have to stay in a hotel, we have to go there, we have to go there, we don't have to take photos, children, I am not able to do it here, children.  I am telling you, is this idea not good, is there no demand for it, is it not a blue ocean opportunity, do you have to give IMIT exam for this, do you have to give your UPSC exam, is there any competition in it? Respect is needed, a little patience is needed and you need a decent, well-spoken person whose company is good. That's it and you are taking payment according to the hours of your time and effort, after that you can also connect those elders and then you  When you have to take many people, you have six-seven clients in one society, one place in the city, then you rented a mini van for them and said, let's take an outing to this mall today for everyone alone because the effort is only that much, I will give you the rest. through this video  I want to do Sky is the Limit as per the idea that if I think loudly in this, I have taught a little about all these things on the membership, I will teach in the future also, you can also take the membership because everything should be done in such a way that even if this idea has merit,  It will also cost money, otherwise ideas are being sold at Rs 1.5 per kg in Chavadi Bazaar, pick it up anywhere, there is a problem in execution, I also understand but the  The thing is it's an idea with no one is doing. Anyone can become a millionaire by starting with this idea. Anyone can take anything to any level but what is personal is that you need something with a personal touch. Anyone can do it. Blue Ocean.  Now there is an opportunity, people, I am just giving you the idea, I am already full of work, I have to spare some time, when you become a guru then every person can write a script.  He ca n't direct a movie and a person can direct only one movie in a year but a script person can probably write six. Every person has his own talent, so in execution, he went into that and then the rest are 70.  They were working, so my work is to come here and give an idea. This channel is for the clarity for the youth, it is a very practical, unique channel, it is being liked a lot, but I have kept it with a little attitude.  I don't allow it to be explored, even if it grows rapidly, or should I do some marketing somewhere else, this Ayushmann Khurrana model has caught on, it is better than word of mouth, congratulations, then people will see that Andhadhun is good, then they will see that dream girl has also started.  Silently, no one even realized in between, when Jawan Jailer was coming, then Dream Gal 2 would leave after earning 100 crores, it was not realized, there is no advertisement marketing budget, so this is quietly, this work was done by no one.  Don't share this video. Oh hello, don't share this video. Beat my idea somewhere because I too am in control and I don't want to tell this to many people. Those who have pressed the notification, those who follow this, I just  Only for them and if you are watching it casually then suppress it otherwise such videos will never be seen again. Brother, you can earn ₹ lakhs very easily and on top of that it is a very good company and the best thing is that I am not saying this. you do this work  Will you do it till 70 years or did you start at 20 but you get life experience from the elders? I learned all this not by taking paid off-course but in other wise consultation. What about the elders? Do you understand that a rich man is a rich man and he is an elderly person and he is a successful person.  Brother, you will do it for a successful person, now don't make it moralistic here, who will look after the poor, you have to open an NGO, open it, okay, I am telling you here, there are  People are very very late, she is a lady, husband is not there, many people are single, she is not a lady, she is an elegant lady, full knowledge artist, what are the paintings, what can you do with them and by consulting them, please help me, madam, these paintings can also be sold.  What may be their leg, may be your name, what talent, what knowledge, I personally know so many ladies, what to cook after a certain age. Now she knows her off course, she ca n't stand standing, off course cooking, she has to stand, she has to do shopping, and she knows the recipe and she knows how to do it, so by calling the maid, she started her startup too, this is the sky. Tell them to limit, make them do the shopping yourself, spend that time fully, juice will come out of life, it is so important, you see, you are spending time with quality people and getting paid for it and learning life from you.  You are getting a ripe life from them, they will tell you about relationships, you cannot tell them what good or bad happened in their life, it is okay, they will tell you everything about money, they will tell you everything and you will only absorb you like this. What else is a good thing to do, this coffee will come at coffee time, you are not becoming his servant, he is rich, you understand it, but you have a level of talking which that person can imagine, here I am and even talk about being educated.  I am staying  I am talking about those youngsters who wear suits, boots and ties, who have the ability to hold an intellectual conversation. Otherwise, if they have to carry only that, the servant will also do it, but they do not pass time with the servant because they  Are all achievers, you can connect them in the actual real world, they will not feel like going with the servant, they will not feel like talking and half the time their children are sitting far away, they also become a little bit that you Where would you go with a servant, why would you go like this, he is not, he cannot do the servant, he does n't feel like being with him, because he does, isn't it, familiarity breeds dissatisfaction with you, whatever you say, call it classist or whatever, sit with him.  Watching a movie, having dinner with him, going to fine dining, having intellectual conversations can't happen in the same garden, you know what I'm saying, so of course there is no per se qualification but.  Yet there will be some qualification there, are you educated? If you are from a good college, may be from their college because like St.Stephen's is ok or is there any Venkateswara college? That too, some shade of background, some shade of ethnic, some shade of anything, shade of hobbies, shade of hobbies, any kind of anything, eight watts and all, the ones from South Delhi are the camellias from Gurgaon. Magnolia Aralish They are not doing wrong, I am not teaching wrong, you are adding quality in their life, they need that quality, they don't have a person and you are that I am not saying you are very sophisticated but you are a pleasing personality you are a  Personality to be around and you have the patience with the elderly You have to have patience with the elderly Will talk slowly Will talk slowly The elderly repeat the thing  Sometimes you will become emotional too, you will become a better person, you will get empathy, you will understand emotions, you are not in this night race, you are sitting in stagnation, I want to tell you one thing, sit with any elderly person, I am an elderly person.  Don't say, my hair is white with knowledge, my age is less than many people, hey, I also know what you say, I only know the art of it, but when you become an old man and become an actual person, you go in your 70s.  So there comes a kind of pause in life, it is fun to sit with such people, especially because there is pick and choose here, there is no need to give service to the old people, you can also get them, which is very nice.  It is bitter, it is pick and choose, if they like you, you like them, they are very old, the percentage is very high, which is very pleasing, life is very enriching, it is very experience, they are just.  Wanting some youngster to be around because they require that energy. If you are in 20 or 30 then this is a very good idea. It is a unique idea and an executable idea. How did you guys like the idea? Please tell me, you can share this extreme with a friend or brother.  And I will do it together because that also feels good. There are two people, two youngsters, they are having time with each other too. Sky is the limit, your imagination is the limit, you can do it in all big cities because there is this energy and product and money is required, it is not there datchi telling bhaiya, small town, leave the small town, leave it, you cannot do anything there except UPSC preparation.

    "title": "A Sukoon Giving Secret Revealed For  All Naukri Wallas This 2024 [gqEzG9nj9sg].en",
    "content": "Hello friends this new year I am revealing the biggest secret for those who are employed, the secret of not feeling unhappy in the job, no motivational guru is going to tell it openly because I am not a motivational guru, I am not a clarity giver, neither the senior people of the job nor the HR are going to tell it  No one is telling, no one is telling, society is telling, many people are unhappy in their jobs, why are they unhappy, that is a basic reason and those people are more unhappy and if you identify with this situation, is that the thing which is causing unhappiness and by doing that this New Year, this 2024  Stop doing this, try it for three, four, six months and tell me if you found joy in your life or not. Okay, this time I will make a separate video on this as well. Now I have changed it. In 2024, those who found joy in it after listening to it, write fire.  A A G means if you are happy then Aag is fine so write this also in the comment section do not be emotionally evolved in your job those who have become very emotionally evolved are suffering the most if they have a corporate job  Bhave Even Government  Even if it is a job, do not get too emotionally evolved, this is the message, you have to do the job by detaching yourself from it, if you do this then you will get abused at the job, you will get scolded, the target is not achieved, you will not be a bad person, something is happening that you do this  Just like there is work of girlfriend-boyfriend or marriage or any close relationship, people are doing their job like that. I had done so well that day, my presentation was good, I have been working hard for so many days, my boss does not understand me.  The organization does not understand, brother, do not put these emotions, they have not opened your SBI bank account, savings bank, yes that entry was made in the passbook, on 29 so many, on 291, the credit, so many good things, if there is a little problem now, then after debiting, the bank balance is still positive  If no one is keeping such account then you are not the same, if your boss is unreasonable then it is okay, you are emotionally sad, we get sad when we do too much of our work, what happens is that we put our emotions in and become emotional  is this good  All the people who are part of the system, the system which is called Illuminati, they will make you, they will connect you emotionally, this is their job, without that connect emotionally, your juice cannot be extracted just by paying salary, they also know this, the employees will play some game or the other Employee of the month, employee of the quarter, best employee, the award goes to them. If you are that kind of employee, employee of the month etc. then you should think that your life is going haywire, there are many bachelors who are not able to make a relationship with any boy or girl outside.  As for him, he is expressing his emotions here, I have also seen many memes that my job is everything, no no no, job cannot be everything, even then the one with mid-range will not let him fire, his parents will not let him fire or the child will let him fire  But these bachelors are being exploited more, so this 2024, create a boundary for yourself, you have to create a mental boundary, in this, no boss of yours can check, the basic job of the boss is to take care of the people above.  To flatter, to whip you, to get good results and to move up on that ladder, whatever ladder is called, CD ladder, corporate ladder, it is a different matter that it has nothing to do with whom that ladder is standing, he is not able to escape at all, that too a lot  People are climbing up the ladder, it is not known that the ladder is standing in such a way that nothing is going to be found even after reaching the top, the ladder is just a means to reach somewhere, one cannot reach here, everything is here  It is like going up the stairs, climbing the stairs, I don't know this will become a deep topic in itself, those who have enjoyed it, okay then write this in 2024, my new thing is that joy has come, there should be joy in life, joy, fun and joy in a day  I will also make a difference, now I have moved towards joy, it is a new year, the channel is doing well, the feedback is good, so there should be progress, so now you have to take your life towards joy, you have to concentrate your emotions on joy  you can exploit it exactly you can see this in india asint text  Now, I do not do that in that paragraph, it is told to do the job with detachment, in fact there is a term of Government of India, google it, now Karma Yogi, it is very deep in itself, you have to become a Karma Yogi, by making a lot of emotional attachment in your job, you have to Expectations come to you and a forced sense of ownership comes while you are not the owner, the owner is someone else, the owner does not have that much ownership, he wants to sell his stake at Rs. 12, 15, 20 and get out, the gardener is not that evolved like a servant  The emotional attachment has evolved, our company is my company, hey bhaiya if you do not take it from HIB then it is not your company, if you are not a shareholder then it is not your company, you are a servant, by being a servant you think that you are good by calling it your company, it is not like that, you should force ownership  You should not take it when there is no ownership, you are not being asked all this, just work, do it detachedly, no one is saying that if you are getting ₹1 then do not do work worth ₹1 and absolutely  If you do work worth only ₹, they will throw you out and that is also a wrong thing, I am not teaching you to do wrong things but do not put emotions in ₹1, the work is worth only 60 but I have put emotions worth 00 and then there is my disruptor I was not respected, I was treated like this, I did not get recognition, I did not get it on the presentation, he got more, he did flattery, this is how it happens brother, the one who does flattery will get it, he is doing work as well as flattery, so he is above us  Yes, you are saying that I do n't know how to flatter, I don't know how to do it, if you don't know this then that is your problem, you should learn it, bosses also keep changing, so don't make unnecessary emotional attachment, do your job by detaching yourself and this is not forcing you in every situation  Do not take ownership of it. All the business gurus, all the motivational speakers, all the HR people, all these knowledge-teachers will come to the company and teach you the same thing. Have a sense of Ownership, one day I will expose this as well, I will make a video properly if you want and it should catch fire, meaning fire means you will feel joy, you will have a joyful moment inside it, friend, just like Narayan Murthy ji would have said Work for 70 hours, what is the difference between him and you brother, what is the basic difference between a person who is the owner of a startup and a person who is employed, I will tell you this, the day you will understand this, you will know and recognize this difference and internalize it, then  You will not find this emotional term in a job. Job is not a place where you go for some emotional satisfaction. Like, subscribe and share. If you want to become a member of the channel, then become a member.

Once you come to take a decision of life, then there is a lot of trouble and pain in life.

The ownership because I am a marital consultant, no example would ever go without my mother-in-law and daughter-in-law. Otherwise if you have understood then you mean the mother-in-law is the owner brother whose husband owns the house or the one who has it registered in his own name is the owner rest you are the owner it is okay for working the curtains are for changing and he is not  I hope you enjoyed it  It is a joy to hear this original topic original content original example I got excited to make this content okay please tell you guys thank you very much"

    "title": "A Tangible And Unique Definition Of Success Explained [g1kmZ82BbnU].en",
    "content": "One question that I ask all my guests towards the end is that is their definition of success, although we have talked about success and understood it from many perspectives, ending today's conversation, if you have to give a  very short crisp definition of success what would that be success is when i can own my time and interact with people who i want to when sambalpuri and ever anybody will be so successful including the heads of the state that they will do whatever they want Including heads of the state, they will also be given a timetable. Yes, we have to go here today, okay, but still they can decide mostly the agenda of their life. If I can decide the agenda of my life, that is one second when I wake up in the morning.  no what I have to do there must be something to be done and that is I deciding again what has to be done  not something else, I am not taking my body anywhere that it should be told that it will do this work, no, my soul itself will tell that body that this work has to be done, so whatever my soul is telling my body, then if my body  If I am listening to my soul then I am living a successful life. Why do my body and relationships break? Mostly it is because some other body or some other soul controls you. Whatever troubles you are facing in your life, they arise from this very thing.  All the troubles of knowing how to control yourself are too much and that what mess or unhappiness, so in the pursuit of that what have people done to become successful because even after hearing the definition what will people do and they will cut the connection that I will not even go to work, I will not even get married  I will not do this, I will not do that, I will not do this, then no one will control me but the fact of life is that you can still live a life, you can still live a life wherever you can and it comes at a stage it  done start at 23 you  can't achieve this at 23 I think 40 42 is the earliest some people never at 60 also they are slogging that you did not come this happened otherwise you should not be a slave of time because something else is happening all the time so that is success otherwise  You can say in short the meaning of success is when you sleep at night and you wake up in the morning you should be a little richer something should be happening in your life that in 10 hours at night your net worth should increase whether it is 0.01 whether it is shares or property  Whether it is there and what you woke up in the morning from, when you are sleeping, you should be intelligent and wiser even at 001 while sleeping, so always every day try to learn something one thing new from anybody, anybody like I am just learning different ways of tying laces -  I am learning a few different techniques because I have been tying laces for so many years and my laces keep coming loose, then I discovered no, it can be tied in such a way that it doesn't open, I mean it is a small thing but then I just learned it and by mistake some video came and I was like, dude, videos are made on this too, videos are made on how to tie the laces Yes, I will also make a video on how to tie a tie, so you need a little excitement as well, if you are not getting excited everyday to learn something new, then it is not a successful life, a successful life should be, I can do as much of what I want to do with my time I have been that successful 100% lock in, heads of the state cannot control the time but the percentage is more, if you feel like doing a podcast tomorrow then do it, otherwise no, you did not do this successful Amit ji which you have done  I have given my perspective on success, it is so unique because I ask this question to all of my guests and everyone explains the definition of success in different ways, but largely some four or five  What I have found so far is that success is distilled down into buckets: contentment, peace, joy of what you are doing, enjoying the process. These are all very common answers, but the way you are looking at success. What I really liked about your answer is that when  You sleep in the night from the time you wake up to the time you sleep you should be 0.01 what ever number of percentage that is should be wiser and intelligent and when you wake up in the morning you are richer and wiser by that much or any percentage A table was and I tell everyone else Allam Ballam so I have become the topper student of your channel as well right now if someone better than me answers then tell him so this anything you cannot measure, you cannot improve a big thing if you can't  Check your weight, you cannot reduce and improve it, so we can improve only those things which we can measure, if the fever is high then reduce it  If it is there then we will have to measure 102 brother, the thing which we cannot measure, now if someone says I love you so much, I will love you more, what definition, so all these content pieces are English, everyone says it but my work in life is this which is my  Our mission is to say things that can be done, the rest is all just rhetoric. Our core objective of The Journey Within channel is to provide actionable insights such that you can take action in your life from today itself and improve your life.  The topic is The Journey Within. We help people to understand their own inner wiring. The inner self is where your belief systems are formed, your perspective on life is formed, where you process your thoughts. Feelingless, that is what I try to extract out.  I guess that with that insight people can improve their life day by day, even if it is a little, we talked about 0.00%, at least with that percentage and their life can be improved.  Whatever the experience is today, it should be better than that tomorrow, so that is the core objective, so thank you for joining me for this conversation on the journey with this podcast, thank you very much"

What will the world say, if this kind of matter is going on, if you are afraid of fighting, then the relationship is not very secure, according to me, you should fight as much as you can, do n't fight, what will the children say to the children, oh children, let them know.  want mian Wives get married, they fight in marriages.

It is okay with disagreement.  It starts with ok, then he is not agreeing, then if your spouse is not agreeing to you then it is ok, two things can happen, your words may be wrong or what you are saying is actually wrong, that is why he is not agreeing, another thing can happen.  The point is correct but you are not able to explain it. Brother, even if what you are saying is correct and you are not able to explain it, then it is your fault, isn't it? If I am Guruji here and I am making a video, it is okay and I am not able to explain it to you people. getting what i want to say  So should I question your understanding?

    "title": "A Unique Concept About Money And Investment Explained [_3Bo-l1fOKI].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, understand this one thing about money and investments. If I am going to tell you today, it will be difficult for me to even put a topic for it. If you see my topic, you can suggest a better topic than this in the comment section, then I will change that topic also.  I will make it, you will see because many times what happens is that your content is very clear but he does not understand what topic to do, so this is going to be a very interesting and good video on finance and you should participate in it very well and learn a lot.  I am sure you will get it, it is not a click bait job, you will get to learn very well and apart from the learnings that I will tell you, what else can you learn, you people should also tell in the comment section so that our crowd sourcing of wisdom happens  So let's start, let me start with the question and you have to tell this question very well, you have to tell the answer, Rohit and Neha, these are my characters which I always carry with me, so listen to the question carefully and answer after pausing, okay Rohit has 10  Neha has lakhs of rupees  He had Rs 50 lakhs. Rohit invested Rs 10 lakhs and after a year it became Rs 12 lakhs. I repeat, Rohit had Rs 10 lakhs. He invested it somewhere, in something and that total money became Rs 12 lakhs with Neha.  Neha also invested Rs 50 lakh and after one year in the same period the amount became Rs 54 lakh. Ok, this is a very simple question whose answer you have to type genuinely after pausing as soon as I ask it. You will understand once I give the answer.  I will give you a note, if you do it again then it is cheating, okay I have made more money, pause and answer it again, then I will ask you quickly, if you did not understand the question in one go, whoever brother Rohit had 10 lakh rupees, he should invest it once  After a year the amount became ₹ lakhs. Neha had 50 lakh rupees, she also invested it. After a year the amount became 54 lakh rupees. This is what I invested.  I have given you the information, my question is simple, who made more money, I have answered it, you all have done it genuinely, you did not cheat, very good, so I do not have any mechanism to check what answer you all gave, that was when the video was released  It will happen, you guys will answer it and only then we will know, but normally speaking, I do my webinars, conduct them, do workshops, whenever this question is asked, most of the people answer Rohit after using their mind, it is okay whereas the answer is not Rohit, the answer is Neha.  Hey, what, how are you saying this, Neha, hey, Rohit had invested 10 lakhs, it became 12 lakhs, so 2 lakh, 2 lakh means 20 but Neha 50 lakhs, 4 lakhs bigger is 4 lakhs, so 50 lakhs is 8 but Guruji, is it useless  The question came up, who made more money, I did not go into percentage, I did not say who made more returns, this is for 12 year old kids  When I ask them questions, all of them get right because it is simple that brother he had 10 lakhs and so it became 54 lakhs, so he earned 2 lakhs, one invested 50 lakhs and it became 54 lakhs, so he earned 4 lakhs, so who earned more money, 4 lakhs, now tell me Even after this if people do not agree on 50 and switch off then they can go now to teach what I want to teach, through this I want to tell you that you have to understand that very significant things have gone into this, what are your marks  It has nothing to do with where you are reaching 99 to 95, what is the actual absolute knowledge, don't know how much you can monetize, there is a game of percentage going on everywhere, this mutual fund people are doing it in percentage.  They also take illegal advantage of this, the fund has good returns every year, they will promote it, these people have opened 3000 funds, I will try to expose them separately again, by the way I have told you all about this in my webinars  I have explained things in etc. but if I ever feel like it, I will tell you. I want to ask you that if you want me to make a dedicated channel, then tell me if my subscribers have a demand for it. Otherwise, I will keep giving it here little by little because the finance channels are finance influencers. Apart from marketing of apps and financial products, you are not teaching anything, take this, take that, if you invest in mutual fund like this then this will happen, hey anyone can see that with a calculator, friend, beyond that how many videos and Excel will you explain, I mean  I am telling this directly to Ankur Vaari ji here, I mean 3 crore subscribers, not three, but 30 lakh 30 lakh subscribers were collected just like this, just by telling the children that if you invest money like this, it will happen like this, they can earn money from that.  They can actually put it, beyond that also I will put a clarity video, what can happen and why, so let's move forward, what do we learn from this that we have to reach such a price point and such a net worth or such a thing that there we have to get a  thing you will agree that at 20  To get returns, you will have to take a little more risk as per the risk reward ratio and to get a return of 8, you will have to take less risk. We accept this much that as the risk in the sense of returns increases, so does the risk reward ratio.  We should calculate that if I hit a number of higher net worth quickly then I can earn more money in absolute terms because when I go to the market to buy something and spend money, nobody shopkeeper has got how much percentage of returns Is it not interested in how much it is in absolute terms, there is interest in that, now let us put this in real estate and see, in real estate the property gave a return of 10 per cent, the property worth one crore gave a return of 10 per cent, so now that property worth one crore gave a return of 10 per cent, that means  There has been an increase of 10 lakh rupees, but brother, you only had Rs. 1 lakh and you took a loan and you still have to pay that money, meaning you have to pay that one crore in four years, so you have to pay 25 lakhs every year and  Mutual You bought an investment of 5 lakh rupees in the fund, or you bought an investment of 10 lakh rupees from some banks and even if the return came at 25%, still the increase was only of 1.5 lakh rupees, no, no, but if you take a loan there, then the interest on the loan will be there, yes, yes, I know it, Baba.  I know the interest rate on loan is also 85%, out of which income tax rebate is also available and those interest rates can also come down in the coming time, but leverage is being used in that property, I never tell you to sell it at 10%.  It increased after selling lakhs and you can run away, it is not that easy in resale, there also sell sell sell g, I know everyone will say that brokerage has to be paid to the broker, that is GST EDC and then it will become distress sale, in actual you will get only 3 lakhs and the rate  I understand all those increases but what I am trying to say is over a period of 15 years if you look at it or 20 years because even mutual fund people say 20 years or long term so if you are looking at long term here  If we look at the case of  The rental returns which come at 4 and 35 look like innocent returns and do not look like much, even in 89 years the rental doubles and that too at three and a half or four or 3 and a half if it is in Mumbai then it is not of Mumbai  Baba, I am talking about Delhi, I am not talking about Delhi, there are many places at 6 rupees too, there is a property on rent at 6 rupees inside the metro, if you want to know about it, that city is Kolkata, so call me, I will tell you the property at 6 rupees.  I can tell you the 6 taka one where the interest rate is also there and your capital appreciation will also be there, you will also get rental rate and you will get the money in 4 years and the property is worth 49 lakh 48 lakh and that will be an ideal case for me if I ever invest in it with mutual fund.  If I compare and tell the returns, I will make a separate video because I still do not want to take the help of Excel and presentation. The deliberation thing is that the audience who cannot understand everything without the help of Excel and presentation is my audience.  No, that's why I am sitting here with less than 2 lakh subscribers, so my talks are also very sweet, good and sensible and if I keep on doing shik shik then I too can reach 20 lakhs, but they do n't care, they are those people who  They are lazy people, meaning if you need a calculator to answer 23 * 23 then it is not a good thing, if you need a calculator to tell 2424 576 then that is not the audience, you are fine, so the simple thing is that in real estate You can use leverage and secondly, you can learn another thing from this that if you have hit a sweet spot for your portfolio by 35 or 40, then even if you grow at 9, 10, 12 and let that portfolio hit its sweet spot  The net worth which is called has become close to 4 crores, so if it appreciates even at 10, in which there is a special house in which you live, it will not be counted in the net worth, apart from that, suppose there is property  There are shares, there is demat, there is PF, there is debt, there is gold, so and so, I got everything, Sovan Gold Bond, all those alums and all, together you get 4 CR, so even if I hit 100%, my net worth will increase in that, then my net worth will be 40 lakhs.  If it is increasing then even if I am sitting on a job of 40 lakh rupees per annum, which is a quite decent package of 40 lakh rupees, even then my net worth is increasing more than my package. This should be the reason for leaving the job, so even now I will not say anything Keep doing that, but now the job will be done with great love because there are 40 lakhs in the job, whose total income is 40 lakhs, it does not go in the pocket, income tax will also be deducted from that, you mean 15-16 lakhs, then income tax will be deducted from that, right?  Then you will get that 25, even in 25, the expenses will be yours, then the savings will be yours in the package of 40 lakhs, cross the limit, even 15 is difficult, especially if you have kids, two kids and are living in a big city. Your net worth is increasing by 40 years, so your main aim should be to earn more and save to reach a good net worth, within which if you want to reach this level by the age of 40 years, then you will have to take the help of real estate.  If you are buying real estate in 38, 39, 40, you still have to take a loan for 15 years, when you have to buy a loan for 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28 years, there are influencers like Warku ji and finance experts like him, because why am I taking their names?  I am okay because these people are ruining everything by taking the broad wisdom of the West which even the West does not follow, they are telling some people that mutual funds are right or not, this is right, I will expose all their secrets that what is this whole game  Bad game, okay it is the biggest scam of India and how it is, I will also explain it to you people, if you want it then write it down by saying MF scam, you will have to tell me because till now if there is any biggest 1.5 crore scam in independent India This scam is happening in our country, that scam, fodder scam, coal scam, 3g, 4g, 5g, 2g, Damad ji, have you heard some stories, but no one knows about the brother one, and I will tell you how it is being done, why it is being done.  He is going there without any reason, without taking the name of such speculative things whereas SEBI is there, everything is there, even SEBI does not know about it and I mean whatever I will tell you, you all know that thing and no one discusses about it, so if they wanted  If it is there then I will tell you, okay let's move ahead, so in this, if someone deprives you of real estate in 22 to 28 to 30 years, then brother, your loan will never end, by taking any property loan, we can give you  I have seen from the data of all the banks that loans are taken for 15 to 20 years, but the average loan tenure is called T E N O R, not tenor, normally it is 8 to 9 years, because it has been seen normally  Salary income in 8 to 9 years etc. increases, inflation increases, people prepay, rental increases, own rent increases or the rent from that property doubles, if there was earning, then it would have been paid early, no one runs a loan for 20 years, it's fine  If someone else is driving the vehicle then he is taking more property against him and is embroiled in lapsed fraud. Otherwise the average is 9 years. So if you have bought the thing till 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 then you can buy it till 31.  Even if you take this, you are loan free till 40 years. You have a house, that house has a net worth, the income of that house is transferred to equity market. I'm again using the word equity because I'm not a fan of mutual funds. Okay, this AMFI registration AR.  I have been carrying numbers etc. for many years. Many people ask me every time what is my qualification, but I don't feel like telling them that they have official qualification to do all these works.  I left it and then I realized that this is not a good thing. Okay, so beyond that I will continue making videos depending on how much you are able to digest this video because the bundle of knowledge should be opened only where that bundle of knowledge is.  You can call it a buyer or someone is standing there saying this one, yes friend this one, tell me, he is not telling us by repeating like this but we are able to understand the things because nothing is coming from anywhere, neither music is coming nor background  I am getting very excited, I am telling you the main thing very simply and easily that how much the money grows in absolute terms is important, percentage has no meaning, if you invest one lakh rupees and get 100% return and it becomes two lakhs then there is no point in investing.  You cannot leave your job, you cannot leave India and settle in Switzerland, okay just because your returns have become so high that you have become the richest investor who has very high returns, if you look at Warrant Buffett, he gives returns on all 20  There are returns only on 17, 18, 19 and in that too dividend income plays a very big role. So if you want to discuss on dividend paying stocks, dividend yield, free cost shares etc then please write in the comment section. Never go for money in absolute terms.  Ever do this equity vs real estate never ever to we are like I always say taking my example people of Haryana we will eat rasgulla as well as kheer or gulab jamun as well and halwa as well but one thing we never say gulab Jamun versus it is winter now so Gulab Jamun versus Carrot Halwa we don't do this, we say son there are only two bowls, only one bowl, do n't you have two bowls, I will take both, I will eat both, who said this is good, that is good, both are good, both  It has its own taste, why burst the stomach by taking too much of one, you can take both a little bit, if you buy real estate also, but what happens is that first the equity does not remain with the man because how can one buy real estate in equity so much  It is expensive, yes, I will teach you how to buy it. I will also teach you how to buy real estate without a lot of money. I have a video on Sango Life Sat, it has probably got 6.5 lakh views, I tried to explain a little there. Where is that video, I don't even know, it keeps playing a lot, I am not able to find it, but right now I will tell you guys according to the latest 2024 data, how to buy property without money, hey, you can not take a loan but also a loan  I will not tell you, well I don't even have a loan, then what, do they grow on trees by magic, yes how does real estate grow on trees and how to pluck it, only then will it be fun, otherwise what is the benefit, so please do write, share and comment in the comment section In the section Subscriber Info Webinar Group you will find a link, beyond that I keep conducting educational webinars, sometimes free, sometimes for a small fee, so you can join by clicking on the Thank You URL"

    "title": "A Unique Concept Given ： The Best Sukoon Giving Video You Will Ever Find On Youtube [M67HCV_YVt0].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, now I will tell you 30 giving concepts which are very unique concepts, I will explain them to you well and till then stay connected, there will be only a little order thinking, the topic will remain, catch these two words and understand sir, the tribulation and peace of life is very relaxing in between them.  The video is about to happen, don't watch it while running around. If you are in such a situation that right now, noise, alcohol, left and right, then watch it calmly and comfortably at night. It is not necessary to watch it now or if you have curiosity.  It's a wake up call, watch it again now, because if you watch it calmly, you will understand the thing. This one is a concept. Catch the word G2. There is a contradiction between the two in English. It is called oxidation in English but all the human emotions are like this. Belonging to all of us.  There is a need for the next and there is also a need for freedom and whatever troubles are going on these days, it is because of who does not understand this concept, it is a belongingness, this is freedom, in the old times 200  300-400 years ago, Belonging Next was very important, there was very little freedom, so you belonged to a community, you belonged to a caste, you were put in a dhare in it and there you were told how to do it, so you had a lot of sense of belongingness, community living.  You knew very well that you belong here, individual freedom choice was very less, then the French Revolution happened, I completed it by going into history and  I will keep ATP as practical and not academic. Whatever happened at that time, I must have felt it in my own time. After independence, after 47, I must have seen it in India also. Brother-in-law had a sense of belonging. There was a lot of sense of belonging within the village but within the community, but their rules and regulations were joint family.  There was father, there was grandfather, there were those brothers, everyone will earn money here, dog and this is how the house will run like brotherhood, brotherhood, those times were good, many people liked it but in that  There was no individual freedom, there was a lot of element in Belonging, both are required and its biggest contradiction is that every time you want belongingness, whether you want to get a job in any institution, whether you are in inter relationship, marriage at the moment, you are married. Belongingness has to increase but individual freedom, caste is a trade off, this is a thing I have to understand and if you understand it then you will understand what alone  Because there is one more in me, body, me, freedom, belongings, it is not a story, without one, there is no happiness in it, there is no power, and without one, there is no happiness in the happiness of freedom, so who is the best relationship and what do you have to do? What is the take away because my audience is also children, 30 middle age group and also scenery citizens sir, one off for everyone, very future for this, this for women, this for this, my irrespective off for everyone.  Gender and further IT is applicable, so you have listened carefully, you must have been enjoying till now, now how do we discover, you must have understood the thing a little bit, yes I want you because clean is normal only you go, video belongs to you.  Belong Tu Rohtak Belong Tu Aap Raho Story in New Zealand Auckland Belong Tu Jaipur NRI's Jo Yeh Puri Movies Of Shahrukh Khan That DDLJ And That Pardes Se And That Saree Jo NRI  What was the emotion of community that brought out the belongingness? Sada pind mera pind mere pind di memories. There is a sense of belonging but freedom is also needed but those are also memories. So how is its balance and how should it be maintained? We will discuss it a little further where  Complete Unfortunate, does whoever is giving you the feeling of belonging want to take away your freedom because from here you need the feeling of suffering, good child, good to you.  You have to become our child, you have to become a good wife, you have to become a good husband, you need a tag, you have to belong here, you have to use our surname here, you need property, this is your brother, then freedom is yours.  Now children who are not ready to have freedom, many people will give them only freedom, financial freedom, this freedom is very less, these people are satisfied and content, you Sachin extend. Ready to give their leaves if you know them, make a regiment, recite some of your words, recite a platoon, where the spot of freedom in your belonging has gone, your saree, when you join the army, if individual freedom is too much, caste is too much, too little is caste, it is okay.  But belongingness is so extreme that you are ready to give up your life for each other. If you are ready to take life for each other, then how is it an extreme? See, I am such a guru, I am explaining it to you friend.  This is good, this is bad, this has to be done, this is bad, this is not this, this is not that, we have to understand the concept, we have to find our happiness, we have to find our peace, okay, life can go like milk, take out sweets from it, power is there, butter can be taken out.  If you have the power to extract curd, if milk gets fat then cheese can also be extracted. You should know how to extract it, then Guruji from Gurgaonity is telling you what to extract, how to extract it, in which situation, you have to understand, for this we are in Every Time Belonging.  If we go to the story, we will give up our freedom, if we run after freedom, our belongingness will reduce. We have to go into those relationships, we have to go into jobs, we have to go with those people, we have to go into the ecosystem where we get belongingness and we have individual freedom.  The best situation is to live with such people where everyone likes them. If you children think that they are birds of a ship, they will fly. They are birds of a ship. Belonging is on the ship itself because it feels fresh. Water is the same meeting, okay, then it will fly away, then it will come on the ship there, okay, so what do we do in this, first of all comes the rule of parents, they have such a relationship that they can give, now what if you give someone the feeling of belongingness.  If you give him a feeling and give him freedom, that person will connect with you. The best way to attract people is that you should not be too mental. Don't make such rules and regulations for them. This is not to be done otherwise I will be with you.  Such people create a peaceful life  I will get the same, they will get it in their families, they will get it in this marriage that yes, I am your husband, what job do you have to do, what less do you have to do, okay, the child is small, let's see him, I will do like this, I am my working SP, he is also giving freedom when  The husband is giving freedom and giving the feeling of belonging. In this relationship, which is called big, he should have more responsibility. The wife also has to say that I am your wife, you belong to me, so I will not complain about everything.  Papa, did you spend your little bit of money on them? Gave ₹ 5100 to my sister on Rakshabandhan, gave her a suit, so I will not complain in your name, you have so much freedom and YouTube question, is n't everyone on?  Want to do registry, do n't I have this feeling, so I do consultation, for me, I can see through it in a minute, what is the problem?  Do you want anything from me? I will not give you the feeling of belongingness. Every person needs freedom. So, if you want your relationships to be good, then introduce this concept in your family and tell me, brother, how much freedom should be given where.  To what extent is it justified to reach freedom, to what extent is it justified to keep it in this belonging, as if whoever is the head of the house is the father of the house, do your round table conference, dining table, our little coolness, this is a blessing.  That's all, now how much freedom is this, tell me, it means you can stay out of the house till 8:00 pm without telling where and discuss, make your own and when you will see for yourself, yes friend, I am getting some freedom, let's meet by talking in written type.  It has been said that yes, there will be no trouble for this much, the wife will not be listed for this much, father will not list for this much, the youth who are our next generation will not go astray, otherwise they will go astray, there are many people who are trying to instigate them because this  Knowledge Now I am giving it from the original tee in a logical way, now where am I getting this from? People have to understand one thing, it is not necessary that all the old knowledge which is written in the big book, he was very great and that too.  We were humans, we were humans' children, we too are humans and we too are humans' children, today we can wake up from our conscious and do some things and take something new which is not practical for us, it is not necessary that it reduces the old one, it is okay, there were no mobile phones, right?  He didn't have much on time. He didn't have much time on time. Well, there was no internet yet, neither could we talk to each other like this, nor now a Guruji could teach only 100 people under a tree and he had to roam around and roam around, then in 50 years he would go and do something about it.  Ideology theory was divided and little was happening here, it is happening very fast, so time is only changing, so we are changing from time, these are the best times, if we look at this kind of thought process and these  We will also learn the concepts of Belongingness, this is the ultimatum of freedom, date, happy moment, okay, not belonging, you are the other big note, doing Shaadi Charan, bald, me, body, me, mind, my will, my book, there is fulfillment in it, there is no purpose, there is a story, there is nothing to be, because there is ultimate emptiness.  Hi rahna hai tu match ware only de belongingness is brother-in-law and brother-in-law is no human freedom nothing you can do you bill again This is absolute freedom, this is absolute belongingness that only this story has caught hold of belonging. In the middle of this we have a sliding scale and we have to operate on it and that Harley will be a little different in every situation because I mean not like you belong, you match you.  I am institution where I am right because date can change so same should I be in fear be I like some freedom in marriage I am willing  You give up a little beat more freedom because here I have to tweet this to you people, change these things, you people will not find the formula from each one that I tell my parents, wife, children, brothers, sisters and to bow down before them.  I am ready to adjust as much as I am to my friend or acquaintance or distant relative or public and there is no bad thing in it and from this think happens across the community this also we do that.  Caste, religion, we too, it happens, no, not like this, oh brother, it must be, maybe you are the king, you are the Prime Minister, you are in that position, then you should not be I, I am the minister, I am the minister of, or you are the one, then you are the one for everyone.  It should happen then you should not think that I belong to the state and it is so because you have reached this level but for the rest of us, it is natural for us, it is natural for us, in this we do not have to think why this should happen.  Used to be  If I am from Haryana, it is okay, no matter how much I awaken my guru element, it is okay, it will awaken a lot, I have become a very high level guru, although I am thinking that I am going in his direction, I myself realize that when the people of my community People from my state, after connecting with me, think that maybe something special will happen for them, the story is ok in some way, in my consultation fee or in pricing, I actually don't like it that much, you be this think so.  My sense of belonging is fading from here, I am moving towards freedom, but this is individual choice, individual choice, then I have that identity from within, all this, there was also a third element in it which I had added now, it would have been very orderly.  And there will be confusion, gradually when we move forward, he will also put that identity with whom you identify, who you are, with your gender.  Do you identify more or are you identifying with your chair position that you have got in the society, whether you are an officer or a VP in a company, a CEO or a scenery employee, whatever you are, it means you are identifying with it, it is fine.  You should be more antifa with your money because if a man identifies more with money then it is a business transaction, then your second blocking in it is where has your belongingness gone? Now if I do, then there will be confusion.  If it goes then I will stop it, I left a hint ahead that there was a third variable, so now I have not told the simple equation, friend, understand this much, then we will also add the third variable, there is a fourth variable, there is a lot of variable in this way, life is very layered, it is simple like this. Whatever I am saying cannot be understood like this, I cannot explain these things through animation, nor am I doubt, doubt, educated, this is my speech, your concentration should be on my body only.  If you understand the language, emotions and energy, it will be easier for you to understand and I have a request, please make a copy, make a notebook, make a notebook, make notes, because this is not what you get in the book, I am also not going to write this original inside.  Observations and insights have come from this site of this world, this story is not just like that, I just wrote the story and no no, it is from the reality of life, yes, it is our emotions and  This constant - meeting people, being jealous, understanding their pain and suffering, giving consultation, all this comes out of those things, okay, my happiness course is one of my own, I think it can be a legendary course, okay, and I do not do any advertisement for it, no Google ad.  Nothing is fine but I think not even a single person is disappointed, many people have done it, if you want to see that happiness course, then you want to take one for free, then you will get it through up and if  There is also a part of platinum membership, you will get to see it also, then you can take platinum membership in other way but interested in doing date happiness course which has bin record it is in seven class which further bin kid classes are also there and it gets you happiness in  Then and it makes your consultant also date is a surprise elite of date you become a consultant and you can Start earning money from people is fine and that is medicine and there is a lot of reasoning, it is not that ₹ 10 lakh is nothing, platinum membership is nothing, enjoy whatever you see, make notes and see, you will work hard is what I tell my people.  In that, the one who makes notes, the one who makes notes, the classes of life are over, now in life you are 25 years, 30 years, 35 years, you have lost your job, you will get married, you will have children or you are 45, 50 years old. Now let's say notes, but now I am going to tell you one thing, remember that the person who makes notes, only those notes are useful. Brother, what is to be done, what is to be done, to make notes on your own.  What to do inside will come, it will come automatically, those who want to take platinum membership can join or can take it very easily by pressing the join button. Those who take it can connect me on WhatsApp platinum group.  I will connect you people, I will keep bringing some abstract topics like this, no one is bringing, no one is explaining, I also feel that maybe not so many people will understand and subscribe like this, it's okay, this is my name.  What I do is okay, you people only a little bit of mine is what you people call your own Chetan Jagan This is date exact word When people say na witch is a good word is okay Something from within Jagan is okay  It is okay to awaken consciousness and make notes with your intelligence and discretion and see that I can take control in life.

Let us come together and do not create any organization or any cult or any institution of our own because it is the institution that benefits from the institution. All the institutions that are running till date have only benefited the institutions, a little or a little.  They feed and drink, they do not do anything charitable. Thoughts which are but other vices, if not much has changed, then it would have been visible in the country because heaven is visible only by killing itself. Proverb: If you want to see heaven itself, then see it yourself.  The story has to die and if someone else does something, it will not happen, then you do the hard work of M.S. Off course, there is some element of relief in it, okay, to bring 90% free content, there is also 2% content stomach, okay, so that it can be more  If it can be understood well then I hope those who are connected are all good taken happiness and enjoyed please write in the comment area ok rest of you guys when you attended live there was very good feedback people are also enjoying the rest of the recordings which are platinum  If you have taken membership then do not forget to check it, those classes are available there along with the classes and they are very good, there are also question answer sessions in it and there are many templates of life which are there.

    "title": "All Sarkari Naukri Seekers Should Do This Homework First [tEUk5iORuSU].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, this is a very important topic, especially according to what is going on in our times, this is a very practical helping video for the youth. Through this video, I will tell an exercise and a task to all the people who are preparing for UPSC Govt. Banks are preparing for jobs, Railways are preparing for anyone's job and the second thing is that the qualification is that they do not have the support of reservation, they have the support of reservation.  Keep applying, there is no problem if you fall in this category, I am telling you two to four categories, first category, you are preparing for any kind of government job, second, you do not have the support of reservation, you are not getting it.  You are not in that category, you are in the general quota, okay thirdly, you come from a middle class family, you do not come from a poor family, the poor understand what happens to the one who does not pay tax, who is poor, what you can call creamy layer, 8 lakhs. Those who come from this family, thirdly, I told you these three things and listen carefully, what you have to do is you have to do exercise. This exercise can be done easily in a week. In this you have to talk to 30 to 40 people.  You will have to do this five times daily and you will have to somehow get their numbers from your parents, relatives, friend circle, each other, whatever job you are preparing for, like whether you are preparing for Bank PO or UPSC or  If you are trying to become a person anywhere in a government system after passing the exam, you will have to talk to a person who has more than 10 years of service in it for 5 minutes, then you will have to talk to 40 people, talk to him for five to seven minutes.  So it will take 200 minutes of effort and when you prepare for so many hours, then only one part of the preparation is that you have to ask them five-seven pointed questions that how are you feeling is it worth it, I am preparing. If I get selected, what fun will it be? Will my wife also be able to get the job? Will the posting be at a small place? What are your challenges? Are you happy and you have to compete with 40 people in that same segment? If you have my challenge, my challenge is a big challenge. 33  But if people have told you, i.e. 13 out of 40 people, if 13 out of 40 people have almost told you, 13 or 14 people, guess 33.  But at 13 or 14, you should apply the formula that yes friend, you should do the job, it is fine then you prepare for that job, but if your result is that out of 40, 35 are refusing, 32 are refusing, 30 are refusing.  If you are a 40 year old or are you refusing, then you should see that the person with whom you will talk should be somewhat knowledgeable and knowledgeable. You should tell him about your family and all that. If you yourself are the child of a government employee and the child of an officer.  If yes, then you should not do it. Normally, most of the officers are not even preparing their children. This is also a fact of life. This is also a fact of life. Then don't create a ruckus here. If you don't go, no one will go, then how will there be government posts.  This does not happen, if you remove the salary of ₹ 1000000 Agniveer, people will still stand there, there is a lot of poverty in the country, dyspareunia, ask once, now on this counter, people immediately ask whether they are from a private job or not. Government jobs are very good, there is so much stress in private, there is so much work in private, in private the boss sucks blood, in private, listen, now with all force, government jobs are also being made like this, so that this thing can happen, we saw how in Bangladesh.  What happens in reservation and all that so that it becomes clear to the youth that now everyone will be made the same and will say that instead of talking about work life balance in your private sector, work life balance in government.  It is being shaken Saturday morning, your work will be done, seen in Covid, a government employee has to do the work, a private one can still say, I will not be on the job tomorrow, a government employee cannot leave the job even if he wants to, there are many such departments where Even if a government man wants to leave his job, he cannot do so. There are rules and regulations to decide when to leave. In a private job, you can leave within two minutes. In a government job, there is security only in the job, there is no security in posting, you risk your entire life.  The country will not change in managing the posting. The one who has got good, he wants to stay in the good, the one who has got bad, he wants to go from bad to better, he has to stay away from the family. In many government jobs, his life is being spent in managing the posting.  It is not worth it, if you are poor then what is there in you too being poor that there is a jump in social status which can be achieved anyway and you cannot do any business, that is a different thing but tell me practically. This is Mukherjee Nagar, this is Old Rand Nagar, I live here, invest 10 lakh rupees, pay rent, pay coaching, waste 5-7 years, I will not even suggest doing business anywhere else, people say, it is not so easy but on work.  You can do your own work and business. There is a difference between self- employed. Doing your work alone and taking money as per the project is called gig economy or you can do a private job. You can do your work by doing a job. You have to focus.  Youth have to focus on earning money, not on becoming something, life will be set. If you talk to any government employee, life is not set with him, posting can happen anytime, no matter how good the city is, the government quarters will be inferior in it.  If the window opens, it will not close. If it is closed, it will not open. So many of them will come out from inside the geyser. Plaster will be put in the house and it will look as if you had seen the parrot ad that the parrot has got dandruff. It is falling from above, okay?  If you are in bad condition then why should I not do it? Why should I not do it? Why should I not do it? Why should I not do it? Why should I not do it? Why should I not do it? What harm is being done by motivating it? Motivate it not motivating. If there is no posting then the house is bad there also, similar type of work is being done there too but mostly check the place in which you are going, why are you comparing the perks of this government job?  Privileges and the status and the place you are getting with what I am saying is when you are joining this if you are going to join bank PO then child you have three places in Maharashtra Mumbai Pune Nagpur After that there are many places which are not named  People have heard that Maharashtra is progressive, I am not telling you to go to North East or there, I am not telling you to go to Jharkhand, I do n't even know where the posting will be done there and then there is sycophancy.  Sycophancy and your boss is not good, then your posting is bad. How many people are identified one after the other. In any job, if you have got it after working hard for 7-8 years, then it does not seem bad in the first year, you are getting the salary, but you are getting it. Gradually the realization comes that those with you are doing better by moving ahead, if they live at the same place then they can change jobs and their wives can also do jobs. Their children should also not change schools. Then when she has to pick up her family and move around, she has to do this every year for two or three years, then it is a big trouble. Bureaucrats are poor devils. Not even six months have passed since the posting, there was some flood there, something else happened, DSP, sorry, SP, DC or someone else.  And the officer in two minutes because that public outrage, whatever happened, what is his fault brother, but we have transferred everyone, whatever happens, the transfer of DC is such that people are appointed for DC DC and then transfer, transfer.  After standing in a line somewhere, then you are half depressed, how many people is this happening to, is it worth it, see if you are a reservation person then enjoy your chances are better, work hard, if you are a reservation person and if you are a  I come from a very poor family, so whatever happens now, it will be better because tell me Guruji, there will be a roof there, some of the paint will come off, so see the condition of my house, I have a tin roof, at least I If I am an Aadhar Adhikari, I don't even travel on a scooter. At least I will get a car. It doesn't matter if I get Desire level, Desire is also not a bad car. It is not necessary that it is bigger or better than that or it is Kastha or something like this.  If you get a car of this type, it is not available to any officer in the beginning, then we will manage the work in it, it is fine for him, it is fine for him, he should do it, but if your work is decent, then it is fine work. what is the definition  You will decide this. Normally, I can say that your parents are not very dependent on you. Financially, even if you get a job for Rs 40,550, the starting price will be Rs 60, but that too will be one and a half to two and a half. You will live in proper civilization. You will be buried in the jungle and mountains.  Won't eat in the forest, it feels good to go for a walk in the mountains to calm your mind when you are in a big city for 300 days, 350 days.  But when you live for 300 days, 400 days, you are not 400 days at all. You have to spend 300-350 days in these jungles, mountains or in a small town and you yourself are born in a big city. It is depressing. I am dealing with true cases.  That's why I am telling you, I am indifference, I am saving all the money, there is no work, but brother, you have to go to catch the bus, which is 10 kilometers away, then by bus and then to the railway station again.  There is no flight 50 kilometers away, 200 kilometers away, 300 kilometers away. To go to your home or when you come back from vacation, you will have to use all the modes of transportation which we read in the charts, which children learn in KG etc.  Whether it is horse cart and then the bullock cart, small tempo, big tempo, bus and train, all will be used. In such places, there are very few people in such places and in such places, even mobile phones do not work, sometimes it is good.  Yes, there is such a place in India where one has to sit under a tree, go here, here is the signal, here is the signal, there is work like this, there is work like this and there is different stress in it, there are the bankers, there are the bankers, I made a video on the bankers, it has become a super hit. Bring a target and open an account. Where did you get the target from? Brother, they are not getting any taste of life. Where will life insurance be sold from? Will you sell them a loan? Will you sell them a loan wherever you live? In Gurgaon Delhi, people buy a loan.  We buy a house, buy a car, in the houses where you are posted, there is nothing in the PSU, there is silence, very very poor people are also becoming unhappy in 15 years, the very poor are leaving the house and  It is coming with the help of reservation and that too is getting fed up in 15 years. It is getting fed up. Those who seem to be stuck in their jobs, want to prepare for VRS and want to follow its criteria, then that is it.  Beyond that, the video will also be available. Write the VRS you want to take on the comment section so that I can tell you that it is not worth taking it because this government job is like riding a lion and riding a tiger. It feels like a lot of fun.  I feel that the lion will eat or leave it, it gets married or does not get married and gradually the wife in small towns does not come because the girls these days, if you are a well-to-do city boy, then you marry a girl from the village.  not doing you  I also know, but your job is at the village level, then which city girl will come to the village, everyone will go away, after staying for one or two to six months, she is going through depression and marital issues and when she got married, she had worn an apron.  And he was told to the girl that no, this is the first posting, this is the second posting, she will be in a big city, she is a government job, look, marriage is a matter of chance, or if you are a government servant, then marriage is definitely there.  It was done but posting was not done because many people are not able to do so. Now posting is not being done. He is sitting alone. He is married. He is not getting hot food. He has no sex life. No marital life. No. Depressed, what to do with him too, what to do like this? Brother, don't tell me, Guru ji, she has gone, she is teaching in school, in school, in the city, she is saying that if you want to come, then you are not supposed to come, posting will be seen, my posting is not happening, what should I do, tell me what is happening.  you for five years  I was determined to do it inside her, then I thought of you. Many people have left private jobs and even left good jobs because their family members said, take it, take it, the dynamics are changing. I have included criteria in this.  And this is my campaign which will continue. In the next four years, government jobs will become such that even if they are available for free, people will not like to do it. Will there be a commission on the 8th, brothers and sisters? According to you, it will not come according to me. Accord formula will be applied. That's what you want in the video. It is not good for a government servant to speak like this. Government employees say, ' Employee, Government Employee, OK. For a government employee, if you want, I will tell you the same. There will be nothing to look at.' Increment on forward and 3 has to be done. On July 1, there cannot be five instead of three. Do something and then that.  When your growth is so limited and on 3rd, only D increases on basic and your DA increases once on 3rd and once on 34, that too increases on basic, which is a part of the total salary.  If there is a particular part, then your total salary is not increasing as much as the inflation. Brothers, the government officials are not beating the inflation. No, the inflation is at 6-7. Guruji.  You probably get seven, but you are not getting even six or seven. Plus the inflation at your level is at 121 and that is at 6-7. So for the poor, for the very poor, what is the price of flour, pulses and petrol?  It has increased by the same amount if you have to travel somewhere, put your child in some good place, wear clothes, buy a mobile, that one is more expensive due to inflation, then you, the government people, are becoming poor which the government officials could have bought 20 years ago.  If he is no longer able to buy real estate through cheese lets, if he is not able to buy half of it, that means the price has gone out of the market, then doing a government job in the market means becoming definitely poor in the long term. In the long term, the per capita GDP of the country will increase.  But the per capita GDP is saying that it will double in the next 6 years, that is, the average will increase at 13-14, if yours is not increasing even at 6-7, then you  100% are going to be poor, they are not going to be sure shot, government servants get the same, for that, that program is also ending, it will happen everywhere and in the future, how come you do n't know that, uncle, uncle, find out.  Call me, check that also, do that exercise, call me, check if yes, program, it is not worth it, that is the message, nobody is going to tell you, this coaching institute will never tell.  Yes, these coaching institutes are not telling that their living depends on it, no, no, if there is nothing, then there will be experience, there will be nothing, there will be experience, the line of has been now becoming a villain is the line of Divya Kriti ji, many people are getting irritated, there will be experience, what will he do? Why are you attracting people because of experience, it means you are giving a gamble of % and it means people are also ready to play, it is a wonderful attraction power, increase knowledge, it is very good, it is very good. Don't play this game is my message because even if you win there is no good feeling coming off it even after winning because you talk to 40 people who have won the job game in the government. If 13 people tell you to do it brother.  So continue and how low cut off I have set is number 13 out of 40 let 13 people say yes there should be a clear yes do n't say round words yes or  No, clear it and see, you understand, it depends, think, it is good in the beginning, then it gets bad, do it now, then leave it, it is not clear cut, it is okay, clear cut is a clear cut advice from my side, the answer is no, if you are okay.  The family belongs to Don't even try to leave it for the poor and the poor have also become accustomed to this. After a few years, he will also feel poor. Yes, once he will feel that he has achieved something, but that realization will be a secret.  Let me leave one more thing for you guys or is it a long video, if you want to know the secret of government job which no one will tell and this video of 5 minutes will become a big secret, if you want then tell the secret in the comment section.  Write it down and I will reveal the secret. It will be fun. No one has told it to anyone. Till today I will tell it. Thank you very much."

    "title": "Always Appreciate Others ｜ A Belief Sytem Questioned [8QWe_g4owF8].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, there is a belief system that one should always appreciate others. There is a lot of knowledge in the books of the British and perhaps the British have also started changing it. Here, by cutting and copying and pasting the same knowledge, these people are getting hold of it.  It feels natural to praise everyone. Everyone likes to hear praise. You will also benefit from this because he will think about you like this, he will think like that about you, it will come out less. I think it's a good thing. Wrong Believe System: Giving false praise to others or giving praise even where it is not necessary is not required. It makes you a good person and someone who is being praised does so because you must have seen the American culture. You must have seen this culture, that, that. This is not in Asian culture. Actually, in our country, what I am teaching you is not that this is a thing, it never existed, it is being promoted, so I am trying to stop it.  I am saying that this disease has not yet become so serious, we may still condemn it, it is not like this, the Asian culture and especially the culture of our country India is not so much but this disease is just starting. Because of the West, what is theirs, they are feeling so miserable most of the time, everybody late, they all say that I should not praise, do praise, and it is catching on India, but its disadvantages are that now children like party.  Let's separate in some function, in a game in school, we have started getting participation certificates, we have participated, we have finished third, we have got some ahead in the section of small class, we have got some ahead and some, he spends a lot of time, he is very ruthless, till the age of 21-22 years.  You live in a very protective environment, when you come to the market after doing 22, 23, 24, in the job market, in worldly affairs, in real life, then there is no forced money here due to great resentment.  Does anyone get these children who are coming here? I am addressing the youngsters. If you are a parent, then you also have to tell this thing to your children that you have become ruthless here, brother, there is no appreciation here and when you are forced to take appreciation. What is habit and entitlement like? People do not have freedom. There will be no moral load on the child. Appreciate him, condemn him, put him down, break his morale. This is a very different thing from Do forced appreciation. You have to understand that those around you who see you should also touch you. If the boss laughs at anyone in any situation, then all the sycophants are flattered because appreciation is also sycophancy and they do not deserve it, it is nothing, it is this.  There is a different way of saying that sycophancy is non-appreciation if someone is more powerful than you and older than you, we call it sycophancy.  But they are also talking about doing good for their younger ones. They say that you should do it for the elders because it is a compulsion. Do it for the younger ones too, so give them full good about it too. Don't do full good out of compulsion, neither give full good to the ones above.  To the people below, your one thought is not that you all will become construction, but another of yours is that you will be your advice will be the seat's brother, go to this guy or this girl, boy, man, woman, whomever you go to.  Tell him this is right and you will benefit. Someone forces you to counter it. It is an office group. You have to form a work group. Any group of yours is a family group. This is someone's small pearl of achievement. Everyone is praising you. I also try to do very good congratulation congratulation like this. People on my WhatsApp do the same to me. I also see that I give some congratulation and then people don't know what is its real meaning. Well, I spend a lot of research time.  But we should not be in a hurry to do games so soon. It means that if off course someone wins Bharat Ratna or Padma Vibhushan or someone wins World Cup or Olympic gold medal, then off course it is you who should be appreciated.  It was great but it has to be that you do not force something, otherwise my personality will become fake. Everyone says to Americans, I am now carrying the country, this is what they generally say.  Date Fake Americans First he has become associated with the country Fix Smile Fake Appreciation is too much and they have made it that they should do it, so they get short time, they praised me, it becomes our nature, then we always start doing it.  And then the world tells you, then what is the point in speaking sweetly, what does it want? Later you come to know about many things that something is not visible immediately, otherwise you become like that, but you become like this. In this, we have to praise everyone, just as there are people who do evil, they have to do evil everywhere, here I am not at all asking you to do evil, you should not do evil unnecessarily when no one has asked you that.  You don't have to do this too and if you start appreciating forcefully, then date her, make her a bigger message, then do this to her, like a mental model, to this belief system, to this mental model, you use all the mental models.  A series is also being made, now I am slowly adding subtitles to all the mental models in English because it makes it richer, so if you have bin a South Indian audience and end audience which has difficulty in understanding a little English, sorry Hindi. Aati hai to woh titles bhi hai subtitles bhi a jaayenge very small video but they all convey lord of meaning and inko diary and note it on and try doing this End C D Personality change will appear, but turn off this narrative and see what I am telling under end logic, that is, the appreciation should be uniform and genuine and when opinion is asked, do not apologize like this, it was very good.  But don't talk like this in your man, don't live life in diplomacy, this is what I am telling you, I have become a big personality, come in my family but I  Have actually made living and money out of technicality, you guys also make money because people will advise you forcefully, don't do this, I am of you understand, if you don't agree with this for some reason, then if it's a one line reason, please tell me.  No, no, I have to speak well because I have been told that there is no harm in speaking well. We are the one whom you are forcefully speaking good to, who is as good, no, you do not give him exact feedback. And in this, I have also taught you how to take correct feedback. I have also taught you the mental model. Please try to see it in this. Thank you very much."

    "title": "An Unheard Reason For Increase In Rent In Big Cities [jnQceeLL8ec].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, you must have seen that the rents are increasing pan India and many reasons have been attributed to it. Today, I am telling you one unheard region. I am also telling you one additional region which is being influenced by a number of factors and this factor is  Now he will play out further and this will increase his interest, so whatever financial money he makes, hey, the rent is only 3%, it will remain three, it will remain three for the whole life, it is the rand of different things.  Tax will be multiplied, property will also be tax multiplied, in 15 years, it is fine, in 12 years, it will be only 3%, so according to these, the house will never be worth buying because the rental lead will never be 8% of residential.  Because brother, as soon as the rent is paid, the price of the property will go up, so if the numerator is going up and the denominator is going up, then the answer will not be correct, but now this is a bit embarrassing because they have made many people lose money in two years.  Thank you has happened to many people who used to buy mutual funds. These people were playing mutual fund ship and are sitting on 2 4 5 10 15 lakh rupees and the house rates have gone from where to where. So let's talk about rent. Water happened in rent.  Region which is merging, TDS has to be paid on rental above Rs 50000, all the children, youngsters and all others who get it, get it in white, get everything.  Everyone is asking for slips, now they are asking for slips, so the landlord has his white income and if he enters into it, he has to pay tax, then he will not pay the tax since he is his own, everyone has kept it in their mind, brother, this much is my  So this is no playing because as this copycat is going to Kashi from everywhere, every time it has to be calculated and sometimes what happens is that many people have to take loan in future also, if they want to do something then they also have to show their income.  So in all these systems, because of this region, these rents are increasing because wherever you have seen in big lions, especially in Bengaluru, okay, if you have seen in Bengaluru, when a talent puts 30000 in his account, then out of 30000, 21000  The income of the landlord is Rs. 21000, if he is already in a slab and he buys multiple properties.  But ₹ 5000 tax will have to be paid so no this is being calculated by every landlord and that it is reflecting because now the ownership has gone to those people because of profiling of the next generation who are now born in 1978.  Those lands have become more and those 70-80 people are still doing less, so they have an already income, so IF.  You are born in 1970 to 1980s and you are landlord, those from 1950 are retired and some are from early 1960, those 63 are also retired, they would be 60 years old but those who are doing less now, they have one running less women.  Earlier, you used to take money in the name of your wife, the amount in your wife's name was reduced, but now as double income people increase, it also reduces.  I am here and she is becoming a young landlord. I am an actor in the sense of people. I am a millionaire. Those born after 198182 are here. I am reducing my blood pressure. You are also reducing it. There is a house, a house and there is another house, so that.  Due to having so many houses, this thing is happening in rental and in the coming time it will be like this and it will get younger in the future, today the result is now the real estate is getting picked up and it is happening because of this.  When you are suddenly increasing from rent, then money is people, its starters making sense, especially in double income, where wife's tax is also for children, your children are also tax and your rent is also for children and this is almost fast access of Mike, which is a little dr payment if you do your own tax.  Two, from that you will see demand increasing in coming times and yes, three percent will remain the same in residential in long term. But if you book flight today and make delivery in a year. If it is happening, then today its rent is this much and its value in the 3% formula is this much, then tomorrow when its rental value will increase and after a year, the rent was this much, it will become this much, now the bill will be this much B style three.  The day after tomorrow, this Hajj is more, now see, I do it like this, I am not able to see the excel, I hope you all understand, I am Sir, everyone understands, by showing something more like this, force the video.

    "title": "An Unknown Secret About IIT Institues And Graduates Revealed [v8kEk4n-0cM].en",
    "content": "The general information that I have got is that IITs are not offering great packages. I have just got the information that IIT Bombay has not got placements on top 40. Can you tell me the reason? If you want to ask then you can definitely ask a question because it is the best college, so I will tell you now.  Let me tell you something, if the audience wants to hear it again, I hope it's controversial, this is in this zone, so I am the top corporate people, yes, again I can't tell their names, all the people.  So look, you cannot go into investment banking, they are looking sexy. If you are an engineer from the ground then you will have to do engineering related to the ground as well. You will have to do some work, you will have to bring engineers and you all sit like this, who knows what they say?  The top people say, Hey IT people, don't bring the reason. I said why man, he should be the best. They don't talk about the best. They say he has dreamy eyes and are bent out. They say the man has been preparing for the competition for 131 years. He came in 23 years, his juice has been exhausted, he is tired, we have to extract the juice and no one should do the work which he has learned in IIT, brother, the work is of dust and dirt, we have to sell the goods, something has to be corrected somewhere. Also, there are jobs like sitting in air condition, there are four or five people in them, people of one level will go there, that's why even the IIT people, computer engineers etc. are getting set but those who are not are now civil engineers, civil engineers are standing in the sun.  Will it be built? If a bridge is built, then in which AC will it be built? Any good building will be built, any infrastructure will be built, a road will be built, brother, it will be built in dust and soil, you will set up your cabin, engineer sir, where AC will be installed, but still you will have to wander around for four-five hours.  There is no passion in it, that passion is there in other smaller colleges which are coming from other colleges, hence there is no demand for them. Come on, the IIT people will put out some of their figures but those who are on 99 and the public are those whose What will they do if they are not getting into the top IITs? Let the IT people be the athletes. I would say to them that they are very lucky. Well, they are very lucky because why is there no pressure on them now? Those people who are successful.  When they go to college or get a job, they get worried that whether they will be good in relationships, investments or even happiness in life, those who have experienced the first few setbacks are better off than those who already know.  It turned out that if everything does n't have to be great then this is the biggest thing."

    "title": "Animal Movie Deep Dive Analysis ｜ Understand The Undercurrent Amongst Young Men [atzUR6SGTB8].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, we will do a deep dive analysis of Ranveer Kapoor's animal movie, the video will be a little long, there was a lot of demand, there is no review, there are 1.5 crore subscribers, Dhruv Rathi ji has also written his eighth class essay, even if there are crores of subscribers.  You are sitting with it but he has done a very juvenile review, I don't think he has even seen the picture and I waited for 8 9 10 days, let anyone say whatever he wants because  The way I explain, the way I tell, the way I analyze, no one will do it because I am India's number one clarity giver, watch the entire video, then tell me at the end, there will be an analysis of the whole movie, because many people have made it in black and white.  It has happened that whether it is good or bad, it is kept like this, we have to know that those who are liking it, why are they liking it so much and those who are liking it bad, then why are they feeling bad because the movie is worth Rs 500 crores.  It has earned more than that, the Indian box office has become 450 crores plus, the world wide has become 600 crores, the picture can even go up to 1000 crores, so what has happened, then whoever has seen the movie like I have seen it, then this  We will analyze and in this I had made notes by sitting and analyzing each and every thing from the beginning to the end. The video is already giving a disclaimer that it will be long, I will analyze each and every thing thoroughly and tell you all and enjoy.  It will come because it is called a boot licking scene, shoes chatwal with a girl is masculinity, it is saying like this, it is saying like this that we have got enough to do, objectification of female is something bad, many have written that this one will promote rape whereas like this  There is nothing in it because many people have not seen the movies like Shobha De has not seen them and if we have told something then we will discuss it very well. If you people enjoy then please press like, share and also subscribe the channel.  Let's start the presumption from a scene in the beginning of the movie. Many of you have seen it. Even if you haven't seen it, now you can hear that there is a scene in it that defending the honor of the sister being the man of the house.  Scene: I saw the movie in Gurgaon. Why am I saying the word 'Gurgaon' because this is the kind of crowd that has little corporate culture and is educated. The crowd that whistles so quickly. No, you people must have seen a lot in shorts also that people have captured that scene on video in which he is coming with a gun, his sister is inside the class and when he is coming walking, people are whistling.  They are getting happy, they are shouting, the girls are also getting happy, just like me, he went as Jagga Jasoos to make notes, why is the society liking the picture, where is the society going, because I am a social observer, I am  a social Scientist can say what is happening, I should also go and see what is happening, then when he is coming with a gun and is firing it and after that they are scared like those who were ragging his sister and people in it. Feeling very alive because inside every one of us wants to take on the bullies like this. You have to watch this. In the beginning I will tell you the background of the movie. Before I start each and every scene over the years.  Let's start with Raj and Simran, DD LJ is fine, whoever has seen it before or knows about it, when Bau ji says yes, I will take him, even then it felt strange, when Bau said no, Ranbir Kapoor is being called toxic, Amrishpuri was not toxic.  He gave birth to children in England, brought them up and went to Pind with the girls to marry the boy from there without even asking them, what do you want, girl, Simran, what do you want and lastly?  She left that hand till the moment when she realized that this other guy also should not marry her, he had beaten her and if he had refused then what would have happened had Shahrukh Khan gone and that in the train, that would happen later. Recently, Shahrukh Khan's movie Jawan has come out in Talks City, Bhagti Hai, in which the young Shahrukh Khan, who is a policeman, the one whom he is marrying, tells Nayanthara's character, 'What do I say at night, what do I become?'  I come out and he is my ladies gang and what is ours? He marries on the basis of lies. Your character of Ranbir Kapoor is a person in your face, which is not being digested by many people but many people are liking it.  Because for so many years, such pictures were being made where there was male ejaculation and the man himself did not know what he wanted to become, the youth of today and the men of today are feeling very liberated in it.  Tox City: Will he copy? What can be copied? Ranveer Kapoor's character and all those things will be told completely but I want to tell you one thing, there was a picture, Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam, Ajay Devgan's character is to his wife Aishwarya Rai.  The whole picture takes her to meet her boyfriend, this is very much, he should be such a man, he should have such a big heart, in the whole movie there is nothing in the corner, nothing is her dialogue and in the end then she is running here and there.  She is running there and finally goes to him. People are saying, Hey youth, they are confused. Since that time, all the people of India are confused. All these pictures which were made were a female fantasy. This is a female fantasy only, that chiffon saree in the snow in Switzerland. These men do not visualize dancing while wearing it, women enjoy it and somewhere in the corner it is written that when you smoke, it is written that it is injurious to your health.  Don't know what will happen if they do n't write there when these girls dance in the snow in short skirts and chiffon sarees, in Yash Johar's Yash Chopra movies, you may get pneumonia, please don't follow this because females do follow these females.  Right now in winter, in December, there will be weddings in North India. Men don't know what they will be wearing and they will stand at their weddings with a cap on top and a glass in their hand and like this and ladies. See what kind of clothes she comes wearing because give her a try all that is in her mind too, I am showing this crazy thing, where is it coming from, for how long, yes, if you analyze this movie, then when things like this come up,  What a movie is being made, what a movie is being made, this was not a movie of men's fantasy, this is a man 's fantasy movie, made by men for the man, it is becoming so complete only when I watch it scene by scene.  A. I will analyze the entire movie. A male fantasy is being played out everywhere and it has never been in the movies and has never been discussed. Many people want to think and say such a thing and they are not able to do it. For example, in the first scene, I have told about it. After this, there is the clan ship brotherhood that men need that brotherhood very much these days because they have become lonely, anyone comes inside the city, anyone gets scared, threatened and there is no such brotherhood which  That if you go out of the village and associate with your cousins ​​and those who are part of the larger brotherhood, the family has become a nuclear family, then there is that kind of desire from within in North India, there is a desire in every way, that desire is also played out here.  The second thing I want to tell you is that being able to tell a girl that you love her and may be you love her broad pelvis because that is  How the DNA is propagated, I can't say it, but in all beauty, I did not always do it like this, brother, by doing 36 24 36, yes there is a requirement of the pelvis, there is biology, behind that you go anywhere, old sculptures have also been made which are of a lady.  If there is an accent of beauty, then the waist to hip ratio remains within it. If he has said this, then how can people say such a scandalous thing, you see that when in that he  He comes riding a motorcycle, wearing a jacket style jacket, so in the beginning scene, he comes with a straight face and as soon as he sees that girl, Roja's song comes and he says, ' Yaar yeh toh toh hai'  She is good but after that he does n't behave rudely. He directly asks the girl, \" Brother, isn't she more yours?\" Friend, your sister is looking fine to me. Someone may be mine. The brother says, \"I can't tell you earlier.\" He says, \"Yes, I agree, it's a little late. Now it's like you are boarding the train. The ticket is not direct from TT.\" Go and talk, you are not rioting there, they are not misbehaving by forcing me, straight face in any way, there are many people who do not do this, that means this actor is not making jalibee, in this movie he is talking straight face. Many boys like you and it seems that's why the movie is becoming a hit. Is it straight? It was like stalking earlier, tease the girl, go after the girl, misbehave, harass her, all that is talk city, straight to tell a female that.  Friend, I like you and I look like this, like this, and you should marry me, what's wrong with it, no compulsion, no coercion, no harassment at all, straight forward proposal, ultimately that girl is the one.  Brother brings her one of the scenes, after that, yes man, this comes, you like this, everyone likes it, so that is something which is important, the fourth thing which I want to tell, there is a scene in the beginning itself, Wanting Strong Assertive Sisters.  No toxic man will ever tell his sister like this, she should take over the company. A toxic man will take away his sister's share in the property, take away her sister's share in the business and will say that the sister has a wife.  Di th di stem need to come back stem we are children we are everything we are the men we are the boys we own everything tu ja which man is a man who is telling the sister ki tu kya yeh yeh jis bad hai yeh dialogue hai In that movie, it's just spoiled, do n't say like that, don't say like that, this is it, you are so educated, why don't you come into this business, out of nowhere, you saw that he has no intentions in it.  He does not intend to kill his two sisters, he also says to the younger one, then he says one more thing and in that too, tell me what is wrong, he says love after seeing and says love does not happen after seeing, he says love after seeing.  What happens is I see this, her father is a professor of mathematics, she is clean, she is exactly like this, marriage should be done like this, later it is found out that the one who is her brother-in-law, was a scamster's son, they used to do the same programs and he cheated again.  This is for the family and for the younger one.  He also tells that brother, you do it by watching me, I will do it by watching, so as a brother, if someone says to his sister, do it by watching me and like I have done it by watching you, I did not forcefully pick you up and fall in love with someone just like that, without any background.  If you check, has he become very toxic just by telling and being there and this is the brother who gets slapped for him, every time he commits a mistake, this character is getting slapped by this character in this movie.  If you count, then you do n't know how many are there in the whole movie. If you look carefully, the director is very intelligent. Banga Saheb seems to be of Scorpio zodiac sign. To me, it is okay. How many of you are sitting with the passion of Scorpio, although I am an Astrology student.  I do n't talk about clarity but I have a separate channel for that, but I am telling you that the director is very smart. If you see, he has not abused a mother or sister in the entire movie, then tell me in which scene. Although there is talk of in-your-face sex wax and kachch-vest and all these things, but somewhere there is abuse of mother and sister, that family man is a web seiz isn't it Manoj Vajpayee, see how much abuse is there in it. Look how much Vajpayee Sabi abuses his mother and sister, whereas the name of the series is Family Man and a lot of the world has seen it. I will discuss it now. This video is very wonderful and good, you have to watch it till the end. I will tell you in a very wonderful way that there is an undercurrent in the society. I was just observing it, but you have to see that the directors, film makers or creators are also like politicians who, after seeing the undercurrent of the public, Makes a movie accordingly and people identify with it, second, third, fourth, fifth and 10th, all of them have been connected somehow, it's not such a great story, logic also fails at many places, okay so your Wanting Strong Sisters belongs to him, after that the dominating brother-in-law who dominates his sister. I am telling the fifth point that if the dominating brother-in-law reveals his brother's blood, then there is nothing wrong if he treats any of the sons more like his brother-in-law than his father.  Papa, Papa, it hurts, he says, you are saying 'papa papa', you are very intrusive, this is a normal phenomenon in our house, many people are not able to speak in shyness, okay?  That too, this character also does not say to his brother-in-law that you are saying Papa, Papa, he also says to his relatives, sister, sister or anyone else, he also does not say this to his brother-in-law, but many people feel that hey.  Why have you intruded into our family? What is the meaning of brother-in-law's younger brother, who is his elder sister's brother-in-law, appearing in a family photograph? Come on, brother-in-law, he has still come because we are married.  If he is suffering from these things, then there is nothing wrong if you see this, there is another scene in the same, brother-in-law speaks, like, let me tell you some points, brother-in-law speaks because brother-in-law also ca n't see that you are so intelligent and all this. Why is he talking because intelligent talks, he says that you have gone inside Kerala, you have ruined the ecosystem, you are ruining the name of the company, you are expanding business there but the ecosystem is bad.  And we are being defamed because he is not, he is educated in US, he is a smart guy, ever watch Inga's characters, you will never ever be angry with such an idiot, and all this will be seen in the male muscular man who is in the category of Talks City.  People will make mistakes, that will happen but he is a thinking hero, this does not make him a fool, he is concerned about the name of his company because he has a sense of ownership, brother-in-law is here to live. There is a deal to be made, there is a deal to be made, he knows that thing, Shana, then he says in reply, why are you getting involved in all these things, why don't you behave like a rich boy, pushing the car from here to there, this is the image.  Hit the brats' car, have fun, travel the world, thinking individual, thinking about the family is not wanted, after that there is another scene in which ting up to do sycophancy to the powerful people. Brother-in-law says CM has come to meet you, he says I don't want to meet CM, business does n't happen like this in India, he says I do n't have any business, this is business, do n't do sycophancy of powerful people, toxin which is actual child, you are my subscriber, youth, don't  You want my friend, I don't have to lick someone's unnecessary sycophancy and all this, why should I do business, why should I run back and forth for politicians, so that's that.  Every character of his is saying everything which in normal things we are being understood as if he is a rebel, he is a logical man and is not a rebel, like if you hate teachers who can and intimidate us, we all hate teachers in childhood, who are Neil down here.  Hit there, hit there, do it like this, be rude, then doing beyond that is not a bad thing, then in one scene, wants a strong assertive wife also who stands up to the  Parents also, there is a scene where when they are finally getting married, his wife is sitting and when she kisses the parents, she feels like this, Bhaiya, you stand up, I am not here like Raj or my father.  Will give and then I will wait You be strong enough to tell the boss that this is the man Accept he only wants that woman And now 2023 is going on 2024  What these men want is that the girl we marry should not be docile or petite, she should also have the clarity that yes, this is okay, I am feeling okay with this and that, they should tell their parents.  Instead of saying ' Bauji, Bhauji' and 'Bhauji' being Hamlet, I want to do it with you, then tell your father clearly that if you want to do it then this is again a female or male.  The fantasy that happens after that is to always take your beloved in a plane, whenever the plane is flown, they also make you play out in it. It is okay that the plane is being flown, now look at that guy, he knows how to drive, Ghan is driving. Flying a plane is all a boy's fantasy. It is a male fantasy that we know how to fly a car, not a bike. We also know how to fly and if we have a plane, there is more to this. If we watch the movie, then all these things are playing with the big guns.  Now many times what is said about bringing guns after doing duty, now the females watching or the elderly ladies watching do not understand what is happening in this, now someone is saying that violence is violence, more than this, it is Swedish Games. Wherever there are some things, there is no cursing of female gender, women are not being abused, no one is being abused in the name of women, yes Royals Roy's Fantasy is playing out black is that which one is it Range Rover's fantasy is doing a okay so all these things are happening in it then another one and that thing if you see okay wanting to be served by the wife that in that  No matter how rich a man is, if he gets hurt in one, why is this maid giving me the maid, why don't you give it, this is a basic requirement of men, no one is telling me. Because in the default setting a man feels that I am an ATM and he will put the card in my mouth and take out his money, then he wants from inside that he can make me drink tea or give me some cooked food, but You serve it, this is a wish of all the people that now you do not detoxify it, do not even celebrate food and do not even earn money and man is going from morning to evening and every man is working, earning money and is in tension.  So that female toxic man may want this, it is okay and you must have seen avoiding in loss but interested in what they are saying because he avoids these people because he knows that they do not like him, but still peeking.  Listens to what were you saying, what were you saying, what were you saying, that is important, okay, you must have seen that scene, then another normal thing, at some stage in this, his stomach goes out.  If you get injured, if you don't do exercise, you become fat, then by extracting that dialogue, that thought process is that of a typical man. A man thinks everything in his mouth, but a man, because of that, he is working on the laptop or his wife says don't.  Don't do it, listen like this and if he is not listening, then she gets up and throws the laptop, then he kills me, this dialogue is to other people, I am sitting there, that brother, stomach discharge means getting out of wife's control, this thought  It is a process for men, men have their own insecurities, just as women have their own insecurities, I am becoming unformed, this is happening, my husband will hit his mouth here and there, will do this, men also have these insecurities that brother, I am not so fit.  If I am not like this, then I do n't know whether my wife is mad at me now or she used to listen to me before me, she used to do this, then a scene will come forward in the same, when again  Then he becomes fit and then he wants to remove all the clothes and show it to the world. Again men are young boys and lot of people are able to identify. There is a connection. Now like I have told you the address of mom and dad but this one who is like  The pressures of modern day, I will give you an example in this movie that you should do a lot of grooming and wear sexy clothes. No toxic man will tell his wife that she is a lover.  What a luxury Vajri is wearing. Wearing sexy normal clothes, I like you like this, it is a female pressure, isn't it, I want to look younger, wearing very sexy clothes, this is visible in your face, it tells you that it is okay for your wife.  Do n't tolerate criticism from your parents at all. Again, not a typical male thing. Don't listen to me. She won't say anything to my father. She used to say, 'Your father is dead. How can she say all that?'  He has done a scandal before in that scene, but the very moment is when he says, your father dies, he takes out the gun that now you call me a lot of men, want to actually not tolerate even one thing, one negative thing coming from wife's mouth. Against his parents, it is a very man's thing, it is not right or wrong, it is that no man wants to hear his thoughts against his parents. When he tries to do the same thing with his wife, I do n't know how many times he gets slapped by his wife in the whole picture. It was only in one scene that I thought I was lost. He says, I will slap you if you hit me.  It's okay if he falls in my sight, but he doesn't kill, eats, says that I will kill you if you say this or do this or take my cigarette or does something and says something. There are many people who  There are addicts, his wife smokes cigarettes, he likes chilli a lot, why does he feel at times that you want to control me, we are not talking about right or wrong, but from what has been shown, it is so very very common, this happens all around. As a man does not want to come under the control of his wife, this is a typical Indian fact, so now it will be due to Toxin, he does not want to come under the control of his wife, but is he keeping his wife completely under his control? This is not seen at all in the movie.  The wife works in America, there his wife is writing a good report card to her parents and says, yes, we have two children, you have not come, neither my mother-in-law nor my mother has come, he was standing there with both the children.  I was standing in the delivery room like this, I was bleeding, this was what was happening to me, he was serving me by pretending to be a nurse, he was serving me by pretending to be a nurse, so brother, then this happens to the men of today, am I telling you? Another very important one is this  Let me tell you a very high point of the movie. It is being said that people will copy Ranveer Kapoor or he is a bad example. Boys will do it. You tell me if you have to copy him, his father is the richest man of India. In the movie, this is his house.  He leaves her when she gets angry with him and says, \"I am going and goes with his wife. How many people are there with whom father and mother do not leave the first floor of their two BHK house in the best city of Delhi? They go up and down Gurgaon every day.  And every day there is conflict in their house, more than 3 lakh 4 lakh children come from Delhi to Gurgaon every day for jobs, they are stuck for quarter of an hour in front of the humid mall and such things happen every day in the traffic jam, to save Rs. 000 fare they have to pay Rs.  It is not spared, they are not serving the parents, the parents are 55 years old, the mother is 52 years old, myself is 28 years old, the wife is 26 years old, no one needs service.  No one is sick, Uttam Nagar is not a very great sexy place, but we will go up and down every day because it is not coming out, hey, copy Ranveer Kapoor, go, he has a different spirit, so stay different, he also does his job, he goes to America. So he doesn't come and say that so much of my father's money is gone, so much is gone, then if it is not so easy to copy everything, this is so stand basically females like decision persons who take decisions, the hero in this movie is Ranbir Kapoor.  There is no confusion at any time in the scene, it is very clear what to do, what is happening and what has happened, he does not say this to anyone, you see, you see, see this because most of the boys nowadays have become like this.  I am scared, I don't open my mouth in front of anyone, I don't open my mouth in front of my parents, I don't open my mouth in front of my wife, I don't open my mouth in front of my boss, the frustration is very high, it seems that if I do this, I will lose my job, my wife will go, my parents will not give me money.  don't know what  When it is done, this character comes who is in your face and tells everyone his peace of mind, along with logic, he is very annoying to many people and those who harass him are facing big problems. I saw one and were asking for a review, just like people come out of a movie, they do n't ask why you were sitting idle for 2 minutes on youtube, how many chances do you get to get up, that means there is always an interval, she is so fair.  They have come looking at dirty useless nonsense with the eyes of hatred, brother means they want to give such a feeling, there is a smile on the face and said to do it like this is absolutely zero, meaning to do it like this is to do it like this, very good action of body languages and my  I am laughing, I am laughing, I am watching the reel like this, I am saying that brother, she was looking bad, the picture of three hours and 21 minutes is not known because the next director is yet to analyze.  Yes, we will talk about the film making of the movie, but we will not even talk about all the characters, brother, after one scene, the next scene, the second scene, the third scene, all in one scene takes a person to such an extent that oh, now they are flying the plane. This is love and affection, something is happening, their good boy and girl are this and that, then in this time the plane is going to crash, tttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttstt See in the scene with Bobby Deol, first Aise Aise Karke Daru, that song is going on, Shaadi is going on and you are like a little now, I am relaxing, suddenly a scene comes that what is said inside her, some man comes and is taking out her eyes.  Hey Bobby Deol, it's all bloody and you are shocked, what happened? I was just having fun, now something is happening, then all those women are standing before him, those two wives, that one other male.  Fantasy with three wives, because if there are three wives, how will it be, how will the work be done, all that fantasy has been played out in it, those wives are smoking his cigarettes, those wives are smoking cigarettes, he is gouging out his eyes or like, what is happening?  Then he wants to do something else with her, all the women shy away and then he goes to the next scene, there is a knife scene which was seen in the trailer, now you could not understand who is doing this. Then I kept doing it like this and then I came to know that both the wives, two wives, this one inside, three wives, again some male fantasy, then you are saying oh, this looks strange, a smile is coming on someone's face from inside, someone is looking here and there.  Everyone is watching over there, I was just making notes brother, it's okay because for me this is blood, blood and all this, I am a Guruji man, for me it is just an analysis, I was thinking of doing a review then.  I have come to the analysis because the picture is beyond the review, brother, this is a picture with analysis, that is why the analysis is going on, I am doing some small things in the dark and making some notes with my pen, but in between, people  I am watching the movie, I am also watching the people, I am watching the faces of the people, this is how I act and tell them, this is how it is happening with [praise], those scenes are changing like this within a minute. Bobby Deol is dancing, then his wives are smoking, you get completely scandalized, then he does some action scene, then the lady goes away, then he does the knife scene, till then you are becoming like this. Till then he is inside his ground, Bobby goes out on the road and is killing people with a gun, knock knock knock, then some man sits down and is like man, so fast, so fast, knock knock knock knock knock knock cut.  Cut, now there is a scene in which Ranbir Kapoor is coming to kill them, Scotland etc. She is his grandmother, she is like Bobby Deol's very docile looking female, the old beeji beeji says, oh son, this is what happens to the one who forgives.  If you leave some knowledge to him then what happens in normal movies that normal movies are made first like if a lady says something then the hero will show big heart, there will be some story straight, it is an in your face guy, it is okay. On Vangaparaon, his fire says, Listen, this knowledge was to be given to your grandchildren, don't give the knowledge to me, it's okay, it was to be given to you, again in your face. All the people who are feeling the problem of this movie, that problem is not a higher cause.  Whatever actions Progo Nist is doing, all those actions have already been done in all the movies long ago but they are given a higher cost. Patriotism Nationalism. For someone, this is in these.  Your face is the first thing, the rich man is standing up, his family is doing things, then people do not understand that. If he is a poor man, he can do anything. If he is a young picture or he is, now the farmers are working for the welfare of the poor people. He hijacked a train for the welfare of the common people, is that right or yes, he hijacked again and then he became Robin Hood, there is a corrupt policeman inside Chulbul Pandey, he is justified because  He gives a little amount of money to someone, he gives a little amount of money then corruption is justified that you do corruption as long as you do corruption of 10 crores and distribute 10 lakh rupees out of it, in some you get 9 crore 90 lakhs.  Keep it for 10 lakhs and become Rab Pandey. In old movies, they used to tie women with a rope or the hero was a man and she was dancing in front of the villain.  Heroine, you must have seen in all these pictures Basanti, don't dance in front of dogs. Basanti is dancing in front of dogs, then Gabbar is breaking what he is breaking. What is he breaking, he is breaking the bottle. Then beyond that, Basanti is dancing, she is bleeding.  We had seen such stories in all of them, the climax scene used to be like this, all the songs were like this, here no woman was tied like this, nowhere else was anything like this broken, now that famous scene which has its explanation. I give what even these actresses are not able to give, I do n't know why they are not able to give because brother, the picture has been passed by the censor board, that means the picture is fine, it is A category, it is animal, but if the censor board has passed this much sensitivity then it is in a wrong way. Now Prasoon Joshi ji is a very intelligent man, today I will give the explanation, it is very important for me to give that scene also because I am a clarity giver.  There is a scene in which her character is determined to kill her father. She has met that girl with the character's name Zoya, so he tries to have a relationship with her and then he is not.  Serious about it is fine and he says to the girl but then there is a scene in which he says o if you love me lick my shoes ab is lick main shoes wala ko itna  I thought that this is more like male toxics, toxicity that brother, I have no emotional attachment to her, no love affair, because if any man loves any woman, if there is any emotional connection, if there is any relationship, then brother, he will love that woman like this.  I will not insult you that you will not come and lick my feet. The very fact of doing it is a trite convey to everybody that there is nothing of mine and yours now.  Take it as this that this man has done this to all the women and this is toxic, he does this to everyone, then you are not thinking like a movie because brother, you have to think like an intelligent human being. When American movies are made, they do not have so many explanations.  The Indian audience needs an explanation. If you see this, there is another scene in it. Even if that Sunak is heard, people feel a little bit like that when Ranbir Kapoor goes to Scotland to fight his Bobby Dale.  When he goes to fight, he closes the door and says to his wife, if I don't come back then what is the normal dialogue now, if I don't come back then you live your life, you carry on and you know life, he says. Don't Marry Again This Is What Men Actually Think Some Tell Some Don't Tell In this, many such things have been said that men may never tell their wives even after 10 20 20 years of marriage.  No, when the man is hearing all these things from the mouth of this character, then he is going to the cinema hall for a subdued picture, because I went and saw this movie on a weekday at 11 am, thinking that there will be less people, I will sit peacefully.  I will open my pad and make my notes with ease. Brother, it seems a bit strange to make notes when someone is sitting on your left, you have kept yours, you are fine, but someone else is sitting on the right, yours is fine and that's it.  Then he will say, brother, what are you doing? I mean, after typing, they were looking at my face and intelligence and many people were thinking that I was a mismatch. Why was it okay there because the crowd was also a young one.  No, it is very fine and I was watching everyone that brother, whatever your character is saying, we all feel all those things but they are not spoken to us, today I am telling women to ask their husbands at any time that  how happy he will be  If you hear that he will die and you will marry someone else, ask genuinely, out of 100, he will speak the truth, if you speak the truth, then no one will say, he is not the same in everyone, no, children are born, that's why brother, I am giving money for my memory.  Now you stay in it, it is not female male toxin or you have something to say, tell someone to say something, in this there is an absent father, one of them is his childhood trauma, that thing is solution, all these solutions.  All these relationships, these husband-wife issues and issues with parents, all this feelingless course, I am also going on, I am covering it when it is being released, this video is right on this Sunday, which will be what, 177th December, Sunday again my  There will be an iconic class of relationship and marriage of two hours. If you want to attend it then you can text A2 on the number given below. We will discuss that thing again, so overall if you watch this movie again, I have seen a lot of scenes in it like there is a song in it, okay which song he sings, it is the Arjan Valley song, what is the Arjan Valley song, that one.  The Punjabi Pho-chlor song is Arjan, who was one of their warriors and who was their very famous commander, his son of the Sikhs and that is a genuine incident on which the song has been made on Pho-chlor and  If you look at that song very carefully, look very carefully, don't listen, sorry, then the sound that is left in the music in the beginning, watch it again after this video, it is Air Raid Siren, there must be many people who have someone from the Air Force somewhere. People must have heard the sound in the place where ships fly. In Ambala, if you are from Ambala or from Jodhpur or from Jamnagar, if I am taking the names of some cities, I am fine if you are from Gorakhpur and which one.  There are many other places, okay so you may have heard it there and you may not have heard it, so I am telling you that this air raid gives this adrenaline, dopamine and it takes everyone up, suddenly what is left is like now you get ready.  So the director doesn't know from where he has brought the music, from where he put his mind to it, don't write him off so quickly, he has brought that Iranian music to Banga Saheb, that wedding music, that kind of music in Bobby Deol's wedding.  It is playing and they are dancing. Incident, now let me talk about some characters and you tell me that the way you come I see them, if you people identification will be a very hit, if you see it in it, then who  He is a director and has brought out emotions in many different ways. He has triggered the emotions. The movie is going after thousands of crores. If a movie is going like this, then you do n't write it off so quickly that you leave it on Talks City.  Because there are many people who are liking it, now that too come forward and say ok, you like the animal picture, you are also very toxic, oh why brother, now you will ask me whether you liked the picture or not. I asked, it is not to my taste, but just as it is not to my taste, now suppose I do not like Chana Bhatura and I like Dosa, then I will not write off Chana Bhatura which is liked by everyone because I I am also a foodie, I know that brother, what are the things in it and what are the other things because of which people like it, you cannot impose your personal things, you cannot say that ask all the bawdis who like Channe Bhature because  It happens like this, it happens like this, cholesterol is this, it is that, it happens like that, cholesterol is everywhere, okay, pizza is very good, is it okay, so this movie has polarized the audience, which movie, which leader, which is this  Kind  Emotions can come out for the love and the hate because ultimately the opposite of love is indefinable with this movie and on the same side of the coin not on the opposite side because who does n't understand or doesn't like or doesn't know this kind of thing. I don't know, I went there so that I could analyze this movie. Yes, there is a lot of violence, but many people also liked Killbill and the British movie.  Which movies do you like? Do you also like scooter games? Bobby Dale's acting is also very good. He cuts it in the end by doing it like this. I can't watch it like this. Oh my God, do it like this in one go.  Dena, what is he doing like this? So yes, there are emotions, there are raw emotions, this is the thing, he comes and thinks, I will do it like this, I will do it like this, everyone will be happy, no, they are not happy. Nowhere in the movie is it shown that the character is very happy. Even after all the scandals, at the end of the movie, his wife is leaving him and then his son comes back. These people also left the scope for part two. It is not like whoever is doing the action. Whoever is doing prog nist action is also getting beaten. When he fired the gun, his father slapped him so much and then sent him to a foreign country for 10 years. It is not that he performed Aarti everywhere. Whatever he did to him  He has to face his ripper cushions when he is fighting so much, as much as he is broken after fighting, they did not show the movie like that when the hero came and knocked everyone down, nothing happened to him, all his bones, cage and ears were shaken.  He was not able to hear with his ears, something happened in his heart, he did n't know that everything was shaken up and down, he also showed it realistically that brother, it is not such a good thing to fight, see, this condition happens due to quarreling, now he is someone.  He said no, he is glorifying it, he is showing the thing and showing its ripper cuts. Now you have to see that this end is being glorified, so see what is happening with it at the end of it.  Whatever he's doing is finding peace and it's not finding peace that's the question but definitely we can't anchor in today's time I'll just finish it with this  What is the main thing, like you see my videos too, I do not openly support that this is Magata movement, this is section 498, females are bad, although somewhere in this movie, females are bad, they are useless, but I have not done it.  I am telling you in general terms that this happens in what is going on in the society. Now someone like me can come and say that this is not a good thing but the very fact is that the pendulum that happens went this way and then came back here.  And went this way, now go this way and come here again, then these things will always keep going on in the society, now I feel that more movies like this will come because of those people and identification, will Yang Saheb's second one come or something else?  So you will keep saying to her that no, it is not bad because right now she is going to thank you for coming. The female one talks about it. When a female drinks and has an affair with 10 people without marriage, then it is called that.  Female independence, female freedom, female choice and man's boyish behavior which is shown by Adeline Rush and if she does anything then it is a toxin called out now because when something comes from mail then it is worth only a thousand crores and thanks to the female for coming.  If she comes then she doesn't earn three crores, she is doing something in Veere Di Waiting, the females are doing something, so I am telling them that this will be female freedom, these people are doing the main work, something.  If you are doing it then it will be a tox city. Men also like guns. The way brother shows violence, the juice comes out from inside him. You are watching it in the form of a movie, I am telling it in the form of a movie, not reality, big cars, Rolls Royce ships, they are there.  All boy things, now you are telling them that you are doing the work of boy boy, so brother, you are very bad, so do not emsculet your boys, your Indian boys and in general this and yes, this is the confusion.  I will leave the boys on this hint, this is my own 25 minute video, I will leave on this hint, the confusion was that it seems that girls like these kind of boys but when they go into relationships with actual real girls, then there is something else.  The only discovery that is being made is that friend, these alpha people are toxic alpha, we want less alpha, which people do we like, which one likes, if you cross this line then it is bad, but if you go below this line, it is also bad, then this  the one  Which zone is it because this movie has only added and created that confusion which the lovey couple was thinking that I have got a package of Rs 18 lakhs in an IT firm and if he does something like this, then now even that might not be liked.  If he is coming then which one do you like? If the one on the motorcycle is there but the motorcycle is not following him then what will you do then which one do you like? There is a lot of confusion here, boys also like it, girls also like it, it is okay, this can also remove the confusion though.  i'm away  I am telling this in a very good manner in two and a half hours in my Sunday workshop, so if you want to join by spending money, then happiness to you, but I cannot impose my taste on the world, now people will say, you are a gaydar picture.  I was saying, don't go and watch Gadar movie. After watching the movie, there is a hatred, that emotion is of hate. After watching this movie, you do n't hate anyone. Gadar movie hurts the real pain of real life. It hurts someone.  It's not like this, it's just a movie, there is no real event behind it which happened historically, it is not based on another ring, it is not based on another ring that we are this and you are this and it is not even like this.  This movie is this movie, that's why I am not telling you guys not to watch this movie, I normally never say don't watch movies, Gadar was one of the only movies, rest I tell you about the movie by making it good or bad. What kind of verdict is there that if brother watches the war, he will learn some things, some doubts will come to him and you must discuss these things and do not run away and poison everything by mail. Because of the hormones inside, this is why this country exists.  This border is protected, your law and order is protected, don't emasculate that suddenly there is a choice when you have to die for the country, the man who will be ready to die for the country and  Will you be ready to die for your parents? If you don't keep your emotions for your family, then the emotions of the country come first. He who cannot save his own mother, will he do for India? He who cannot save his wife will do so.  A person who cannot protect his sister's ownership and does not stop his blood, knows that if someone harms his sister, then what will he do next? I am not at all saying that he should reach there with a gun.  To Not everyone is roaming around with guns but from inside there is talk of emotion and that emotion was so strong that is why there is applause otherwise I have seen so many pictures in Gurgaon, I have never seen clap whistle in any movie. Neither would I feel like killing myself, although even in that scene, I was not inclined to kill. I was like pretty amused that friend, I mean where did you take the fantasy from, he will come back with a gun only, I do n't know if someone else will give it tomorrow.  If I don't release then yes everyone will get it but I was seeing people left and right in the hall. People are standing in the hall full of people. Girls are also whistling and they are saying yes this is how it should be. Now who has this emotion? Who can stop this wrong emotion of yours? How can one say wrong emotion? If it is an emotion then it is an emotion or if you tease me so much and trouble me then it will be like this then that. We cannot call emotions wrong, rest is the Censor Board, there is the law of the country, there is the law and order which will enforce it, no one has the right to take it into their hands, but these emotions are very much painted up inside the boys through the movie.  People are coming out, getting associated, the picture is going on, we ca n't live in its denial, so now the time has come that there are very pent up things, men and the young boys of this country need to come and really talk.  If it is not about things, then this anger will come out in a wrong way. Now that anger is there and it has become known through this movie, just as by putting a thermometer you can know whether there is fever or not, so do not abuse the thermometer. He has given you a reality check that son, you are 102, now you take paracetamol or 103, you start bandaging yourself, doctor in 104.  If you show it to sir, this movie is only a parameter that it is a mirror to the society. Through this video, I am showing the mirror that this is what it is now, this is what it is, if everyone is facing problems then  Should he get treatment or should he just not watch it? He is wasting it. Why did he put the thermometer in his mouth? If he didn't put it in his mouth then he would n't have fever. You can't say that he did n't put the thermometer in his mouth. He showed 104.  So  It is not the fault of the thermometer, it is the fever. Now if she is not well then fix her and if it is normal then tell her that if it is so then in the same way The men need to come out and discuss. The females need to discuss. This should be a case study.  This movie should be a case study in all schools and colleges where this kind of education is imparted. Unfortunately we do not talk about these things, we take sides on social media. People are simple.  Sa ak UP ke Bande hain Launde hain Bhokaal, the film is Guruji Bhokaal hai jaake dekhi kaal to him he got all the emotions which Guruji went and made notes for three and a half hours and then analyzed them or did he also do it but his one word analysis is Bhokaal.  Yes, it was fun and why is there such a thing, why is it a thing, okay, he is from Haryana, he is saying some word of his own, hey boy, did you enjoy it, why did you enjoy it, brother, what fun did you have, those 300 men.  Nasty Arjun Valley Arjun Valley is going on, am I saying this or when will it end? What is the meaning of 'cut', do you have to fight in the hotel by firing that gun, let's fight outside somewhere, it is okay by firing that gun, they bring emotions in that too, patriotism.  If we came for this, then somewhere we would have made it in India, we would have made it in India somewhere, so that that also happens, then this is how the analysis was, it is a very Indian man's fantasy picture which suddenly from 25  There are 30 big scenes, whatever you say, the settings are all fantasy settings, taking them in the ship, taking them for a ride, standing for the family's owner, not bowing down, if you look at the characters in it, then many people have the same feeling as when we got that Pushpa wala.  Tha Apna Jhukega Nahi Saala Bada Adiyar Had Big Airing, But What is the character in this one, he is rich when he is poor, there is a bigger cause, if he is doing something else then we discuss more.  We don't do this, we face problems when educated rich people come and from that the problem comes when corporate boys and girls also get identified, all people become like this, Pushpa will not bow down, neither will the wife, nor will the youth bow down before the parents.  Bow down in front of father, mother in front of wife, bow in front of brothers and sisters, in front of everyone, in front of everyone, meaning to be under control, Yes, OK, Hukum, Ghani, Khamba Ghani.  Keep saying Hukum Hukum Hukum Hukum, they look good, now these days' boys have said, brother, this is enough, Vanga Saheb has made a picture, enough of all the harassment that has happened to everyone, boys, we will make a picture for you in your fantasy.  I will put it here, you want three wives, somewhere you want a car, somewhere you want a Rolls Royce, you want a ship, I will put everything, I am fine and after doing this I will talk to your wife, to your father, to your mother.  If you want then it feels good to do it, otherwise she gets horny and after that she holds her from behind with such ease. This is me that I [ __ ] my wife and she is still convincing me, so this is a big male fantasy. It is real.  This does not happen in life, it should not happen, it should not happen, what should happen, Guruji, we are not judgmental, we are just mirrors, this one has to be shown, brother, if there is dust on the face, then wash the face, do not do it on the mirror, this is a dirty mirror, why did you show this one, it was good.  hey brother  Some people have dust on their face and some have it in their eyes, so we will have to wash it. A lot of male fantasy has been played out one after the other, after many years it is the first time in an Indian film movie.  If there has been a time in other wise, it was shown only to the villain. Other wise, many boys used to think that only villain is fine, he keeps coming for massage, keeps sitting, keeps drinking alcohol, keeps giving straight dialogues, keeps laughing.  Happy Goes Lucky, it's okay, he gets shot and dies in the end, but mostly his life is going well and even in the end, if someone apologizes and something happens, he gets released, okay or is it half good?  Indian youth used to be confused if it is okay to do the work, this picture came after many years, it was all painted up, Shana is the director somewhere, she caught all the emotions and by catching all these emotions, she made Khichdi very good and she is very good in Indian.  The section is liking it and this second Saturday also earned Rs 35 crores, it beat Jawan and beat Gadar for the second Saturday, I am talking about earnings and Indian connection collections, I am talking only about world wide.  Even if I am not talking, this picture doesn't seem to be stopping anywhere. Now let's see more, what is this, what is this, what is this vulgarity, is there anything else, there is nothing like this vulgarity, if you look at it that way.  The husband is talking to his wife, he would have talked to her in the same way, but they have shown her on the screen, the only difference is that they are not [ __ ], no, this is tox city, this kind of slapping from the wife is tox city, so many males are toxic, right?  If it is, then toxin is quite a reality, you can give it whatever name you want, so I analyzed the boot licking scene properly and told why it was shown in it, if he had to actually do it.  So, Zoya had sat down, so why did she remove the shoe, why did she run away from there, her interest was not in the shoe Chatwani, her interest was in conveying a message, yet she ran away from there, okay, then understand the subtle things which the director wants to do.  Ask the Audience to Know Anil Kapoor also keeps saying something, such females have not been seen in this week. What is the name of Rashmi Mandana? Rashmi, the heroine, is not such a weak character. Hey, the woman who slaps her husband on screen in real life can kill a lot.  And add salt to him and feed him whatever porridge he was eating, she is also not like that, that is, it is okay to compete, it is good, it is equal, it is okay and she also praises her husband and fights like one.  The average Indian housewife or any other wife is like this, she will fight with her husband, love her, get angry, beat her and all this, now if you put a camera in every bedroom and watch the scene in isolation, you will see a very toxic person.  Very toxic women will be seen but only the couple knows the truth that who is like who and who will give the appraisal of the husband whether he is a toxic husband or a good husband, the wife will give it, she will give it.  To my parents that this is my everything, this is my father, this is my mother, my brother, my husband, my everything, so when she is giving, then where are we toxic from, then we are the censor board.  What is your take please write in the comment section, share it, like it, thank you very much and there are many old movies which have changed a lot in the Indian thought process. Movies are not current, there are many old movies, so if you want some analysis on movies, because movies do change the way we think and the society operates, we cannot just say that it is a movie, watch the movie as a movie, no, no, did not see.  Everything goes up, let's try it with our life, okay, so it is easy to say that a movie is a movie, a movie is not a movie, this is also a fact, so if you want old movies like this, then please write in the comment section. Thank you.  you very much"

Ladies, I know Jim has a very good cooking talent, but her husband is not appreciating her such good cooking talent even at home, this is also a fact and it is true that there is no way with which you are rich out.  Other bodies and monetize IT, this is the biggest iron in our country of India, we have so many retirements and we have so many people who create a platform and match this need, the biggest money is in taking that work, then this thing  You will also have to create your own platform in the digital space.

    "title": "Appreciate The Sacrifice Of These Young Men ｜ इनकी कुर्बानी याद करेगा जमाना [IOHtavwIs2M].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, the topic is Appreciate These Young Men for the Great Sacrifice, so if you are a woman, then listen to it. If you are a young man, then listen to it. If you want to enjoy, if you understand what the poet wants to say, then write. It is important to give a disclaimer in the beginning itself. Otherwise, it is possible that it may be misunderstood in that way, it is Satyam, you are ok, a little bit confused, you understand, that is the basis of this, let's start the other topic now, and those who can understand, then definitely enjoy.  Tell me, who is this man whose sacrifice do we have to appreciate and what is sacrifice? So it is up to two people to define them. So these are young men in late 20's and may be in early 30's. Indian men make only 20. What is their sacrifice?  Sacrifice is that these women are not marrying to teach women a lesson so that they know what men are because it says that women Many demanding programs have been made, women do section 498, there is no need to get married when they want and many such things, people also say that when milk is available in the market, then there is no need to raise buffalo, hey, we can go to Bangkok.  Why should we follow you? Yes, very good, you are doing very great and let me tell you what is the benefit of this. There are too many female foeticide in North India. They say sex ratio is very bad in the 90's.  Only the children of 90's are now coming into the marriage market because 2023 is going on, so those who are there till 1992 3 94 95 96 97 98 99, these are the people of 90's, women are less in sex ratio, so they have a choice and North India.  In the setup, look at Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, Western UP, Rajasthan and this belt because the audience is also from there and it is more in the middle class, not so much in the lower class. They are fighting, marriages are happening there and the sex ratio there is not that bad because they did not even have the money to commit female feticide, perhaps they had six children, perhaps they also wanted a boy, but they  They had four daughters, then one boy or two boys, they had children together, they were poor, the middle class of that time, the great middle class, they created a scandal, now they are feeling frustrated that they have created this scandal.  Now our boys have become boys and we have become great but this has turned out to be the opposite. In 2023, girls will dominate because demand is supply. Now there are only 700 girls per thousand boys and out of those 100,200, 100,200.  If there is a request program for girls or if you don't want to get married or are not in the mood, if you don't want to do it, then you want to do it only Rs. 500, then it is 1:2.  It's all about ratio, they have two choices, so these boys are sacrificing that we have to awaken our wisdom and consciousness, if we get a girl of this level then we will marry, marriage is good even if there is pleasure of the body for five-seven years and so on.  It is possible that even girls may get wisdom in this, I am not saying here at all that girls are very great, their aarti should be performed and of course this man is black and this is white, the way they do it is absolutely noble like this.  Are  And here too I am telling them not to behave like this, it is what it is, but you should know why they are throwing tantrums, but what will happen in this that when these people are forced to sacrifice, this is great.  The Great Man Sacrifice Choice No one is selecting him, sometimes even the grapes become sour, otherwise what will you call sour, you will call him this and that, okay, beyond this, I will talk about Bachelors separately. I am going to make a very iconic video, it will come in four-five-seven days, you must watch it, okay, you can become a member of the channel, you can also become a paid member, if bitterness comes in your life, beyond this, I give you a lot of happiness.  Course 2 of mine is starting on 24th November, you can take that too. A2. There will be less number of men for me. Those who are ready to marry her will enjoy the sacrifices. So look at the sacrifices they made. What happens is that if you go to the time of independence in the old times, everyone was taking the batons, some were taking the batons of the British, everyone got freedom, it is okay that not all were hanged, there was no revolution, not all took the bullets, some took the bullets, now they did.  We call them patriots and freedom fighters and they call them years and years, they are not freedom fighters yet, it is 47 years since it has been 706 years, so 14 years.  If anyone is a freedom fighter then he has turned 90, it is very less now but for many years, they got a lot of freedom fighters, so the same thing is here also, this thing will be here also, they will also get appreciation but then they will have to.  Relieve that here you will not get the status of a freedom fighter or the status that our martyrs got for taking freedom at that time, then when you do not get it, then you will say that we sacrificed the society.  So what did we get for this, so it is up to you to take the call who are making these sacrifices and who are trying to teach a lesson to the women, that friend, you have taught a lesson but after teaching that lesson, if the woman who was so called was wrong and it will be right. You have got that happiness otherwise you have to release this thing, are you ready to make this sacrifice actually because as soon as this ratio will be fixed in 5 years because whatever rules of the government. Regulation was tightened, people's self-awareness increased in the society, government increased anti-natal laws, all those laws came in such a way that all this feticide should not happen, after doing all this, the sex ratio of the people born in 2001 was four or five. Born in 2004, things started getting better there, now those people will come to the marriage market, after 5 years then that much will not be there, okay, then women will not have that much choice, so women will not have that much choice.  Let's agree on record, yes there are tantrums but everyone has these tantrums, brother, whoever is in the demand supply situation, when the film actor's movie becomes a hit, he also throws tantrums whether I will take this one or that one, okay, you are a very big celebrity.  So you pick and choose, I will add this, I will not add this, now you are not like this, Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev, people are not asking him much, Virendra Sarbh has to add Kamla's choice, he has to add his  There is no choice, but maybe if someone has a choice, Virat Kohli does not like Kamla because he is a current celebrity, he who has got choice, then anyone who has choice in life will have tantrums, why do you, why do you cry over this basic.  The fact is that you are making sacrifices to reduce that choice, so do it, but your sacrifice is also being recognized.  Sacrifice: I am clapping for you, but I am doing something to wake you up. If you are able to hear the sound of this clapping, then this clapping is being done by one man in the entire country and no one else is doing it. After another 5 years, you will see that other people will reap the benefits of your sacrifice, so you see, you have to do it, don't do it, I tell every man, you have to marry one woman, not everyone else, if you let's end this world.  All women except one should become extremely great as men want which is the greatest fantasy of men which is too much, okay that Libra where the zodiac sign is like there are demand programs, I am telling about her astrology and she is not a woman.  If it is perfect and you will get married to her, then the seduction that you have done, which you have created so much noise about, is all gone because so many things would have happened but yours did not happen and they do the reverse, I do n't know how all the women are but you are fine.  If it is the way you wanted, what would you say, what would you say, mine is fine, I don't know what about the rest, same thing is applicable for women too, so when they say, all men are like all men, all men are like all women. All communities are alike, all citizens of any country are alike, no one is alike, everyone is born different, you are one  Now you do n't have the power and charm to attract a decent person, so the fault is in you, brother, these days everyone has become like this, no no, not all are getting such jobs, so where is everyone getting jobs in government jobs? Even if you go to IAS, 12 lakh people apply and 180 are made, so there you don't cry that why is it so less, you have worked so hard, fight is going on everywhere, fight for the survival, fight for.  It is attractive, brother, that you will also have to come up in the merit list, if you come among the people who sacrifice like this, to get pushed on a motorcycle to awaken the consciousness and wisdom, and then to say that this is just nothing and  We are doing great work, we are not giving birth to children, we are saving the earth, that is why I am respecting you, it is a great job, please save the earth, that is a different matter, the earth is not going anywhere, we are the ones who are going to be saved.  Having more  If children are not born then human beings will go away. Nothing will happen to the earth. You will treat the earth like this too much. The earth will backlash you and will treat you like this. We are not saving the earth. We all are doing climate change and all this. We are doing this only to save ourselves, but to save ourselves, we should also be there, all our consciousness, intellect and discretion have gone to work, then what will happen and the one who is giving birth to six children is doing the same to five, is doing the same to four. What awakens consciousness, intellect and conscience? You have gone to wake up yours, then what happened, hey you are telling all that, you are in danger, you are in danger, you are not like that, no, I am not a party in danger, I am a practical party, we all have gone down from the replacement race.  By mixing religions, now all these things are being introduced into religions brother, the replacement rate is 2.06, if the infant who caters to infant motility is the other wise, then only you and your wife come into life, you are the one who is married, two are born.  If two come, two will go, if two leave, two children, that is, there should be two. Ideally, it has become less than that, but India has so much population, there is too much crowd, there is no crowd everywhere in India, where there is opportunity, there is a problem. This opportunity is of opportunity, if you go to your Tonk, go to Bhadurpur, go to Munger or somewhere else there and go to small villages of Gujarat or Rajasthan.  These are small villages, even the villages of Haryana, and if the entire place goes away, the population will spread out a bit and many places are still very open. Go to the mountains, go to the big deserts, go to the forests, there is not so much crowd like this.  It seems like this in India because wherever you are in big cities, only crowd is visible and that crowd is because of opportunity, the problem is not of population as much as it seems to you, it is being seen and explained, it is not an issue.  And everywhere else in Japan, in South Korea, see what happened there and those women do not say to us not to give birth, they have done the same thing in China, see what is the condition, single child policy was done, now no one has uncle.  There is no uncle, no aunt, no aunt, no aunt, no relation at all. Look at this, if your father does not have any brother or sister, you do not have any brother or sister. Within just two generations, all the relations I have mentioned will not exist.  There will be no uncle, there will be no uncle, there will be no aunt, there will be no aunt, if there is no aunt, then there will be no uncle, if there is no aunt, then there will be no uncle, all relations are over, if there is no mother, then there is no uncle, if there is no mother, there is nothing, there is no one for your mother.  If there is no brother or mother is born alone, then no one has anything, no one has anything and even one's own sibling is not there and the parents got rid of it due to which everyone gets along because Amrit P.K. No one comes, then who is whose, you understand this thing and you yourself should not get married, then you say that I am getting depression, I am getting mental illness, then I am not enjoying life, then I am not getting that.  It does n't matter to you, you make a sacrifice, you will take advantage of this sacrifice, now why did I do this because I used to say earlier, do it with your family, do it like this, do it like that, but if all the things are accepted then it does n't go away, sometimes trolling.  If it happens then now I will create doubt in you. Everyone's mission in this country is still the same. My mission is still the same but I am changing my tune for that. Now I will tell you guys, do you want to stay?  If you want to do it alone for the benefit of this earth and for the benefit of all the people, then I will distract you through videos. Otherwise, keep going, but if I do n't get everyone married in 5 years, then unsubscribe from my channel Kya Bolega T.  Tax  Whether it is okay to donate or subscribe depends on your life, it will give you complete clarity. Send this video to all those who are making sacrifices and say yes, what are we doing? Enjoy your sacrifice. These women who are like this will be noted.  It has happened, now they will come to know and now you have come to know this, now you marry me, many people will do this, boys and she will marry them, will not go to her mother's house, will keep all the seven promises, will lie, will bite the crow.  That is the song of Dimple Kabad, 1973 Bobby Kitna and in the end, Rishi Kapoor would have set it completely, Tu mike chali jaayegi, I will do it again like this, I will do it like that, so this one, this one is happening because of you people who are making this sacrifice again.  So Rishi Kapoor who is off 2029 2028 30 They are going to enjoy And women, you also see what is happening to every person.  Only one spouse has to be given to a girl, a boy to a boy, a girl, we are enough good people, you have to concentrate on yourself that who you are, what you have to offer, not what you have to take, there will be clarity on this too in the future, I hope this thing will spread.  Now he is a very big user, okay Acharya Prashant ji, so this is the message to his followers that we are telling you directly, I am very appreciative when every person talks to that person.  He would like to marry someone who can take him up, only then the society will go up, but what is the problem that this person, what is the logical problem in this that this person should marry this person so that this person can take him up, then how can this person marry this person?  Is it taking you down or ca n't take you up? How can the one who is down himself take the other up? Or you want to find a match in a way where both are down and both are taking each other up, meaning how much?  degree of difficulty  You are increasing it, people need a lot of clarity on this matter, if college is not getting selected, if college is not selected then it is not getting, if it is getting then job is not going, if job is getting then marriage is not going on, if getting married then marriage is not going on.  If the marriage is going on, then the child is not being born. If the child is being born, then the child is not growing. If the child is not growing, then don't do anything else. If you don't do anything else, then there is the trouble of the parents, then there is no money, then there is old age, then there is life crisis and there is no meaning in this life.  And raita is visible  Then what is it, brother, don't go on this path, this is very painful, I want to go to the part of consciousness and intellect, pour 5 liters of water in the motorcycle and keep roaming here and there, awakening consciousness and wisdom.  Keep living your life in a fun way, then you get the relief that it was not so fun, otherwise you did not get anything, then this realization will gradually come to Baba through my videos, I have changed my genre, the mission is the same.  The message is the same, okay, so I hope you all will enjoy, share it and please forward it to all the people with consciousness and wisdom, who are fond of it from within, feel like it is chilli, write it down, write whatever you want. Write everything, write everything because you will write in the comment section only, I will collect them, add them, race them, make a video beyond them, then you will feel chilly again, then what will happen from this, why do you do this?  Yes, I am doing this to increase my views. Yes, you are selfish. Yes, I am and I will try to increase the subscribers too. Yes, this is what you are doing. Yes, that is why everyone does youtube4. You have to see with discretion where you are enjoying. Where are you reaching, where are you getting the benefit, are you feeling good in buying the goods from that shop, is your life going somewhere or is that creator creating confusion in your mind and giving you a destination which will take you somewhere.  It won't take you away and you will keep boiling it like tea and you will keep enjoying it like no flying Punjab, you are getting like this, there are many people who are in such intoxication, this is also a very dirty kind of intoxication, so you have to see it. If anyone had wanted to throw these five-six lines at me, I would have told myself that I make these only so that I can get views. Who would be such a person who cooks food which no one eats? Is it okay? Which person would keep such goods in the shop? Who is not going to buy it?  If a person does such a thing that no one does anything about it, then you see, it is okay, he is doing cheap publicity, publicity is always cheap by taking people's name, spending ₹ 5000000 for a view, then someone is crazy to do this.  Well, it is cheap, every person does cheap publicity, from big politicians to your top movie stars to all the companies, because only when you reduce your sales and marketing costs. Profit margin brothers and sisters increases, otherwise you become a side hustle again. It is okay that you have spent so much money in acquiring a new customer that he is not paying that much money, then you will fire everyone, then you will be ruined, then it is like this.  It is not done that is why everything is cheated, see how many other things I teach you through every video and especially in the end, which not all people see, if they are able to reach 50, 60, 70 then  But those who have not seen it till the end, see what they have missed that these things can be accepted and spoken with such a straight face, it is you who is awakening this consciousness, intellect and conscience, this is my claim, this is yours.  Actual wisdom and intelligence is awakening that yes by talking in such a simple manner then please subscribe and like Happiness 2.0 which is starting on 24th November, enroll for the iconic course.  A2 I will learn everything in life and teach me everything. Now someone will say that these are bad things, they are not things that will spoil us, they are not things that will spoil us, they are very practical things because everyone is taking them here and there, when there is freshness in it, I am practical.  Advice: My channel brings a freshness of air to everybody. I believe in talking nonsense, so join that iconic five class course.  thank you very much"

    "title": "Are You Living A Busy Life ？ [naxYy9VbDxY].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today I will tell you a little extract about the subject to give clarity to it. Even if you are an elder, you should also learn it so that you too can teach people to understand a very small thing. Business is not a good way of life. This is the topic we have discussed about productivity and Increase productivity and increase more in the day, achieve more, do very well, it is a good thing when you are in early 20 but when you are coming, a good day and good life and today you  Grow older you will release this when there is stagnation in your life, peace and tranquility, yes I agree, I want money, I want networking, boss should be happy, income should come, children should come, so I am teaching this concept in a very detailed manner in my happiness course. I am fine and this is just part of it not the whole thing it is just part of it your 7 live classes these people took the course if you want to write something in English then ok  Thank you respect, by the way, marble feedback is very nice, it is fine and in future too, I will keep on touching these things, what are the things which are necessary for a good life and what should be followed, so if you want to take happiness post.  So there is a link of an app given below, you can buy happiness post by downloading it, let me know and on that you will get the recording of the classes that have taken place till now and the upcoming punch live classes are still left, third Friday end.  First Friday of D month, then third Friday of this month and then third till first of next month, then from that there were questions of next month, so now five classes are left live, you can add them because I feel that this course will be quite popular in the coming time.  You people will get to know about it definitely but today I am telling you that there is an opportunity to join live. All the people who have joined the live classes know that there is a different energy level, there are off-the-record recordings also but respect. There is voice recording, but many people have told that that template has been told, so you can definitely take it. It is a class of 2 hours, almost 2 becomes 3, sometimes it is even 2 and a half days but 2 hours. So the class is minimum, it is on Friday at 8:00, so it takes time to understand such gay concepts and it is not being taught anywhere, so I take a lot of I do n't know what.  What do you take for happiness only? It is okay that in getting undistinct you are the people because I think that you will not get it because they say no read the book no there is a limitation of the book because some things are not written according to the Indian setting like you from foreign countries.  People keep reading, something is not going to reach anywhere because there is no feeling behind it, nor is there an Indian behind it, nor is it based on where we live, eat, drink, etc. So I understand the things in the larger Indian context that you do in your life.  If you can implement it immediately, then utilize the opportunity to be a part of live classes because the benefit is time. What you see is that people are not yet connected, they do n't know what they are doing, what is happening, is this what, let's discover later.  It's very fine, it's okay, those who are listening right now, you have a chance, you have a chance, the price point is extremely extremely, very very normal, you will go and CD price is okay, no one is your little one. In today's era of inflation, accounting is just that much and it comes down to the same cost. Okay, so this kind of thing, because that's what I am claiming, you owe it to me, there is a lot of demand for consultation and my.  Consultation fee is extremely high and I don't think so, people should go because of that, what magic will happen in 45 50 minutes, okay here magic will happen in 16 hours.  The content will be fine, magic will happen here and in totality, you yourself understand, because the consultation I give is my extremely expensive one, I give it to you people who are level lottery, you should understand it also, if it is fine, then it means this is the base.  I am waiting for you guys, it would be very good if you connect. Whoever takes it, connect me on WhatsApp that brother, it is okay, although the links will be available on the app, but please give the link on the recording app. I am also creating a separate community so that it is not necessary that I finish seven classes and take whatever courses, I will give surprise packages to them in the future too. It will be continuous. Okay, so it is not just one time, it will be there in future as well, so I will tell that.  We will tell people who join, we also keep some bonuses for this. Thank you very much."

    "title": "Are You Ready For An Early Retirement ？ [hmAU2Xeb8Dg].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today's topic is Are You Ready for an Early Retirement? This topic has not been created, it has not been discussed. The topics that create financial influence are: Retirement, Fire, Financial Independence, Retirement, You Should Retire Early, These are the others like this.  You can leave it by investing in mutual fund like this, then it will become so much when your expenses become this much, your income becomes this much and the income also becomes money. Brother, all this is mere talk.  I have come up with a practical topic that are you ready for early retirement? This means that it is not your choice. You will be fired from your job. Do n't I make tent videos that teachers can do this so that they can sleep well at night? It means that no.  Sweetly she said yes, now I have shipped Rs 5000, now my life will be fine because someone has told me this, okay listen carefully, it is too early for them to retire, the rest means for them.  It is very important for those in their early forties and late 30s because in 45 years the company will fire you after the juice of your singing. This is the message that if you were planning for early retirement, we will give it to you here. Now whether you are ready for it or not.  The topic is because when you are 45, your children are also involved in education and their college students are not married in 8th, 10th, 11th and 12th.  The plaintiff is too far away, is the responsibility or is it too much, have you built the house, have n't you built it, otherwise is it going on, are you ready if something like this happens to you? Most likely, the people I have seen in consultation are not ready, tell me the tricks to prepare.  I am telling you four-five tips to prepare you for early retirement. Here you have to see that I am not preparing you so that you leave your job, I am telling you that your job will leave you, so you should do this first.  Now understand what I am saying, whatever be your skill set in life, you should do well in such things, you should listen carefully to whatever company you work for, how is that company a money committee, then you can know how to take franchise. You know how that company is a money committee, it is a phone company, if you sell phones then how can you make money as a distributor, then take your wife there and take her there.  Is  I am giving a hint that every company has a money committee by doing something, if it belongs to the company, then by entering into the logistics supply chain, it can create its own independence, it can be done very easily and this has to be done by you and those officers who retire at high level.  You are doing the same in corporate, you can give your consultation, there is a lot of scope to do this thing, there is a fear that your company will fire you in 45 and you need to be mentally prepared.  If you are not removed then it is very good because what happens many times is that people holding small positions are removed, it is a small catch, it is late, don't feel ashamed, but if you have reached one level in the corporate, you have reached VP level late, then you have reached something very good. Your status has reached the level, then when you leave the company, even the CEO is aware of it. Now that news has come, why did you not resign but you had to resign, okay, if you leave, then the company is top, that is, a company worth Rs. 7 lakh crores is also known to you.  They leave because if they had a Border Director, they would have to be removed and those who do not have the IIT IIM pedigree, they also need to be removed. This type of consultation on career planning is like what is yours and what is mine? We give this consultation in the team group. If you tell people to take this consultation, then you will see a subscriber group related to my job in the comment area, in which you people will be completely and well prepared for this. How do you move in your corporate and you should understand whether you have utility now or not, as the time of appraisal is going on, is your level one, are you there or do they give different levels to everyone, there is a flood of 12% 10  There is a flood 5 There is a flood You should know from him what is going to happen to you This kind of guidance and mentorship I am no giving through me Kar group me team Okay witch consist of  If I am a professional, have big experience and corporate like or private job then please utilize this service which is of you and this is your return early retirement which is a reality after particular I don't see you working in this job in your late 40s.  People do this world you are going to be true but not in be in these they date you  They will tighten you up that you will not be worthy of them, then you yourself will either get fired yourself or you will be fired and what are the methods for that, what are the things, what are the story players out, my next video will be on that, please watch it.  By liking it and this is called cute quitting, this is called cute cooking, owner rice, what is cute quitting, I will make a video on this too and this is the writing on the wall, like telling something to the daughter-in-law, she has been a smart daughter-in-law before.  She finds out that it is not necessary to understand by coming straight to his face, it is absolutely not good for anyone to do this by doing hands like this, what I have just done, from nobody likes to people want to settle things, a hint is enough for even a sensible person.  So genius means that I will take you people above intelligent, there will be a change in life, so the thing is that I will tell those who are going through this thing, they are able to understand, who is listening very gangster or who He is 55-60 years old, he might not be understanding what is happening right now but this is going to happen to you brother, the note is ready and there is financial advice as well as career advice in it.

    "title": "Are You Waiting For Someone To  Help You In Life ？ [iqwx5Cf8GsE].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today's topic is very important, especially for the youth. I will help you in a simple way. This is a typical middle class problem and I also get a lot of messages for the young people. Maybe you send messages not to me but to someone else, you expect this, this is a typical middle class problem, this is this problem, help us, please help me, just recently  I had made a video which became very popular. How to earn ₹ lakh per month? People are also confused about the idea. The idea was very good. The comments came in very good. People liked it. They found it practical but they say, where did we get the clients from? I and in it.  I told in the video that if someone does all the work for you, then do n't just put money in the account, it is the best, this is an entitlement. People, especially the middle class youth, think that someone will help them and he will do it for free.  has a stomach ache  If you have a toothache then you need help and if the pain goes away then you go to the doctor, you pay the fee, he is a professional, he does the work for you, your hair has grown too long, you have to style it, you go to the barber for a haircut. He cuts hair, takes money, does the work, if you need clothes, if you go to the shop, where will the help be? The poor are getting help only if they don't have food, so the government gives two or three rupees to someone, not a bathroom.  If there is something like building a roof, then come up with a plan.  Your lakh rupees have been converted into two lakh rupees. The government has started a scheme for the poor. If you are not poor then it will not help you because the help is being given only for food and clothes and a little for house etc. and that too very little.  No one is going to give you a house in Gurgaon, Mumbai or Bangalore to help you and as far as you need clarity in anything, on job, on marriage, in relationship, if you are stuck in something, if you need any kind of need then it will come.  At a price and it is not help It is service Stop asking stop using this word Help No no Is there help in this world Someone has an accident There will be an emergency Someone is dying of thirst on the spot Someone's bone is broken The doctor would have got that help  It is an emergency and it is humanity, we all have to do it, but no one is going to give you the time of his life for free, this nobody is going to come to help you, you have to help yourself.  You say, brother, if I only had money then why would I be asking for this? So yes, earn money first, earn money from the things you do n't want to do, to learn the things you can do, but what is that? What is the matter with people if they want to ask something from someone, then after thinking about it, now he will give it by connecting all the wires, no one is going to give it, wherever you work, work, do business, do business, do job, whatever you are doing.  Do you ever get his total picture? Your boss who is not clear will give you only that much clear picture in which you can work. The one who has all the clear pictures will not work at all. Brilliant people are not needed to work, average people are needed because as soon as they become average  If you are brilliant or are brilliant then you will figure out and adopt anything and everything and no one is helping you to figure out all these things. This is the message.  In a professional way, on the form of templates, on the form of clarity, understand what should I do, please help me, what should I do in my life, what should I do in your life, someone will come and help you, you are feeling something that I should do this.  This has to be done, there is this doubt in this, there is doubt in this, someone will give you professional advice and take fees, India has to now release some part of India has  Realized and maximum majority has to realize that apart from being a lawyer, doctor and teacher for tuition, now you will have to pay money to get knowledge by talking to people. In our country, people are ready to buy a plot of Rs 2.5 crore and build a house worth Rs 2 crore. But the architect is not ready to pay Rs 5000-10000. I have heard from my own ears that he should give one of 10 marlas for Rs 2500000. Hey, you are building a house with a similar design, think of some way to customize it, you are investing Rs. 4 crores, but now people have started believing that the advice will come at a cost, you may be able to afford it and not afford it. I am going to give some very good templates in my Happiness Course which will be given on Saturday 25th November.  It is starting, if you people want to enroll in it then you can send a message to the number given below. I will tell you the process. It is only Rs 2500, there will be five classes and two hours of recording. You will also get access to it that way.  After learning the things like, you will never go to anyone for help again, brother, help me, no one will help, no help will come from anywhere, if you are very poor, you will get food, two or three rupees, there will be a lot in KG.  If something happens to the body then the government has made a provision for treatment in the government hospital. Beyond this, if you are thinking that someone will help you and you will become a tycoon, then this is not going to happen, it is never going to happen. You studied for 18 years, went to college and did all that. You didn't figure anything out in it. You think that you spent so much money, spent so much time and you still don't know why. Even now you are asking if someone would have helped.  what about those people  There is accountability and that is why your parents are not able to help you in this kind of clarity. No, they do not know anything, they do not know anything, the college students have failed, everyone has failed, now they will get help from one person.  You have wasted lakhs of rupees for free, you have wasted lakhs of rupees, you have wasted your time, you have wasted all your efforts, now you will get help, only such divine help will come from above, will manifest, will speak, will speak its two lines and you will know everything very clearly.  What to do and your life will turn out like this, it is not happening, it is not going to happen, stop expecting it, especially middle class people because what are middle class people, children, parents have money but you yourself are poor, you have poor people.  No, you are even lower than the poor. The poor earns 500,000,3000 by doing anything, earns daily living, does work. He knows that the children of middle class are 18 20.  19 22 23 24 25 year olds are also roaming like this, their parents give them this way, now they are saying help us so that we do not have to ask for money from our parents and if we go out, now this is for help.  I need money for advice. Now this money for advice is not taken from father. If I work for father's advice and give it to you, then I have kept the advice. Now I don't feel like doing what father said.  This is the biggest problem of not having skills or not looking sexy enough. Many people are not able to release the bitter truth that brother, it is a job worth Rs 30-4 thousand, do it, it is not great, you will have to survive.  But do it, understand this because you don't feel any great achievement in it. Middle class people think that if I do this then I will be able to get special attention from my father's house, this is that 30,400 thousand, yes, not that too.  We are doing this, we are not catching the low hanging fruit, we are not getting the top cup, we are not getting any ideas, we are not spending any money, we are thinking that some Spiderman or Superman will sit here, Heman will come to help us and then our life will turn out to be no one.  Yes, people who awaken intelligence, wisdom and consciousness will definitely come, people will definitely get attracted towards them. Recently I came to know that their lakhs of subscribers are increasing day by day and they are also doing a lot of advertisements, so this is the time for panic.  This video has been made because by going there it seems that he is helping because he tells everything, job, this is nonsense, this marriage is pleasure of the flesh, this is useless, marry someone who takes you like this, oh your god's job.  It seems that who will marry you? You are saying marry a capable person, I am saying that you are not marrying a worthless person, he is saying marry a capable person, okay Acharya Prashant ji, who are you talking about?  married to ra kaabil Do whatever blockade you want, get married in consciousness. Practicality is not happening in unconsciousness. When she goes away from life, then such paid papers come, they play the flute, people go back like rats. Now where else will anyone take her down from the mountain? People have no idea because nothing else is happening in their life so it seems that they are helping, they are helping ₹ 10 0 ₹ ₹ 1 Donation Dakshina 500 Read the book Come give 1500  Give me 1000, hey brother, that is also a very good model, collect two to four crores, then take 10000, it will be enough for him and then tell him, you also join here, you also do the same work, all this, this is this model, isn't it? First of all, that.  We used to say that this was a pyramid scheme and what was this multi-level marketing, make three below yourself, make four, convince people, then people got the sense that this is a mess, it was very popular in India, many and big.  People have been fooled but now this is a new one, this is also the same scheme and it is being made because people have the misconception that someone who will help you is going to help you for free and even when the money is available. Then it doesn't help, it is a professional monetary transaction happening, you don't say this, help me, I am hungry, you go to the hotel, money  You give the food, you eat it, the hotel owner took the money, you got the food, the work is over, who helped whom, then in practice, remove this word in your life, Help, please help me out, please tell me about this, whenever you ask a question to someone.  First of all ask, how much is your fee because the person who has no fee and is giving advice, look at the fee and give good advice, there is no guarantee, but brother, free advice is just free advice, it has no meaning.  Also remember this, there will be help, all there is, there is nothing which is called help, remove that from your mind, you can do something with help, there is always something, there is always something which is professional, there will be good professionals, there will be bad professionals, yes the advice.  Will Be Good Yes Advice Will Be Bad These Some Times Your Money Will Feel Like It Was Killed Because The Advice Was Not That Good This Can Happen  But you went to watch the movie Lal Singh Chaddha, who guaranteed that you will enjoy eating food in a hotel, who said that it will be tasty, people wake up and go to eat who knows what all the sophisticated things they will eat, Sashi and it is not eaten with a spoon.  Pieces are not eaten and people go in such style to many places, don't know what orders they order for mocktails, colorful designs are made and they come in such big beautiful glasses like an umbrella.  You charge them Rs 800 and it seems like what are you going to do, but think of it, if you get something exotic, if you get it cheaply, if you get it for free, then you will not get value for money, it will not be there, it is not guaranteed, but you will not get anything cheaply.  The advice to the youth is this, please remove this help word from your mind, you have to help yourself, nobody comes here, subscribe to the message channel, get rid of all these things.  If you get help from Clarity, then tell me in the comment section. If you get only this much for free, then you will get this much for free. No, no, it is not free, we watch, so we get views from it, yes, at least now we are talking, this is also not free. Absolute right, this is what I also want to say, nothing is free, if something is free remember this."

    "title": "Are You Working In Night Shift Job ？ [r054d_mFGII].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today's topic will be working in night shift or those jobs which are night jobs. I will tell you about it. This is a very unique topic, I do not think it has been discussed much but if you are learning such a job.  So it is very important to tell you about it. Van of D job which is done mostly at night and is a popular job is being a pilot, your flying is fine, there are also call center people but here I am a pilot.  I will explain a little by taking an example, first of all I will explain to you that if you are in such a job, then it is not worth it, I have already told you the result, it is not working, you are getting, what is my purpose of making this video, that I  Let me tell you, there are very few people even at night and they will have to happen but whether you want to do it or not, the second message in this is that if less people turn off then there will be no supply in the market and there will be demand.  It is what it is, those who do their best at night will get more compensation, you understand what I am saying, someone has to do it, there are less days and nights like this for no one, there are very few of them, we cannot leave them by saying that you will be respected.  There is a lot of respect, there should be respect for every little thing, so those people who are doing less and do not want to do less in the society, they should get more compensation, the world does not run on respect alone, we have a lot of respect for you.  is less than that  It does not become less than adequate compensation. Secondly, you have to see whether the composition is worth using your health and mind because reducing the night time is not on a sustainable basis. You may also get gas, bloating, obesity, psychological issues because of this.  The social system that is there runs during the day, job during the day, coming home in the evening, food, wife, children, their homework, conversation, normal sleep, because whatever I do as a pilot again and again.  Why am I giving an example, because that has to be done [Music] Because you land at T3 at 2:00 in the night, then you do something, all this less, get out till 2:30, then you reach home somewhere in Gurgaon at 3:30  I left the taxi and then you are silently going to your house like this. Now as soon as you go, you do n't fall asleep within a minute, you just go by 4:00, you fell asleep very quickly, it seems as if you fell asleep then.  Till then, the morning activities of your house will not stop for you, children will go to school, that too, look for a night shift school, you will find a maid, the bell will also ring, everything will be reduced, how much discipline should be put in the house, close the doors, just do it brother.  No, I do n't know, I don't know, you will definitely survive, yes, I will just sleep, I have become fit, I have become physically fit and that's it, brother, there is no taste in life, this is what I want to tell you, whatever now I am just  I am not doing Pilates, whatever call center or night shift or American company is engaged in it fighting, whatever you have to reduce the night time on a sustainable basis, why should you do it, someone else will do it, if it is okay for you, then let me lift it.  I am saying that if all the people are doing it then follow the suggested extreme example or no one should do it, it has never happened that 100% people will not do it, but mother lo, 670% people say that it is not worth it, brother.  Those who are doing this will get an increase in their compensation, so they have got some benefit. Now you have to see if you are irritable because I have seen that pilots become senior and in a way, their level increases, but not these flights with orders, for example.  There is no happiness more happy that someone says that I will live on less money, the lotus is your shelter, now you are young after doing such and such, if you do yours then I am telling you young that you also do not need to do so.  Because it is not worth it, it is D message, it seems that if it is of the body, then the body will answer as if it is CP, then only 30 years of mutual fund will know what happened, so the body too is doing such a thing. No, it will be known in your late 30s and early 40s what you have done. Sam's job is office related, I should do this in this way, speak official Hindi, I am in deep sleep, I like it very much.  Scientific and I am not going to tell that by doing, this is the way I talk, just like a friend is talking in the drawing room, did you understand it, it is not working, your hair movement is your matter, your life is all this, it is not worth it, it is Whatever you are doing which is not working is a compulsion, prepare to get out of it, instead of getting into this compulsion, you will become numb. No one can reduce your creativity. At 2:00 in the night, no one can be creative.  You cannot reduce these Mondays, in which you just watch or sit on the computer, you just remain in zone of doubt so that your life is not in zone of doubt and you can live a normal life, you can have normal relationships, you can live a normal life, please avoid it.  If you are there then it is a compulsion but try you come out of date job final job find date compensation is not working why don't those white people reduce the night according to us why according to them we turn day into night Because they have released it, you give them service but it is not so, understand the meaning of the analyst, understand who is controlling whom and who is doing what is right, do the analyst, understand that date is important and respect.  Vice does not mean that normal things should be considered bad but this is the fact which I am telling, only helpless people do less at night, those who have some great compulsion, otherwise they will have to stay at night. Someone left after serving for 6 months, served for one year, there was night duty in between, got a break of two days, the sleep pattern became different, I am not telling you about that, you are given 10 days, 15 days, 20 days at different times in 365 days in a year.  -Doing it for two days is ok but it should not be a matter of giving alternate days or 15 days in a month, I am saying 15-20 days in a year is acceptable.  That's what happens in no time, if that much mother is crying like this and doing this is the point, it is by all music."

    "title": "Ask Your Parents To Let You Play The Game Of Life [eSKrGwrYOG8].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, I am going to give you a very nice printed message and even if you are 20 to 25 to 30 years old and have not had children, then this deal is very important for you. Top, check that you are not traveling unknowingly or unknowingly during your periods.  -If you can forward it to mom, then it is applicable for every elder parent whose children are above 10-15 years of age. And this is for both the child himself and the child himself.  Lipid wave new arts and you tell me in the comment section whether it is specific or not given, the thing about this is that many parents will not let their children play the game flight because in that game of life, the parents will keep playing the decoration game. They die, now they have to make mistakes in those games, learn from others or their talent or any of these things, they keep interrupting the children on many things, today I am going to tell you a very good and deep thing on that, if you take this journey.  If the children do not listen to us and are frustrated, I know two or four, I will tell you in this piece, first of all, if you refuse everything to your child at one stage, then you will find out the real thing that actually he is doing wrong. And there the reaper question is very welcome and you are refusing then he will definitely do it in irritation then Jhans tax ₹ 500 Thousands of rupees 2000 20,000 ₹ 5000  That do not stop where there is no risk to their health or physical, one is fine and do not stop too much, which one you have to see, if there is a limit of refusal and there is a limit of tolerance, then they definitely have to do it, but you think of it this way.  Use it like the lifeline of Kaun Banega Crorepati, you do it carefully in this way, so I see children who are two years old, four years old, five seven years old, six years old and eight years old, whose parents do not know the country. Okay, in a little while, something.  And I started doing No Resident in both the countries Weight One House Subscribe Vashishtha Atithi was visible in Play Store so I said its ok then I changed the name otherwise I am refusing it This should be done because I have grown up and have a job too  If he does it right then if he sits down and leaves the skirt and does something else, then he will decide to do it like this and ultimately comes to the phone, he is not doing anything because he is doing nothing physically, so no, this skirt is small.  Now on the children, which elder children should keep, 15 years, 18 years, 20 years, purchase of I have to go for a walk, I have to go there, you are like a tree, he goes that I send him alone, don't forget, thank you, I have to take a call, many times.  It happens that if it is your very special day then say, go, I will also come and I will stay at a normal distance from where you stay and I will not even look at you, I will give my attention to your father. Enjoy peace, privacy is also complete, don't stay with us in my room, stay with only those with whom you want to live, it is okay, but if you are feeling opposition, if you do not want to suffer yourself, if you have some doubts in life, then have a child today.  Do n't send, hey, if you don't land tomorrow, only then will you go, you will earn, you will earn, you will do something, this was an example that many people do not have four mentors, they are sending their parents like a guru, who is like a child batting.  I am giving an example of his batting character. I was in the meeting. I am batting that Hans is very important. We have to watch the match. Hey brother, the fun lies in spreading. This life is nothing but a game. You will take someone's pieces and someone else's.  You will take the racket of badminton, you will take the Atal yourself, you will take lawn tennis yourself, you will score it, ODI cricket, and that I did not ask, it does not bloom, I am fine, you play with it a little because you have done two things first.  You have to see, you tell me, if everything starts doing like this then the player brought the medal but the coach has the knowledge of age but the energy is raw energy and the Brahma is in the gangster, now Chanakya then Chandragupta. Why was there a need for mental stress? You should have done it yourself, otherwise in your life Chanakya tells you something about your child, whose coach is teaching rifle shooting, then if he goes from the ground to his office with a shop bullet.  He is filling it himself and taking it and he is not even allowing it to be fired and is telling her every time that dekar ko aata hai na tere ko aap pantha karti main kar ko dekh rukhsar rukhsar very limited next vest under are less not.  If there is wasted time then nothing will happen then I am telling you as an example, I have been successful in explaining, if I am successful then please write success. If it is not happening then I will tell from a different perspective.  But I am trying my best to ensure that you guys understand this expectation. Let's move a little further on how to live in a relationship. So, every man is a Maruti in a relationship, he is a father to the daughter, he is a father to the son or  This elder guides the mother and son, it is okay even at the time of marriage, she guides the experience of their marriage and one Madhur tells her not to do it too much, this habit will become bad, now she is also doing all the work of father.  70 years  But at the age of 24, another new girl is guiding the 24 year old to do something with her husband, hey, she doesn't need guidance when she doesn't tell you anything that she will not do anything with Italy whereas maybe in friendship she can do it.  No one can become as much of a woman as you who takes 10-20 percent of what 250 55 60 year olds do with the leaves, but if we do that with the fennel leaves then a newly born girl can happily do 2530 with her will and desire. And then the husband can also do something. The husband is bringing his knowledge, the wife is bringing her knowledge and this and the knowledge of the baggage of the old marriage and that baggage is also a lot. Let the new ones decide for themselves, if the boy has to marry the wife.  There is no shame in ironing suits and it is clear to them that I should press suits, I am going to your office, I am getting late, so making tea is very nice, so what did they look like? Beavers are husbands and wives are friends. We live like two friends.  We type amongst ourselves, ok, the wife can tell her husband, let me go to polish your shoes, he used to make tea or do something else, so bring bread and come, it is raining, the husband says, Rashi, I feel like making bread and pakodas.  I am doing this, if I bring bread, then fry the gram flour and it will become tight, then this story of compassion together, don't do anything, order it from the morning, play the giver of life with the latest delete among yourselves and let them make late.  Send that letter, letter, love letter game, don't sit and wait in line. I tell you, many people will not have any idea. Pilots are not born, they are taught, so the inspector who teaches to become a pilot is a pilot. He becomes a good pilot only then.  If he is teaching, if he shows, he himself will keep sewing this plane. So this one will never be seen. Landing at some point of time. I am not teaching anyone online. If I know how to fly a plane, then I will have to maintain a lot of control.  That eye ship is not even a little bit hmm, without that, and this should also be learned, the third thing is to learn and whoever is listening to this, this pilot, please try to put two lines in the comment end also on the explain in button * from how difficult is the latest which is pilot jin-  Who did not teach but learned Jersey His inspectors that how strong it was in the heart Okay happy and prosperous Vitamin E You have to take over If things are going wrong But you have to keep the threshold  Now, it is difficult for a common man to do as much screening as it is for a pilot, but at the same time, they have given something to the child, that is, to give the child so much growth space that he will make so many mistakes, after that, let me tell you one more good thing, when the child  It is said that you say children, keep listening, we are telling them this much, then you tell them, instead of it being the child's fault, there may be something wrong in your way of explaining and sometimes what happens is that periods have caused something very bad.  is grinded well  There are patterns in their life, they have the knowledge of war and liberation, now they want to tell the child that don't do this, he has the patience to explain here, hey, I am telling you, don't worry too much, there is no problem, but you have to do this.  Sit and say, come son, sit and sit, sitting like this, watching you sit comfortably and talk is such that they will discuss distance and after this, if you convince me logically, then whatever you want, she will want it.  Must be because that's why I had set the video to say less, do no logically, do n't cry in everything, development doesn't suit you, you can say this, son, this daughter, doing this thing is fine but this trick is sky involvement right no I am not in this  That's the frame of mind and that's why instead of refusing, I would rather postpone it and then do it. Okay child, so you have given him logic, now he is waiting, so when you create a relationship like this, a small child is interesting.  If the teenager is upset then he will respect you, this is telling me logically what happens sometimes, sometimes you do not want to say that whenever MS Word of money, I have invested a lot, we are taking it home, this is this.  Things can be taken now Will be tight tattoo stage After that what would have happened to you Money does not grow on trees Money does not grow on trees This logic spreads your legs after seeing the sheet So why are you doctors spooning out the frustration of your life like this? Tell him it's a game, resources are limited, no matter how much money you can earn, there is a limit, its location will be according to each location, you have to have fun in some, whether you have to earn money in it or invest in it, in some you have to maintain it, stop eating and drinking.  School fees, electricity, water, petrol, all the expenses are okay, if you call him fat, then tell him, this is so discretionary, but this one is already here, but you have given options to me.  Let me tell you the requirement. Add this requirement in my list here and it will find place in 3241. Okay, do it like this and tell the children to be straight on everything, no on everything, they will tolerate it for many lives as long as they are there, there is a compulsion to depend on you, only then I  I have seen that as soon as a child starts feeling bad, it seems that he has suffered so much. Do those parents even need advice? Who is he like this to you?  Brother, when he is 24 years old and gets your job, there is no need for parents. In fact, they are very much needed because now knowing the other challenges of life, till now you were under their protection and your child is under their protection when he is coming out a little.  Now to him, you are the only one in the world and some good looking guy, so now he is not your lag because you had collected those things for the last 20 years and he was feeling that he has to tolerate them because now he is not able to earn his living.  So it gives food that then go to me today in 24 circles, that's why children are becoming very oppositional and rebellious type and are taking decisions which make their life worse, this is visible in their relationship decisions and jobs in seconds.  As soon as I leave the code, I take decisions and leave 50,000 rupees, then I leave some salvation to someone else, and whenever he does a parody, he does something, now that pot of his, the pot of sin from the police station to the highway, is from someone special but  Whatever was his limit, the parents made it a joint by talking about things on Monday and the parents say that according to him, it was under control, now why not, you have said this line of your Amitabh Bachchan wali or Amitabh Bachchan wali. Only I would say that the one with Shishupala and the game Krishna Chinh is the one that had given that lifeline. If you had done Bigg Boss, she would have been very careful in painting the mist of Justice Jasbir Will Be. This is also a question of whether you have to say those entries.  This may also have to be done without understanding and at short notice, but it will work only if you use it in your life. You are the mother who normally never refuses, but the elders are doing it mentally.  If yes, then that child will also sit like this, what has happened, but whose parents complain about everything, they say that everything is yours, it means green, if you understand, then it is okay, but let's go to this platform.  ok so this is yours  Say you belong to this system and okay so this thing is called on this thing, how do such videos look, you guys tell Vikas, this is original content, you will not find anyone and this discussion, somewhere in your mind, solve this problem, I told you, please write which.  -Those who identify with this problem that yes man, these things you are telling, this is happening, this is shoes and 175 Mila I am not at all Singh's fat.

Advertisements  Year Old When Should Explain To Leave Every Time You Know It Is Your Duty As A Parent To Put Child And Tell  Him Regional Rural Golmaal No Return True Region Whatever region it is, if you want to tell then you are Because I'm Telling You All the Paris Away in Your Kids Vikram 2535 This Will Be Judged on Parenting Today The Child 200 Can't Do Anything Even His Brain Is So Much  Even if Nisha happened, the judge did it but he will do it, the umpire will strike for years but he will not know what happened and how he did it, then you felt how much he did not care about you.  Brother, we have done our best, we have done our best, we could not have done anything more than this, we could have done this, it is okay and that story repeats, the families where there is more understanding in this, then there your next generation will also be like you, you can do nothing.  If more people come then they too will not go to the deposit setting and they will go into such a country in a wrong direction. Today I am talking about social reform type, this summer is very difficult because first Raja Rammohan Roy Vidyasagar ji who  I would say that it was still easy for him because he was educated and everyone else was illiterate.

Look at it from the eyes, it is okay, watch the video from India's eyes, then definitely watch the video from the eyes of hatred and introspect within yourself, you enjoyed it, what happens in the ultimate end, MSG, you enjoyed it, you enjoyed it, CM, write it down, I also understand.  I will go, okay do it whether you want to or not, take what happens sometimes in life with you, what I said has happened to you, you cannot go there and do anything, but brother, something like this has happened to many others and  The only way to know that this is happening is that I am not the only one with whom this has happened, so if I write MSG, then they will write EMERG, okay thank you hey."

    "title": "Astrologers And Finfluencers ｜ How They Ghumao You ？ [lOLFl8lK1fA].en",
    "content": "Hello friends Astrologers and financial influence every now and then in the coming time I will mix two-three videos of Astrologer Astrology and this one because the reason for this I will tell how they operate in all the professions I am also in astrology ok although I am in the teaching part  I stay there more than usual but I am bringing it up so that it doesn't seem like I am speaking ill of any other profession, I brought it up for that and how they operate is fine because there are predictions in astrology and all the people make predictions even though they are astrologers.  You are playing the game of predictions and I will also tell you why and how the games of predictions are played and I will explain it well, you will enjoy the practical video, so first of all my fraternity of astrologers, their fraternity is not of astrology but of fraternity of astrology, you have an exit with astrology  It is very good, whenever anybody comes to an astrologer, he comes in trouble, not in happiness, so what is his exit, that you come to me, something happened to me  And now whether your life will be better or same or worse, then these are only three situations and there is a chance of 66 out of three. However, if it will be bad, you can also claim that it would have been worse if you had not come, but then let's say that at 66  So there is a chance, and keep making so many predictions in the normal public domain that this person will get this many seats, this one will win, this one will lose, something will be fine and then claim victory and do the rest as conveniently as possible left and right, these financial effects are also done in the same way  They come and forcefully give knowledge about the stock market, they start talking so much about so many things and do so much, whenever you go to an astrologer and he starts showing off his knowledge, I will compare the two and tell you that all of these are very good and right  Even if you don't do astrology and all this but I will do it and tell you that whenever the astrologer says like this, your Rahu is going on like this, Saturn's is like this, it means he is fake, he doesn't have the knowledge, you have come, what is the need for him to explain to you If he tells you clear cut story, you will also see financial influence, showing diagrams, Nifty will go like this, here it was like this and now it is this and he will take a pen and show it like this, recently I see that he is roaming around with 20 lakh subscribers every day  He is Akshay Srivastava, my friend from People, his name is nothing personal to him, I can take one name and tell you two-four more but I don't see 100 channels, so he is Master ji, the biggest showman, sometimes you should catch hold of him, it may spoil his reputation Leave it, then say this is not right, now grab something, now grab the latest micro cap, small cap, grab anything, today I am going to expose the whole of YouTube and I am also a YouTuber including myself, listen to us carefully today, come here  It is very easy to read knowledge because whoever has lakhs of subscribers, lakhs means more than 1 lakh, after that the matter becomes one, of course those who have more, they get a lot of regular income, a lot of money, right, and here  come  Saying I am doing this, I am not doing this, I am doing this, you don't do this, this is the dirtiest and most useless knowledge. You have seen me in my videos, I do not tell anything about what I do, what is my income, what are the accounts, it is because My life experience is that I have got nothing to do with your truth. If it is like this, listen, it is like the heroes of the 70s and 80s portray poor heroes. They are rich in real life and there they are saying poverty and people associate them with it.  They are saying it is like being that leader who travels by jazz and is a leader, he has a lot of power, reach and everything, but he was once poor and poor people are cheering for him, they are cheering for him what he was earning they are right  Now and they will always be most like be there only, you are understanding, I am telling you from a deep thing, even astrologers will do astrology with full force, they will play on fear that this will happen, that will happen, without it work cannot be done, this is what you do if you are in mutual fund  If you do not invest in the equity market, if you do not invest here, then you will remain poor here and if you do it here, then you will become rich, brother, ask those who have been doing it for 20 years, you will catch each outlier in it and weave it too  That a man is like saying that one of my uncle's grandfathers, not my real grandfather, but some other cousin's grandfather, used to smoke hookah and lived for 104 years, so is that true, yes it is true, so that means you use tobacco for 104 years, smoke hookah and do such things  You will not live for 104 years because you did not tell that you used to go to irrigate the fields at 4:00 in the morning, used to do farming, used to eat desi ghee, used to eat food only twice a day, used to sleep at 8:00 in the night and used to wake up at 3:00 in the morning You did not tell about the rest of his 1500 great things, you only told about one thing, the hookah, or cigarette or whatever like this, today those who are doing their wrong programs, they also do this work  If it is applied then it will take 104 years because you are not telling that you have the ability to lose money because you have frequency band tokens, you will also play Lakshmi people do not mention it, once you have brought a fancy product, Mama tune change, Mama tune change, I am doing  This I am doing this I am doing this I am doing this I have to lower my level by acting like this to awaken the people and the youth, otherwise why should I come and act like this, I too want to show off my sophisticated people  Come let the math speak, let this speak, let that speak, however much it is shown to you, it is like high-fi, you are being made a crazy fool, remember this, no one knows what lies ahead, if the past was to be the history then  Librarians and historians would be the richest people. Otherwise, Buffett's quote is great because most of the history is read by historians and librarians also have lots of books, they can read them too.  Bhaiya investment and life is forward looking, yes you have to look in the rear view while overtaking and while moving left and right, but when you drive, brothers and sisters, then you drive by looking ahead, at 95, at 97, times two at 4  One should also look back in time, but if someone is doing a rear view investing that I did it this way, I incurred losses like this, but it is okay, this is it, everything is okay for you if Rs 50 lakh or Rs 1 crore is coming into your account every month.  Brothers and sisters, everything is okay, keep playing some game of 5-10 lakhs and keep showing off, I bought this, I did this, there was a loss because I said so, so I also suffered a loss brother, you suffered a loss, % of net worth, others suffered a loss of 50%, youngsters You took the youngsters to crypto, financial influence is the same, this is the work that astrologers do because do it like this, wear this ring, wear this, wear that, do it this way, do it that way, oh brother, the one who has so much real knowledge, he is free  I do not share it, it is a fact that I do not share it, if my knowledge is strong then you can attend the webinar and come there and judge, now come here and recommend two stocks or three stocks every day, okay don't talk about those which lost, those which hit  It's done, it's done, oh friend, this was told by Peter Lynch, one upon Wall Street, the famous 1980s equity manager of America, that any child can pick up stocks and they will perform as well, we are overrated, call any child to Nifty 100. Make a portfolio for your child today, you guys don't have to invest too much money, invest thousands of rupees and buy 10 stocks, 100 thousand rupees. Just for argument, call your child to check it, tell any 10 year or 5 year old child, son, something  You can also put your hand on 10, it's fine, you can put your hand on 10 out of 100 top companies of India and show off, it's fine, do it like this, then buy more and see about the rest.  Look, behind each of them, this company does this work, this company does this work, hey, there are corporate issues in these companies, come and teach me how to do forensic audit, you have to calculate operating cash flow along with cash flows. And along with the profit, we have to see whether he has inflated his assets in all the micro caps and the biggest scam in all these things is this, a famous case of corporate governance, if you have ever read the Google3 scam then it is quite well known but this  I don't know what all misdeeds are done inside micro cap in the ballast, and all these YouTubers come and tell you stories, hey you are doing a little bit, has got no meaning, you have to define and what is there in it, it is  For I am telling you it is for the risky, he is the biggest bad, everyone has to take risks, you are making it for the youth, the youth have to take risks, he is saying if there is risk then there is love, if there is love then there is risk, there are many such things  There are dialogues too that which one came after doing love and risk, there was a web series on Harshad Mehta, people make such dialogues in it, so people feel that if you take risk then there is no benefit, sometimes you have to see risk Reward ratio just because the risk increases dozens means the reward will increase and it will increase at a common rate that if I double the risk the reward will become double no it happens that way in life some times the risk increases as an exponential and the Reward design increases so why should you go there, I will tell you one thing, I am thinking of opening a finance channel but I am doing its due diligence that I have very little actual knowledge, how will you come and make videos on it everyday  Because those who are making videos every day, talking nonsense, talking nonsense to everyone, you should come there and tell the investors how to look at the balance sheet, how to look at the red flex, corporate governance  How to check that he has appointed all the directors in your corporate and there are related party transactions, he has made guest house in his own house and gives contracts to his own companies and takes money from your listed firm in that company  It is being told how it should be taught and how it should be taught with examples and case studies, the real knowledge is that, the real thing is that but then it takes so much effort to explain it then the person says friend how can I tell all this for free because  Anything that is very good will not be free, remember this also, in micro caps, every day there is an influencer who has 20 lakh subscribers, brother, any of his fans will buy it, then you will see it growing  You know, take that exit fit and these come under SEBI's range side, no matter how many times you tell me that no, no, I am not saying that you should buy it and this is dangerous and it is not like that, even then you know  tell small children, son don't open this cupboard, just tell them this  Don't peep into the cupboard, just say this, then what will you know, then you will say that I had forbidden you, I had forbidden you, so understand the psychology, someone has to come and tell that the whole game is of astro loggers, the whole game is of financial influence  The whole game is played with the psychology of all the people in the financial media, that is why I say with you that the public is not explained but cajoled and the public can never take a decision, the public is told that you will do this, do it like this Do it that way and anyone can come and I am saying this because no one speaks against it, everyone says that you tell yours, tell them yours, then everyone tell theirs and everyone has their own, some big needs to come and challenge that brother told this  I went or did not work, now there could be 1.5 crore reasons, no one is accusing you personally but come and accept this thing, there is nothing rational, brother, the money will be made but if you tell this then how will the channels run, how will the newspapers run  This media channel will run, how much will it cost him every time he comes  You have to show a multibagger of small cap somewhere, that means finding that needle is like a haystack but these low hanging fruits are looking good, how much will you talk about it, then it is not fun to talk about it, people, even the public wants to become rich  Public thinks like this now that I am a multi-bagger, I am not giving you any normal example of mine but there is no bragging in it, I am just trying to tell you what is luck, there is a company Lav Pola, it is 100 bagger for me, okay, absolutely advice.  There are a lot of valuations that I should not buy it, so according to me I should not buy it right now, maybe it is okay, I am holding it, I am holding it, it is 100% safe for me, if I was that smart and my investment was that much, then  I would have then allotted part of my portfolio to two customers so at that time the portfolio which was small, I took it, it increased but did not sell it, I kept it aside, I forgot it was in a demat which was dematted to another and many times you do not sell it and that  It increases, if we forget then what now  Let me show you the date when I bought it, when its market cap was so low, it was something like 30, 40, 50 crores. Now I don't know if it has become something like 30, 40, 50 crores. So Garware Valve again, it was a Ro manufacturing company, 200, 50, 180.  It was 20,000, now it is probably 3,000 plus, brother. It is not known what the company will do. The company does not know. The owner of the company does not know how much I will do, so what do we know. It is, I come here and request a few things. That someone should come and just tell people this small thing that friend your cash flow is for the last seven years because of working capital, inventory and all this, many companies in India also give bribes, now how will they show bribe giving on the balance sheet  To this politician, this is a fact of the state or of that place, do you people know, then how will they show the balance sheet, if someone shows it given to this, then he will have to do some such dressing up  Then once you get used to dressing up, you understand it, then you start doing it more, then you start doing more and more, then you start doing it for your own benefit and who will teach you those things that whenever you study accounting  The basic thing is for every debit there is a credit, for credit there is a debit that needs to be balanced so if you are hiding profit somewhere then your asset or balance sheet will bloat somewhere and there will be a mismatch somewhere, the way to catch it is this  So it seems fishy, why is its return on equity coming so low, it is showing profit but why is only RO coming, what is happening to the assets, what is return on assets, no one is telling this, I am explaining, explain  I want to tell you but I think I should reach a particular stage where I tell this because what should I tell the audience, hey bhai sahib, leave this and tell the stock, stock today I will be covering this multibagger potential i micro cap stop in the agriculture sector and guys I am there  And I'm very bullish and that's it  There and I am also buying and you buy and it is going this and this will do well defense will do well this will do well that will do well sector will do well company is doing well or not doing well what do you know now most solar solar solar  They will go after solar, someone will go after someone else, these are all fads, the game of PMS which is played in the company, this is what is told to the clients first, okay, then it runs up, then it is seen, then it comes Gradually I told it as normal and then told the public, whenever I go, brothers and sisters, you public says that the public knows everything, no the public does not know everything, the public knows a lot, the public knows everything, what is happening in these handsets now, the public knows everything  I don't know, but what happened now, the public will know in 2028, this is also a truth, but what is the fact, what is happening in 2024, these big people tell you something about themselves by putting it on Tegra groups and offload the shares first, technology  There was not this much earlier, whom all would you call and tell them to take this  Take that, take this, nowadays some will increase, some will decrease, some will be offloaded, then trap new chickens, then tell them and then give the data to any financial influencer, brother, this company costs nothing in covering the company Brothers and sisters, you are telling about the company, if something goes wrong then they will say brother SEBI is there, this is there, what should I do and then conveniently those things which you have told by mouth like I tell you Gurgaon real estate will do well  So it is neither doing better than last year nor is it doing better than last year, when it reaches that side even then I will tell you, there should be a clear cut verdict that yes this is it, this is like this, real estate is doing like this or  All these financial influencers said that two years ago the real estate was bad when it was time to buy, now they are taking it to Goa when the valuations are so high and it has been two-three years, so brother, you should not buy in the first place, when you buy, then just imagine the videos  People are coming and not just one but many, there is another one too who is into real estate  He only invests money and teaches only finance to the world and tells people to buy mutual funds, buy my courses, with this money I will buy real estate and brother, write his name also, cases are something and he tells with state face that  The ad has been taken seriously, it is a straight talk and not nonsense, they will say friend it is transparent but it is transparent but how transparent is it brother, he is saying in simple words that bhaiya I will take this, my father told me I will take this and any such state also  No, the arrow state in pumpkin is India's number one, something like this, he is making his good portfolio in whatever state it is and telling all of you that you buy all this, then don't mix asset classes, only this is good, only that is good and  I am saying mix, it means confuse or else money can be earned from everyone, everyone has a cycle, everyone has an understanding, even within real estate, commercial flats, your plots, your warehouses, 50 types of things are built and in every state, every city, every big city  A small town has a different cycle so anytime If you want to judge an extra good astrologer or a good influence then you have to see that you came into his life, he came into your life, he confused your life, he simplified it, did well, you have to judge it on a better stage, it is not a roundabout way.  On top of that, the superficial knowledge, the driver knowledge, which is called giving it up, yes I you will do this, do that, in such a case, the problem actually arises, this happens, I am doing this, I am doing this, I am doing this, I am doing this, I am doing this I am doing it brother, I am doing this, this is never a good advice because so many others can not do it, you are a very strong swimmer, you have good experience, you have a big body, you are young, you are a fast river or rebels, an intelligent guruji is intelligent Influence is so rich that there is too much to cater for everybody and it's not that you look after yourself, it's not survival of the fittest for you, it's dangerous only if it is dangerous then it's dangerous for you You should not even talk about any such thing which is dangerous, it is dangerous for 99.99% of the people, so have you come here to increase your dopamine, feed it at 01, then feed it future options also, get all the work done, you have already done non- fungibility Sage I am taking you, ask him a direct question, what percentage of his net worth, brother? If a person is spending one crore on his child's wedding and the party is worth 100 crores, then his net worth is 1 per cent, but if you have spent 50 lakhs on your child's wedding,  You also invested it and your net worth was only two crores so you put it at 25, then you are looting, then you will say no I did less, he did it only, if someone is buying a car then that is why we do not see that he  I have bought a car, hey bhaiya, how much is his income, what is his net worth, come here and give straight advice that no, I should not buy it, I should buy it, hey bhaiya it has to be done with number of, when I make it, I am thinking if I should make it  I will tell you clearly, number of months of salary, you should buy a car, you can afford more than that from your monthly salary, in this way you can take as much loan as you want, but you should not do that, that is the right thing there are two things in life, one is what  You want what you like the other is what is the right thing and it is not necessary that you like the right thing. So brother if you have a car worth Rs 2 lakh then you can buy a car worth Rs 8 lakh but people buy it for how much  You are sitting, you can see and I am telling you the total, I am not talking about how much is coming after deduction, otherwise those figures will change, I am keeping it simple, otherwise like this then what would you say about a lakh, it is four pa lakh  You will take it, yes you will take it up to five, you can take it up to six, just take it for six months, cross the limit, and if it is more expensive then you should do it for four, then four to six months, and why, by doing logic and all that, good detailed videos will be made.  It will be interesting but what is the market of finance channel or should I tell on this Let me give you the clarity on 25 things because I keep giving clarity on 25 things in this, what is in finance brother, you earn more money in finance, now as far as I am concerned, you don't see me promoting anybody, I do it myself. Hmm, take this, take this one, take the insurance from here, take it from there, take it like this, I do n't say it like this, hey yours, this one, the one who is sitting with 20 lakhs, the finance one, by taking anyone's name it would cost 12 lakh rupees. yes this is the figure now different people have different rates depending on subscribers views and all so brother if you earned 12 lakhs in one video then you can get anything posted anywhere friend you don't need your father's or someone's yes something  It goes away, there is no problem, no one is incurring any expense, you have earned 10-12 lakhs, now you can keep buying any fancy product from that, some of those fancy products will be hits, some will be flops, some of those products have given you money You are telling this to me, but it is the public  You are a fool when you say that the world has given me money, that is why you are giving name to it or any product, you are earning money, now if it sinks then your money is not lost because that  So brother he had given the money, so did n't I tell him after working hard, here comes the conflict of interest, a person earning in crores can afford to lose in lakhs every month, earn one crore and lose 10 lakhs, what's the problem and the 10 lakhs which are lost Those same people had given you crores, so what is the problem, you are in profit, then take names, give this one, give that one, but who will come and check you, someone should come and check you or you all will wait, SEBI will come, it will come  The government makes a rule of Rs. 1.5 crore but people have made bypasses for it and these ones say this is for this and I am showing you this figure, the astrologer will also show this, I am showing it like this, to show it Nothing happens after joining for three months or six months if you have clarity of mind  If you do not get any increased relief, if you do not get any benefit then that is nonsense, that should be the judgement parameter and this is happening, new people are coming and subscribing, the old ones do not watch the videos, it is seen that there is a ratio of you8 but I consider healthy that  If I have one lakh subscribers, then even 8000 is enough. But many YouTubers have gunned down to 2, 3 but it is like that now they are watching only new chickens, the old ones are tired, they are fed up, they have not reached anywhere in the comment section.  is another indicator because from where will you get fake comments, how many will you type, you have 1015 IDs of relatives and friends and even they are not ready to write anything for anyone, the fact is, you should tell your wife as an utter that  Write well about me and say that I have more work to do, this is the truth, if you cannot write it then my request to you is that please tell me in the comment section what I explained through this video, thank you very much"

People waste energy. Husband's husband, wife's cows, parents, someone's bus, employee, junior, it is a lot of fun. Well, the first thing is this energy. If you change people, then what is happening in your life is not interesting to you.  You will get one thing, tell me, I am enjoying the LED video, tell me, am I enjoying this time, just write the image, friend, something like this where we can read it just by listening, see how much content, I am not a very long video.  gonna do  I am just giving a little spark here that yes man, if we have to think like this then we will get less by changing the attitude and sometimes what happens is that my attitude is there, I am getting a lot from the attitude, Sambdi com and tells me mess.  Is it because of the tire that I can get it, I am not getting it and this is a jackass thing for me but I don't know that because of this attitude I was getting all this, now I have changed that.  If I have done everything, I may or may not get this. If this Chhath falls then this matter is very delicate. Sir, this matter is very delicate. Who behaves how? I am not telling the story in such a way that only someone behaves badly and someone keeps doing bad, not good.  Want but what time saying something is working on you tick you it I am also devotee of you right like she is Shivgami in Baahubali movie maybe she is the character of Lady Ramya she has shown some attitude her daughter-in-law  In one scene, people remember that itna toh suits Sivagami's daughter-in-law, why doesn't he do it? Some people can get it on the D message which is of you, my brother, the first thing is that this attitude has been Akashi because unless you are at the source. No attitude can be changed superficially, only I am positive, positive, gold positive, everything in my life has gone wrong, everything has gone wrong in someone's life, where it goes, that is, they themselves say it.  The challenge is brother, he has such a feeling that it cannot be changed overnight, now he has to see that whatever has happened in his life and his attitude, how can he monetize it or how can he get something out of it? Every friend is important.  Whenever a big plane is being built then there should be such a person who can say that it can get spoiled because of this or see that it will get messed up, it happened there too, there are definitely such people in the entire organization. in homes  Everywhere, everyone has the same attitude, Jain, there is a lot of confusion there, there is caste, I have seen very positive couples, everything will be good, no, good, good, nothing is better than gold, big is not worse than gold, that is what happens and  It's okay, you can put negative preparation in it. Negative preparation is that if something negative happens, how can I be prepared for it, like if you look at flying, they are pilots, you look at fighters.  There are pilots who are fighter planes, so you know, but the risk is less, okay, one thing is done by injecting seat in it, their soldiers, then they go on their own, they hold their handle like this, so it is called negative preparation, they are trained.  And that decision making most of the time is not even available in 1 second, it is not available in 1 second, sometimes it is available in mid and within that means 1/2 second, sometimes something happened and people have seen it and the story in the show has sometimes happened.  Have you ever had a story in real combat? You don't get time. In half a second, in half a second, only the person who has prepared for it can take a decision. This is called negative preparation. This is a great example of negative preparation. What is that? He is a pilot, he always thinks that he will be my companion, he thinks negatively, doesn't he think positively, he will never be with me, he will never be with me, he will never be with me, he will never be with me.  I think he thinks positive or negative, he thinks that if I have to do this, then this is a big attitude thing, I am going to tell you guys, this is neither positive nor negative, so even in the name of positive attitude.  If you stay a little less then how can a good thing be made better and how can you have fun in it or how can you do something better then that is the preparation, even if there is something negative.  If it is so then how can it be reduced? It can be rocked or endured or a child can go. This is attitude, this is not escapism. This is called negative preparation. I hope I have succeeded in giving a new concept. How did you like the video?  Must tell, Share with people, Attitude should be just seen from where it is coming, I will leave, date will come, there is a lot of homework to be done, so much on this video of mine, I left it like a satsang, notes.  Make it, I have to say again and again that the one who makes a note, the same note is useful, just understand that the note that is made, only the note is useful. The videos of this channel are of about eight nine minutes each. I have to write that there is such a concept that Guruji has come.  The teacher came and told me that I have not even read the story, I am being beaten in 12th in IT, I am being beaten in Delhi University, so tell me this story, I am telling the story on YouTube, so tell me the story now.  It is being told that you are in the class, yes, you are in the class, even if the class is free, it is okay, give a little more likes, this is all I am asking for, give more likes, a few subscribers increase, if you like gratitude, I also like it, more people  Reach out, okay, because of this space, many people have wasted their time. Motivation, which is time wasted, is only for the help of the self-help book author and nothing else. You should never read self-help books. [Music] How much support is there, born in such a rich family, people ask about personal, Hey, you tell me your credentials, then I raised myself, people enjoy hearing something like this, there is nothing like that brother, there is nothing like this, I know something like this  If there is no such thing, then what is the use of telling it now? Thoughts, same brother-in-law, there is no point in telling your life story, you are the other big nobody, its life story is exactly the same, if two sages are brothers.  If you also talk about two twins, their life does not work in the same way, from home to appearance to clothes to school, their books are also different, so this is the biggest thing, the only thing which can be taught and understood is the power of learning. Formula templates and you will have to tweet them as per your own, you will have to do it as per your own, only then it will be fun and it takes a lot of effort and introspection to bring all these videos, do not think that you will make 10-12 videos like this. In minutes Yes editing does not take much time If there is no background music then there is time saving but this is the insights You come every give almost and make something on you then it is tax and if it is not extremely you can also on tree please make de notes notes Now people will say, 'How will you get notes from this? If you make notes then do your graduation, if the course is ok then do it, you will get your figure out automatically, this channel will come inside you' 10 lakh subscribers, if I keep running Google Ads then the content will be good, I follow the model of the movie, I am good, I have seen it, no sales, no marketing, nothing, congratulations, it was made for 18 crores, it was made for 225 crores, so there is a request to you.  Your closest friend or closest relative or son or daughter or any other good person with whom you are in touch and you send him the video, only when two people discuss it will you understand, no one alone will understand all the topics I have. You can do videos, you need someone, you understand, like you can also practice batting, so tell me, you need a thrower or a bowling machine, if you need something, then these are my videos, you will enjoy alone, you will learn, but if the husband is flirting with the wife.  A friend is sharing a joke, you are sharing a joke with your parents, you are sharing a joke with your brother or sister, you are sharing a joke with a friend and by sharing it you are discussing the topic, what did you squeeze out of it, what did I squeeze out and how much?  What is there in the matter and how can we do it in our life? Only then will we have to put in the effort. I did not tell you much and I will tell you further with success. Many times insights come from such things which are a bit complex and abstract. No one is ready to attempt them.  I have the curd of my mind, many things can be explained easily, so I will continue making date content like date, the one which is more understandable and feels better, enjoy it, but please make a note, thank you.  you very match"

    "title": "Chatukarita , Hardwork And Talent ｜ What Works For You ？ [gkpfHq1vKbQ].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, why did this topic become irrelevant because it shows a pattern, it does security in my consultation, I also do it, the employees are suffering, this topic is sycophancy, talent and hard work, those who are talented and hard working are also suffering a lot, government people too.  These are employees and those in corporate and private jobs too. The issue of suffering is very simple that those who sycophant have to be fired. So today I am giving you a perspective for free, if you also want concentration, I will give you a job, you will be happy, the claim of the channel is only one, okay, you will definitely become one, if those who are connected also agree, then we will talk. Today we are talking about the point officer of a chatukhor. If you are a chatukhor and it is very difficult to accept someone, then write in the comment area that brother, I am becoming an uncle, my audience is also very honest to me.  Even if you know, please see, are you irritated by Chatu Kholo and Chata Khodo, are you suffering or do not like this thing, sycophant psycho Sanskrit and in that Lord of South Indian audience is also witch is you know offlet joint subscribers like big one request and friend subscribers.  Big two, one big two each. If you like the channel, you are watching this video. I think it is not too much to give one big two likes, but also the subscribers.  There are two big requests in my circle, friends, I have a little request. They are copying and pasting so much of my content. Those who are bigger than me, I too deserve a little of mine, so I am making two big requests. I forget and don't even remember. Rahat is okay, so tell me now. We consider hard work and talent very important, so today I am going to give clarity to all the employees, listen carefully, sycophancy is considered a look-doctor, we cannot do sycophancy.  He cannot be accepted by you because the one who has talent in life will have it because of knowledge and because of talent, he will have attitude, understand carefully and if he has that attitude then he will not be sycophantic but if that sycophancy is because of talent then he is not becoming virtual.  He is just that, sycophancy is a feeling, feeling good about your scenery is a talent, this person has this intelligence and  Knowledge and Academy is not a kill, it knows this thing whenever it enters, I am going to understand you very lovingly, even if the video gets a little long, then watch it further because the notes will open up about job issues and less.  Are the issues going on or am I telling you in free consultation? After giving this consultation, the retirement of people should be reduced. In my opinion, whatever I will tell you, you listen carefully, this is the top management, this is the one below. Management is VPCP very middle management manager etc. then your executive then story yes story you are grinding here story I have become a grind hamster are you ok you tell me then you are saying that friend that sycophant is having fun and my  So I work so hard, I don't get it, so you have to see carefully, you are a horse, but you have to see what are you doing in the middle of growing, the value of donkeys is flood. Because when he doesn't use his brain, he is like a donkey and gives pulses and gives pulses. It is not necessary to use brains because when people use their brains, they do not do that much in physical. There is a lot of physical retirement in sycophancy. Happy Birthday, Happy Anniversary. Party at night.  In the bus, hold a cigarette in your mouth, your lighter is fine for that, a pack of liquor, a party, sir, when you don't want to concentrate, all this also takes effort, the physical eliteness seems more like the decision making you do.  You think that my boss took the decision but for the sake of the company maybe my boss would not have thought this and would not have done this. You challenge him on his authority and you think that Sardar will be very happy. This is the dialogue of Gabbar, is n't it?  If you are talented then you have to take care of two things, if you are hard working and talented and you have it, if you do less with the Malik then he will appreciate it. The top management who is the Malik will be a sycophant.  Do n't need an example, if India is a company, then the Prime Minister should immediately be a sycophant to reduce something below him because you can see through, it has to be reduced, the more the distance increases and the ownership decreases, the more the company will enjoy sycophancy, so below.  Magic is needed at this level and this manager has received direction from above as to what to do, there is no brain here, it is implementation, like a donkey he said something, he did it and did not challenge. He got good sleep in the bus at night but the hard working talented lower employee who is working with donkeys and is a horse himself is not giving good feeling to the bus. If he is not giving good feeling then your appraisal will not be good. You are not Sardarshahar.  If he gives you then you will not be fired from the job because if you want to reduce it, then only you will make it work, he is just giving the feeling, the other one is just doing it out of respect or like a donkey. Give anything less, you will keep the sleeping person, you need appreciation, you are not getting it, because you need appreciation, it is yours, it is just that, I am tolerating you, this is enough, every time you make me fool, so in adequate, I am yours.  I am tolerating it because all this has to be done with less effort and that science has to be done less by you and if I am tolerating it then it has become equal. You will not get praise for this if you pay attention.  Listen, you are a horse, you are sent to run on Maa Lakshmi Race Course, WhatsApp, here you have to work under the bus, which is the owner, which is not so easy that you reach the level immediately, Jain or you are so brave.  If you are a servant then why should you reduce yourself? If your vision is very good, planning is very good, you have talent, you have networking skills, you have execution skills, you have hard work, you have passion.  Why are you doing less for someone else? Either it is not that you think that you have everything in you but it is not that much, hence you brother take the decision of this thing, we filter it out in a small concentration, I am an obscene grower.  Like Sharaf Tank, they do not insult like India, they help in it and you are a horse, they will also connect you with those who invest money in you, which is called venture capital. Brothers and sisters, whoever is fond of startup and wants to understand then  In a good way, with love and without being insulting. Otherwise, if you are worthy of it and have talent in connecting with big people, then that too will be provided to you. Service also I have already started consultation. If you only want a job. So type T, He is not going to leave you, He works very hard, He is very intelligent, He will go a long way, Now the next bus has come which had seen my sycophancy, This bus and the government changed. My job: Have you ever thought about Chatu Khar's security, thought about his hard work, thought about his wealth, he is a happy and lucky man. You will also see his personal life, if you haven't missed it, he has a good relationship with his wife too. Even in front of him, Choudhary has not failed, his parents are also happy with him, his brothers and sisters are also happy with him, ₹700 are also happy because he has skill, that skill is not found in everyone and it is gym, do not tease him, he is his elder brother.  Amul Macho is very comfortable for them now, he will go everywhere, say something lovingly and it will be reduced and the management knows that many times his skills are such that they have to send stories to the offices for networking, some just for the sake of smooth buttons.  You have to sell, you also need talent, so all that comes in less. Your hard work does not come down. You have to see that you look again and again in an ecosystem. If you are in a wrong place, then your hard work does not come down.  Talent is not this message if you are feeling organization date you are not getting appreciated and liked and valued and cherished then do this interest Nandan Vishakha Nandan on this Sanskrit donkey donkey speaking other voice sound culture sweetest language I say you are Vishakanandan and such  I am Vishakha Nandan Nobody feels after Vishakha Nandan is a nice word  Okay, but it's men's do and KIA. Okay, so Vishakha Nandan who is there, he also definitely needs it. If you want to wash the society in a coal mine or visualize any old one, nowadays everyone is attracted and this is ahead and this is where some society is being hoisted on the mountains.  If that horse falls down, the horse will run away, the horse also needs different ration, the energy level itself is different, the donkey will not do it at all, it seems relieved, it has nothing to do with the sycophant, 8:00  If the bus is sitting there then Sir Neha is sitting there, Sir Rohit has packed up, Sir Rohit has packed up and gone, I am sir, your friend is here, what less do you have to do, tell me sir, he will do something, he will not do anything, he is making the film stand.  So many times what happens is that it is like a doctor is doing an operation, four-five people are standing there, this is not what is to be done, he will do something similar here too, you are standing and monitoring, he is the hero man, so the feeling.  thing happens for  The leader goes on to the story and something comes under him. If you look behind him, there would have been 10-15 horses. Are so many people needed? Is that hero on airport look? Have they come to receive him? Let's take a driver, a bodyguard, a social lifter also taken, mother.  Even if there are 10 people, you will still count them, they will come out of Puri, they have come with a cart, sir, it is a game of feeling, sir, we cannot do this in India, we do not need that much feeling in foreign countries, hence there also. Talented people migrate because there is value there. Feeling is very important here. Before that in college, this one is there. We all want what they wanted when our country was not free. Calling a slave would not be a big word because it was.  Azad said, I used to watch those masters and that went into the DNA and the story went that I want this feeling, I have to go there, now you will get that Hello Indian right because now it is not like that there is no different.  kind of  If there are people, then that feeling will be good and they are going to give that feeling. It is running in the DNA inside the ghosts that that and that person should do that if you look at it from his point of view, if you take a mother, you do not have much talent, you do not have much skill, there is no famine.  You have lost your job, now you have to save yourself. If you want to save yourself, tell me. If you have to make a difference, then if there is a big sycophant, then first of all, that person will come out who has less talent and less sycophancy too.  If he doesn't, then first of all he will be cut that neither this is of low value nor this prayer of Salam, so first of all his number will be cut, after that the number will be cut to the bone, it is not that only the sycophant will be thrown out, they will keep it and the hard worker will be cut to the bone, even the hard worker will go.  If you want to do less and also want this feeling, then only this above people also know that it is not just going to work for less, they also want this for less, but they also want these people to feel good in their big, so there is relief.  Is  Don't understand if you are a true superstar, if you claim, think you are a superstar, he doesn't do that, he works very hard, he is talented, he only thinks about his survival, so why do they give tests to those who are going to do less, this is their own.  You who want to reduce something are doing something, reduce yours, if it has enough power, Newton will be there, you will be tolerated, you will also be tolerated and it will not be there, and you yourself understand and if it is urgent, then brother, you will get it soon.  So I would say a little bit that whatever I have never painted in my life can be made black and white, then a little bit, whatever you need for survival, add as much salt as you need for your benefit, add more sugar, dog is too sweet.  Anything will happen, if there is a need for balance then please do not consider it as great, virtual is not so great, it is not so easy, it is not so easy to give your personal time, to be ready to be present, to be available on the phone, to pick you up on the morning of the bus, sometimes  elder  Not criticizing a person would be a quality of a sycophant, he would never criticize a person in the bus and the bus also knows the caste of any critic in the office. If you wander around the bus and find out the caste of that person, his sycophants will tell what is going on in any group.  What is going on will be shown in the screenshot, he will tell you anyway, if you know everything then it is consistent, in this, if you test them, then you are wasting your energy and these people are not wasting their keys, their fox is clear, this is  absolutely on you  While selling, he used to say, brother, our purpose and mission is clear, what should I leave to do, I don't know this, I will leave, I will leave, I will leave, not only did I leave after 10 years, we talk even in a government job, we talk in a government job too.  If you don't get a government job then I will leave it. If you are not getting respect then why are you doing so without any reason and if you don't get it then where is your courage. Do you even know who you don't like? It's just that you haven't got this skill. It's a simple thing if you  Do research in actual, it weighs 40-45 crores, it is not good like this, it is not good like this, so say something, you were not doing this, it is your choice, you cannot do that thing, do not do it in the matter of good or bad."

    "title": "Clarity On 02 Aspects For All Naukriwallas ｜ All Non Smokers Must See [qHk7-RYd5IY].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, I will tell you two things, whoever is going to work, especially in corporate or any other setup, do both these things and you will find something good happening. I will tell you two aspects, the first aspect and there is something for smoker and non-smoker also in this, especially if you  You are a non-smoker. If you do not smoke, then you have a huge advantage and that advantage should not be taken away. You are not able to speak, you are not able to observe.  This is one thing and all the non-smokers should look very carefully and if the smokers can also learn something then see it from this. The first point is universal. It has nothing to do with smoking. The second is with smoking. The first point is whenever you go to office  Whatever be your office timings, start 15-20 minutes earlier, reach your office early, people get late, then batting there on the first day is defensive only. Already someone is climbing the head You are always behind that initial 15 20 minutes in the office when you can just organize your thoughts Organize your table Organize your work That's it, an impression is also being created that it has come before time.  He comes and mark yours, don't go and sit in your shell, show a little of yourself that you are coming first, that lift man, that gate man, that leather man.  Anybody who comes later than you will know that car is parked in your car and where it is parked in the parking lot only you will know who comes when and if it is okay for people then that advantage is a great benefit to you and is a big moral right of yours.  If you have come before time to pack up on time, then I am telling you these things about time and job and productivity will increase, you can organize your day, you have to do this, the second thing I want to tell you which is non  There are smokers, they practically save more than one and a half hours in a day, the waste of the smokers and the smokers show such a favor by packing up late, by flattering the boss or by the way, we are so late, these days in the corporate, we are not drinking any water or cigarettes.  It is okay to smoke in groups like this, you are smoking cigarettes, then drink tea along with the cigarettes, go somewhere, then chat and then come back and if you count,  And this is what I am saying to all the non-smokers, Jagga, do a spy, look around you to see who goes to smoke how many cigarettes, when, where, how and how. You will release that Bhai Saheb and he is not one to smoke cigarettes.  When I went, I worked immediately and as soon as I came back, that break on work becomes a bit more. One and a half hour is the minimum, my research shows that people are wasting even two hours, but anyway from 90 to 120.  Minutes and the one who doesn't smoke, what is Max doing? Someone will eat lunch break, someone will drink half of his tea, then he will give you this thing and this is especially for women, I am not saying that no woman should smoke.  She might be doing it, but 90-95 women don't do it. This is also a fact. If a woman is late by 10-15 minutes, it becomes such a big issue. She was dropping her child at school. She was making something. She was doing something like this.  And this discussion on cigarette so many cigarettes, discussion on tea should have been separate, there is no accountability of those discussing cigarette, infact discussion on cigarette is bonding, especially if the boss is a smoker then sir, we will discuss there only what we are discussing about.  That's only ok, we were discussing the strategy and meeting, we were ideating, we were strategizing, this is the condition of the smoker, so the smokers will feel a little bad, you don't have to feel bad.  I have to give clarity that this is happening because if you are going to go at 6:00 and are smoking for two hours then maybe you can be forgiven but it is not your work, where will you work when you have to smoke so many cigarettes and What actually happens to you is that those who smoke do not even clear their stomach in the morning, they come late after consuming too much of it and then remain irritable and then they feel scared of going home and then they avoid going home in the evening.  vegetable of  Bring something, do something for the child, do this, then you stay till 8:00 and then show this to the non-smokers who want to go on time, that brother, I am brother, we work a lot, don't we work from 6:00 to 8:00?  Does it happen only at 00 o'clock? In many offices, there is a big problem for those who work six to eight hours and many people understand it like this, the traffic will be less or I will be sycophantic, I will do this, hey. Brother, come before your time and leave on time or a little before time, this will increase productivity in life. Your balance will speak while saying balance and next time you can quote that Sir, do you know how many cigarettes he smokes? You are telling me.  Yes, I don't get up from my desk, I come here to work for 9 hours, so out of 9 hours, I work for 8 hours, maybe for one hour I am also eating or doing something, but I do the rest beyond these.  also checked Look, these are the big ones, you can see in your CCTV camera, who goes out how often and how much they smoke and what kind of life they are living. The women here do not smoke at all. Most of them do not smoke.  Okay, 100% never happens and many men are also sizeable, those who don't do it in numbers, in quantity, and those who do, do six to eight things, so this was a fact, my job is to give clarity to the youth, brother.  This is what is happening, which camp are you in, see, I will not be judgmental in doing good or bad, I will never be judgmental after coming here, those cigarettes are so dirty, those lungs are like this, those photos are kept when they cannot scare you that cigarettes are  If you don't want to smoke then I wo n't come and tell you, don't smoke. Those who want to smoke, brother, you have your lungs, those who want to smoke, smoke but go to your corner and smoke, don't make anyone smoke and  The two hours you waste should be yours somewhere. At 6:00 to 8:00 you have to work. Don't make a virtue of a necessity. There is an English saying, 'Making virtue of a necessity is a necessity. The work is not finished.'  Now you will have to do it because it is hot, it comes every hour and a half, so in eight hours you also smoked six to seven and I know people 10  We also do 12, we did six, seven, eight, then roamed around, roamed around, came there, then drank there, then drank there, then drank tea, then discussed the tea and the cigarette, then that partner came, then something happened, see how much time is wasted.  You do this a lot there, it is possible that even when time passes and something happens, I will not comment there, but in corporates, there is that wall of trouble, in government, people are busy even after opening the window, if in the office, everything is going on.  is in the government  What is the matter with people who have got big offices even when they are alone, they smoke in the AC, there are such ill-mannered government officials too, if you have identified them then do it and they also make you sit with them saying that I will drink in the AC with you too, so if you are like this.  He is the boss and you are not a smoker. Join his hands. If you ever go to the cigarette seller in the AC, then you are doomed. Your patience will end. You are doing what is happening to him. I have seen a lot of people getting shy.  no women  You do n't even do this, tell me sir, we have not come, it is not our compulsion, if you want to come, then you come out, stand in the sun, we will talk there, don't come to this ass office of yours, this is in the government setup, I have seen it, have you guys seen it, did you understand?  I have heard, I have seen people suffering, I have seen these problems, this is a practical problem, cigarette smokers need to have manners and etiquettes, no one is telling you to stop smoking, because like I told you, when you see so many of those photos, you don't.  If we can scare then how can we scare, we are not that dangerous looking but we are saying that please do not trouble all of us who are non-smokers, who do not want to smoke, this is a simple message and please.  You spread it, ok and understand, thank you very much"

    "content": "Hello friends this video is about clarity for youth, who doesn't know that Nikhil Kamat ji is the cofounder of Zerodha, a statement of his came which was widely circulated by my subscribers, so I will give clarity on this very well, his statement was that I don't want to have kids because  I don't want to waste 18 to 20 years of my life. So, I will try to explain the war in a very simple and civilized way without arousing unnecessary emotions or creating any such ruckus, and very lovingly, so that there is a smile on the face and people can watch it without taking any tension.  If you see it, you will get complete clarity. Whatever clips and videos come, then the people who are opposing this thing, what is it today, the protest is no longer civilized, people write wrong and dirty things below, like this, your father wrote this If you had thought about it then you would not have been born, if you do it like this then you will never get clarity, brother, if you don't like the person who said something then talk to him comfortably, this is the environment  Now this is my political channel  Someday I will give clarity about what kind of environment has been created in the country, this is also a fact to react like this, so let's start on that matter, he took two Ajmans, what were the two parts, first of all, baby sitting of children aged between 18 to 20 years  I have to do this and having children is a waste of time and in the meantime I can do something else and the second thing he took was that in old age when one eye grows then if she leaves me or misbehaves with me or does not respect me or  If they don't serve then what is the use and what is the guarantee that they will do it, so he gave two messages, okay, so I will give clarity to both these messages as well, but I will say this now because I will say it in the beginning in the video because some of you will come to know  Hey, too his own, who are you to tell anyone what children should do or should not do, whoever wants to do it will do it, why are you even discussing it brother, these questions will come from whoever is coming, tell me right now that friend you should come and gain knowledge  The elder one starts distributing and saying that the children are not giving me time to do it  It is his wish not to waste it, I want to tell you that when you come to a situation of influence, you are the owner of thousands of crores, you have social media presence, then such things have no effect, if he had told the same thing to his mother  If you had told it to your brother, if you had told it to any of your close friends in the drawing room as part of a discussion, then what was the problem? Who are we? Those who speak also have a private life, but you did not do it like this. You chose to do it on a platform and tell it.  So first I would like to ask a question, brothers and sisters, what is this need to justify coming from within, if you don't want to do it then don't do it, what is the need to tell you that it is a waste of time for me, because people like us will come and question it, because it is normal  They will not let it be normal, they will not let it be normal, so the majority opinion will be that yes, marriage and children, you have this hunger for validation from within and I will link it up with marriage as well because many people say don't even get married, so both things  There will be clarity on this topic as well  There will be clarity, firstly today I am not able to understand that all these bachelors are running this country and want to enter everywhere, there is another bachelor, there is a narrator, I am not able to remember his name, if you know him then please tell me, it is very good, he  She says she is young, she is also not married, she is also giving advice on how a marriage partner should be, when the right one comes then do it and you have to live with him/her for 50 years and 60 years, okay and if you want to get married then how to get married  If it is there then I will tell you, the next topic will be when to do it, how to do it and what to look for while doing it, I will tell you that, okay then it will be a separate topic otherwise it will come under this, so in this we discuss about children only, half children  They don't do it so that when you become old, no one takes care of you, it is incidental, if something has to be done, if someone wants to take care of you then he will do it, otherwise there is no government, otherwise there is no social security, otherwise it is your money, there are many people  Those who don't have it, then that is no reason and yes, he is the right one, he says what is the guarantee that  Yes there is no guarantee that he is right but you are not doing it why you are doing it because it gives you a chance to experience life again you were once a little baby you grew up growing up something happened to you according to you  What went wrong is maybe your parents didn't listen to you that much or your teachers didn't listen to you, there might be some lack in your education or you wanted to do something according to your life, so when you are 25-30 there are issues that you didn't enjoy it that much, if this had happened you would have had a  So you are getting a chance, that is one and if you enjoy it a lot, then you have a template, if you have money, if people like Nikhil Kumar who own thousands of crores, if they don't have children, then one thing will be taken away from those children  No, it's not about that he has not said anything like this to girl children by opening an NGO worth Rs 50 crore. Well, I think so, but if you tell me, I will sponsor education, not for myself because it's not about money and education, parenting is  Not only about this, it is about creating a character, creating a personality, having a I will not again use the word legacy because again I said this that no, I do not want to leave a legacy, I do not want to leave my name behind, yes it's okay, the name should not be used by anyone anyway  It does not go further, nobody among you who are listening to me does not know the name of your grandfather's grandfather's grandfather, you may know the surname, you may not know the first name, you may not even have your photograph, you will not remember, so there is no such name  Not only this, I don't understand much till you are a very great, famous or from some such family where your ancestors have done something great and if there is no documentation then there is no issue of legacy, it's about experiencing life, it itself is that  A small child grows up gradually and when a girl grows up, she has to experience life with her, that is the reason why you have a child and this is an experience and someone between 18 to 20 years of age  One does not have to baby sit for years and since when did men have to do it, since when did men start baby sitting in India till 2024, so this has not happened yet, yes sometimes you may have to do it a little bit but in the first place like this, not for 18-20 years  Kids do n't baby sit, it's okay in the beginning, they keep sleeping, they sleep with their mother, then they also play with their grandparents, then they have their own life, then they also go to school for 18 to 20 years  What baby set will you do for a year and the child is also going to school for seven to eight hours, then he has his own daily routine and once the child becomes a teenager, turns 13, then in any case the parents keep complaining that they do not sit, do not meet, do not talk to them  It is not like they are going to be 18 to 20 years of your life and the second thing is what else will you do, friend, if you will not do this then what else are you doing, no, I am doing my thing  Hey, the kid is also going to school at that time.  Hey, you have to work only for 89-10 hours a day, after that there is Saturday, Sunday, Holi, Diwali, New Year, Bhai Dooj, Rakshabandhan, all these, when you have to get married to have a child, then there are all these other faces of life too because what happens when Nikhil Kamat says this he if you look at his face now I cannot get very personal but a little personal he does not seem to be an extremely happy person there is no happiness on the face then it is frustration when you do not do this thing and it is an intellectual challenge This knowledge is given by making someone wear a mask of ' Prashant' Prashant 'Pareshan Prashant' okay so Acharya Prashant is like this, he also seems to be very troubled when he is angry, then there was confusion about the name Prashant Pareshan, but I used to say troubled  I was going to do it then it seemed like I was not trolling you like that but it was not like that then they also behave like that why am I telling you this, you should look at me, you should understand me carefully that why am I making the video and  Call it my ideology or what my messaging is, what message? First of all, if you like the message or it strikes you somewhere, which I am sure it must be striking a lot of people, then please spread it in your groups because it has taken the form of a pandemonium.  It is not taking the form of an epidemic, it is taking the form of a pandemic, why do you need to justify this, you want to get married, you don't want to have children, you want to do one, you want to do two, you do n't want to do six, do whatever you want to do, but when will you come and say it?  Or no, all this nonsense happens and then by making their own cult and they say yes yes yes we agree with you, love you, they will not let this happen, that is wrong, that is wrong, no one with kids ever comes and says this normally that you should have kids while walking around normally  Okay, it is a very good thing, people do not say anything because they say such things, friend, these are natural things, many people would say this earlier because the children used to be very big, population was high in India, so having a child was not considered an achievement, okay, because it used to happen anyway What should I do, tell Acharya ji Anybody can do it and if you think so great then have a child, many times what happens is that by having a child you become a little great, it is not that the girl has never taken any responsibility in life, many will agree who have daughters and whose  I have sisters who are married or who have their own wives, who knew someone who had been in a relationship for two, four or five years before marriage, how she was, I have seen her change overnight, I am a great observer of society, I am very  I observe the same girl who it seemed like how will she manage her expenses, what will she do, seeing her become a mother, I mean all the hormones and that child takes away all the responsibilities and I have seen a lot of men, boys are boys and women are not married.  Even if you do that, a 35 year old or 38 year old woman would be a little mature in her mind, behavior and way of living her life. She is not married, she probably has a kid but she is a woman and she will not be that out of touch with relationships.  You might also know, you might also have an idea about emotions, but this man, he  He remains a juvenile until he has a child, gets married, if he doesn't get married, he remains like this, he remains a 42 year old Fukra panthi, making such videos, doing friendship, drinking, roaming around and debauchery, there is no purpose, nothing because  That and then come and tell the world that I am living my life bhaiya you then at 47 our Radi old man has a lot of respect for me I at least got married late for what ever reason but after marriage asked brother what to do lots of babies directly too  I want to have a child brother, now whether it happens or not, I will tell you later but I never said anything like this in messaging, earlier also there were many bachelors, there were bachelor leaders also, they came and went, meaning and they never did anything like this  I did not say anything, even great men have been against marriage a lot, even today this about families and not having children and why so much messaging is being done, I do not understand, should the whole country become bachelors because for 18-20 years  It is wastage, 1820 years of yours will go to waste and if you do n't do it then you will utilize it but then what will happen to that utility, what will happen to it, I have had my experiences, what experiences have you had, you went for a trip, took photos, did trekking, mountain  I went cycling, did manji jumping, this is how you can count 50 things, take 50 anything, did white river rafting, went to the beach, went to the ocean, did a cruise, visited a foreign country, did water sports, did adventure sports  What else will you do friend, there will be 50 photographs, all those activities will be of two, two, three days, I told you 50 activities which are done beyond limits, it will happen in 150 days, now what is thrilling, you have even done sky diving, now tell me, it is all your money  You have done the work, now tell me I am talking about 50 tasks, not even one or two, whatever I told you, I told you 10-12, but keep thinking about its list, keep thinking, 50, then what is it now  Life is not very long, it is not short, this is what I want to tell through this video to all the youngsters that life is very long, in youth it seems that it will pass, we see friends, then those friends, now like Nikhil ji's age is probably around 40.  It's going to happen now that he's married like that, the rest of the people don't see him that much now, they do podcasts with youngsters and they give this kind of messaging which is very wrong and I want to ask that all this which  You are messaging, suppose he got married after 5 years and then he said, oh I was right, actually this, you have ruined so many people, friend, because people who are rich can always recover in their life very easily, people who are not very  Rich people who are middle class, it becomes very difficult for them, you tell me, a little fat belly, less hair, grey hair, 44 years, 43 years old man, now he is now middle class, he doesn't have much money, now he has realized it and his shop is closed.  Isn't it now  Who will do that to Nikhil Kamat ji, even now he looks physically fit, he has a lot of money, so anytime he wants to change his decision overnight, even after four years from today, he will do it, so that's why I am giving a message to the youth  Do not follow these people, first of all what is the problem in India, if someone earns a lot of money then that is success, now that success will be talked about in everything, whenever you have to look at it like this, what do you have, that is not it  When knowledge is there, it should come from the very facet that what is being said, concentrate on that thing, on the fact only that what is being said, who is saying it, it should not be a thing, the rich is saying it, the poor is saying it  The middle class is speaking, anyone is speaking, any gender is speaking, age is speaking but the focus should not be beyond that, the focus should be on knowledge, what is being said and that is being questioned because what happens is this They will put intellectual touch on this mask  Some people will say, go for the knowledge of Geeta ji, do some other big work, do great work, there are no such great works and today, brother, the way society is going, especially our majority people from Sanatan Dharma, are going  I am not making it a religious religion, you know what my take is, I am not in that category, okay, they are in danger and all that, I am dispina, which society and community are you taking them to or not, child.  Don't do that child, it is not a pen, it is not a pen, it is a child, now I can tell you with any example, we only ask about the child form of God, in Ayodhya ji, whatever has happened with the Ram Lala temple, so in that, the five year old form of Ram ji is there  The form which is being worshipped is God-like in it, Goddess is seen in God's dividend, child form of Krishna is worshipped in small baby and above that is that energy and that is the God, no matter how many stories and stories you have.  If you are like this then basically understand this thing, don't run away from your route so quickly and no one should come here  I am not talking about compulsion here, I am saying that many times my hair are grey, I am just a few years elder to Nikhil Kamat, I will also be younger than his elder brother, I will be equal to him, okay so I am not saying anything to me  To the youth, hey what do you know uncle, many times mistakes are made, Gyan's hair do not turn grey with age, that is why I am telling you, I understand all these youngsters' requirements and I am saying this with great sincerity and great love affection, don't Fall under the true narrative Just ask what is that need that should be called out because there is no peace You have taken a decision that you don't want to get married You don't want to have kids That decision is taken OK now why are you seeking validation  for this because it is keeping you restless every night whether it is right or not so you want to tell others and then you want to take a feedback yes bhai and then you want to look at left right and find so many people like you for numbers now married person is not having this inside se desire ki yaar mere ko aisa chuck maine shadi kari the right kya maine  I did the right thing, he doesn't say it like this, I have had a child, I did the right thing, he does n't ask, nobody is asking this and no married person and a person with kids is going around with people who don't want to do it now, today there was a time ago aunties  They used to do it in houses, aunts and relatives used to do it and big pictures were made of the wedding, who are they to tell us, they were all right but they have given up that generation and the rest who are like us nowadays, even we are not  I have also changed myself, I don't forcefully say do it, do it, don't do it, I always make videos when someone comes and says that not to get married, is a great thing and not to have a child is a great thing, I am saying to have a child.  is a great thing Getting married is also a good thing, it's okay if you want to do it, do it, if you don't want to do it, it's also fine, but not doing it is not a great thing if getting married is not a great thing, then not doing it is also great  It is not a thing, but a child is life it itself, life is sustained on the planet, something is fine and you can call it a purpose in life or you can also call it that you come home tired when you are hit by the bitter frustration of emotions outside.  One child is okay, now many people will say no no, I am raising him for my own happiness, I am not raising him for my own happiness, I am raising him to enhance my life experience, if you are doing all these things then understand this basic difference That's it you are having a kid not for your selfish pana because you can always say that I don't want this selfish pana, I do n't want any inheritance, I do n't want any service, no he the way he is speaking he is speaking s  Like a corporate guy who is looking at my profit and loss, I will buy shares, I will open a demat, this will be beneficial, this will be beneficial, if I do n't get any benefit from this then I will not do this, it is not like having a child is experiencing life first hand.  a life grows in your hands okay because when you're a child you did n't experience it in that way now when you become a parent you experience it like that when you become a grandparent life is a second chance first chance or the one you had your  The baby is fine and then after that if his baby is fine then he again becomes different and has fun then one should try to go in that direction, all the grandparents who can be there should be told to do yes also we will also help and have fun well then your  At the time our focus was here and here, your focus will also be here and here, but our focus will be on the baby, you earn your money comfortably, do your job and do it, we are there to the grandparents, a message to you also.  so if you are a female who is about to know have a baby or wanting to have a baby if a youngster is listening to me please forward this video to all your family members they should come out and support all the time ki bhaiya hum main hoon na hum  Isn't it? Don't worry, India needs to talk about this. Please like, share and subscribe to the channel. If you want to take membership of the channel, you can take that too. Thank you very much."

    "title": "Comparison With This Type Of People Will Always Make You  Miserable ｜ Find Out [7NCiLmj3iu8].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, I want to tell you a very important thing for all the people, especially for the youth because if they become old then it is not so applicable but 23:30 It is very applicable in this Never ever compete with this type of people never ever compare to complete.  A more correct word would be perhaps. Never ever compare yourself with this type of people. That's who. Starting line is not yours. What will be the starting line? The starting line of our life. People call it socialism and in the name of all this, people have called everyone, everything can be done. It does matter if you are working in a corporate, you have come from the 'I am' route, you are exactly in this position.  Whether he is in a good position or someone is in a lower position, he is also in this position and if he comes from a rich family, his obligation liability is less. These facts help in getting money every time you buy a house.  You get money in buying, marriage also gets more money, your new social status has come and the responsibilities are fulfilled, marriage of two sisters, marriage of one sister, Uttarakhand, building a house for father in Haldwani, treating mother, doing something for the family.  There is no need for the villagers to do anything to the relatives from your starting line. Yes, I am telling you as an example, because your salary is high, but brother, if the salary is high, then how much is the package? 20 lakhs.  Use 40 lakh, 50 lakh, 60 lakh coal of 30 lakh years, but behind them, there are chambers built in Greater Kailash. If someone's ancestors can make a new wave, some wish may become this, this is the truth of life. If you compare it with this, you will remain sad, you will say. I have gathered more, I am more intelligent, I am more hardworking, I am on a bigger post, I keep speaking, keep thinking, keep understanding how much, but yours in Greater Kailash  The rate of the house has become 14 crores, it was taken by his ancestors, it will come into his hands and he is not doing any savings, now if he does not save, then he roams around in big tax. Want to take a photo in front of the Leaning Tower of Pooja with his wife.  Now you can see this on Facebook and keep going that you and your wife can also be there, see with you somewhere, your junior is your junior, this is the place of all things with all in corporate government and also in government employees.  Even among the government employees, people think that if we are senior then we are rich. Who can be the will player role? This group is your junior in the job and you are sitting here in a very official manner, so this is the third generation group.  If your father is a clerk or a doctor or a farmer, then he is one of those things. Now you will see this, collect the car, travel around, share everything, then what will happen then, never ever compare yourself, check the starting line before comparing. Comparison Comparison Saying no comparison is a bad thing, it is a moralistic thing, I do it in a comparison manner, you have to do it, right, heart beat and you know kidney function, they ca n't stop it, their father is very rich, it is not their liability, it is your father's  Loans are going on there, this is how it is going on, this is how their money comes from home, this comes, this is how corruption comes, this is the reason, quickly compare someone with him.  To do that, this yearning, de-satisfaction, it is not that just by seeing it, it becomes less, then in less of it, because somewhere, only the meaning has to be found, someone will harass him, he will be called useless and then those who are like minded, from whose starting line. Well, no one talks like this in this class base, because everyone wants to remain correct for the quality because no one will create this kind of content, it came on YouTube first. Don't think so will you understand because we have kept it in isolation that this is my finance, this is my real estate, this is the kind of English speaking, everyone has kept separate for communication, I have combined everything and am bringing a buffet because everything is this.  Link Every time when you go and you tell me I am of you My request to the audience who is listening to me is that I am of you are identifying with whoever  I am saying please type ID so that I can have peace of mind, I do not live in any other India and you are coming somewhere forcefully and in a small car because it is the boss's liability. That check is older by four years and older by two years.  He is 10 years old, he is more qualified, he is you, what will he do now and this is happening and whatever he is doing, I am telling him also, don't do it, it destroys you, he is eating his destiny. Where else was the luck and destiny born with him, you can't take it, you can't take it, this Sachin Tendulkar scam, playing is fine, cricket is not talent, it will do well, it won't do, what will it do brother, if you sit, you will get good kit, if you get good post, then good  Now there is no need for anyone else to cry on this thing, you are understanding, okay, then there is no need to cry on this, like that Sam cricketer has done his struggle well or no one has got it like this, he is batting from a bad bed.  Like you are doing, you are one generation behind, so he did it, I am telling it as a platform, then there are people in India who are one generation behind and they feel that you are very jealous and the person who is born in a rich family.  He will always keep giving the explanation that what should my father do, if someone's father becomes the Prime Minister and he is born, what should he eat and if the same person is doing less business then just keep going and why did you get it comfortably?  A doctor does not get comfortable. Tell the farmer's son also that I had created nepotism and even on this matter, if the farmer's son becomes a farmer, then it is not nepotism because it is considered poor, if a doctor is becoming a doctor, then nursing has become right here. Got home, a 25 year old boy is sitting, a girl is sitting straight, not doing anything, he is sitting around his neck, notes are coming, head of you is buying a van, he is not starting the generation, he is running a business in a way, just think about this.  don't be a hero now  Now you have the realization that I will get back from him in 30 years, we will work very hard, brother, what his parents did in 30 years, you will be lesser people in 15, and in 18, your wife will also be there, you will work hard, you will work hard.  You are very great man, take it in 15 but you can't beat it by half on the first day, he will travel in a nice car on the first day, will live in a nice house, will enjoy his life and this thing will help you.  There is no need to tease, this country is ours, this household has done the work, it is more historical, not the last 100 years, I did not get the chance, I did not get this, I also become like this, change now, leave the man, father, adopt his parents now, this means  You will get many replies only, if you want to equalize, you have accepted the truth of life, you have seen the destiny you have got, the cards you have been born with, what things have been told to you, you are Understanding This Basic Thing Are You People Identifying With It Tens It Reduces Bitterness Tens It Makes You A Little Bit More Happy Tens It Terms If this is happening to you then you identify If you are doing this to someone then you are committing a sin OK  It's just because you have studied a little and you have learned something and your father is poor. Just like being rich is not something great, in the same way being poor is also not something.  Let's do something great, why we are very poor, we had a lot of struggle, please, the whole country has struggled, the whole world has struggled this way, during World War 2, the condition of all the countries was the same and it was very bad, okay, the whole world.  The whole country is struggling, the whole community is struggling, the whole world is doing it, so it's a great virtualotid to cry, I was born in a poor house, I have uprooted the flags, so it's okay, I too have uprooted being poor.  It is not a great thing to be poor, it is not a great thing to be poor, it is not a great thing to be rich, it is not a great thing, it is okay, we have taken the rich as a man, then why does the poor need to perform the aarti, why should the poor perform the aarti?  It is necessary that your parents have achieved something great, so what to do now, otherwise it was a lot of hard work. Well, these are the stories that I have collected. Parents listen to their children too, so I don't know what is the struggle.  happens to know  There is no need, I have done it, someone else will struggle, it's not date verses, I am not doing it, how did you guys like the video, please share it with people, how do you like this kind of content because when you get out of this thing You will concentrate on your journey. What to give you? Who was poor, who was rich, who came ahead of the rich, who overtook him, who has overtaken him, God has given you his car. Make the capacity of your car. The second one is Mercedes, BMW is Alto.  Desire is Nano, it is going at that speed, what do you have to take, if you are sitting in Nano and want to compete with BMW and want to go ahead of it, will it work or not, you don't want that much, focus on yourself, focus on your journey and Run it in the best way, upgrade it in the best way and don't disturb the others. How will this come to him? How will he come to this? I am a person, a talent, looking better, this is better.

    "title": "Concept Of F.I.R.E. Analysed ｜ How Some Finfluencers Are Fooling The Youth ？ [-piBLnA0hQI].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, we will discuss the concept of fire again. Youth is very strong. This concept is youth on channel clarity. You people will get a lot of clarity on the topic and watch till this fire is not the fire of Pushpa fire, this is FIR, financial independence, retirement and Lee Bade Youtubers have juiced it, there is a student on the top in it, Ankur Bade Ko Ji because by picking it means the concept of being a father of 10 years, 15 20 years of western people. Introduce something new, it seems that even if there are jobs here, there are talks of retirement first, so I, a leader connected to the ground, who actually works on the ground, has come up with something. How do you like the video? Do share and tell.  You will have to understand what is the opposite thing that is being told and what is wrong with it in life and what should you do in its place. I will tell you what should be done instead of this fire. So, first of all, a little more about the concept of fire. Discussion  Let's do this on the basis of this, 99% of the content on YouTube is in its name, what is it based on, brother, what is your concept that in 40 years, 45 years, you retire early, which is fine and then you set some standards of your own.  Do it or you can relax and what will you have to do to do it. Three tax terms do it in English. It is called frugality basically in Hindi, stingy means do not spend money, do not waste that you  What should I do? Do you need a mobile phone? Do you not want to drink coffee at Starbucks? If you ship it here, then it will happen like this in Excel, it will happen like this, it will happen like this, then you keep your gold like this, achieve the gold for the children.  So do this, do that, then the money will also be less. These five or six words are from English: Frugality Gold, Mini Militia, Passive Income, Money Wing will be less, then you will have this much, then you can assume that it will be 14% and then your  This much will happen in so many years, if we have got so many returns in the past, then we will get so much in future also, that is, if India has scored 140 runs in 20 overs, then brother, if Karan is at the rate, then in 50, 350 will definitely be scored, maybe 400.  Hey brother, this saree can already be priced at Rs 200. This saree is of Assumption colour, the saree is of English colour, it is just a play out, why is it a caste, why is it a hit and why do people listen to all this?  Because you are in pain now, while I am in pain, your life seems measurable. You just feel that you have some freedom. The biggest problem is that you have to be frugal by not spending money. Even after having money, not spending it and giving priority to time gives more stress and trauma. What is the problem of not having a plan for your retirement?  So people hit that million and billion by doing what the English did, Rakhi Bibi did the rally with frugality and took notice and could have stayed in 4 bhk but lived there, could have done it within 1 bhk. Innova Christ roams inside the auto.  By doing all this, you become the same person and then when you lose money, you don't spend it, then you don't spend it. Your child wants to go and eat. Someone wants a cake and blueberries worth four-five thousand rupees.  Thing  One piece comes to Rs 800, no no wastage of your life is over, better than this is the story of poor people who keep working hard and keep reading their aspirations, see parking giving liver more full feeling life, I will tell you in this.  What to do first, let me live out its shortcomings and issues. The biggest thing is that this money is the first money of income. Income has not become so much money and what is absolutely wrong is that it will continue to be received in the Indian Scenery which also follows all these.  By doing Retirement Corps, I was thinking that my expenses will be this much and this much will be taken out. Brother, those who have regular income will not be taken out. Because people have not cut off, what is geriatric care, that in old age, someone will take care of you, you are not in the hospital.  I know you have created on replacement of created on heart surgery on your created, liver transplant on you created on which surgery farana dhanka na uska paisa aapne  I have done it, but brother, the children will not be in the mood of a human being to see you. This means less. We had thought that children or maybe I will not live this long. Yes, in 80 to 95, I don't know how many crores of rupees can be spent on this. This is fruitless.  Do this system of fire with you, then I will retire while roaming around, so I will not go around, oh, the notes will not be spent from you, they just give me whatever is left, saying that when I am done, I will do it, they will not be spent at all.  I am telling He will not be able to buy plane tickets, he will not be able to stay in a good hotel because of his habit Reena Bhai since last 15-20 years, it is not right to have such a minimalistic and frugal mindset in this mini militia, I am not able to do this like two paisa dance bar.  I am not saying this to reduce it, but what I am saying is that in the concept that has been shown to you, there have been many such husbands and Patiya is ready to leave them and die because they have given the story, this knowledge.  Took it, then the story is that if they are imparting knowledge to the children, then their children go abroad. I know many rich people who did not want to give exposure to their children by spending tax money, otherwise the money will be wasted, then they run to America to get that smooth paan and  When we go to other countries, we leave them and this is also the reality of life, why do we take notes from them, that is, in India too, there are small oaks to live in, where you feel good after drinking smooth paan, you feel good after eating and drinking, you feel good after wearing clothes.  Which brand is there which is not available in India? What kind of food will you get after filling up? You can go to Umesh Mall and get such good French food which would not be available in France. Okay, everything is available. I am talking about Gurgaon. Tell me everything about the things which are not available outside. This available list will also be available here, you will get all the things, if you spend money notes instead of manners, but you will sit on it like this, children are far away, wife is far away, did you get Kapil Sharma, what to say, is it okay, did you get this instead of fire?  Now let me tell you what should be done, leave this matter of saving money away from the mother, Sir Fox, focus on earning money, do not set any goal that I will not save anything for my child's education till this age, this is a stupid education. You are not being taught anything to loot any money, this is the system of Illuminati which runs the system to fool you that you do this and that, do your thing here, save money here, do that as earlier people were old women.  She used to put notes inside the rice in her kitchen. Nowadays, they make her put more stories and then say that when yours is full, it is okay for her to break the piggy bank and then you finish it here, remove the thought of spending ₹1 from my mind.  Where to spend it, where are my wishes, then earn so much money that if you want to spend it, you do n't have to think twice. If you put it in the jar, if it gets filled then it just goes around and around, then it's over, then it's okay. Then it's for the child's education.  wedding and  This life of your old age is over like this, my friend, life is over and if you live this life for them then do it like this in great miserliness, this jar will get filled soon and then as soon as the jar gets filled, then you can make a wish and tell your story comfortably, hey brother.  These aspirations will change, retirement will change, opportunities will change in India 50 years ago, 60 years ago in India, be it rich or poor, there was no opportunity, those two cars came Fiat Ambassador.  There used to be Doordarshan, only one channel used to come, then for the people of Delhi, the second channel used to come, there were no choices, who knows which choice will be there in the future, everyone got a chance to survive in the moon, now they are going to the moon after 20 years.  If everyone gets technology then your mother will do it, you did not cater for her, you were playing fire fire, so you only know where you are, what and when, what mother will do. Don't lead life without purpose, on earning money.  Concentrate, concentrate on earning money for the family. If you spend ₹ 10, then will you have to plan to spend ₹ 10? Can you tell me? Do I have to plan when the desire is 50? The expenditure has to be 45 so that the expenditure does not become 52. Planning then.  This has to be done when a man is batting well, making good fours and sixes, then he does not calculate much. If the run rate is on rate, then you know that I will win as many matches as possible.  If I want to leave frugality and all these things, go for goal based investment. Think that as long as I have breath, I will earn money, I will use my brain, I will do networking, I will do skill set, I will do consultation, I will sell knowledge, I will attract people, I will do anything till  My dear, I will earn money and as long as I am alive, you will earn money, then do any calculation, they say that in 30 years this much will be worth one crore rupees.  The value after 20 years in 7% inflation is 25 lakhs, today's meaning is that if you invest ₹ 15000 at this percentage then after 20 years, please tell me the value too, it will be reduced to crores, it feels good today.  But if the crore that comes will be equal to 24-30 lakhs, then why are you stuck in these queues, who will get how much, what will happen today, I have to live my life, in between I have to watch movies, eat food.  When you wore good clothes, your body had to go out, when you don't have to go out, then what will you do with money, then it will become money, then again philosophers will come, other conscious beings will come and they are going to awaken, that too Baba.  Yes, are n't you roaming around, are you saying that you should run away from it? If you feel like this, then it is foolishness. There should be an intelligent way to run away, not the desire for money, it is very important. When you earn money yourself, then you will not pay attention to the expenses.  You will get pleasure from earning money. Whatever I am telling you, you give knowledge on YouTube, right, Dhaba, I don't know how much money is earned from YouTube, no one has ever come and told me properly, but this much is okay.  This kind of free knowledge can be earned so much that you can sit on a higher panel and feel comfortable that you too can do something like this here and there because no matter how much your monthly cash flow is coming, many people  Akshay Srivastava ji also says that my expenses are only two-three percent, then if you give any knowledge, then your story is also adjusting by 97%, but the man has to enjoy himself, doesn't he? A person can easily show a poor back and this is what is going on behind him. It is a good car, the child does not even need to be sent to school, it is necessary to send someone to the house, it is necessary that you send your child to school, it is necessary only if you know your road to this endeavour.  Hey, will you waste your time?  I am staying in my house, bring the best teacher, someone will make him move ahead in the house, someone will teach him poetry, an artist will come and teach him drawing, the math professor will teach him math, it is up to you, then tell me brother, home schooling is very good, then this is good, this is just a matter of course.  It's a simple thing brother, I want money, don't keep your fire behind me in the pursuit of money. If my fire of 24 hours comes quickly, then I will keep that fire behind me, meaning today's fire is on the Independence Rally.  Where will you go to retire OK D Correct you have you generate rate multiple sources of income You have you make your money sir, what is your wife's income, she will have to reduce it and she will also have to do it yourself, you will both earn money and then multiple sources  And only if you do it with your income, you will score goals in this world and be happy. Okay, and then you will not have to think again and again about the expenses, otherwise everything is budgeted.  Keep how much is my expense, why do you have the same sodium currency and expenses, you put the money in the bank, spend with it in a bank or it is necessary to get an app, you have put lakhs of rupees and are spending with this, if only ₹ 80000 is spent 20  If you go to the bank, after your expenditure of 80 lakhs, you have to deposit another Rs. 20,000. Brother, this is Rs. 1,20,000. What is the need to count daily? Today I have given it to you here, today I have given it to you here.  I took the credit card, I took some cash, then I took it out, then I will keep the account and waste my time and show this 50 up to the people, then take the coffee from Starbucks, oh brother, earn money like this, story, drink coffee as you wish, whatever you wish.  Eat this, there is relaxation in it, Johnson shirt, you like it, think like this, first change your thinking, the story is that I am not going to retire soon, I have to earn money till my last breath, then those overs which someone has bowled for 20 overs.  It will be 50 overs. Hey, if you make it 75, then in 50 years, you will have 50 more accounts for your wife. In 20 years, the wife who is sitting at home is middle class. The husband wants to retire in 20 years. Where will I get from here?  I am saying 100 years, this is 20 years, how will it happen in 20 years in 100, you can easily do it in 100, then it is necessary to invest today, you say 20.  In a year, I will stay warm with the thought of today, I will not spend twenty-four rupees, I will do something, no, I will not do that for another 20 years, wait till 95 years, oh brother, you cannot sustain 20 years, if you are 42 years old, then you will have another 92 years.  You will live with 20 years of income and assets and investments can never sustain these activities for 50 years, this is a math now it is absolutely 20  You become a billionaire in a year and you do some startup and listing will happen, that is a reality, that is not happening, a normal job of 20 years with Musaddilal and playing soldier in it, you cannot last 92 years, yes, you can do 42 to 50 and then 50.  You will have to reduce it again, so that your children can do something less or can take advantage of the platform or can start from where you have reached, this is not what you did and that too from here.  If you start then brother, then you are coming again in 47, reduce the power, no, I told you so many years, instead of spending 20 years today, enjoy 100 years and reduce it, even then it will be equivalent to 60 years in front of this, three.  Guna Ye Fire Wali, whatever less I did today, you will still do it for 40 years, you can relax, 40 which Mian Bibi, after accounting for both of them, I am telling you, Mian Bibi, both of them.  After accounting, I am telling you that the cup was very life is very long, it is not going to cut after 75, when you reduce the activity, you have to live till 95, Ratan Tata ji is still investing in companies, still listening to the presentation.  They do n't have any such thing in the future also, why are they doing that, where will that money go now? To keep yourself active, you have to work less and earn money because what is the biggest thing about it, right?  Income and assets and things on which you were relying, you retired early. Technology would have changed things and you became so satisfied here that you did not take advantage of technology. You had a lot of time, there was a lot of famine, there was a lot of patience and that was the time. You did not reach here by utilizing it, you will be happy only with this, so all these people are saying like this that life is not competition, it is a single person's game, the number of runs you can score here, what are these people doing right now?  You will be double sensitive. Now don't leave the bed. You can even score 500 runs here. Unless you get yourself out, you will not be out. Say something but you have to hit tuk-tuk. There are sixes on each side.  By doing this, as long as the game is on, the game is on, meaning the game of life, keep it on till then, you are enjoying later, you are also spending money, you are also giving it to the children, no, definitely not to you, why not give it to the children? should not be given  Have your children got a platform? Have you reached a stage? Is your stomach full? Is your income increasing? So let your children enjoy. This middle class and others will also say that children get spoiled. Children get spoiled, meaning Mukesh Ambani ji is spoiled.  K Dhirubhai was the son of Ambani ji, he has become very spoiled, brother, business decisions come in many colors, there may be problems in the family, there is caste, but it is not necessary to spoil, the matter has continued further and the one who wanted to spoil did so anyway.  Money has to deteriorate, go nothing, you do, it is a big misconception of the people, okay, without devotees' money, a lot of things will get spoiled and without money, things will get worse because if money comes, then you lose something, list brother, this is some incentive.  Behave yourself is fine then please spread this awareness and these people who take your life forward by telling this on Excel so quickly is wrong, very wrong."

    "title": "Crypto, Goa And Now Dubai ｜ Why You Need To Question Such Influencers ？@AkshatZayn [_nTH3QZg-aU].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, this is a very important topic for the youth because he is a popular user and he has a lot of following. Now he has gone to Dubai. Making this video is very important. I, the one who is following me, I had said two years ago that Akshay Srivastava ji will leave Goa in two years.  The same thing has happened, I am not claiming that this prediction was made astrologically, I am an astrologer also but two years, I had said and that is as it has been almost two years. Leaving sa aa pao, I will tell you the needs to answer to his audience. The audience is also common. Why am I making this video? I will tell you at the end, so let's start with the real estate of Goa. He said, come, come, come, I have come to Goa.  Always opposed Govansh supported the video has 1.5 lakh plus views and not only those views there are thousands of comments in the comment section which Gonus wrote  You are absolutely right and today I am going to save many people from many things through this video because what is the I will say danger in following this influence, I will tell you with an exact example, this influence is such that I opened a samosa shop, great.  Make Samosas No one is saying that all the content is bad or education about share market was not good Make Samosas good Make a lot of good Make it very popular  Samosas have become popular, the world has eaten them, so now let's open a Sashi shop. If you are eating samosas then it is a thing of dirty oil and then people are left hanging and dry. Their entire audience is also that and confusion is also great confusion now.  They are saying Dubai, Dubai is right, why should I not go to Dubai, why should I not take Dubai, I will tell you that this video is not going to be just a condemnation that such renting video and something it  Is going to be very educational because this is what will be done first of all he says that I am very transparent and I am selling this and guy its updated and I am living Ek toh by talking so fast in English na that  It Looks Like Things Are Going Right You Don't Have Any Choice But Not to Tell Your Audience That You're Going to Dubai Because Dubai  I have to sell the goods, go there now and sing the praises of Dubai, it will be visible outside. If the audience like you make a video on this sofa, then just keep this sofa in Los Angeles, keep it in Canavera, keep it in Sydney or keep it in Gurgaon, then that.  It is a different thing but when you have to show, explain or sell the goods, then you have to tell about its reasoning and that connection. All the juice is lost. Crypto can be bought easily by coming to Dubai and cannot be easily bought in India, so then here. Why were they selling the world or not, it is not the world, now it has been released that the government in brokerages is like this, government is bad, bad, bad, let's go here, I will do another prediction now, I will again do another prediction for Akshay Srivastava ji, two years from now, I will Leave Dubai will also come back and I am telling you the exact story, how will you say it, write it down and take it.  It will be repeated guys, it's not working out, there is a lot of loneliness here, I am there but the advantages were like this because that story gets played out, the sugarcane story of everything has the same juice, Goa's juice has gone out, Air BnB's pole  Goa has opened, go inside Goa, the local politicians are protesting. Famous top builders of India are not able to launch projects there because of Wayanad land slides and that.  Like things have happened, it will set up for ecological disaster. Govan is folding his hands that brother, don't come so much, pay here and go there, take the property, take it here, my air conditioner has also failed, what is this my biggest problem?  What am I against that I am also a creator, I did this, I am doing this, I am this, I am this, what happens to me, friend, tell me the useful thing, the person will automatically understand from your personal example. Personal Home Family My Wife Has Resigned This I knew from her that if I want to go to Dubai then I have to resign, I had told this 2 years ago because everything like child care leave, maternity leave and all that remains, so it is a fact.  This is what I wanted to say but by giving my examples, many people are getting misguided, hence it is important that any creator should give very personal examples in the  Name of transparency and it will feel good in the beginning but the focus goes beyond that and not on its knowledge. Now the next thing is Dubai. Ok now tell me any shares on the stock market every day. Today I am buying this, I am selling this, I have moved.  Out Now I've Done Swing Trade I Use Jargs Good One Ok Call Put Option Future Or Say This Swing Trade This Trade This This That This That Cashing Out Setting Now Complete  Now I am this oh my God, the next guy is a complete edge exploiter and those youngsters who were thinking that I will become rich by trading, my income will come like this, something like this will happen to me from the stock market, real estate is worthless, real estate is worthless.  When real estate was at juicy valuations in 2020 21 22, they were not allowed to buy it because they said it was worthless, then they bought their own 21 in 23 24.  Showed that there is a lot and everything, it is in the videos only, it is not that, I am making some kind of accusation that it is the conveyance, sometimes what happens is that you impress the people by speaking straight, no nonsense, plain type, that.  The next person says, hey, it's simple, you are right, I will also tell you the seventh point, I will also tell you my new prediction, I have told you two recently, I am not active on anyone, she must be me.  Even today I say, my prediction is that Gurgaon will do better than Dubai ha ha ha ha ha, flats worth Rs. 100 crores have arrived in Dubai, Dubai has the status of flats worth Rs. 100 crores, so many new launches have been made, flats worth Rs. 100 crores and it should be written in it.  Is it true or not that you should not buy here because if you have so much money then you can buy a flat worth Rs. 6 crores in Dubai and buy your car there like this. Hey my brother who loves Louis Vuitton bag.  If you have bought it for 35 lakhs then tell him, friend, you should buy this Alto only, hey brother, there is a Maybach parked near it, the one who is buying Ton, it is fun, he does not want to buy it, those who are buying here for Rs. 100 crores can have it. Is it already in Dubai? May be they don't have the address. Is it already? Yes, it is the middle class person who is buying it for 100 crores. It is like buying a Louis Vuitton bag. Someone says, oh man, this is good. This one buys only Rs. 1.5 lakh Pro Max, that crowd is different, he has different requirements, he cries for taxes 24 hours a day, I also create a lot of content, my channel is only one, government politics, Modi ji and all this.  There is a dedicated channel to create noise, it is not that I am a sycophant, it is okay but ranting on constant government is ranting on taxes. Do this about the country, you should do this constantly, I do not refuse, but without solutions and then you will not be allowed to celebrate being a fugitive. Okay, there are businesses, there are individuals, the country is free, you have to stay mostly there, you will stay here for a few days, 180 days, 200 days. When tax fax is there, that's a different story, it's fine, but don't celebrate it like this and one thing I believe is that if a person leaves the country, then  Whoever wants to go should go for some reason, okay, my video is pending on that brother, then you don't have a moral right, that Dhruv Rathi sits in Nana Germany, brother, do it by sitting here, only then can you get the taste, friend, do it by sitting here. I know it comes with the associated little bit dangerous also it is ok people will say I am sitting here in the dust and here I am speaking and because I am speaking because sitting here and speaking  What is the benefit in listening? The listener will also listen, the government will also listen and the rest of the public will also listen because the gift will be such that you want things to get better. You genuinely want it because you are living here, you go there and go out and then it happens like this.  That's it, friend, you are letting us down. Now I would like to tell you about the feelingless Dubai. After 2 years, this is what will be said in Dubai. Loneliness happens there. The biggest problem of Dubai is loneliness, there is a lot of it and Indians.  Ca n't survive even if you are doing a job, there is a lot of loneliness there. If I am an NRI, please type. Someone living in Dubai is your brother. Write about the failed states of the world. Rich people have come there and have been made artificially rich. Breaking news is this.  Yes N you will also see maybe Akshay Srivastava ji promote others also Sharja will become the new thing now after Dubai Sharja will become the new thing again just it  It is like Delhi, Gurgaon only, same is also Dubai Sharja, now you will get to hear the stories of that place, they talk about real estate rental, but brother, the maintenance is very high, trucks are used for sewerage, the famous thing is water, find out.  Check whether sewerage works in this place or how it works. Maintenance is very high. Second thing is capital appreciation is limited. Third thing brother, citizenship is not available in the soil there. Will you go or come back to India? You will never get citizenship from Mother India. That country has said that it does not take tax from you but it does not even make you a citizen. The country is not ready to make you a citizen. Brother, there will be a waiting list for citizenship in US also for 60 years.  There is some procedure at the age of 50 years, whether you go there, are you paying tax or not, whatever work you are doing, that is not your case here, otherwise you cannot become a citizen, then what is there there?  Clients will come there, they are rich, okay, go here, SIP of mutual fund and buy stocks, stock market, I told these stories for four years, I told them for so many years, it is again like they had served samosas.  Now if you go for Sashi then open a separate channel, this is my advice also because if you have made one because then I will tell you why I am making this video, I am making this video because why am I making it that Akshay All the subscribers of Srivastava should come to me and my subscribers will increase. Guy, I tell the truth, I can't tell lies, it's okay, I have to and no one will tell like this, I am very transparent, you bastard, the cult does not decrease, friend, tell the truth. I am telling the truth of my life. Well, my video is my content, it is layered, call it grey, call it higher order, say anything, I can say whatever.  What do you say because I claim to be down to earth like it is said, I am a leader, a practical person, I have clarity. I have removed the word motivation, I have stopped giving youtube2 and speaking, Vivek Bindra has stopped being a motivation speaker, it is like a curse in itself.  Went because I said that he has corrupted his mind so much. A new word has been coined 'clarity giver'. Now people have started using the word 'clarity'. It is like a word from the dictionary is called ' clarity'.  That's it, don't follow these guys, you won't reach anywhere, they'll keep telling about their growth, now it's like this, it's very good there, guys, look, taxes are bad, it's like that, cost of living is also something, isn't it? What do I get for selling, does anyone charge tax on the goods? Even in India, a poor man does not pay tax. He eats a biscuit of the size of Parle ji. There is tax on that too, so he  If you don't pay tax there like that then it will be taken anyway and will be taken from the cost of living and other associated issues will remain and that too, there are no trees to be seen, no greenery to be seen, there is a lot of loneliness and there is so much crowd. If you are not at that level then you will always feel poor. In India, if you earn even a little salary of Rs. 00 then you will not feel poor. There is so much poverty in India. There are big advantages.  I am here to stay, I am here, Hello friends brother, I can also go, Dhruv Rathi ji has gone, Akshay Srivastava ji has gone, what work am I doing that I have to plant a basket here, I have to sow wheat in the morning and then Crop has to be harvested and this has to be done, this sofa will fly and sit somewhere there and there, there will be a good view behind it, this is a so called dull view of the sea in which there is no life, it looks smooth and minus the sea.  That's why Gurgaon will also become like this in four-five years and it will even do better brother, you are taking more money, buy in Pali Hill, I will tell you which project to buy in Pali Hill, Mumbai, India will do better, doing better and staying in India will be. Better in any way and bar Dubai Dubai Hey in India now you see what is happening with Canada Canada because this video is not to encourage people to go to Dubai Shopping festival in January  I have to buy something and bring it by all means, go by all means, but no matter how many consultations I have done there, whatever consultation I have done with NRIs, one word that has come out is loneliness and that is my request through this video. Because many people look at Dubai, UAE and that side also, if you are genuinely an Indian working there, I am sure there will be cleanliness, there will be some fun, it is a city of rich people, but what I am talking about  I am saying, I am enjoying the taste of living, I am enjoying living, that is not the end, I am telling Akshar Srivastava ji also, 2 years was the last time I had made, I said I will leave Goa now, say 2 years.  I will be leaving Dubai for 2 years. Yes, but the stories will run for two years. Look, this one is so much, one BH is worth so much, there is a rental, a rental, a pental, just like that, they come to me for so many collabs. Because Aa Real Estate is a real estate exclusive channel that now it is not necessary to take the names of the builders, just take the names, do it like this, do the collab, they come, you come, get the ticket, then I said brother, I am not going to come, I am not going to India.  So you will create an environment like that of H and M. Now it is very tasty to go there and stay in M. You have to check yourself, then if the story ever gets twisted, it becomes something like Canada, then where will you go if you have expanded your business and made investment.  Lee Real Estate  If you have bought then what is the exit, the country itself is not yours, why invest in it, then brother, no, I do n't feel like agreeing to the six crores of Gurgaon, there are many more places, Pune is the short ticket.  There is Bangalore, there is something good coming in Hyderabad, no, no, no, in South India, why in South India, if you can do it in Dubai, then there is no problem in South India, there is no problem in India, there is a problem in investing in India by being an Indian, from Jammu and Kashmir.  From Kanyakumari and Apna Bhoot to Dib Garh, the country is so big, there is so much opportunity, there is understanding everywhere, there is kinship, there is acquaintance, there is friend circle, there is so much investment, don't invest in Dubai, Goa has been refused.  Look at the awareness I have single-handedly spread in Goa, what was happening there, the politicians are doing it, people are doing it, I am not going to do that, bring the information and tell the people that.  After melting, you check why I should show the article selectively like Dhruv Rathi, Shik Shik Shik, do a little yourself of Aam Aadmi Party, who are the law makers there, who are the others, who is doing where and what should happen.  And there are protests there, this is going to become a political issue before the elections, the burden of so many people is there because they are not able to buy local Goans, their income is not that big, in India, if you can buy all the Goans with this much money, then the people of Goa will be satisfied. There is no sustainable living there in Goa, other than tourism and tourism also, I am telling you brother, this sea looks good in the month of November December January, otherwise if you go in any other month then go and see Neel Bhate, the silence remains quite empty.  There is no data of Air BnB, it is not looking good, the whole of Goa becomes Air BnB. In November, December, January, Sir, everyone starts living somewhere outside, everyone gives it on rent and people come but this This does not mean that the model is not sustainable, you go and buy it, nothing will be left, it is like running a taxi in Goa, who will drive it, will see it, and people will understand that I have saved many people's money from getting wasted. How about investing in crypto, which may be good, but if you can't do it in India, then why are you so young? Will you start batting with crypto only? If this is your first ball, then go for it. Little by little, buy a small house, do SIP, take mutual funds, take FD, use your skills to trade with crypto, then she will not know the exchange, then she will default, then she will disappear. What is the fate of these influencers? This is a monthly income of crores. You can go anywhere every third month. Anything can tell you a story. Guys, no, this is not okay, no, guys, this is okay now. Guys, this is guys, I like it. Brother, you will become very stupid by singing guys and guys guys, because what happens is, I have released one thing in English, you can impress in Hindi, you will be caught, so Hindi is only used to shrug off such trolls.  For, it is not like that I do not know Hindi, I know Hindi, but what is Hindi in Hindi, if you speak in Hindi, you speak in Hindi many times, you understand that you lag behind in explaining in Hindi, but the same thing in English.  It is said that no one can speak English, your senior guys in a corporate setting, there is a paradigm shift happening in the market place and we are launching a new product and under the guidance of the CO, we are moving from strength to strength and we are Gonna change how the market looks Abe chhutku sa to main naya sauce ko laaye hai Put it in English quietly Why are you telling me friend, it's okay I mean all that is to impress  Things are simple, tell everything simply, stop the presentation, tell the paper as normal, what is happening is fine, so this styling will remain, this money will be wasted for many people and there is more fear, I think this inheritance money is wasted, no youngster can.  Buy Sach Property in Dubai So the crowd that we gathered is no longer of any use because as told to us, we have gathered the problem eaters and now we have opened Sashi Dining, so all I am saying is that it is an advice to you.  Create more channels, we have also created many, many, many, why don't I know how many views I get. By going to social media, I get to know everyone's status that they are sitting with 5 crore subscribers, only 2.5 lakh views are received, exceed the limit of one video.  Pay other wise 50 lakhs 1 lakh and your subscribers are 50000, still the views are 40000. Okay, so how many views are coming and with the views? See how much is being said that makes a difference and what is the impact of what you are saying on the society. That is the most satisfactory. You are not there or someone is dreaming, dream is dreaming or you are not like anyone, dream is you. No one likes all these youngsters, 20, 25, 28, 30, some of them got inheritance money unfortunately, the truth is ok. 14  If anyone wants to invest Rs. 20 crores, it is not there, so I think this was very important that I came out this thing because now Goa's Roka is now Dubai, let's go to Dubai and this was already predicted. Stay away from Dubai, stay away from crypto stay. Away from Goa Go and See My Goa Video. If you have not seen it, you cannot buy so many views and so many comments. You are understanding that it has been typed and written by a human child after reading it.  It is known from the user ID that it is not a fake, it means the English is written in human English and if there are genuine concerns, then this was a genuine video, there is a genuine requirement to spread this message, kindly spread it to everyone.  Do this and do n't stay in these cycles. Don't buy in Dubai is the message just. Here is my video for foreign settlement. You guys have to go out, I am doing a lot of research in it. End  The same thing over and over again, there are always no straight black and white findings that one should go or one should not go, that's why it's taking time because I'm speaking to a lot of people who have done their making, my notes will come out with a very  Very clear verdict brother, what to do that many youth have to go out to study for a job, they should go for settlement, if it is like this here in India then no one is straight yet.  The answer is no, I hope till after Diwali, by calling me completely beyond that, whatever clarity is definitely emerging, a trend and a trend are emerging, a pattern is emerging which I can see and that is beyond that.

    "title": "Delete This Word From Your Life And See Magic Happen [NnURbBzSklM].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, this is a deep topic, it is taking a lot of effort to make it, you put this abstract thing in words, already taking a toll, okay and it is difficult, I am trying and try my best to stay connected, be successful, somewhere, I was able to understand some thing, I was able to explain it.  And if you understand then please write and if you are not able to explain then write that too. It will seem abstract, it will seem like hair order is thinking, it is a topic, it is a word which you remove from your life and your life will change and it  I will also tell you two words by replacing it with which word. If you have understood this video, I will try my best after watching it. I understand that I know that you should remove the pure word from your life, meaning every person would come when you should be doing this. We say this a lot. We have to remove the word 'should' from our life because it has become so pure, that is, like everyone is giving knowledge and the truth about things like the way you are eating curd with curd, the ways in which you are eating curd wrong, that yes, my lap, the ways with eating curd.  would have been  There are seven more ways if I am doing wrong then the right way is a lot of shoot is going on Mummy you forward WhatsApp on the family group Shoot shoot is going on You should shut up A lot of shoot is going on Okay so I just discovered this  This is the thing we have to replace the shoot, I will tell you under the example of want, I hope you understand, you know you should slipperly so date you can get up early, adopt, you are being opposed by many youngsters.  It doesn't happen on time, that's why I took this topic. If you are sleeping at 12:00, 1:00, 2:00 , 3:00, then you should be sleeping. Order is going to go here, so I am telling you in advance, so you should sleep early.  The world speaks, I don't sleep, I don't know why I don't sleep, I don't know why I don't sleep, you have to see this, that's why I can't sleep, because the whole day I was doing something that I was doing for someone and was getting someone to do it, it is not a lesson in productivity like this video.  if you  You see, this is your down time, he needs it and that is why he is getting late, so we have to put want word in it, wherever we are putting pure word in our life, we have to put want there, date, I want you, sleep early, nine, when you put want, your  Want is pure, the world is telling it to be punch in 50 shoulders, want to give you food, put that, let me continue with the example that when we realized that actually it is  Not D I want you to stay late, no body wants you to sleep deliberately late, but his daily routine is going on in such a way that his down time is meeting time, starting at 11:30, now he needs a date of 2 hours to do something like this in his life. Which has reached its order because whenever my penis is not converting into what you want, then there is something which is stopping you in it, there is a scab in it and you have to reach down to this because normal. Everyone who goes by saying 'should', you should respect your parents, you should do it correctly, you should do this, you should do this, then why it is not happening in that, you have to find out, everyone should know everything, everyone should know everything for 25 years.  Suits are known, if you don't know then the world will tell further. As if you say you should get married then yes you should but same you are not getting married no I don't want I don't you want stress  They give and you cannot go in joy, you have to see your want and move towards the want and realize that why this want is not coming, I will be able to continue further because in this learning, the curd of the mind is also of one's own.  Whoever brings the template of I Hope I Will Stop It Only Time, now you write in your book as a homework, how many are supposed to be given to you, how many of them you want to do and what are the reasons.  There are many good shoes too, which you are not doing because you want, what is the actual thing, he is crying, we dismiss him, we become strict on ourselves, no, why are you not doing mine, mother, everyone knows this thing is right.  You also know but why there is no want and you also know that there cannot be want everywhere, so if you are going to the market then through the whole system of the society, you will get 10-15 of your wants which are less than yours.  They  Do it with time, you can increase it. Once you understand a concept in your life, thank you."

    "title": "Do Not Apply For Govt Jobs If You Fall In Any Of These 4 Categories [m8pOTKU4m0Y].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, this will be a very important topic, do not apply for government jobs if you fall in this category, which category is to be discussed, the number of people who are applying for government service, it is going to give a lot of clarity to YouTube, it is very important for my tax audience.  This is a very important topic, please share. If you are a parent, then understand. If you are a child, then give it to the parents. Discuss over tea, discuss in the group, tell the inside story.  I am talking about the latest 2023, I am watching the full video till the end and I will reveal a secret which normally no one wants to do on the public platform of YouTube because it is a very gray and dark area type, you know that is the truth of life and if you  If you agree with this and if you agree with this video, then please shower the comments in the comment area, because of this crowd sourcing of knowledge, a lot of knowledge is generated, people are very good. Many people have written that there is a lot to learn by reading your comments of people of your videos, I am very happy, you have date quality of subscriber based then let's start if you are a person of this category but 18 22 23  If you are between 24, 25 and 30 years of age then please do not come here, I will also tell you the reasons for that, first of all I am telling you the category clearly, if your father  If you are a Group Pay or Group B officer in the government, then please leave the government. Don't even apply. Don't do it. If you are not going to pass, you are afraid of leaving. That is not the belly in the fire and even if you become one then there will be no one in life. Even among clipping and greatness, father was there to meet the group. Even if a boy or girl group is formed, it is not a very fun topic. Father, it was you who were also engaged but the poor or the poor or the rickshaw puller 30 35 city of  India has all these taxes, these are your Pune, Ahmedabad, Bengaluru etc. and after that, count the state capitals which are yours, like Chandigarh, Jaipur, Lucknow, Bhopal, Trivandrum, all the big cities of the South are also counted.  Hyderabad etc. came in the top, you hold upto top 30 35 40 city, if it is a proper city, above 10 lakh 15 lakh is a proper city 20  Population of lakhs is your property, wealth is yours, please do not give it, it is not worth it, I will tell you further, this is the second category, okay, leave the small faces, it is okay for the villagers, Samastipur's will come, Ballia's will come, Arrah's will come, Munger will come.  Ka will come from Supaul, let them come from there, Dantewada will come from there, story will also come from Chhattisgarh, but if you have gone to Raipur, Naya Raipur, then leave Ranchi, leave it, leave the meaning of tomorrow.  If you mean you are from Guwahati then leave it, it will not give you happiness at that time and I will be telling you reasons and this is what Kari said now, the person who is going in selection 23 has to work till 60, 55, 60, till 2015, it is okay, so  I am telling you that the third category is if both your parents work or earn money, that is, even if your mother is a teacher, she still earns Rs. 30-40 thousand. You don't have to join a government job because of your status and that thing is butter, you don't have to do it and the fourth important thing is that I am telling this to boys, it is different for girls but I am telling this to boys if you are a man and you want your  If your wife is working and that too earning money and you live in a good place then please do not do a government job. Wives in government jobs should not do jobs because the cities are such posting places and where else they are not and if he is in a government job then he will live with you all his life.  there will be struggle  You will keep writing letter after letter, tomorrow by referring to the government's letter of 2008 about that policy of location, your hair will become like this, you will not understand what happened in your life, your life itself will be cut off, if ever you are a government girl and she is a teacher, then what?  So don't marry that girl either, I am telling this to the men, it seems that she is taxed by what you have to do, no, who will do it with her, I am telling my audience, there are 144 crore people in India, I am my royal.  There is an audience who can understand what I am saying. I am telling it for them because many times there is a comment area. If you tell me something, then who will reduce it? Yes, some people have to reduce the sewerage also, if they have to do it in Mercury too, then  You do something less, it is not even being told, if you have a choice then you will do it, the world will do it, India has so much population, even after doing all the less things, 20 crore people are sitting without less, so there is no such thing as who means less.  will do whatever Everything is becoming less, the lesson will be learned, if you are in this tax category then don't do it, if you are lower class, come from a poor family, in your family father is a peon, laborer is a rickshaw puller, mother is a maid, then because of men you are doing all this.  As soon as you get a job, you will get a huge jump. You will never be able to get the money from your work because of your social status and the system you have, but I would like to tell you that my second audition is the one that I have given motivation to the lower class.  I am not motivating them, after 4 years or 5 years of doing the job, they will know what I am saying, but it is still okay for them, I will tell them why it is okay, but I am telling them that the system will not give you power in the job. As soon as I am telling you, this is happening, now I am saying it by saying that no one has done research on this and extracted the data. Even now, if you see it on YouTube, see it in newspapers, see it on social media, then you will see your ears and eyes.  will hear a lot  The rickshaw puller's girl has become STM, she took the exam, became an officer there, this became her opportunity, made here in garment, made there, made here, the system knows this, the system is not even giving power now, who is the system, who is the Illuminati, who is the system  Today you will not be worried about who is running it. In the times to come, government officials were said to be good at four-five things. Modi ji took away the red lights long ago. It is fine, there is no corruption.  You will neither get power nor respect brother, if I take out these three things and add dal dun tadka posting in it, frequent posting, posting in small districts, posting in small posts, then are you a Haryana or someone from Haryana, it is a small, very small province than Haryana, you are a  You can do a job in a corner and in a corner you keep your family, Chandigarh Gurgaon bus or someone keeps it on GT Road, then they keep on enjoying the job and the weekend job is the same thing.  Let me tell you with your example, see eight big cities with you which are named, you will start from where you have some education, education is fine, although Lucknow is the best, but you can do eight more cities, do Kanpur, do Allahabad, do Prayagraj. Sorry, do Prayagraj, do Meerut, do Agra, rest like this, I don't know the name, Robertsganj and Samastipur, Mirzapur and even there it is not like that the district headquarters is among them.  If you didn't even know, then you are posted in Ballia, are you posted there and where are your children studying? Are you doing less for your wife? If you ask people in Rajasthan to tell you the names of the lions, then after that they don't know the city. Say Jaipur.  You will say Jaisalmer, you will say Udaipur, you will say Bikaner, in the circuit in the tourist sector, I will say Suratgarh, where is Suratgarh, Anupgarh, Hanumangarh, Sriganganagar, Tonk, Sawai Madhopur, you will not understand what to do, then you.  Don't do a job in Rajasthan Government. Don't go far away and do any other government job. Do n't do it if you have a house in a good city. Why else? I am going to tell you the secret. Listen, I will tell you that only because I think and maybe I am.  You absolutely understand that my words will reach only some other audience, that is the last secret, that is the show stopper, that is the last reason, it is okay if your family was fine, you are not from a poor family, you have a sense of achievement in the future by taking a government job. No  You will get this very big thing, I am giving you a secret, I am telling you a very big thing, if you don't get it, there is no benefit, you will get such houses, if there is a band, then they will not be opened, such houses will not be opened, we will say that the one who is coming from a poor family, is living in a room.  There were six people living in the house. Those who get a three-four room house in the government, there is a sense of achievement for them, but if there is Jaguar, Toto and Kolar in your bathroom and that fresh water comes and it comes under pressure. And all your sanitary ware  The society is good and you have good tiles and good work. Your lions are made of silk and you have made century ply. So please do not cry about the government job. It is okay that you will find termites in the cupboards. You will find sewerage issues etc. in your sink.  There will be grass outside the house, there will be grass in the front, there will be a forest. Of course, if you go to DC, which is only 643 in India, then maybe you can get a system for cleaning the house, otherwise no one does it since then. Saree  Adish and AIDS, the surrounding remains like this, the sipes shoes are there, the pipes are not from the old pipeline, there are sarees lying in the street and whatever system is there, it is the government system of taking the government houses, which are called by different names in every department, now they are not taken by name.  I will defame them but eat a lot of money but the system is there and they don't do anything. If you are an official of consequence and you are in the system, then perhaps tiles, tools, clouds will paint your house, but it will take you 20-25 days to reach there.  It will take years, by then you will be 45-50 years old and there is no happiness in living in these shredded houses. Yes, we are from lower class, live in slums, live in a colony near the railway station and in such systems you have seen it.  If you whip your life then you will lose the sense of achievement and people have to bypass this and in the times to come, I will keep coming to the last point and tell this throughout the house.  Gave corruption, told him that right now something is going to be released on Netflix by Sandeep Bhaiya, he has made all this job from Allahabad, he has made it from Prayagraj. Sir, how is the coaching of the system by tapping and responding every time?  If there was a shop band, then they would have brought out something like this, that region which I was trying to tell about the inner feelings of brothers and sisters, the mother would do this slowly and gradually, turn up the volume a little and put it in your ears and listen.  Because it is not politically correct, anything else is also not correct but people will be very angry but I will make it clear here that I am not giving cast test classes to any class but tell me what I am saying, understand it carefully and with full force.  I try to tell you that now such people are coming into the system who are coming down from the stable, but how to come down then, is it a bad thing, brothers and sisters, should one not become a rickshaw puller, should one not become a maid, should one not become a laborer?  If this child has studied, he should do this and become his own. Baba, where am I? I am from where I am, this saree should be made, but when these people come to you in the bank and you come here to live your normal good life.  There is a lot of pressure, trauma is happening in consultation, I am not getting any dreams, I am not getting dreams that I am coming and making such a video, here I have seen the whole pattern very well, notes have been made, trends have been made and when that form  it becomes  The thing is playing out, tell me, is it a pain of pain that the officer who is above you turned out to be an exploiter and has worked hard, but he is butter, but when you have seen that you are below him, then you can tell everyone about your status.  You get to know where you are, whose house is where, who is dressed how, who travels in what kind of car, whose wife looks like whose children, what clothes they are wearing, the school has spread Raita in your life by playing out their jealousy factor. Government servants are facing problems in their personal life and this Tabla will now have to leave everything. When all of them will become the same then there will be peace. This factor has also become a system within them as to who is the brother and where has he come from.  Then we will take us to the top because every person identifies with himself in life, by his community, by caste, by status, by religion, he is very much ours, he lives with us, we do everything in every way, then suddenly the people of Tabla have been exploiting him for years.  Whatever he is extracting from the collection is right or wrong, does he need counselling, does he need consultation or does he need discipline, he does not come so openly because when he is doing it, it hurts someone, it just gives a little that  There is prejudice within me, just look at it, it says that you are no less good, you don't know how to maintain files, you don't have knowledge, you put him on temporary duty, you go there, you didn't go there.  You, on the other hand, will push her to tie her, isn't it? When she tortures her daughter-in-law, is it at all logical? Is it just because she has to control me and I am irritated with you and you are a spice and Hello to me, this is my basic feeling, isn't it? Rest ask, hold someone's hand, today the food was not cooked properly, when I felt relaxed, today the milk was taken out, today the kitchen was not cleaned, today guests had come, you did not listen to Chunni but Audi above, you Hello, that is not good, anyone can give any reason, it is okay to do the trouble, but that is the trouble, then from this trouble, whatever I do to a tabla of India, today I told the audience, this is only my audience, rest of you also learn something.  If you go then Guruji is Guruji but the audience in Guruji's class is that someone from outside has to learn how to learn. Please understand brother who is a man because you will definitely get to learn because I am not at all like that. He has made up his mind that he will pay this much fee for the song and this man will not come, but I am telling you people and those who come even from a small poor Tabla, you too will not get the taste, now you will start coming from the very bottom.  Meaning absolutely below, because the population is so high, there are so many jobs and out of them, brilliant people will come out mathematically, out of a thousand poor people, one child will turn out to be very intelligent and among the rich, if a little, if from the upper middle class or middle class.  If even one out of 100 is being selected then they will number you out because their number is so high and the income is so high, so if I am becoming an officer every time in India, then by setting up an exam department, I have done all the year's Group B exams.  And brother, if you remove A's then hit the limit, it will be 5000, all together it has thousands, invest ₹ 10000, invest 20000, you will make ₹ 20000 from the net, you cannot make more than that.  Not only this, there are not so many numbers, even though the numbers are less, now this is the maximum crowd, what is wrong in this, they should be given a rock, if Swarnim has a category in it, it is for poor people, then it has become a rule, the one with 50 is there, so it is.  But now what choice do you have and I am telling you that gradually the flow of government reservation should break because no political party has taken power back then, there is only one way for this, to make the government like this.  Do not do any lookup for its look forward, however, rare steel, oil and after 76 years of independence will go, now it is 75 years of government job, its courage has become a company but in the coming time, there will be less, a system is running that postings of one's own choice.  There is no taste of meeting, he is a poor man, he is hungry, post a story to him, he has become an officer, there is no problem because that is his life, even a story was nothing, post it, dog, children are not in school. His social status in the family is not visible because nowadays he does not speak much after calling, brother, earlier you used to be an officer, so you spoke less, it is said that something has happened that today if less is right then it would be right and  If it is wrong then its risk factor is so high that no relative or friend will take it for you, that means no one will take it for you in 3 funds, then it is a fact that when you will not be able to reduce it for anyone, when you are not getting anything which I have done to get it.  Hey brother, I told you three things Sir, what do you say, you must have got it till now, friend, till 2030, I am talking about 24 to 2055. Those who are employed today are already employed, where will they run to yours now in 5 years, 2 years, 3 years, 10 years, 15 years? As many jobs as there are new in life, tell me who am I talking about, have you seen these patterns, are you going through these emotions, are you  Going through the truth, what I told is that he is prejudiced and on the contrary, what used to happen earlier was that the man used to come from the Lat Saheb family and he used to oppress them as if the social system was going on for 5000-10000 years, that too was wrong, now the story because time has told.  Gave it to you, how much do you keep telling them, I am in the bus tomorrow, I am too busy brother, so he has to send yours, whatever you put, on which day I have to know the reservation.  If you want to go on Diwali, then he will be sitting, your reservation is not happening, he will not sign your leave until he makes you a waitlist, if you do it before that then he will make you move one day back and forth, he will do it like anyone, do n't say.  This is going on the date, go after a day, you don't know what is going to happen on this day and you have to be there, it will just be thanks to you, then ask this, hold on, hold on, hold on, this is the visible pattern, avoid them, leave them.  there are two toxicities  Leave this, it is not a job, it is very secure. Do you want to know in detail how much security is there in a government job? I will tell you what is the security in it and everyone else is crying about that security. On what basis will anyone go to the government job, what they are doing?  Now I will also do a workshop on this, how to prepare for the government people, if they want to be expelled, if you want, then write in the comment area that you are working so hard in a government job, etc., that you will get a job.  If you do more then you will get 10 times more money, people provide your back, you are from a very poor family, your parents are not like anyone, they do not help, they are poor or there are differences or they are not getting money or they have a kind brother, keep it up.  Keep it up Munna Bhai, as long as you are engaged, who is expecting you, but if you have a good family, then how did you get an ID? It was a boy from Chennai, IT Chennai Mechanical Engineering, 2 years job with his friends around him.  father has  Forcefully send him to a government job and that boy is in depression type, what's the matter and his salary is Rs 16 to 18 lakhs and the package of his colleagues is Rs 50 to 55 lakhs, it has been two to three years since he graduated from IT.  This courage is ruining the children of the world. Somehow these jobs are created, leave them bananas and their further sense was only supported then, sir, the power that is new in the system has been removed. Like it is said that there is a poisonous snake or something like that, I will not compare the government people with snakes, but the one who is a fan or whatever he is, has been taken out, it is moonlight, it happens, you can destroy the life of the world.  This one is also there, sir, it seems good if it is present, but it is going, brother, if you get it, then keep going, who am I to believe, but at least check the number of A's that you have kept, see this which is a sign of corruption.  The water was running at the speed of a peepal, otherwise it would be so much that it is moving towards the pipes like drop by drop and everything is getting tight. System, band this note, change this, take it out there, give paan.  Two have to go out, have to stay in hotel, have to give here, buy jewellery, fancy fit and in both of them this rupee coin, this digital e and one rupee digital currency and all these come, then it will be Block China and you will know this. What will happen and we came to the government with the thought that it would not be less than yesterday, no one would say hello to you or ask you, earlier passports would have been made to you, how they were made, how the system was, now see people, it has become such a wonderful system. Leave it, don't waste your time, 2 years, 5 years, do n't even give 1 attempt, don't even fill the form, leave it, too much is pending, will not proceed further, if you see the pension now, you will know how much it is, even that has not been made, you have seen everything.  things are getting tight  The government will not be able to tolerate so many employees, productivity will go down, everything will go down anyway, then the future will not be good for the government and after three to three years from now, any girl who has brains, intelligence and looks will be a government employee.  You will not get married and this story will become like this, then the one who is prepaid, your name has been changed in six years because in a government job, it takes so much time to pass that by the time you, poor fellow, have passed, your job is gone.  It will seem that your value will reduce in the marriage market. I am telling you this by making a prediction while watching the trade. Now whatever this is is my original thesis, there is no video on this thing, it is made by copying me, we will become but this is original.  If yes, then tell me how much you agree in this thesis. 100% 50% 80% zero percent or none. Government jobs will remain sexy in India in 2100 and never.  Khushi, there may be many who will be like this, even if there are extremists like this, I will write, okay, that is not going to happen, one thing is sure, so please share, like, thank you very much."

    "title": "Do Not Commit This Mistake While Switching Jobs [r_bc_wVc6eI].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, this is a very important topic for the youth. Don't commit this mistake while switching jobs. We keep changing jobs. We should change jobs. I also say that it is not necessary to stick to one place, but what mistake are the youth doing? What mistake are the youth especially doing?  It has been and I have got many cases and recently why did I make this video because those cases also came on social media Sharan ji is from Finance with Sharan, he has a startup, no percentage club, he has many people  Now he himself has been fired, he talks about financial management and in Jogeshwari in Mumbai, he incurred such huge rent expenses that he had to cut his job, it is a business, what to do with him, but due to this, many people are upset. For example, if you are employed in Gurgaon, you are like this, Kaju Bhaju, don't go to any startup because if you go there, you will be fired in four, five, six months.  Sir, you have to pay rent there, you have to give a turban there, that is the security which is there in Bangalore and one has to pay a lot for that, a lot of money is spent, a lot of money gets wasted and those who are married and have school children, they are busy with school.  People are also doing such foolishness. I had told earlier in a video that the first thing is to find your work place, do not change it because this instability is causing a career growth. People think about it but you  You should know how much stability you are going to a firm, how much raise you are going for, many people are appointed by some designation changing, I will become the head like this brother, in a big company, small designation is quite ok than in a very small company.  Big designation, when the whole game is about tanka, someone calls me as me, people call me something, call yourself something, what is tanka, I am here, the executive will be called manager, someone will be called VPA.  Who is there, there is no horizontal promotion, there is no vertical, there are many ways to do something, you are stunned, but you consider this, don't do this mistake and this is what I am saying, try inside the startups, don't go because burn out here.  If the rate is so much, so much, so much, then what will one do if no one goes, this becomes a problem, tell me something, then like this, if you don't go to the army, then who will stand at the border, tell me something, everyone's  Do you get fooled by the middle class? Do everyone watch my videos, will everyone follow me? I am saying that there is too much burnout, there is no financial stability, this is why they take it to their heart's content by doing sops. Sops brother, everyone's list is not the same for so many days.  He is roaming around doing soups and soups. He makes rooms. What is the name of the hotel room? It has not been listed till date. Environment is not good. Where will these tents of yours come from? What is the name? Are the losses so high?  Look at any of these startups, brother, how many losses are they incurring? Look at Jagi and Sugi, its IPO has also taken place, it has reached that stage, outsiders will get exit, look at the losses of everyone's scam.  How many are there, you can see this Physics guy, check it out, a few years ago we used to hear the name Baiju Baiju Baiju Boo Boo Baiju Baiju got saved, after that we said, Hey Physics guy is right, Physics guy  Look at the losses, 2000 crores, there is some rain, 11,1200 crores are losses, so better than this, Astro Talk is going on, 99 crores is sitting in profit, astrology is good, people say that it is not scientific, yes, it is okay, it is the stories of grandparents, the same.  It is bringing profit and you are teaching here that there are losses in every startup. Now if there are losses and you will join with an open mind that one of their  A new firm is opening there. Today it is opening in that city. You are being sent as the head and in six months your shop will be closed there and then you will eat because listen carefully to what I am going to guide you, you will become a good person.  You used to work in a very good firm. You used to work in a good firm. You had a good position. You had hundreds of problems here. Okay, a startup told you, come under the canopy, you will get respect, you will get money, you will get power, you will get designation.  Everything is called here, you go, now when his shop will be closed, because you got here because you were sitting here, then you got here, when the shop is about to close, when you run to the next one and he will say, where are you coming from? Coming from Baiju or I remember very well about good aviation because I am into it that when King Fisher Airlines was closed when you know right and its pilots in between you know Sahara was also closed because it  Phenomena has played out many times, Sahara was closed, the name would be King Fisher, then it became Jet Airways, so brother, who is their captain, captain is called captain, this is your captain speaking, he went there and became a co-pilot by going there, he made seven seven eight lakh rupees directly. 3 Lakh, 1.45 Lakh, 2.5 Lakh came directly from Tankha, then it is okay, then the matter gets settled again after many years, but it is the truth of life that when you leave from the position.  Of strength for a new thing it is it is a jump it is going to be a jump but then if you land up in a place where you are not in a position of strength then the next time one you land up where you started from  The stock price will fall the same, so the example I am saying is that suppose you are engaged on 20 packages and the startup brother has called for 25 lakh packages.  So increase at Rs 20 seems very good, however, all that increase at Rs 20, new house, new setup, new rent, new commuting, profit has not started yet, if the shop is closed in six months, will you leave here with Rs 25 lakhs?  Brothers and sisters, when you jump from the ship, who will be your savior, will he keep you at 25 lakhs, will he keep you at 30 lakhs or will he keep you at 20 lakhs, tell me this or will he not keep you?  This is to be seen, do n't just run away with your mouth raised, do due diligence B. Shana Here we have our team of experts who guide you in such things, take consultation, I am not the one, I do n't get in too  Exactly inside this but then and my associates are there. If you are facing this kind of situation and want opinion and consultation from experts then you  CC corporate consultation on the given number which will be found below in the description or somewhere in the comment section, because once before jumping, ask that brother, I am here, I am in this profile, I am going here, if not this company then some place.  Even if you spy, if it is a listed firm then its balance sheet will look the same. Even if it is not listed, then in those startups which get funding from somewhere, these people hire without mind and then release it immediately.  Oh sir, what has happened, after that we give a thank you and then what else happens, isn't being afraid is a psychological issue, it shakes your confidence, you feel that you are lacking, there is nothing lacking in you, that idiot.  I was the one who hired you, the one who didn't need it, the one who didn't know, the one who got the venture capital money, the funding came from outside, the one who had to spend the money, the one who felt that he didn't know what he would do.  Everyone was hired and then they got that funding of Rs. 10 crores. Just like I had told you in this case, the money was wasted. It did not seem to be doing anything great. Now the shop is closed. Now that poor guy had left his behind somewhere. It was going well. How did you like this advice? Do write in the comment section. Like and subscribe the channel. You can take membership of the channel and they are for consultation. People like this and other wise, how do you know from a friend?  Will you do it and how will you find out from him? Everyone is the same on the board, no one knows in the market space, there is a spoken word that what is happening, there is a reputation, many will tell, no one will tell, you may know someone in that company.  If you don't know, he is telling the truth, he is not telling how to know, then there are associates in the market who are experts in these things, then by linking up with them, you can be explained in a very good way with the consultation. And you must take it if you have this decision dilemma because this decision dilemma will remain because if you are not enjoying the job you are working there and you are getting a good offer then is that good offer good? Is this decision making?  Is it worth it or should one stay in the same city? Should one stay in the same skill set? Then the decision dilemma will come further because it has become very dynamic these days.  It has been said that jobs are being created very fast, there is a lot of hire fire, there is a lot of hire fire, so the few employees will have to learn and be wise, so I hope you people will benefit. Like, subscribe, share the channel.  Thank you very much"

    "title": "Do Not Disclose This Information To Your Boss [wWqs_zRQmNk].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today's topic is Do not disclose this fact to your bus, if this is a fact of your life and that fact is that you live in your own house, especially if you are a junior employee and have not even reached the VP level in the cooperative. Whatever it is, whether it is your family's wealth or whether you do it yourself or what your father is, keep these things hidden a little or keep them hidden completely. This is a very practical advice. This story is on YouTube. This kind of thing is not available. If you have not subscribed to the channel, then please subscribe. You will say why, there are many sirs who are very different, then how come they have come after hard work, have you got lucky or have you got some other support? Do you know the system?  The system also seems to be a support, whatever may be the reason, these people are not telling things as if it was not their fault to be born in this stable, it was not your fault too if you were born in this situation because your struggle has never been this struggle.  He will not agree because he will see his own struggle, this is also a fact of life, his butt is a jealousy factor, these are counter videos, because of what they say, people get distracted by talking like this that people think it is a matter of classes. Brother, sorrow is sorrow, even if any pain from the story is a pain, then don't tell me, now don't think too much of them, say yes sir, we keep on passing, it's okay to tell more jumps and I have also seen this, if you have two things  are there  The thing which is a little less good is that people are bigger than the bus, there is relief on the bus car, there is relief because they live on the bus, they are richer than you, their salary is more, they are also qualified, they may be from ITM, it is fine but it is a liability.  Father is from a very poor family, his two sisters are married, so he and she are late in life, meaning he has come to a big city later in life. If you have been living in a big city for 40, 60, 70 years.  You do n't live in a prison, that is a relief in a prison, even if it is a very posh society. I am a relief in a prison, but in a prison, there is a relief in the prison. You live there, don't tell me this thing. These are the pain points emerging in my consultations, when I ask the priest.  People don't even know I am an athlete, I told them and they are also like this these days because I am late for their separate training, many times, when I have to talk to them, I have to say, find out, you will know everything. So this is my request, please don't tell me most of the information if you agree with this advice and if you have faced this prejudice arising out of the situation where you are in some personal details by defaulter and other vices, what should you do?  Sometimes the disclosure is done, sometimes it happens in an interview, sometimes it is asked casually or in a conversation, sometimes what happens is that you don't just tell it, you tell it to your colleague. He is a walking loudspeaker, sir, what is his, his house is his father's, you are the flat, there is relief there sir, there is relief in Central Park, Sona Road, sir, there is relief in sector 48, sir, the foot rate is ₹ 2000, maintenance is going on 14000.  His inner behavior is straightforward, I talk with my mouth open, in the same way, he is putting 50 more pressures, then when he will see which of the five employees, he has more influence in Jalaun.  You are in the top list because of that, you have to consider yourself privileged. Many people are not so privileged but are being considered as privileged and they are under the influence of forcefully binding you with the social status that is in your form. It is possible, father. Maybe you should know that your dear father, you are keeping your daughter so lovingly, you may have given her a gift, a bill note, another word, what was given to her at the time of marriage, later.  You can also give many loving fathers in Dr., because the luck of the world does not seem to be 498. Many people are roaming around with tickets of the lottery. Well, you know that car. You have got the car from the story also of father or father in Dr.  So don't go around displaying it, you yourself might not have taken the off course and many people also take it themselves because father has so much money and so much support that he was not ashamed of taking his loan, I was not ashamed of tying it, people.  will give to  So he does n't understand the live film, he didn't drink, he didn't know, hey you are a fool brother, so how if you are born in the right place then just put your finger on lips, I am a people hit people in India and I have privilege, I will make a video on this in the future too.  I will stay, there are different channels, there is a request from you people, launch a new channel Guruji, I will pierce a hole or something like this, there is some meaningful program, so please you people, who watch so much here, Jain there too, people have something to learn and empowerment type feeling.  Hogi but now I will not tell you this thing, I am of you agree with me please type yes and if you agree with me then give you can disagree apna aa newton then apna maal aaye by body hota hai to i bill do date de that lot of things bill happen  Then you don't know, then you go, why is this happening with the astrologers, why with us, why with me, this is what Rahul has done here, Rahul has messed up his mind, that's why you are doing such things, is n't it?  Open a little less, if you are in front of the bus or in front of the police, then the office is well managed. Those who are the ones who know everything the most, are the ones who are the most troubled, right, just check the various reasons in the office, or it could be yourself.  Or do a test run, everyone in his family will know where his house is, what his wife does, what his parents do, what troubles he is going through, they will know everything about him. It is a big reason for him to know all that. I am again and again  I want to speak, I have to keep a little sign, I have to keep a little meaning, I have to keep my fingers and lips, do n't consider it as a lie, because next time when you are getting angry, you will say, 'Hey Rohit, Papa roams around in BMW. Have you ever bought a car like this and this?'  That's why you should say that you want a race, if people ask then why does he work, this will also become a fact, your father has so much, you are a relief there, children of such houses work hard, these people will also ask, don't you?

    "title": "Do Not Prepare For UPSC ｜ Do This Instead [aDGBRgNA0y8].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, the topic is Arya preparing for UPSC. Giving videos to those who are preparing for UPSC is not spoiling it. I am telling you an alternative solution, very good. I am telling you that do not prepare for UPSC or if you prepare then what to do, linked up with UPSC.  Is it or the exam given for this, it is going to be a very good video and before watching it I would like to tell you that I have many videos on government jobs and UPSC, I should also post them earlier, one of them is Rahul, who is a content creator on YouTube, he is exactly my cut copy.  Let's start pasting, for once I got a little angry but then I saw their subscribers, their subscribers are 25 times more than my sixth channel because you people are not increasing my subscribers, I don't know why you are not increasing my subscribers, increase them a little but they are 11 -Ubahu makes the same content after getting 12 lakh subscribers but after a certain stage I felt good because at least that message is reaching out so okay with date also my request is to Rahul ji that this is the one  which is my content  This is my video, I request you to please cut, copy and paste it exactly like this and put it on your channel so that it can be reached. You have a big loudspeaker, it will reach out to more people. Mine is small because my subscribers are less. It's okay but the message is very big.  And it is original, so my subscribers will be happy that you are getting absolutely original content from Guruji, rest of the people do it in bags, you can check it by google, you can check it by YouTube, Rahul has recently uploaded a good thing, what a good thing on YouTube  But when you make a video, it has a date and time and someone else uploads it, so if you have given something to the newspaper on 21st and the news is being published on 28th, then your news will be considered first because on which date you made the claim  Whatever is being done for the counter, it can be proved very easily, so today the original content of UPSC, you prepare for group C and group D jobs and pass, those who are not crazy, drink alcohol and leave that aside, it's okay. but group c and di there is lot of money is there money is job  What do I want from you, my father in the group wants me to become a Miss, will you make me Chapra MTS or is it a group C post, is it a group B post, is it a group C post, hey brother, attempt it, you will pass it, don't do a job after passing, to do a job  I am not telling you to pass it, pass the saree and get a certificate and a letter or an appointment letter or any other thing, teach coaching to the world, there is a lot of money in this, there is more money in this, you can see the art in India, ₹180 for this  Their annual salary is 20 crores. 20 crores 180 their annual salary works out to be around 20 crores. To enable them to earn this salary of 20 crores, there is a mechanism of 25000 crore coaching industry which is being created.  And if we make all the cleaning charges then we earn 180 rupees in a year and if you add the claims then we earn 2000 rupees. If I tell my enemy that something is okay then you will get this  You have to see that the money is very low and the competition is very high there, more children are coming, they will give more coaching, many people put a lot of morality in their advice, every time they say anything, brother, you should not do such things in a government job Then according to this, who will join the army, you are protecting the country everywhere, why do you put morality in everything, everything is given as advice, why do n't you say that the broom is a government servant who is going to sweep, Shivraj is going to clean  He is going to become that too, you should become that too, then he should also become that, there is no one to say anything, there are such tasks that I should write a list, no person wants to do it but still you do such a task that you take votes from thousands of people that  If you want to reduce this, not even one person will say yes, I would like to do it, even then lakhs of people are reducing it, take interviews of lakhs of people, not a single person will be ready to reduce it, but if you keep it reduced then let there never be morality because date is made last What's the argument about that, then what about this, hey, now you take your word and make it yours  Advice for you, many people are doing this, I also told in consultation that there is a lot of money, there are stars on YouTube channel and it is shown that we had passed, there are Axis Taxation jobs, there are Inspector jobs, these are the jobs and which Apply any of R, Group C, Group B or D, you are giving MTS maths exam or apply Bank PO, apply this Bank colour key, all the jobs below, their cost is SSC jobs which are called service  The selection committee of the state government is the one from the monastery, pass the pattern once, apply yours here in such a way that I passed all of them and got on the panel of every coaching academy of the dhaba, then see their pattern from them.  Here, see the method, take the phone number and then open yours, teach and then attract the children, a chubby man wearing glasses comes, the history teacher, write his name, it is okay, his question is of three marks in this exam, that much of history is there.  The syllabus is this much and the income is in crores on YouTube  He is popular and the dhaba has great balance, what can he say, what motivation, son, he is very handsome, he wears glasses, he is very stylish and how should he be a king, you want to become a king, you have to do this, you have to do that, oh guy, become like this, friend, it is fun being with this teacher  In the next year I will focus on coaching for this, see how much money you are earning, full style, I mean if you contest election then maybe you will become a mother, if you tell me the name of the cabinet secretary of popular India, then those who are not preparing for the exam, then I do n't even know which India  The number one post of Cabinet Secretary of India has come, tell its name, no one will know, no one will care, this will go on for 5 to 6 years, after that it will be ruined, people like me who have a government job will be ruined because there is some  Not only children, in the coming times, people will roam around with beaten up government jobs and if you are a government servant, then you will be looked at like this because since it is a developing country, the economy has not yet rocketed, whatever has happened is that there will be some dairy, sometimes demonetization happened, sometimes GST happened  Then your Covid came and you tried to run away Something has happened but he has to be chased away, he is a young kid, he will run away okay and when he runs away then the government servant will cry because he is getting an increment of 3%, in the government donkeys, horses, lame horses and lame donkeys are all equal, in the government there are donkeys and horses and two  They are beaten so badly that they are turned into mules. A mule is made by combining a donkey and a horse, so the one who becomes a mule from a donkey considers it an achievement but for the one who becomes a mule from a horse, it is demotion, then life goes on further  The horse is angry and the one who was made a mule from a horse is happy and the one who was made a mule from a donkey is happy. Then if the donkey turns into a mule, then they go up. Then if they go up, then the ones who were made a mule from a donkey are the same mules from a donkey.  They attract the ones who have become mules from horses and they leave them, then ultimately now I am not condemning the government employees, if they feel that they are big and if they have become mules from donkeys then there is definitely something to be sad about and happy about.  Keep moving ahead, the roads which are built on roads are in the government, whatever the government does, it's all against it, they only love government jobs, bad roads, bad infrastructure, health education, slogans against the government, all this of the government seems big to everyone, but government jobs  Everybody wants it because there is a fortress, it seems like people think that fort is a fort, so it seems that this person is inside the system, so he wants to go inside the system like he should go like a peon, he thinks that Everest and D system will benefit me.  It will happen, this thing is crumbling, I am telling you, it was there, but it will not be there for those who are coming in 2023, so prepare for government job, clear the job, how much date proof date you are clear and do coaching for Dhaba, Dhaba has so many numbers, so many  The numbers are 5000, 10000, 20000, anything will be given for the preparation. This is a 4 year scheme of Agni Veer. I am telling us that there is so much money in its coaching. People don't even know what the syllabus is. Hey, give me the syllabus yourself, you will get to know the syllabus. Notes will be made, you will know everything and who is stopping you, give government job exams every year, clear them and don't join, find out the pattern of all, learn the method of all, there are certificates everywhere, whenever you go to any coaching  You will show that I am the selected candidate, you have to keep it, Master ji, Master ji, A Jain, you then after that it is your luck, create a YouTube channel, I have not come to talk nonsense, friend, that means it is very easy to impress youngsters, 20-year old kids  By the way, people get impressed by someone, you can see that on YouTube, how many times will you post, that madam went, this madam went, they are standing ahead like this, all the boys are going more to see the madam instead of going to study.  They are happening and it is visible as well, it is not as if I am trying to tarnish the relationship, it is visible, it is visible on YouTube, those shots of madam come while she is dancing, the whole world is going on, you know about it Sir, money is the cost of all these things, so it is a star to learn this  This star is Aman Bhaiya because when he walks, 12 bouncers move; you must have seen all the coaching people, there are such nice and gentle natured people, they talk so nicely, I do n't even have much to say against them but they are big  I say that people like me feel that if I am not here then there are so many loving teachers, okay they are very loving teachers but still what do they say, they have the UPSC training in Hindi, I have a coaching institute in Delhi, they say that if you do not do this  You will become something, if you work for seven-eight years, you will become something, my friend, I feel irritated here, otherwise you study philosophy well, you have very good knowledge, you are a good teacher, your way of talking is good, your communication skills are good, I have seen your videos, I am also quite impressed I want to learn something, it will be very good and important, this is a gamble, if you continue to lose then you can teach others to gamble, this is the same, UPSC is a gamble, the competition today is a gamble, the chase to win in dream11 may be high.  If you get marks in some of these competitions then this is the same  This is a program for this category, there is no productivity in it, it is not necessary, even the government enjoys it because the government knows that this will remain busy for 10-15 years, these are some categories like the ones that have come from above, General category, OBC, SC, you Tell me, in one category there is an unlimited team for 37 years, they consider it a great achievement that they can give exams for 37 years, how many times your life is getting wasted brother, think about this too, you are so engrossed in it I am saying that you should clear the prelims of UPSC as well, leave it, clear your prelims and get the certificate of premium and do the prelims coaching at Dhaba and tell that in Delhi, these prelim specialists study standing in the room of Mukherjee Nagar.  He has cleared the prelims six times, ten times and you should prepare only for the prelims or else that Golu Mol ji of ours is fine, like him, pick up one chapter or two chapters, you will only get a question of three marks in History.  You can talk about it, it is your speciality, you have to study all that, it will be good too, less studies are seen on youtube but still you have studied only that much, you know only this much about the forward and the backward and then you have to learn to become a king, king How is Banega Raja, don't talk to anyone, don't talk to this one, do n't talk to that one, your aim should be like this, it is a Ponzi scheme, like MM, let's start, brother, the plan is to make three down, first you should prepare for UPSC.  Do it then you have to cook three chickens then tell those three you catch three then you prepare for the presence of the whole country for the day prepare for this saree coaching the government has a lot of money by the time people come to know this there will be nothing in the jobs after six to eight years He used to eat grass, he had social status, all this is over, this was the attraction, don't work less, you will have to work a lot, you will get leave or not, you will get posting, you will not get where you want, okay your wife will not be able to do the job, short story-  you will keep roaming around in small places with your society, your children will not stay in any of your schools, then you will put your wife and children in the corner of the state and then you  You will keep roaming around, you are from Uttar Pradesh, so you settled your children in Gomti Nagar, Lucknow and then you are roaming from here to there, okay, from Sitapur to Mirzapur, you are roaming around, okay, this is your life, is n't it, Bibi?

Listen carefully do this activity topic name is milk milk this activity one is everyday that is 30 minutes 30 minutes me ho shakthi hai or one is sour ho shakthi hai but less than 30-30 Don't do it for 30 minutes 30 minutes Here I am not talking about any axis, nor am I talking about any meditation, nor should I talk about anything else and this is very important for the youth, that is what is ideation. Whoever is there, where does social media come from, someone from there, from newspapers, from your WhatsApp messages, through which friends talk to friends about what time they do things in life, then they say, we are not able to know, because you are the idea.  You are not doing what the thought process should be. If the thought process is to earn money, then instead of finding the idea for it, people first look for the idea to do this and then ask someone, but they call it the thought process.  Don't develop here, like me, whoever is having curd in his mind, then I am sorry, okay then I will not be able to help you, but whoever has a little idea of ​​what I am saying and  What is the difference between this set, what is the difference between animation and idea, so I am going to bring very very good membership on this channel and this thing I am going to make a lot of templates for you guys, would you like to learn this thing and not just this thing and also  I will teach a lot of things, I will teach a lot of things, okay, so only IT bill, note, be on date, recording details, but first I want to know, is my audience, if you are going to understand this thing that I said and  If you are going to enjoy, then it will be a gym membership. Just like if you go to exercise, if you have a membership, then there will be a mental gym, so you will come, you will benefit from it, your muscles will be built, if you will enjoy the mental pleasure, then if you do not know how to stay, then there is something like this, no membership.  You can take it anytime, leave it anytime, it depends on brother, if you are enjoying then take it, if you are not enjoying then don't take it but what do you want because here you will appreciate that thing, not for free, time has a lot of courage.  No, less things have to be shown in actual, very less things are different in platform and different, there will be a little fee structure in it, so the platinum which is my separate membership, but on this clarity, if I do diamond membership on youth, then it is okay.  Because rest of the gold and plated memberships are gold and plated and I want to open them by typing diamond membership. Please clarify, how many of you will be interested? Only if people are interested will I open it here too.  This is the kind of thing we want to learn, rest of the things I am teaching different things, but here I am targeting the youth, I am only targeting the youth because parents want to impart knowledge to their children by watching the channel 'Yudh'. Those men who also want to come and some youngsters who have not yet become youth, they are 15, 16, 17 and 18 years old, they are also on my channel this seeking clarity note of motivation, why am I early in the morning?  Why should I reduce that gold, I am not yours, I am not yours, I will tell you as soon as you get a lot of life and your friend has to do something, Cooker Buland himself has done so much, this is not a program like this, it is my program, it is a genuinely practical program, tell me here.  I am not going to tell that in the scheme, brother of multi level marketing, making two men wearing suits and speaking like this and that is no less than my practical templates, you will have to work hard, you will have to work hard. Understanding other things, we will also read about the thing of performance, no one understands either in school, nor in college or anywhere because everybody is just having this think and is doing that. Idiot, bring fresh history, make thought process, what thing will be done, how and vote further.  Thoughts will do things in life first if you understand them, look and catch a trade which I say, there will be one who is an idiot and creates things by processing thoughts and the rest will be the crowd. Absorbs thoughts and then if you want to speak history then how to do this idiot behind these ideas like say chai pe charcha type then that chai pe charcha wali my channel, they can also keep chai pe charcha in the name of membership so infant membership. What should I name it? I also want to ask my audience. If you have some interesting names, please tell me. Is it a good thing to have a discussion over tea or do something else? There is also a name for the membership, isn't it? Yes, it is.  There is so much more in the membership, it will be around 500 plus minus 100, okay, this 500 is also a rough idea, I am telling you, it will remain the same and this much means friend, you go for pizza only once in a month, you go many times. If you want to learn something then it's okay, so if you people want to learn then please join and tell about it and this difference between idiot and idiot is very big, many people are okay.  You don't have time to sleep and the one who doesn't have time to sleep does n't have time to sleep, because you know how to think, because once someone has taught you to think, then you people also take out time because you know that there is benefit in taking out that time. What is your head wasting time, from here to there, time is wasted in life, time is wasted in scolding, teeth are wasted in scolding, or time is wasted in entertainment, if you find a way to think in your free time.  And if someone gives you some advice, please give it.  You bill not waste your time so hope you see me of you in de membership please write in comment area thank you very match"

    "title": "Do You Fail To Keep Promises ？ ｜ Clarity Giving Video For Youth [lssXgsGeaWo].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, this is a very important topic for the youth. If you understand it well, the topic is do you fail to keep a promise? People take a promise from you or you make a promise to the world and you are unable to keep it, due to which you feel very guilty and feel bitter.  People get upset with you, you don't feel good about yourself, this is happening with many people, if you identify with this situation, please ID me and say yes Guruji this is my problem or I am seeing such a problem  So once we will get a lot of clarity on this that the youngsters are very unhappy because of this, so the clarity of this is that you have to first of all do this introspection, why are you promising, see, you have to make a promise, the girlfriend gets the promise done, the parents get the promise done  Yes boss, you make me promise, what is it basically that you will do this work, you will come to that party, you will take me out, you want to take out some commitment from you, life has become so busy these days and you are not able to manage so much scheduling  Owning time is the biggest thing to promise If you promise anything in life then the biggest luxury for it is that you own your time If you are not owning your time because that is what is happening most of the people in their 20  And 30 they don't own their time, so if they give a commitment to someone, he will say no, this is not to be done, this has to be done, that is why there is frustration and then the anger is taken out on the boss that the person to whom I promised, the person to whom I promised, because of this  I was broken, what happens many times, I promised something to my wife, see, I am giving you knowledge by squeezing everything from a 360 degree perspective, I promised something to my wife, my mother asked for something, ok, I have a stomach ache, you go and see a movie  It is okay, I am telling you a simple thing, I am telling you about houses in a practical way and in this also I will tell you in the end that if you have to make a promise then whose promise should you never break, this also  If I will tell you, then first of all stop making these promises, first of all, make any promise, say I will see, it will be seen, no no, how do you commit like this, tell me on your time, this is what you have to say, say I am a servant, servant man means I do a job or  I am a student or whatever I am, you may say that I do n't have much control over my time, lot of people say on my time, in that situation if this will be the option for me, I will try my best to do it but I cannot promise the moment  You start talking like this to your father and mother and girlfriend and wife and spouse and boss and anybody, any boss will say that this is a good presentation, what is it like nowadays, don't give me any work at work, oh no friend, there is not much work  It is just that much, first of all, if you do just this much and give me work, then the first pressure is that even this much work was not done, before you, the people who give me work have to wonder why do you call someone and say this  This is absolutely correct, why don't you tell me that this is a brain-intensive job, you are the best among all  He is a worthy man, be ready mentally, physically, emotionally to be in it and this is very important and if you do this then you will get this reward, there is no wisdom in the givers and the takers because he said that this is all it is  Now for how long will you do this little work, I will do it tomorrow, I will do it the day after tomorrow or whatever you say, then it will not be done then it will become the scope of work because which work is given like this within the office space to the company and  At the organization level, the work is given very well, the scope of work is so much, the money it will cost, due diligence will be done on the project and that whole analysis, at the small level, the work is available at the employee level or in homes or among themselves, you assign tasks to each other  Who does so much due diligence that how much it will cost, someone will say friend do it like this, don't do it, drop Bua ji there and come back, now who knows there will be a jam there, who knows what other issues will there be on the way, how much time will it take  It will seem that how much time will be wasted for that, for everyone who  The man is giving work to someone, there is only this much work for him and what about you, father will give you this much work in a week, wife will give two in a week, mother will give one, she will have two-three works of her own and the boss will have separate works for everyone  This is so much correct, people have become so fed up by doing so much, then they are saying that there is no balance in life, you can put anything on your head, if you try to balance it like this  This is a thing, I should keep it on my head, now if I try to balance it then I get stressed, so I am balancing it, just now I was sitting quite comfortably, I do not have any stress, there is no stress, now as soon as someone touches me Who will say Nalas, yes life has become like that of the British, by taking all this knowledge brother, I don't want to do it, it will be my work, I will do it, it will be my life, it will be life and work is also life and life is also work and no work life is separate because if work life  If things are different then there is nothing left in life, everything is already done, you have to progress in your life, your growth  Where are you finding time for this? All your time is being stolen. Never promise anyone. Just promise me something and you will give me the money. Tell me one thing. You also earn a salary. I also earn a salary. Do you need money?  and I can give you money then how are you living a life hey don't give me knowledge friend let me give you money if someone says this then tell me now you will not even get knowledge you will not get money anyway now you will not get knowledge also  Go, if anyone asks for a loan then the answer should be no, now you will say no, no, if I need it, why would you need it, you do n't behave like this, why would you need it, you save your money and don't take it from anyone forcefully  We are living life today in the year 2024 as we were living 10000 years ago, 200 thousand years ago, that when that lion comes, the whole community is here, if we don't help it today, then tomorrow it wo n't help me, so we should help it  We are not living such a life in 2024  The work was done without anyone's help. Hey, are you teaching wrong things to the society? All these weak people and those who waste your time and exploit you, they will write in the comment section that you are teaching wrong things, a wise man will say this  So you are teaching a very right thing, all those who are robbers of your time will be irritated by this video that what kind of knowledge has this person imparted because the entire youth has become so fond of it, because what happens when you are young So you feel that there is a lot of time, it is something like if you have crores of rupees in your bank, let's say you have 10 crores, then out of 10 crores someone takes away Rs 10000, takes away 10000, takes away 20000, takes away 00, takes away 500, you are not afraid and do not feel any difference  So what happens in the youth? You have a lot of life left in the future, but it seems there is only time because time is not passing, half the time you are just reeling because there is no purpose in your life, so whoever comes will take away some of your time. so take it  Go, you also take it, you also take it, but brother, such a stage will come in life when you do not utilize this time properly, then you are not reaching anywhere, now you are making people promise that you will not become like this to me  He will give you time, he will give you this, he will give you a promise, then you are not getting anywhere and this is happening like this in the society, it is happening like this in the whole society, then he is saying that when we were on your stage, we used to waste so much time  You were with the world, which we call doing good to the people, now if you are not doing it then you are selfish, so whenever you have to make a promise to someone, you should never break it, it is for the child, that too for your child  Because breaking a promise to a child makes him very uncomfortable and it makes you very uncomfortable because the child's emotions crash immediately. You have told the child that you will take him to the mall or to the movies or you will take him for an outing or you will get him a gift and then he may wish to do something because  He is helpless, no one else is helpless, parents are not helpless, wife is not helpless, I am a man  I am addressing you, you can change the gender, boss, no one is helpless in the organization, a man gets caught, he was exercising in the gym, the next day the same problem is going on, till now they were giving him so much stress that it seems as if without him  It will not work, he has gone up and will never be seen, work is going well but there is only one child, your child, whose work will not be done without you, so the promise given to the children should be priority number one and for the children and it is not like this for them also, the children also  These days papa is very smart, promise him everyday otherwise I will also have to make promises to him as per the need, which are dual, which are justified and which is okay, do not over promise there either, but never break the promise given to the children.  When a promise is broken, it leads to childhood trauma and then that relationship never lasts. It has been seen many times that you kept a promise to your boss who could have screwed you over, basically if you broke any promise, you tried your best to keep that promise to him.  Kari is just a child who can't do anything to you at that time, so he  If you have given that last thing to the child, you should not give it to the child, you should give priority number one to the child and give the rest to him, tell him that Bhaiya, look, it is like this, how will my health be that day, what will be my mood, if I don't know, then I will not come to your party.  You will have to come, you will not come, say no, I will drive there at night to have dinner at such a great party, I will take care of my whole day, if I am tired then I will not come, either you do this, get me a lot of holidays, you have so much  That is strength, okay so live life practically like this and don't go where you are in the mood to go, don't go where people have to get angry, if not today then tomorrow, if not tomorrow then the day after tomorrow, okay don't go and donate your kidney to every person Can you not give it to me? Yes, I will give it to you just like that. You also take it. You are also sitting with two. If everything is fine then anyone will keep asking for anything. They will keep asking for any promise. Promise me, promise me that not in childhood, God, promise me such a childhood  I used to talk in classes, okay, kids talk among themselves, promise not to tell anyone, I wo n't  I don't even know myself and is this not true, is this not true, these are professional commitments, you went somewhere and you promised someone about 5:00 pm, you are sitting somewhere at 3:30 pm, very good place  You are in a very good company and having a lot of fun and learning a lot about life and you want the experience to last long because you will not get such an experience again. You had made some bad promises to someone 5:  why are you doing 00 o'clock because possibilities of life are not like this but if you don't promise like this then it won't work, hey just try it, live this life for two-three months and see if it wo n't work, if it doesn't work then see from the beginning why do you think so  You are thinking no no but if everyone does this then India will become a happy country, which we keep roaming at 126th place in the happiness index, even after having everything, there is food in this country, the weather is good in this country Everything is God's grace which is called but still we are not happy, then when  That index comes out, then we call it false because Pakistan is above us in that index, so we will say, hey how can Pakistan be happy with us, they have this 1.5 crore problem, yes after that 1.5 crore problem  That country is happy with us and we are unhappy but we are not ready to accept this because we get the ranking that suits us, like if India is ahead in business then we get that ranking also which shoots up  My report card, madam's number is correct, no, it is just a region, the government cannot raise it in this happiness index, it has to move up on its own, you have given us ration, 80 crore people are getting food, you are getting water You are getting some air but still you are not happy, okay, so it means that you are definitely spoiling each other's plans, why are you doing that badly, why are you doing such things, your oaths, your promises, your promises, memorize them in English and make songs quickly.  It has happened that you broke the promise, you broke the promise, your promise, stop making such promises, stop making promises  Do n't make promises even to yourself because what happens many times is that you tell yourself that I will go to the gym, this is new, that too is a promise, a promise to yourself, don't promise too much to yourself, work on actual things, don't promise yourself  I promise I will do this I will eat well I will do this that you will eat well You promised but you should promise that I will maintain my emotional stability I will maintain emotional stability and stay happy then maybe I won't have to do this emotional ting Instead of restricting your food, you should control your emotions and these emotions get shaken because you made promises to yourself, the promise is not getting fulfilled, you told yourself that I will go to the gym, oh I will go to the gym, it is a good thing  But if you are not able to go, then what will you do, so brother, take a walk there, walk somewhere in the office, do some alternative things, don't be so harsh on yourself, this is the message, the world is not forgiving anyone.  You should forgive yourself, stop making promises, say I don't promise, I will try, I will see and make that your priority and never take tension on anyone's promises, you are not worried about going anywhere, you are not worried about coming anywhere  No, you are a happy person, do whatever you enjoy, and slowly people will start respecting you for this because you have that ability to say which they don't have, and slowly people around you will start changing at first  You will be in trouble that this is like this, you are like this, you are losing one thing, you are like this, you are like that, then others will say friend this is also getting cut, right, so this is us, we are getting into a mess by doing this because at The end of the day it is about are you happy and satisfied or you are unhappy if you are unhappy then you have to do something no if you are happy then keep going what's the problem people who give you comfort in life, give you peace, give you pause  interact with them  You are doing this and you are not making any promise to the rest, you are not making any promise to anyone, neither to the good ones nor to the bad ones, so I hope this message youth will apply in their lives, how did you like it, there will be a webinar info group in the comment section, do you want to join it Join one of my workshops called Art of Decision Making. It will also help a lot. It is linked to this thing because not being able to make decisions in life has given very good templates. It is a two hour workshop. Please purchase its recording in the comment section.  You will get the link of that app. If you want to purchase it, you will definitely learn something very nice, it is taught in a practical way as per the mental models. Thank you very much."

    "title": "Do You Follow Andrew Tate ？ [Qg4C8VFfvVQ].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, do you follow Andrew Tate and why Andrew Tate is getting popular among Indian men and young men especially, we will discuss this in some videos, I don't know, even in my comment section, I tried to make it so that I told you that you  Des Desi Andrew Tate Bhai I am not here I don't know him and you don't know me so I make it clear I don't endorse Andrew Tate I like someone more special No, but why are Indian men following us? We will discuss about that. Whatever is happening in the West, he is the one getting popular because women are rising, he wants to show his status to women, he himself is rich.  The body is very nice, if she talks like this then men get attracted, especially those who are addicted to porn, they masturbate, there is no juice in the body from inside, they cannot attract physically, they do not have money, they are not heard by anyone, they are real. Can't attract any girl in life, can't handle women and whoever is called that in real life will feel bad after hearing it but it is a fact that in real life there are not that many men, they like it because it is ok, you can become like that, can you first?  So show me your body, he smokes cigar like a jailer, there is a feeling of Rajnikanth, then I don't know his body is exactly like that and those things are like this and then do that and then that don't.  Woman has to be seen in that place Why on money Why would you do job All those dreams are your dreams Fantasy is yours What you are never able to achieve But that is fantasy And ultimately how is that fantasy She awakened the fantasy in everyone Made a course of my own and converted 000 10000 few dollars into 10 lakh 20 lakh and it became 50 60.  100 200 500 crores and he showed cars, then showed one car, then showed 2, then showed 10, then showed T, then showed girls, then showed boys, then showed like this, Oh brother, he is a confused soul, his entire journey, if you see, you will not follow him, there is still a lot of journey left.  Isn't he in jail, he has gone to jail, there is a drug scandal against him, there are 25 types of allegations beyond that, he does n't understand which one to follow and which place to stay.  He doesn't understand but that's what attracts you in him, that's his one tension, he goes everywhere, he feels like speaking in your face, so he is not a talent alone, nor is he a talent alone, but he  He has attracted people with his superficiality, his thought process is that treat females like this, they need this, men they need, by doing like this and that's it, Indian settings.  Me it is not working may be well settings that thought process may actually work on the real ground because there may not be enough India is also being made in the same way oh no it is being made brother something is 100% and here it is at 5  So now it is no no, it was three a few days ago, now it will be five and tomorrow it will be seven, yes but it is still below 10, still it will not work, this much will not be visible in your life time and till then  He would have dealt with it, his bad habits would have come out and these are the fads of his. Kim Kardashian had never come before him. The ideal that I am telling for girls is fine from the point of view. What is one's claim to fame? He had turned out to be  Pon video, they are famous just because of that and then this is not real life, following them is not going anywhere, you listen to them and you feel good inside, but there is nothing beyond liking, isn't the ideology very good?  So do it or do it in India 498 It seems like try and see and it will go like that here, there is no Andrew Tet, no Ender Tet courses, no money, no car, no lawyer, but the education was closed in two minutes just by watching the video.  It is fun, this is what I am saying, it is fun to watch the pun, but it does not seem to reach anywhere, dopamine is being secreted, adrenaline is being secreted, this is what is happening, testosterone is doing something, without any hard work, some work is being done. real world  To achieve this, now I am going to explain all these things very well in the Happiness Course, which will be my Happiness Course 2.0 after Diwali, so if you want to enroll for that then do H2. Oh you too, yes, I too. Then yes, Andrew Tate counter is Andrew Tate, Andrew Tate's is 000, mine is only 00, so mine is $30, okay, so give a tip in 30 and 7000, I am okay, okay  If yes, then the fact is that do not follow them, they are not reaching anywhere, they are just enjoying seeing the one, they are not taking you anywhere, they are not getting any clarity in life, there is benefit in just seeing them because you are in real life. Neither can I attract girls, but this so called person is taking photos. In real life, your body is not becoming sexy. A lot is being made of him. The one who is just making the body sexy gets some money. No, in India you cannot go to the gym.  become a trainer of  You are left with 50 6 thousand 1 lakh 1.5 lakh, there are very few people who are able to make much money, they have moved ahead, they are gone, but nothing is happening just by becoming a body, this is also a fact and there are such women who become bodies too.  She is not coming, it seems as if she will come, she is not coming, she is coming, Shik Shik Shik Shik Kari, she Shik Shik Shik Kari, practically no one has come, keep roaming around, it seems, then there are the cars near it and all these cigars.  And he is doing all the scandals, you don't even have this, where will you get the car, where will you buy it, he is buying a car worth 2 lakh dollars, multiplying it by 2 lakh dollars, it comes to 1.8 crores, buying a car worth 1.8 crores, you will have to earn Rs 3 crores.  Because that 1 crore 20 lakh will go in tax, only then 1.8 will come and after earning 3 crore you will buy the car, then what else will happen, down valuation at 20 when the car comes out.  I will study further in Indian Roads, again I don't know what is its value, so is there any practical thing, I am enjoying, I know why I am enjoying, I told the reason why I am getting popular because Indian men don't want.  To work hard in the real life, there is only one Acharya in India who is awakening the wisdom and consciousness. Those who are not enjoying there, then one is Andrew Trait who is awakening their wisdom and consciousness. Andrew Trait is becoming popular saying that earn like this and keep them girls like this, keep them on toes, keep them as slaves or treat them like that, that good feeling comes, yes somewhere inside BDSM type feeling comes, the dirty one is okay. Keep it like this, leave one saying, this game itself is bad, this is nothing, if you get it, then what is the happiness of the body, it is an animal, it is okay, so this animal is becoming an animal, this animal is telling, this is saying.  Become a big animal and the youth should understand only this. I am telling you simple and practical things. Remember in your future life, get married at a normal time, have one or two children at a normal time and the marriage has not broken and you are living a normal life. This will be repeated by the parents whose youth is listening to me, this was a normal thing, it was not a great achievement, what a great thing, got a job, got married, this is also a life, do something higher, do all this.  Will go to such an extent to elevate that whatever was this thing which was the most normal thing of all that a wife who labors every five days out of every 10 because it is her religion, you have made the rounds Ramesh Mabu, the price of a pinch of vermilion. Many know that a pinch of vermilion has a huge price, so all Ramesh babus will look like winners 10 to 15 years from now, this is the message so.  It I the Clarity Giver is saying become Ramesh Babu don't go Andrew Tate they don't go this way then after that 15 more years will not come because in 15 years that pinch of vermilion the wife also becomes a little relaxed and the children also grow up a little. A sense of achievement comes, a family has been formed, your fulfillment will happen, purpose has been found, this struggle was immediate here for 15-20 years Chetna Buddha Vive  They were running Uga here, some people say go to Bangkok only, go here, you need to get married, ask whom you want to marry, how many times will you go to Bangkok, okay, we will go to Bangkok, we will go there, if we go here, then there is HTD also, there is some HIV also.  Syphilis also happens, Gonorrhea also happens and let me tell you 10 diseases, what are they and what are the incidents, I am going to explain all these things very well that why you should not do all this and  What effect does it have and what is energy? What is the body? What is the memory of the body? I am going to explain things to you in a very good way. Those who would like to join the Happiness Course, after Diwali, I will have an iconic course on h2 at the number given below.  There will be a full house for noise shots, there will be five or two hour classes, there will be over a period of time, notes will be made, you yourself will become the giver of clarity, there will be no one who tells anything vague in happiness, no one who will teach spirituality, not much.  Just do it like this, not like this, and I will teach you practical things in life wherever people have doubts that this is an addiction, this is a pawn addiction, how to overcome, how to overcome, what should I tell in two lines and less, just raise the consciousness and the addiction will go and will not arise.  What to do, Guru ji, I don't wake up, I don't wake up, it's not like that, just set the alarm clock and you wake up, how does it happen in a practical way, the matter is correct, there is no prayer below, you have to wake up.  But what is the procedure, no one wakes up after reading a book, no one wakes up after reading a book, this is what I am telling you, so do not take the help of too many books, if the work had to be done with the help of books, people would have figured it out long ago.  By the time the public is hanging on the books, no one has read it and has not been able to understand after reading it and the writing is also vague and the one who has written it has turned the whole world into a super power, so don't relay so much, I am not going to dismiss them.  there is something Also these and these books, which are old books, have their interpretation and half of them are also wrong, who will decide that it is okay, it means your teacher is checking your copy, but who is checking the teacher's cap that he is checking the copy correctly?  It can also be wrong and yet it has come from this system only, we think that this person is capable but only he is really capable, it is possible that he may make mistakes in spelling, make mistakes in grammar or he may become strict like that.  One is giving four out of five, the other is giving three out of five, this can also be so easy, so teaching things in a practical way is my USP which I will teach, you come and join, thank you very much."

    "title": "Do You Get Such Whatsapp Forwards On Family Groups ？ [sHTLi035m8Q].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, do you get the truth, it becomes like this by eating, pick it up on time, pick it up in Brahma Marat, this is your problem, this is how life is, it will be like this because at times, the youth speaks to the mothers, this is that, a little.  After listening to this, then after doing further research, they give all those videos to the children about food and this one is about mothers, in general family, there must be some relative like this or some woman, there is poison in this food and that in food.  poison like this  By doing poison here, poison here, this disease, because of this, that disease, because of this, because of this, this is very common and there is an important thing which is not being discussed, no one is making any video beyond that, that video is not being forwarded, that  This video is that one, this video is about who should India talk to, Indian families and in our WhatsApp2, India has the best choices. Historically, they must have been in India for the last 75 years, which means hunger has also reduced.  Choices have also increased and now food is not so much an issue in India. What is the issue in India that needs to be discussed and which I want to highlight. Rest of the diseases are already being highlighted. Do it like this, do it like that.  Be it, everyone is wishing that nothing comes of it and everything is like this, do this, do this, do this, do this, do meditation, calm the mind, the main thing is not being talked about, that is.  Emotional Health Son, how are you, daughter, how are you, how are you feeling, what are the issues, do n't eat on that, eat right, eat right, eat right, all these women who were born in 1950-1960, did not know how to eat in childhood. Food must have been a big motive. These parents have fed their children well. This generation has fed its children well by making sacrifices in wearing good clothes. Now this is the thinking.  Those who are the next generation because these forwarders are mostly grandmothers and more of them come, these food issues will also be there in the next generation, by eating good food you can remove the problems of life, so this is the message to the very elderly and  With great respect the message is that now India does not have food issues but emotional issues. When India was struggling in food and clothing, yes, it was a big thing but now it is not so. Now you can hear this again and again to a youngster.  If you send a message like this he will get irritated, he is saying that you are an elder in my family, you are so senior than me, you do not understand what are my actual issues, can't you really address them, can you actually talk about them, this 24  Wake up in the morning and eat this. Get up in the image of Brahma. Do this. Hey, how did you wake up in the image of Brahma? Madam, at 7:00 am, 7:30.  He doesn't leave the boss till 8:00, he doesn't reach home till 8:30, he takes bath and then eats something and then he won't be able to sleep at all because you yourself have said that we should eat 3 hours before sleeping, so that means 3 hours after eating.  If you want to sleep, then you have to eat. If someone has a meeting at 9:00, you can't do that. Go and talk to his boss. No, he can't eat at 5:30 in the office itself. Brother, that's it.  1200 12:30 He is sleeping, he will not wake up in Brahma Muhurat 3:30 pm People Have to Release This That Nobody Has Told This In historical mankind, not all people used to wake up in Brahma Muhurat, it is not necessary for everyone to wake up at the same time  It is not necessary that you tell me this, take the example of Historic India or go to the ancient hunter's age while hunting.  There was no agriculture, so everyone used to do some work all the time, some hunter would get up early in the morning and go, then he would kill the animals and bring them back, then he would have some program, he would do something else, some would sleep at some time, and stay awake at some time.  There was a shift system, there has always been a shift system, so the people who work at night, the work goes on in the world, so what should they do now, they are standing in the same way as in the Brahma Murat, they are standing in the earlier position, so to each his own.  is every  According to the tendencies of a person's body, it is said that we are Kapha, Vata, Pitta and according to that balance, his body tells him what is good for him and what is not, for many, only potatoes are fine and they eat them.  Now there are many elderly people, they did all their programs and some of their bodies got spoiled. Now their bodies got spoiled and they did all the programs, so they thought that they should do this program, hence their body got spoiled. There is no direct research on this from medical science.  and other wise  Emotional Health and Emotions and How You Feel About Life Has Got Direct Bearing Charlie Late Charlie Manger and Apna Warrant Buffett Still Eat This They Used to Eat Junk They Used to Say We Eat Like 11 Year Olds That's 90 Crossed Karkar Direct Link I am not here  I am not promoting junk food at all, but your gut, your stomach, your mind, your tongue, your system will tell you what is good for you and what is not good, then the world will die.  Go and eat these. Benefits of eating garlic in the morning. Even if your heart will do so, fill your stomach with garlic all day long. What is the biggest benefit of eating garlic? No one will come near, no one will come near, otherwise there will be no trouble, only trouble will happen.  If it is not there, then health in life will automatically be good. Okay, eat so much garlic in your mouth that no one will be able to talk to you, no one will be able to talk to you, don't pick up the phone, no one will come near you, otherwise life will be good.  of everything  Disadvantages, Benefits, Benefits of drinking tea, Disadvantages of tea, That person gets confused, what should I do, There is poison in everything, Benefits of everything, Disadvantages of everything, Whoever shoots the video has made the video, 100,000 crore videos have been made and no one else He is a nutritionist, a doctor, what is this? No, he said like this, he said like this, he said, eat detoxification leaves, you idiot, this is the biggest scam, this is the biggest scam, wherever the word detoxification comes, it is there.  The biggest scam is that the body does its own thing, earlier the fads used to say, eat breakfast like a king, then came intermittent fasting, eat in six hour window, then eat in eight hour window. Hey uncle, someone is sitting there to feed you, your window is on.  You are not getting food, your boss is not leaving you, what will you do, change the window, all these demanding programs and all these things happen when you reach a stage to do something in life.  No, and all the work is done for you, now sit and keep doing it like this, hey, eat when you feel hungry, eat a little less than what you feel, just eat whatever you like, because whatever the soul is not liking, eat it. Sometimes what happens is that even if you eat that much, perhaps there is no benefit. Many times, I used to live in Gujarat, they don't have very healthy habits and I used to like this one. So Amit Bhai used to say  Tell me, what will happen with these meals, I said, you will eat well like this, life will become longer, okay then I will leave all this, then what will happen from that, I mean, their philosophy is that they are parties with money and you know everything, then they would say, friend, follow you.  I do n't know whether life will get longer by doing this or not. Amit Bhai, it will definitely seem longer. Life should not seem so long, so I am again saying that by going to the extreme, I am not saying eat unhealthy, it is okay, eat yours healthy.  Must eat only Discover the good things but talk about emotional health Emotional health How you feel Where are these toxins being formed inside the body The kind of cleansing that is being done whatsapp-web It will have to be corrected, so I am Ramdev ji's here.  It is not true that he is absolutely right, the program he speaks is of those who have been annihilated, who were living their life like this for so many years, now it will take many years for them to recover and become normal.  If it takes 40 years to get ruined then it will take two to four years to recover or become normal but I am talking here of the youth who have not yet lost it, neither have you lost it mentally nor have you lost it physically.  So, whatever needs to be done on the physical plane is already being discussed, mom is already forwarding it, do it yourself and see what suits you, but on the emotional level, talk about it.  Talk about stress, talk about anxiety, talk about yearning, talk about yearning for promotion, talk about yearning for relationships, all those things also shake things up because when you go into that zone, then you don't care anymore.  If there is one thing I am telling you, if you remain happy and full of joy in life, then you do not feel hungry much, this is a fact, many people do emotional eating, fill the vacuum of life with burgers and this in between.  A normal person is happy if he is eating his normal diet twice or thrice a day. He is happy with that. He is not looking for happiness in eating a lot and when you are looking for a lot of happiness then you should look for a little.  I am also a foodie, but you are looking for the happiness of relationships by eating too much of everything, the happiness of yearning, the cure of bitterness, then brother, it will be like a dawa doll situation. Keep your emotional health ok and talk and discuss.  About it, let this video be forwarded on your whatsapp2, you don't have time for 30 minutes, you don't have time, never ask anyone how are you, he said fine, this is also a culture, a video will be made on this too someday, stop asking people, sales, goods, selling.  And call Sir, how are you, how are you, I am having a fight with my wife, my stomach is hurting, I feel like drinking tea and my head is bursting, this is how I  Am Why did you ask how are you? Speak sir, can I speak to you, then I will say yes, do this. How are you? Keep this how are you question only for your very near and dear ones. For your parents, for your wife, children.  For your siblings or very close friends and when this genuine society asks how are you, then emotional health will be discussed.  Friend, are n't the children listening? This is not happening, he is not getting a job, I feel very stressed. Okay, then he will benefit from it. If this thing is not being discussed then be very careful about how are you. So someone asks how are you, I say, come sit, let me tell you how am I. Come, you were thinking that yes, how are you, you will say fine, say, I am ruined, my mind is at an end and I am crazy  And now you will ask me, ' Your sales marketing is done, your work for which you came sir, how are you sir, how are you today sir, as are the fun of yesterday, I enjoy all the fun, okay, but how are you sir,'  Mirabel Yesterday, now tell me further, then you would ask why everyone in the society has to reply like this, so that should be asked genuinely, how are you, this how are you has to be given a lot of importance, see how much video is there.  I have brought beautifully, there are some long videos but there are so many learnings and take aways that now at least you will ask this question to the people closest to you and if you do not have any close person asking casually like this, then say brother, don't do this. What will you do by asking me how are you, how am I, I am bad, then you come for your work, go out after doing the work, why are you showing intimacy by saying how are you, otherwise sit and listen to how am I and help me because this What is the reason for asking this question about emotional health because how are you is directly related with emotional health. It is about how are you feeling whenever someone asks you how are you. Its actual meaning is that brother, how are you feeling at this time.  So when you say I am fine thank you so that I am this is what is inside this it is not may be in this hand this hand is not in this hand  Feel good and may be feeling good but this is our mind from inside, so do more on this thing, make noise by saying how are you today, it is okay and talk about emotional health and also the emotional health of parents has to be discussed, youth and  May be the mother is sending something again and again that she wants to connect that she is connecting now for your benefit that my daughter will listen to this, tell these mothers also that your children do not even open and watch the video.  They know everything about what is inside it and what they are trying to tell. Sometimes ask your children that they do not sleep at night, which is very easy to say that they should sleep. Benefits of waking up at 9:00 in Brahma Purat.  Benefits of sleeping, why can't you sleep, just ask once, what are you worried about, can I, you can actually do it, I get forwarded to people for that, I talk a lot, words do n't come out from parents, from rich parents.  Also from upper middle class upper middle class people who can solve actual problems by forwarding it to others, you will sleep on time, we used to wake up on time madam, you used to wake up on time because you were a housewife, you did not have to go anywhere because you again  You can sleep again at 11 o'clock. Please don't give the knowledge to someone who cannot sleep at 11 o'clock or cannot sleep at 2.30 in the afternoon because you can sleep, don't you?  After watching that Anupama serial for the third time in the afternoon or after watching its old one again, you do n't sleep, don't you chat, do n't you relax, you remain relaxed the whole day, how will your body get sleep, you don't need that much.  So today I have a very humble message to everyone, this knowledge of sleep and food is a very private thing, stop both of them, who needs how much sleep, India, all I can say is that India is sleeping less, it needs more sleep, but why is it sleeping?  If you are not able to, address him instead of saying that no, he should not sleep and why he is not able to sleep, what are the reasons, what is happening in his life, those questions will be directly connected to his emotional health, eating is fine, waking up is fine, sleeping is fine, pranayama, all these are big.  These are good things but why is a person not able to do it even after knowing this? Is it just a lazy thing or is there some other reason? Those who live in homes do not go anywhere, I too go, but I am sitting here on the sofa like this.  shares knowledge  I have been saying that the public is not raising children, it is useless, this society which has been created by the previous generation, if the children today are bad, then it is called bad, not according to me, but if it is called bad, then it is those of the society.  Were there previous custodians or are there custodians now who are senior people? You don't see in India that a Prime Minister became at the age of 35. One of them was Rajiv ji. Apart from that, do you know at what age ministers are made in our country and that is fine.  Some 22, 25, 30 year old people are not running the country. People above 50 years of age are running the country. If it is okay then they are direct of their generation. Guidance is also needed and not judgement. We used to do like this, you used to do like this then India.  It was different at that time, what did you do to India then that if emotional health is not right now then we will talk about GDP, GDP growth and all this will be fine, I talk about everything on my other channels but emotional health and  As soon as this happiness index comes, India becomes like this, don't talk about this, we will finish at 126, this is fake, why is it fake, why when the ease of doing business comes, then you become very happy, this is fine, where the ranking is good, that and that. We don't believe that everything gets better even if it gets bad. Why brother, talk about emotional health. We have to go up in the happiness index. Those countries like Finland, Norway, these countries in the upper part of Europe are okay, there is no sunshine here.  comes  There is no night, there is no sunlight, there is midnight sun, man, they are so ahead in the happiness index, take all your countries, Denmark, Norway, Finland, it is so cold here, they are the happiest and here it means so much blessings. Our country has everything about the weather. I am saying that our country is the best country in the world. If you are a human being, it is a historical requirement which has been of mammoth and all kinds of temperatures.  Extreme temperature is nothing, even after doing that we are not there, so there is something wrong somewhere, brother, the potential is complete, geography is with us, history is with us, the rest is what we have in the present state, after geography and history are with us, which one else is that?  The subject is left, we have to fix it and in that emotional well being is a very very very important thing. Start talking about this word emotional well being how.  Instead of how are you, start asking how are you feeling emotionally so that you can know the answer and discuss it and there should not be more than five to six people in anyone's life who ask this question, five six is ​​enough, five six in the family.  Seven people just single digit array don't keep asking everyone how are you I'm fine thank you I'm fine thank you nobody is fine nobody is fine people are struggling and late  That thing came out, yes I am struggling, everything is a struggle, it is not easy, let that be there, Amul Macho, life is not going smoothly for anyone, it means it takes effort to make even this video, come, sit now and like this  I will keep feeling scared that the cook will come and the bell will ring, chi chi chi chi chi, it's okay, everyone has a little, my only thing is that chi chi chi will not happen, it's okay, whatever happens because of this.

    "content": "Hello friends, this is a very important topic for the youth. Do you have an agenda of your own? You have to understand that the agenda is mine, my own gold, my own less, my own agenda. Why is it important because I am especially looking at the youth and I want you to tell that off.  People, I am young, I am in my 20's and early 30's and it is also okay for those who are older than that, then we should look at the children as well and apply it in our lives because This is applicable for everyone, however, it is based on the fact that too much youth is wasting time because they don't have an agenda of their own, so if you don't have an agenda, everyone is roaming around with agenda. There are as many business houses, political parties as there are  There are as many leaders as there are actors on social media, including myself, because what I said is that everyone should have an agent. Do they have an agent? Do I have an agenda?  I lower my flag, it is not yours, if you ever go with it, I am not saying to run away, it is not that you should not watch the video, I am saying that you have an agent of yours, who will take you there.  You are going where you want to go, but before that you should know that you want to go and eat, you are free if you are sitting, friends, did you want to go to see the plot or go to see the flat, you go to see my clothes, you can go to your grandmother's because you have to.  Nobody cares if you have an agenda you don't speak  I have to attend Guruji's behavior, one child is from 1 to 3 o'clock, in the decision making model it is being told that I have to attend that, it is my clear agenda, friend, what are you and after that now they will not let you reach for 2 hours.  Went with a friend, it is better to go with a friend, if there is no story nearby, I don't know date you want you to make flower good, there are other ways to make good, by making those flowers good, you will reach the story, if you reach there then you will feel good. feeling of  Tikki will remain in another vice. If you waste time with a friend or relative or with someone, then his agenda has been solved. He needed a partner to sit on the left. I have seen many people going from Delhi to Chandigarh.  Do n't want to go, take someone else, he feels that he will get food and drink, he is going with me, I will become a court driver, let's pass my time, oh brother, his agenda is to go to Chandigarh and make money, he has something to earn, he will do it to you.  There have been and there will be many people who when they have less agenda, you go to them to pass the time in such a way that they will give you a start up, you will also feel a little big but they will come to you anytime because it is yours.  No, with what mouth will you say that I will not give time to you, then there will be nothing left and parents, I have seen these days even the parents tell their children, 'Hey, she is coming, she is coming by train, leaving today and aunty.'  Today uncle is coming, it is good for you  He is reducing his driving time, he is going to go in an Uber car now, but that is not your time, he knows that he is draining your battery, if he is reducing your driving time, if he is making a relative happy, then this is something that the parents also have to see, you too have to see it.  Are you not a part of anyone's agent and do you think this should have an agenda? Your money also, Lord of people, doesn't have an agenda. Anyone goes alone. Anyone goes alone. They ask me, Sir, he was asking me for a friend. I gave it.  Gave, brother was asking for it, gave mine, he was asking for it, gave it, relative was asking for it, gave it, father was asking for it, gave it, oh, it should be given because these are relationships, your agenda is his agenda, to build a flat, to build a house, not to do anything, but if I help him. If I don't do it then he won't help me tomorrow. This has to be removed from things because right now we have him in our consciousness. Inside, he was there ₹50,000 years ago. There was a command that if I don't save him, he will come to me tomorrow.  These Brothers and sisters, all of them are definitely and do not depend on us. If you enjoy this video then write MG Yes after pausing and I will tell you one more thing related to this that is in this and in this.  One problem is that you need gold for the agenda that is set and people are very afraid to set that gold for themselves. The same agenda will be of your life, won't it? If you wake up in the morning, then what is today's agenda in which they talk about a meeting?  So  The Date Agenda is Driven by Goals Where You Want You to Be Rich and Where You Want to See Yourself  If you want to do it, you cannot set your own agenda, then there will be someone left for you, I set your agenda, it is not in your power, when the ideal bill sets the agenda, brother-in-law sets the agenda, you are on the agenda. REMEMBER IT YOU WILL BE A PART OF THEM, HE WILL SET THE AGENDA AND TAKE ON GOLD, HE WILL GO IN A SUCH WAY WHICH IT IS BENEFITABLE, SO THIS IS AN INDEPENDENCE THINKING YOU PEOPLE HAVE TO DO, I WILL BEND THIS TOPIC ONLY IF YOU PEOPLE  If you enjoyed this, then there is more to talk about it, but I think there are too many things that people don't want to understand or don't understand because I put a lot of emphasis on abstract things, this topic is not something that can be found.  To you  Or someone is discussing these, I bring something very abstract, if it is liked then it will be discussed further. You can also take Paisa Hai Sukoon membership by pressing the join button on Youth Pay on Clarity, in which I am providing workshops and vaginas and decisions.  I will continue to do such things like making and you will enjoy it a lot in life, first of all, how to set up an agent and in that, how to make your mental model for him and then you will realize that I will never work for someone else. I am Jhanda's partner. Now you will say that you are also setting our agenda but to make him learn things also you have to be a part of the bill. You understand my point, this is the attraction, just like a singer, he gives the secret to him.  He is a poet, he takes me, this is how I am too, I also take these things to the top, I tell myself as mine, I also understand you, then I do the same thing with him, then I understand him too, I hope.  do you understand this thing  It is coming and this is the fun, it is called mental massage, people do it for the body, how will they massage the mind from inside, this is mental, I do this massage for those who want to do it and if they enjoy it, then you take membership.  Can join thank you very match"

    "title": "Do You Have True Friends In Your Life？ Selecting And Making Friends The Right Way [ZHNTad0hlP4].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today's topic is I should have friends, a lot of people will run away left and right in this, I know how to make friends, how do we make friends, those who think like us, have belief systems like us, with whom there is no argument, with whom we have fun.  Well, we make such friends, but in friendship, I tell you that those who make too many friends then do not progress further in life, what nonsense are you talking, everyone has to lose like this, what I am trying to say is that when you  In  You will progress, you will meet them, you will respect them, maybe you will help them sometimes, but your lifting, sitting, eating, drinking and meeting will not stop. This is what I am teaching you that you have to leave friends. Friendship is an overrated thing for you because today it is war which is understood. Who is the friend with whom can I make out with? Who is the friend with whom can I drink alcohol and talk dirty with whom can I talk politely without being intrusive. Who is that friend?  He can talk dirty like this, I can smoke cigarettes openly, I do this openly, he is my friend and friend, I have not seen you that many times anyway, there will be a fight in the pub, this is what I call my friend.  He is a friend who will not question my small, useless actions and will support me with his eyes closed. He is my friend. This is the basic system of friendship, I will even give up my life for you. We will not break this friendship. He is Amitabh Bachchan, Veeru.  Concept is the same concept, if we have to have friendship, first of all, friendship is a loose word, you should be very nice and cute with everyone, but if you have to have emotions, then keep parents, wife, children for them. At the workplace, people call colleagues as friends.  No there is a lot of fluff because hey friend means because if you want to get something less from someone then it is very easy to call him a friend that he is our friend but practically he is not a friend, you also know. And it is not possible to have 3000 5000 friends on Facebook, can you have 4000 friends, this is the terrible need of people, you have friends, how am I looking? Our mind has become such that we think about how our face looks in the mirror.  And now we need another man to ask how I look. We have become so far away from ourselves that we need a confirmation by which we have made friends.  You will see that it is okay to pick any Hindi movie, sometimes happy, sometimes sad, Pooja Fu Fu of her three friends who look less sexy than her and she is a leader type and everyone is grinding her, this is how we have made big friends in life so that we can live in reality.  You can check the comparison by saying that this is my friend, the someone who studied with you, he does not become your friend, you will say in college that someone was with you, he was not a friend, he was in the first job, he became a friend, then you went to the second one, then what happened to him, no, he  still friends  Sometimes you call someone, you call someone, you want to take advantage of someone, don't call him a friend, even if you have friends in life, they ca n't be more than the fingers of one hand, I'm not counting us, I end  That friend is the one who is your definition of a friend. He will be less in sorrow. He will be less in sadness. I will also tell you that definition. Check your quality and friendship. I am going to tell you a very big thing. A real friend is the one who can join you in your happiness and sorrow.  what did he just say  What did you say, in happiness everyone is in sorrow, yes-yes, listen carefully, so that you can be genuinely happy in your genuine success and genuine happiness, in sadness everyone goes, this is the actual saying of life that is counterproductive but you are the one in life.  Look, that's why it got messed up, a little bit, he is not a real friend, friend, the one who is happy in your happiness, is happy for you and adds value to your life, his words are devil's advocate, not by confirmation.  You are about to start a business, he is telling you how stupid your ID is, he is able to make you say things that you may not like or maybe question your belief system, crush him, keep such friends in your life. Those friends of progress are few in number. If you do have them then you have to cherish them. They will be happy and they will never have anything to do with you. They will never say to you that they will not care about you. If you are my friend then make me happy.  I want to tell you the same thing about girlfriend- boyfriend relationship, that's why marriage is also love, don't associate with any such girl. If you are a boy and if you are a girl, then do n't associate with any such boy who is jealous of you.  Try to put this burden on me that you make me happy. A good friend is that friend who is happy himself and is ready to share his happiness with you and is also ready to share your happiness with him and he will never let you down.  That brother, you make me happy, you make me happy, you did not come with me to watch the movie, come with me to watch the movie, you did not come with me to watch the movie, you are not my friend, if you did not come here to waste time, then you are not my friend, who should never judge you, judge.  There is a big difference between judging you while not doing one thing and opening your eyes and telling you your real perspective. The difference between the two things is friendship. Yes, if you are a real friend, then I am saying it is overrated because of your quality and its like that.  their  There will be such a system that even after 3 years, they will talk on the phone even after 2 years, they will talk directly, they will forcefully come and go, eat and drink, alcohol, super fish, only there will be no relationship, no one has come to meet you, has come to meet you, food and drink in the hotel.  It is there but that relationship is not going on the basis of let's drink and let's party, it is not because of him, it is because of the people who are adding value to each other and are surrounding themselves like this.  If you make a friend then there should be someone in your life who is your books and who is your knowledge. You can make any creator a friend in YouTube too. Talk to him directly without being yours. You understand his words and you write in the comments. Such friends add value. You may have many such friends. If your definition of a friend is not actually the same definition of a friend, but if you try to make it like this then whoever brings value to my life will be the one who will come to my mind.  I will not take people with me because what kind of action do I have to do that I have to tease a girl, then her boyfriend will kill me, then I will call my friends and then I will tease her, I have to create this kind of circle, many people do this.  Do you know that you play in numbers, we will make friendship like this, I will never leave you because of my friends, men please very polio of your family life, parents do not get along in the family.  Parents do n't understand or don't listen, brothers and sisters don't get along, that's why friends come into the picture, because what is a friend, why do friends like it, because friends don't care that much about you and whatever you do.  Do n't share the bathroom with someone you don't know. You can't do stupid things 24 hours with a friend. Your wife knows. Your parents know what kind of person you actually are. Friends, maybe they are just like you and only.  two alike If you collide then you will support each other then you will feel that he has become your support system and that is a bad habit of yours, don't you understand that he is your mirror image, your clone, he is not a friend because a friend is someone who helps you. Take you up in life and if you reach up in life, then be happy in reaching up. In this definition, how many people come into your life, they will be called friends. Now write whether you thought this thing was good or very bad because  That's what we saw, friends spread in the purchase.  If it happens, it feels a little bad, but if you go first, then it feels worse and you lag behind, and you heard it, friends, friendship is nothing, it is just date in date time and frame, date time and space time pass. We give him friendship through best means and friendship now I say that there is no brotherhood between two brothers, if one brother makes a lot of progress and the other one is not able to do so, this is also a fact of life, then friendship will be lost.  Is This is that you can also say that the Kingdom and there is no fighting among themselves then there is friendship because they want to grow each other and do not want to attack, that is a different thing, you have become very rich, you are a businessman, you have network and  You want you call dem friend it is ok mostly people who are network friends call them friends I hope not confused d only thing what I want you tell date do not get  In this, there is a lot of friendship because of business. In this, it is the friend's friendship and the obligation will increase. He has a lot of personal problems. He is helping you. No, we should help him because he will help me. I have to live a very low standard of life. What friend is there in 20?  What issues are the girl having? Are the girl's issues happening? The boy and the girl broke my heart. Now brother, today you are brother, today you are mine. Hey, don't be like this, why am I for you, why brother, why for them.  Hold on like this, you have to put someone inside you, you have your own life, you have to take your life to the best level, then it may be from such people that you may get what you are listening to, it may be you who are the friends who cry and cry and  Expects my friends to come and help me and set up a harem because you can't do such wise things with your parents Concentrate on your life do something Time Table If you have ever wasted in gaming then you have spent time unnecessarily in drinking alcohol  You have wasted it in cigarettes. He will not eat his friend's cheeks. He will not say how much we are enjoying our lives together. Brother, I am having fun. Brother, I am having fun. You are the only one who understands me only because you are here.  If you need stupidity to understand an idiot then maybe you are living a stupid life and to understand him you got another idiot and this is what you are trying to date me oh ho this friendship we  Will never break because anyone else will come in talk sense and will try to say please don't do this, you will not like it, nor will your parents like it. How will your wife like it if they are talking like this?  Those who are interrupting you in the society for your actual growth, you are really white, these are overrated things and you should not force yourself to have a big.  Circle of friends have limited and three you have sounding boards where you can talk to someone about investment, you can talk to someone about job, you can talk to someone about venture, you can talk to him to do something, just keep it to him, force him to do so.  Do n't take too much because there will be many people who have to do something with you, first they will create a role, today you will meet, then he will ask for some help from you, now you will say why did you waste so much of my time, you should have asked earlier, this is what happens in friendship. If he is your friend then the best friend is an insurance policy. Whatever happens, you will get money. He is also a friend. If you kill him, you will get money. He is also a friend. So look at the definition. Now you want an emotional man who is manipulating you or  If you can manipulate someone, then please do this. If some of your friends start filtering you out after watching this video, then you will filter out your friendship. F for filter F for friendship, please right.  And those for whom this video has completely hurt their belief system and they say that if the video is ridiculous then please write it also. I should know what it is about my audience, so I said it is coming from higher order thinking but I want you to know that I understand.  I could not explain it because if many people say it is ridiculous then it is not that there is no point in it, I will just date it and what do you have to say on this video and this information which I have just shared. Thank you"

Nikhil Kamat is in the business of stock brokerage firm Zerodha, so when he says that look Bhaiya, I am not staying at home, I invest my money in stocks, you too can invest in stocks.  If you put it in mind, then he has a purpose of not staying at home, he can buy thousands of homes and he can stay on rent in exotic places and he can travel the world and stay in five star hotels and may be travelling in 365 days itself For all you know 150 days and staying in the best of the locations, you will get peace there as well, for you a home is a residence and if any landlord says go away and vacate the place now I cannot hammer a nail, I cannot do it here.

In the same house for so long and that's it these people are all smart Bill Gates it's okay yours but Buffett also has such followers in India white do it is that friend do n't hate him people are very jealous of him recently Guruji on I uploaded a video on Virat Kohli on the Gurugram channel, Praising Virat Kohli for something, you should watch that video.

Now if you go out then you are like what is this friend I will keep changing the house these days getting my AC fitted, getting the TV fitted, getting the geyser fitted, getting the chimney fitted, whatever such things are there, 00 things inside the houses  There is a dish washer, this, that, the people who get it fitted charge so much money, friend, first get it fitted, then remove it, fit it, then remove it, this is the only work left, then you take your child to school, then get your wife a job, this is what you want for your  There is something called a variable in the equation of life Keep a constant, have a constant that yes, she is my wife, she will remain my wife constant, this is my house here, I work, I may change the job, I will leave the boss, I will not leave my house, I will leave my wife, learn to make life constant carefully, who  Which ones will be my constants in sea life, will they not be mine, Nikhil Kamat can afford to stay on rent all his life, not 2 or 3 per cent rental, I was seeing a video of Sandeep Maheshwari, hey, it is rarely available and financial issues  Sitting with someone, hey bhaiya it will always be % rental, sometime you can catch it 30 years ago and 30 years later but nobody talks that the house appreciates and becomes double, so if the house is worth ₹1 and the rental is for ₹ then when it is 200  If it becomes Rs. then the rent becomes Rs. 6 is also 3 per 200, but brother  The one who bought it for 100, he is saving ₹ rent and then when it becomes 400 from 200, even then there is % interest i.e. still it is ₹ rent but the one who bought it for 100, he is getting ₹ 12, I have one thing Tell me friend, I took the lion of NHPC, suppose you accept it, okay okay if I but it at ₹1 and NHPC gives me.  Dividend per year the dividend is how much 10 per for me but I suppose I am giving an example, okay and if it becomes ₹1 now and some more in ₹80 90, okay I don't check, I don't check every day and  You should also not check your stocks every day it's a bad habit ok if it was for ₹1 and now it is giving 1.4 then also at 1.4 but friend tell me am I getting 10 per cent returns as dividend on my investment and am I  Getting 1.4 is the basic problem of understanding because financial influencers will say in this case it is technical in case you sell your stock, you will get 100 and in 100 again you buy it will become 100 and now it becomes 1.4 but yaar I bought it for 14  Brother, I have eaten as much as he did in 10 years NHPC has given me dividend in the last few years. It is more than the stock price. For me, the cash flow of the stock is zero. Meaning, it has given me more dividend. I am not supposed to follow it. It is a government company. Here, I am not recommending it.  HPC I am giving an example I am not talking about stock here I am talking about an example that why do people say that there is a flat of 3 lakhs in Janakpuri MG in 1988 and its rent comes to 45 lakhs per month why it is not counted counted age  150 on and it is counted as 3 because if you buy fresh then it is of 1.5 cr so in 1.5 cr you will put 4.5 thread whatever calculation so yes it is three thatchi will remain okay but the game is over right if I  In 1995, the rent should have been invested in mutual funds. Why didn't Varku ji ever do the calculation and give it?  should take this example from this video, put it because he is a great this thing guy because it is good, he shows it well, he has his whole team, I do n't have any team in the team, if not from above, then I would have come after learning, okay  If anyone wants to learn this video then there is no copyright violation, which I am saying openly, any knowledgeable person can do it by learning all this, no one, and today I am telling it on record that my people are already doing it.  My people are stealing such content from big YouTubers, I don't do anything to them, nor do I tell them, nor can I say anything to them because they are so big, so today I, a common man, am telling the common subscriber that you can use all my content wherever you want.  Look, I am never going to do anything and people don't bother me, it's okay, at least the message has reached, okay you too can make shorts of it, edit it, make messages and this is a big thing that I have done because I really feel like doing it.  I have to make a financial channel because when I make it then  Many shops will be shut down and my aim is not that because I do not want to wear the mask of moral science teacher, social reformer etc. anywhere. I am a realist and I say clear and practical things but no one follows anyone completely. I want to tell the youth practically that you should do only what is within your capability but whatever you are able to do, you should learn by getting confirmation from it, this is the only truth in life, the one who cannot exercise, has 100 excuses for not doing exercise and he  He takes 100 examples due to which house cannot be bought, cannot buy, there is no money, mother and father are not giving, money is not coming from anywhere, father in law is not being kind, wife is not giving money, wife is a housewife, does not do a job, cannot take it, then he gets his confirmation  Here he takes notes, those who buy this house, they tell their story, everyone is looking for their confirmation batch and there are so many case studies and examples that you can follow anybody, you can follow Salman Khan, you can follow Shahrukh Khan, I want to follow  Mukesh Ambani ji, such a big house, everyone will live together but on separate floors, so my ideal is 27 floors, brothers and sisters, cars on five-six floors, servants on five-six floors, one floor for one grandson, swimming pool for him, there should be another floor for granddaughter.  The daughter's children should be born, the other ones are also going to get married, the elder ones are also living, a full family, mother is also there, friends, parties, this is the fun, something or the other happens when the wealth of the rich is in the air alone, oh that  The fun will be there at home only, right? How much fun can you have by going out? If you have a very big and nice living room in your house, yes you can do everything sitting together, like I give people an example, people say today Everybody is busy in their rooms, hey bhaiya you build a nice house, make a cozy house and don't be judgemental, everybody should sit like this, in the family the son is sitting, he is engrossed in the mobile, the daughter is sitting there, the wife is engrossed in the mobile  Here you talk to mummy ji on your mobile with someone here and in between  You can also talk to me in between, why are you being judgemental? Someone has something in his ears but he can be seen sitting nearby. When you see your child, your loved one, your wife and everyone, I see anyone like this now  I was not giving a very personal example, if someone is getting happy after watching the video of a cat, is laughing, laughing ha ha haha ​​then you are like it, it increases your energy, friend, keep watching it, but it will sit around only when the atmosphere is such that  You must have made it, house is very important, all the happiness is in the house and the second most important thing is the woman, the wife, she is the one who makes the house, other rods don't even make houses, now I will take it towards wisdom, intelligence and then  Those elders of Prasad ji whip me, don't say such things, okay, I will give rest to my speech here, okay, I feel very scared, that Sandhi Maheshwari had to remove the video, he had said something, okay, so okay  I am scared, yes I am scared, there is victory beyond fear, so please this one  I have given you clarity, you guys have to do what you want to do, no one follows anyone, there are a lot of youth, they are smart but they call their Jaan Badmash, there is a word in Haryana, Jaan Badmash, what is the English word for Jaan Badmash, anyone?  One who knows English very well should write Haryanvi, normally no one among you would be able to write, write it, people of Haryana listen to me a lot, video Jaan Badmash, tell me also what is Jaan Madbash, ji youth is fine, give deliberation, just fan see. They have to do only what they can do, okay, and in that they will follow someone, not to justify it, if you want to get married then grab that person, if you want to get married, those who do it are becoming less in number these days, okay, so this is called confirmation bias  I have taught mental models very well. They are one and their thumbnails are green in colour and my paid members will get them by clicking on the join button. Their demand is very high. They were free for one and a half years, so people bought the free stuff and the price came down.  isn't it as soon as those trees are gone aha ha subscriber  Press that join button and now see, this is the fun of doing something, if you keep saying it is free then it has no value, now it has a lot of value and people are enjoying it a lot, you will get to attend free webinars, you will get to see old content as well  You will get to see all the interviews and I will do regular webinars, those who want to join them, you will find a webinar info group of subscribers in the comment section, so you can join that as well, thank you very much"

    "title": "Do You Want To Be An Engineer ？ ｜ Which Branch To Select ？ [ulQXHK5-Eek].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, do you want to be an engineer, we will do the engineering profession, there is a little trick, it is not easy to say yes no, but still I will address an audience here that if you are a brother or a child, should you do engineering or not?  This is very loss ended because you know engineering is also ETP and from the nonsense below, engineering is also from college, so I am the first one who is crazy about the people in IT and the leadership and is very brilliant at his level.  There are students and if they are going to be expelled then I am not addressing them because those points are not even 5%. There are close to 16 lakh seats in engineering. India does not have that much GDP of China and that of America, if you add that.  So the GDP of both of them together is 10, 11, 12 times the GDP of India. Add whatever figure is fine and India produces 10 times more engineers in a year than both of them, which means as many engineers are produced in China in a year.  Are produced and are in it, combine both and India's figure goes 10 times and the GDP of both of them is 10 times more than ours, then we are out by 100 times, this is simple mathematics, please motivate it, first of all, practical.  We want only one out of 100 engineers who are making it, now we want only one, the rest are engineering Haj Vikum D New B.Sc. Like earlier we used to say, if you had done B.Sc., we would have called you an Engineer.  15-15 2025 ₹ 3000 worth, they are roaming around like this, okay, Aadesh is roaming around doing stand up comedy and who is roaming around doing what and those who are fired for IT fighting are also fired, if they do less than those related engineering then What would I like to tell you here? Have you not written off in the exam? It is definitely not an engineering thing. Which one should I do? Computer is doing well. Coding is doing well. Do this one. Today I am going to do an engineering thing.  I am going to talk about the branch of engineering which is considered by most to be a branch. This is my opinion. Discuss it with your parents, it does n't make any sense otherwise parents will ask that am I telling them engineering is the right one to become an engineer?  There is no competition, if you want to become that person then you can pause here and write which branch of engineering is the most money caste and I am going to suggest the same and also tell you the logic and what to do.  I am also going to tell you, okay, so write which branch is the most popular, which branch is Civil Engineering, okay, in Civil Engineering, it means no SIM, in IIT too, maybe there is a vacant caste in that, okay, no one was interested in Civil Engineering, and IT is it.  Note consider this think if you become a civil engineer if you are not a very intelligent child whose rank is one in lakhs then it is known as one in lakhs in triple I means rank in lakhs which is right not in thousands but lakhs comes after lakhs.  So now you also know the story  You have to go and become an engineer because only then you have taken PCS, given engineering exams, if you are preparing then brother, do civil engineering, it is not necessary to get many jobs, become a civil engineer, India is in great need of civil engineers, they are building houses.  They do not have any knowledge which makes the contractors who are becoming Plus 4 these days, they have not even gone to ITI, leave aside being engineers, what else is definitely not taught in engineering, is the syllabus of civil engineering of IIT or any other college?  There is a lot of difference, there is no difference, there can be difference in faculty and stamp, Apni Bhaiya, how to stand the pen, where to put Bhim, how will the door frame come, how is its strength, how to rate cement, there are basic 25-3050 questions which you can use to gain knowledge in the right way. By doing this, by stopping it and doing it practically, you can earn good money throughout your life, there is a lot of money in it, that is why I am telling you, I am not talking about the rest of engineering, I am coding.  Is this going to happen in a wedding? What will happen to electrical? What will happen to mechanical? If it is evergreen then it is sitting there and has sold soap and oil to anyone. Anyone has sold phones to anyone. Anyone has done engineering and has kept themselves happy. I am talking about real engineering.  I have been a Civil Engineer for many years, there is retirement ahead in Forms India for the next 30 to 35-40 years because today if you are taking the decision of engineering then your age is 18, 19, 20 years and 60 years.  If a man has to work for 65 years, then in the next 50 years, there is a lot of construction in India, there is honey and there is no blue ocean opportunity, the more you enter in the beginning, the more experience you will get because this is such a degree, what kind of engineering degree is this?  With this degree, you can earn your living, like the Tata accountant I mentioned earlier or a lawyer, I am a lawyer, so I have a degree, just because of this, I can earn my living, I am a notary.  It is like giving an affidavit, making a rent agreement outside, or whatever the story is, I don't trust anyone to do it, brother, please do it for me, all the other engineers are like this, brother, if I have done mechanical engineering then it means that I cannot do it myself.  They will set up a factory and a company, they will come with a dog and a machine and make something, people cannot do anything like this, go to the story and join the elephant, the one thing in this is that you can start with less and you can start with your team.  You have got the project, the project owner will give him the money, you will become the society by buying it with the money and that will be your profit. People don't find it sexy in being a contractor, but in reality they are small contracts, road contracts, there will definitely be many big ones, these are the big guns. Youngsters like you, who are 23, 24, 25, 26 years old, do less than a small team of 100-200 people, no man is like this.  He himself has hired 1.5 thousand engineers because what is going to happen in the future will give you a small commission as it is said inside the puzzle that brother, you convert this one by doing this, how much is it like this?  You have less than 15 days, do this and as your portfolio keeps coming, keep creating a website of yours, keep posting it on the website, take a photo here, take a photo there, you will do well, you will not commit theft, you have the knowledge because you are a civil engineer.  and yours  It is a good team, then you will test it, that is, brother, he built my house, it is very good, there is a photo of the house, and building a house is such a thing that it has to be done honestly and well, look at the relief, I have built it, it has been erected there, it is word of mouth.  It will be less for you but for that you have studied civil engineering for the course, now what is keeping it in the market, there are some colleges like Daily University, there are some colleges, very sexy and good men go there because boys and girls like them.  come from  Something has been prepared like this, mine is done in it, mine is not done in it, you have a cook, if he knows how to cook good food then he knows how to do it, now where does he find the time, if he has to cook the food himself and sell it ready, then is n't he like a hotel?  From where you have done management, it is important that you should join civil engineering. Even if you have to become an engineer, if it is okay then join civil engineering. There is no competition and retirement is very high and till the time the country releases you, you will  You have gone ahead, how much do you need this realization, civil engineer will come to India in four-five-six years, I have to tell my trade here first, I have to tell people who know my analysis of trends and you can read all these things in the newspaper 6-8-  After 10 months, this is mine, you will get someone to write your report, you will get someone to write your report for 6-7 months in the newspaper, you will get it in some or the other, India needs a civil engineer, then again I will do it, it is like this, the coder, the coder who had started, is white, junior, was there.  Give this thought, all the children will also become good, they will become coders, that is our country, then this husband will also go, but the one who became in the beginning has started less, the one who has knowledge will always have the advantage, the first mover advantage is always there in life, there is relief in anything.  No matter how small a business I am, the shop that your grandfather built is there, it is just that, it will always have the lifelock advantage from someone, bill start date match letter and bill.  Note Delete So today I told you that after four-five-seven years you will see a lot of trades but this one is a lip off fake. Discuss with your parents that if you have to take engineering, then reduce yourself in it.  I will do electrical engineering. Can you go and set up a company? How much does it cost? I will not do engineering, you will just do a job, you will reduce everything else here, and in reducing it, you will have a lot of initial capital.  The investment is not very much, it is like you are in Hawaii and you reached there to make Aloo Puri, first he gave you the money, then you went and bought oil, bought potatoes and your people cut them and you started the business, then slowly.  -Slowly you are again buying the society and this is dangerous yourself buying the society of shuttering, come yourself, keep your things, keep the story in place, you can do it slowly when your money starts making, otherwise in the beginning everything will be at a cost, shuttering will also be done.  Pay  That machine is going to rotate, it will also come on the car, everything will have to be taken like this in the beginning, after that gradually the money will come, then you will start doing all the work yourself, then you will start increasing your margins, that is a journey, but how did you like this thing? I am telling this idea in a practical way, I am telling you in detail about the profession, you can also take the membership of the channel, I am telling you this in details later, you can easily watch and understand, I have made it on the doctor, it is on the lawyers, it is mine, but it is the doctor's. Webinar has been done and it will also be updated in the membership. Whatever these are, their detailed things will be like this, like if you want to understand properly about civil engineering and if you are proposing or have done civil engineering, then you can definitely do it. It is perfect and they are roaming left and right. Either these people have become civil engineers or are doing so because even in the third year, a small business can be started. Brother sir, if you make a little in the future then it may happen that till that paw to me  Till the time I don't come to prepare bhaji, I ca n't send some more parathas as per my wish. Start doing less. Your normal contractor is normal, he is not even 10th pass, not even 11th pass. We have kept him for now in the North East and from the side which is here.  They are doing less in Gurgaon and North India. I do n't even understand this language. Let's do less. Okay, you can make a good team. I can do a workshop on how to do this. If you are a civil engineer interested then please type C.  CI will type the short form of civil engineer on my WhatsApp number which will be given below and you will see the number. You will WhatsApp me, if there is no audience then I will hand hold the details in it that brother, get this street job for civil engineering. Start this small business, you are fine and how to do it, which company to join initially for two-four years, how to gain experience in it, then how to bring your personal in it, how to create its brand image, what is your  If I want to tell you how to do it, I have read only this one in Puri Engineering, okay, you are very intelligent and that story and something else, okay brother, I am also there for those people who are poor and are not able to write, they are one in a million, okay, lakhs.  I have to put in it even once in life, this is a triple thing that brother, if the salary is above 1 lakh then you will get civil engineering, anyone can get civil engineering who wants it but it is getting it from someone else, it also has less value.  no caste  There is a lot of money in this and then those of you who are doing this job don't pay 40-50-60 thousand ₹1 lakh in life or you will beat the IIT people, this is Guruji's promise to you that how much package will the IT people get?  It will be done, it will be more than that, okay now I am not guaranteeing to beat all the IT people, but those who are from below IIT and those who struggle, look, it is not about toppers, now it is not about beautiful back, not here.  so beautiful as soon as you say it  Then you take these 10 names, okay, there are other people too, there are people who are below in IT too, they are equal to them, you will be removed above them, okay, so please, if you want to do me after Civil Engineer, then IF.  You are doing civil engineering please get connected and let's monetize your skills otherwise you will keep roaming like such thoughts, what should people do even out of shame, I am in civil line, you will make the country, civil engineer will make the country and who else will make it sitting?  You poor people used to sit, stand in the sun and watch Dharmendra in his old pictures, like this bridge is being built inside the village and that bridge is being built in the other side of the picture and then there is the same heroine and two-four songs and a dacoit and  The villain is in these kind of movies, isn't it? Engineer Saheb, he was an engineer in civil engineering when the country got independence. Who has made this Bhakra Nangal Dum? Who has made Bakra Nangal Dum? I mean, what is the physical construction that has been done?  Those who make engineers, if you tell me, is it a very good thing, it should be of great value, according to me, there will be more ahead, so become one now, tomorrow you will get respect for your experience, if your college is also not great, then no problem, 10 years of experience.  If it is there then you will get its value because when a thing has value in the country then even if you are not an experienced engineer, I am telling you that if you have built 10-15 houses then just witnessing it is fine like.  If you want to play a builder, then you should have a lot of knowledge about caste, sir, supply chain, do you know what to buy from Chavadi market, where will the plumbing work come from, how to lay cement, what fibers to lay, which brick to take, number one, two, three, what? Which Indian or fly bet of five key up should be taken or what new technology has been introduced or which cement blocks can be taken, what are the types of blocks, you will know all that when you do it.  Sir, it will be done in 8, it will be done in 10, it will be done in 12, it will be done in 16. Okay, who will come to do my shuttering and who will come to tie the iron, what is their rate, so I have all this knowledge like I have complete knowledge.  I am not a civil engineer, I have complete knowledge about which door frame, I am surprised, how many wooden ones, Burma teak ones, how many ones, education, where do I get the grill, where do I get the iron, what is the rate?  It is going on, I have to install Italian marble, I have to install tires, I have to install Kajri, I have to install Dushmani, there is another one too, which one is one by one me, which one is 4/2, which one is to be installed in the bathroom, what is Toto's fighting?  You will know everything, but you are a civil engineer, your team will be ready, you have to hire a plumber, you have to hire an electrician, two-four masons, strong cooks, laborers are definitely available, okay, you just have to hire an electrician, you have to hire a painter.  All good team, I will type everything and give it to you people who are in North India and around Delhi, even if you are cooked, you can definitely cook, there is no learner in the market, the next person in the market is not going to learn everything, gun, all.  Who are you, take the cake, take the cake, take my cake, no one is telling me how to make one, that brother, it will be made at this temperature, it is like this, and we will make this eggless cake, we will make the eggless cake, the good one is very soft, that and this one.  I have something to tell everyone  If you are ready to sell, then I am teaching you practically, I am not a civil engineer, it is not necessary for you to become that person, this is also a fact, it is okay that your degree is yours, you will bring that knowledge as yours, you will be billed as others.  Give match butter, give me because you are already butter because you are a civil engineer. If you are roaming around in the degree lake, then your knowledge, practical knowledge, which you will go to in my comment area, I will either make you a WhatsApp group of civil engineers. Like this or you WhatsApp me something bill b daan so dat you can get connect which of dem if you are only i bill teach I will also not tell you holding two do five 10 so if there is enough okay  Do you know my friend, how to do this, how much money is saved, what are the margins and how to go and how to do it. Zero means you are studying now, you don't know anything and your father is saying to mother, hey, do a government job.  Do it now, you don't know anything about engineering, this will give you some courage, so whoever needs courage, please thank you to the civil engineer."

    "title": "Do You Want To Become A Doctor ？ ｜ Deep Dive Analysis On Medical Profession [Of8Ghpv8BSc].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, start a small playlist or start a series and if this video is taken by a very pragmatic and intelligent audience, then what happens to the creator many times, the story code gets more posts and the creator becomes silent.  If it does n't happen then it is good to do good because I have a lot of clarity on this subject, so today we will discuss with him. Is it okay to become a doctor in future in my career because children are not doctors, that is, T.  I have to pass the exam to become a doctor, so I will tell him about some such aspects because if we have made him advice wise, then he should become moralistic, then he should become a very noble profession, then that is a normal thing, it is a different thing, mine is less to give you clarity.  Feeling good is not just sitting there with whatever your thought process is, if I come and do this then there will be clapping but if you reach there then there will be counter view in even one of them.  Or maybe you don't want to hear this because even a doctor is not going to tell you what kind of profession a doctor is, what kind of profession a doctor is, now you will say, are you a doctor, are you, can you say, no, I can say with a lot of experience and consultation and Look at all the points I am giving and also go and ask a doctor. First of all, if there is any doctor in your family, everything, mother and father are doctors. Mix a lot of sense in you.  Tu vikam you me note want tu vikam ise n different think this series and this bill b par people hoon are asking give are ready tu vikam anything give are asking how if you don't want tu be comment doctor give then you don't have tu watch this  Na this on this if you want to know then these aspects should be learned from you whether it is a boy or a girl whether it is a boy or a girl look today if you are becoming a doctor in India then you have  There are two-three choices, one is that you have become a doctor now, then you have to study further, you go to the government system, no matter which department of the government, the doctor is there, from Railways to Defense Forces to Lake Normal Government Government Service, Haryana Government, Rajasthan Government. Central Government has all types of systems, your doctor's one is that one, your salary will be fixed in it, in that you get decent salary along with non-practicing, it is less.  It means very little to the government people because even if the infrastructure is not that great, there is a lot of physical movement of people in the hospitals, it is okay that there will be a struggle in satisfaction, money is the only thing for you, the second thing is that you become a private doctor in which you can work in a private hospital.  Start practicing, the third thing is that you start your own consultation, okay and one more thing is extreme, Papa Ji Mummy Ji Gayi Kuch Hai, if that means Papa Mummy is a doctor in the family.  Uncle, close uncle, uncle is like this, that is, it is called nepotism, which I do not consider wrong at all, okay, if there is such a system, then you can fit in here too, then by doing these five things, where you can fit in, then salary in this. Whatever is there in the government is fixed, there is also change in the government and the salary is fixed. When you are sitting here, you are the owner, the next one is your corporate and this is the salary wise, something like this is very picky.  No, but the young doctor is struggling a lot, doctor, and as long as what is there nowadays, I will not call the message customer, patient, it is the other side of the table, okay, so I will tell you my mind set, but whatever people, whatever doctors are listening to my request to them.  You please tell me whether what I have told you is right or wrong and incidentally, I am going to work for a doctor in the near future, can it increase the fear of income because I am personally a full doctor?  Note getting given date is me this think lord people bill se doctors are like this I had also made some videos hospital like that and the same I am feeling on bed d doctor's private if you see it is like school teacher's life fool after  I became a doctor after a while because the public is paying the full amount as if education is not cheap but neither are our teachers who are doing jobs who have made a name for themselves, the hair becomes so hairy then the notes start coming before that.  not coming  So this program has started very late, marriage is late, studies are late, then that sir, the whole life is late, and after that, he starts earning money and becoming a big man. The quality of life is very affected. You tell me, I talk to the doctor when I talk to him.  If I talk to 100 doctors, then I have a little regret, if you tell me in 5 percent, if you are a doctor, then you have worked very hard, but you are not getting that much and to have a name, your hands are clean.  You have become your name, you have become a name in social media, you have become a brand, then it is sky's the limit, then brother, there is nothing bigger than that, doctors are like this, they are hard doctors, they are doctors just like us, Medanta City is so big, that is theirs.  Its IPO was also taken, that means where did it come from, Doctor Area Shetty ji, he is from the school, some of his doctor's names are famous doctors, so there is a lot of scope, but what is his struggle, this is very bad, how much do you think, don't you think so?  that people call you god  It does not seem to be known to the public that Maa's Aarti will be performed like this because there are limitations for the doctor. You know this. I have my personal opinion that the doctor does not get as much as he should, because the money is used on the platform which he has in this hospital.  The hospital is a corporate one, the one who opened it is making more money because the doctor is sometimes here, sometimes yes, sometimes yes, sometimes there, sometimes he poached you here, sometimes he took a good doctor, he took a good doctor, he took yes, sometimes there, sometimes yes, this is an affair.  And then whatever is good for you, then there is relief in it, I will not call it greedy, but now there is a consultation with a doctor, now there is a consultation with a doctor, it is very unfortunate for me, I am not a doctor, I have not studied to be a doctor, sometimes I do doctor's consultation.  I am ashamed of my caste because my fees are so high, compare them, you fear the fees and I laugh, that too, I have to laugh too. You did this, did this, studied so much but cannot ask for that much fees from a common man.  You, because there are many doctors available, it is about this that if the solution I provide becomes popular in the market, then my fee will also stagnate and it will fall. I am making an impact consultant because of my happiness course and real.  State course and astrology course and consultation course and all those are running on the channels. They are running on the big channels. You can also do less than platinum number one there and what time.  Saying this, when the doctor comes to the house and then does the consultation, he charges a thousand rupees. In a small town, he charges Rs. 200, 300, 400, 500. In that, every person goes for 15, 20, 25, 30 minutes and then only one goes, but if you add  Nowadays, only four-five ₹ 6000 is earned, if you multiply it, then if you work for the whole day, then ₹ 180 will be distributed in 30 days. ₹ 180 That is divided, then if you are in a story, go to the post, you have got a story, go to the post, that is Sensoplas to you, then if you are in a job, in a government job, story in the job is a different thing, but in that, I have seen that the doctor has now got up.  So demotivating is motivating, no, I am giving clarity, I am not saying that you doctor, believe it or not, it is your choice, but look at your working today, in the shift system of night, day and early morning. When accountability is very stressful, brother, when it is very stressful, otherwise, if someone has to become a doctor, then he will become one, what am I, what am I, will he become a doctor, will he become a doctor because of my food, will he become a band, will he become one?  There is not much shortage of doctors in India who are being supplied. There is a greater shortage of medical workers which are of nurse level and medical assistants. There are too many of them. In the medical system, is it the story or the body or the doctors themselves? Government is there, something should be done about doctors, I feel like this, you make it a lucrative career, according to me, it is not lucrative, noble is noble, there are many things, noble means if those people do not reduce it, then they fall many times because I can't do it. Already friend, is he going to speak like this or are they sewerage workers? Aren't they good? Are they not needed? Don't we want those who lift the country completely and do n't want those who bring it down in the beginning? Opening graves in the cemetery. You don't want those too, but what do you want to become? This question is your life, someone has to become someone, someone will become someone, there is no shortage of anyone in 140 crores, okay, plumbers will also become electricians, everyone will become doctors, everyone will become this too.  Industrial Entrepreneur Film Actor YouTube So here I am seeing the same pattern on different careers that if there is someone in your system then you know the elder brother who guides you.  You are also a doctor, which is very good, then after becoming a doctor, now the limitations are to marry only a doctor, if you have to bring a working wife, then now you are a Pardisan wife, it is a very strong combination, you are giving birth to a child, you are looking after the child, after that, she  There was not one patient, when the pregnancy came, the pregnancy lasted for 9 months, she got the delivery done, she caught you here, you saw her for three-four years, then the second year went on for five years, then she had her second child, then she was the one.  If you find a couple, then together they become your customer base for the year. It is a very good thing, but the question is that after MBBS, getting a degree in Pediatrician, then meeting that girl, then getting married to the girl, getting married and having children of your own. And then while doing this program to manage, when will you be 45 years of age, caste is not known, tell me, I have been there for six years, after going to 45 till the breath, then you were working on big money for 18 years.  When I had given the NEET exam at the age of 17, he used to say that there is some trouble in life, if you have to leave some corner for yourself, then you have to check how much corner is there, how much study you have done in 17-18 years, you have not lost, it means you.  If selected, if you add 25 years then you will be 42. After 25 years, you get a breather, where the doctor has to be respected, he has to say Namaste. Let's start with brother doctor.  Get the mail from sir Get it from sir By doing this, it is a long journey till then, in today's era, people are running this fire system, for those who are financially retired, people have gone to dream of retirement till the time doctor sir.  They are set then from 42 to 62 it works very well but the biggest problem is that the doctor seems to me to have the biggest problem that I am talking about such a profession here again and again moral.  Don't be a stickler, please no, it has to be physical and there is stress. I have seen patients in medical colleges and all. I have data too, that is, the doctor is looking at the patient etc. that he is not my relative. You do n't even want to be a doctor.  I know because for the sake of the patient, he is killing the patient who has come with him. The doctor has to drink tea and has to go to his doctor. Brother, no matter how much it is an emergency for you, how can it be for you? One income from my heart is 200 income per day for him. He is  He also used to be a doctor who smokes cigarettes. You must know that the one who wants to smoke has to smoke, brother, you know that his head will get fat. If you want to drink tea, then eat biscuits, then you need energy. The whole situation is about eating and drinking. I talk to girls who is a doctor.  These are the things that are in my pocket, I have a lot of support, I need such people in every way, because I feel that I will cry many times, so I asked who made this video that you don't even have a corner to mentally prepare, you will get a lot of money in the water.  If you get the ultrasound one, this radio one or many other things, the one that is available is like this, but brother, look at its fiber, it has 50000 seats, it has 10000 SIMs, these doctors are making 50000, mother, only 10 of them are being made in a year.  There are its fibers, there is titration, then there is that reservation system, this system is mine, I did not get what I wanted, I got money, I got the college, I did not get it, they consider me a consultant and I also give it. Now tell me friend, how do you give the advice that doctors can give? They ask me, Sir, hold this one, I am not gay, hold it, hold it. As soon as the message comes, many of you will say, friend, where are you, Doctor Saheb, after getting qualified, ISP also gives consultation.  I know that this type of grip is like this grip, it is in great demand in the market, it is in great demand, it is the best combination for marriage, which I have told you about Gyanni and Prediction, the best good one is  The sweet has to be increased by doing an operation at the same place, which means the child has to be increased in the department where the child is born. The rest of the story is that the stomach gets cut, that sweet is not there and there is so much of it. How many tanks are used in a cesarean operation and there is clapping, so the profession of a doctor is stressful.  Demands You are a particular kid of nature, a little fixed and a little belligerent and very clear if you are a little emotional person and you get respect.  If issues arise, then basically I would say, if I speak a little from within, it should be like this, I am a doctor, I am doing great [ __ ]. Every doctor should have the same attitude that I am doing great [ __ ]. Never ask all these crazy things.  You will not understand because if you go towards the public for a doctor, because then what happens in the system, when it becomes so much yours, then the story starts with the wrong practice going forward, this is also because of that.  Back  This is a journey of collecting things which started from the age of 18-19, I studied like this, I know how much I have to do, this note is made, do this, do this, do this and this, it is the same thing, it is the same thing, it is not going to get distracted, it is okay, cleanliness.  No, this is not Banda, you know that staying in the middle of the whole day is the Aadhaar letter, but if you choose a career, I feel that some systems should be like this, the doctor's incentive is fixed, very nice, it is written to me in private. This is one thing, they take a lot of money for the bed and the rest of them take a lot of money for the equipment that comes, keep visiting the doctor, if the teacher is getting money, then there is a big offer for the doctor, you can increase your income.  How can I increase it in an ethically and legitimate way, in a good way and you do not have to resort to these doctors? The story is better by reducing the salary of your hospital which is less, because you are a doctor, you can earn more money, in this regard.  In  I will do Wagner, you can subscribe me which is inside the comment area, whenever the information comes, you can join it or you can WhatsApp me doctor, okay doctor, I wrote it because I want you tell me doctor something witch  Give it no, they will say, not only the doctor will teach you, the doctor will teach you how to do your marketing, how to improve your life, the hard work you did for which you are not getting that much results, your income should be exponential.  I don't know how to do that and the public is also benefited in it. I will not tell you anything that will be of any harm to the public. How to connect you, what all you can do. So I bill, I want you to reach out, you doctor, you give help only because of the great feeling from inside.  For a doctor, I myself feel that the hospital is a dog of money, some doctors may also be raising money and some doctors may not be that good, but in the matter of one or two percent, the condition of 97% and 98% is also not that good.  More videos like this can be made on career and also on those. If you want on which career, then you can tell me, maybe in the coming time, I will bring some expert who will give genuine inside information because you know when my  So I know the thing, but when I talk to the expert, you will like my questions very much, the inside talk because coming out and telling only the good things about your profession is a natural thing, so everyone will tell who.  Told that it is there in me, it is there in everyone's life, you know about everyone, then you have to see that friend, that is, which one is more suitable for me, according to my nature, according to my life situation, then you have to understand that you are good.  Because you have seen the life of those whose parents are doctors. The one who does not have any doctor at home, he knows the system either by watching a movie or by seeing a doctor. For him, he knows what is going to happen in reality. What will happen to me?  I will reach the account, how much will I do?  Because if people who work less hard than you or are less educated earn more money than you, then you feel pain. You feel pain because throughout your life you cannot go on the fact that I serve, I serve because those whom I serve,  Even if DK goes to the street, you feel proud of me from inside that I am very close to him in the profession, it is God's distinguishing, which I also agree, but he should also be a flower, I agree, but you are not a flower at all.  someone else would have spoken  Is it or anyone is telling you anything like this? You are feeling helpless and under a lot of stress. If the doctor will definitely respond then I will try to remove it. I will try to remove it from the middle of the tower. I know your issues. You will take some issues, we will discuss them and you will  Please Jadeja will take you to the best level, there is a video for doctor, Sher Karega and those who want to become doctors, thank you very much"

    "title": "Do You Want To Become A Lawyer ？ [pLZnFBcHK-I].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, taking the series of my profession forward, today I have brought this video 'Lawyer as a Profession', everyone should watch it. If you are already a lawyer then definitely watch it. You too will definitely learn something and at the end there will be some surprise for those who are lawyers.  At the end, it will be for those who are already studying law or are practicing lawyers. If you want to learn this and want to get into this profession then watch the complete video. Even if you are already working somewhere.  You can become a lawyer, you can do law because you know that law can be done later also, so I will also address those people who are parents, they must see, students must see, spread, discuss, the way I explain the profession inside.  They go and go and do some youtube 1 dum prose based on the psychology of understanding and then go away and in the end I will also give the verdict that what to do brother, I will give the verdict of my doctors, if you people have not seen it then watch it, it is a very good video. Many doctors have made it when people of that profession give praise to your video that brother, you have told this very well, so today I will ask for feedback from all the lawyers because those who are thinking whether to enter or not, they cannot give feedback. They have to get clarity on whether it is good or bad, but lawyers should tell whether what they have said is correct or not. The first thing I will tell you in seven points is what type of lawyer one wants to become after going inside the law.  What to do, then which type of lawyer means it will depend on who you are, that too I will discuss what father does, the lawyer is one, the one with Jolly LLB is the real law criminal, he is standing in the court fighting for divorce, that lawyer is fine.  Movies show a murder case, this case, that lawyer, one is fine, the corporate law guys sit tight because which lawyer do you want to become and will they decide which college to go to?  Because I did not talk about the entry earlier that give me the [ __ ], give me this, then he will come, you have to go, I will not tell the things that he will tell in my videos, I will not tell that thing.  So, if you tell me, first one is done with corporate law, second one is English stylish one, second one is yours and Jolly LB lawyer, two third one is also one who is preparing for Judiciary, so brother, I have done Judiciary law for 23 years.  For 22 years, if I have to appear for Judiciary paper, then I will address you all. Judiciary people also, when should I give the exam? If I want to become a judge, if I want to become a judge, then I will address these three people. I will tell these three people. Okay, so come to the entry.  Whatever be your club, if you have good colleges etc. in NLU etc. then if you want to go for corporate law etc. then by all means because  What do they do? If you don't want to do your work, you have to do a job, then you need a filter in the job, he doesn't have patience, you are judged by sitting in the interview, he scores marks in the class, because only on the merit of the class, you will get college.  Then the college will also get HiFi, so what is HiFi college? Law is the same in India, you can study from Chaudhary Charan Singh University or Chhotu Ram College of Rohtak, you can study from someone somewhere and that law is the same.  that is  It is the same, there is no difference in it, it is not here in India that this law is taught something else, here some other method of teaching communication skills is taught English Hindi Hostel Boy Girl Crowd That is the difference between that and that somewhere people go on dates.  Somewhere people go on dates, that's the difference, okay, so I am telling about college, okay, go on a date and understand the difference between going on a date, okay, it is a joke, but I hope you have understood, okay, then entry will be done.  Decide this, if you have to become a law lawyer and your new number is coming then go to some good so called because then if you have to become a Jolly LLB type, then if you want to become a Jolly LLB Jolly LLB type, then go to any of your  Also go to college. Becoming a lawyer is not difficult in India. There is not much competition. If you want to take a degree then if you have thought about it then you will get it. What is the advantage of it?  Think better than just doing, you can just do graduation because you get graduation, you can prepare for competition, you can do any job in government because it is a stamp of graduation, plus if you want to do your practice then that way is an advantage for you.  There is a positive thing to be done here and it is okay to do so let's move ahead if the third point is an advantage if there is a lawyer in your family.  Brother, it is undeniable that a lawyer's son, a lawyer's daughter, a lawyer is a very good advantage. If you yourself are lawyers, you are listening to me. Now what happens is that many times children are not born because of what is there in the law, I will tell that in the profession of personality law.  There is no respect for the lawyer, there is fear of the lawyer, there is fear of the black coat, there is no respect, this is also what I would expect from those who do not need respect very much because  Look, sometimes respect comes from nuisance, so if I tell you the truth, it is not there in any profession, it is about everything, it is about nuisance and the nuisance of lawyers is very high, many people are afraid of them, many people are afraid of them, this is a fact and in future also I will continue with this.  I am stopping at this aspect right now, I will go to the fourth point that brother, if you go to corporate, then what kind of salary is there in corporate in the beginning?  It seems that you get to work in smooth spaces, in air conditioned type and you get work from the front that brother, this is the work, you can do it and now you are working for some associates and some buddies and your life seems like it will be set.  This is suitable for those people who do not want to do any ground related work and who have to go into a salary bound thing. You will not get much change from normal corporate life. You will definitely get a salary in your life and so on.  Crowded space is also visible, it is fine to me and you should not have any such great promotions that if it costs so much in the beginning then it will cost you six times more, it should not be like this, it will run at one rate but yes, there is definitely safety security like that.  Even after sitting, I get the loan papers, just check them, is it okay or do I have this agreement or something like this, things are made as per the rules and regulations of the company, you get a low rate.  Jaga is very big and that too, it is not that you can operate everywhere, it is okay and the second one is the desire to become a judge, okay, here people are doing a lot of mess, I want to give a warning to all the law graduates that in the beginning  Do prepare to become a judge, but start your law practice. I will give you some practical advice. What is a judge? One who knows the law well and you know what a judge is, but if you have never practiced as a lawyer, you will never be able to do so.  You did not even stand, you do not know the procedure of the court, if you do not know many things then your chances of success are less. What are many things? Knowledge comes only by practicing because you are in theory. You started practicing Judiciary at the age of 22. Curry law and yours becomes 22. Law becomes at the age of 2, it is okay at the age of 22. At the age of 23, then you have prepared for it, you have prepared yourself 27  You are 28 years old, you have not done law for 5 years, you are not an advocate anywhere, if you had done law and actually practiced in these 5 years, then you are practicing law, so the same question is asked in that judiciary also.  You have to prepare for the exam, even if without that preparation, people will say no, no preparation, I would not be able to do that much if I practice there, because I agree, you are right, then in 2 years, whatever you study will be lost.  If you are doing it, then you can do that work in 4 years with practice, right brother, so much in 4 years of practice, if I don't do it for 2 years, then I can do it, I divided the time at 50, but I can learn things from my practice. I will take it, I will ask questions to other lawyers, oh man, how to do it, how it actually happens, that practical knowledge is also very important in the exam, those people also take the IAS papers. IRS was there for four years, it was an officer somewhere, it was somewhere in the government system, those things are understood, how are the rules and regulations, when you enter into that system, you know, this is a Patwari and then these are the lawmen.  Then it happens that it is a Tehsildar, first he becomes Naib Tehsildar, then Tehsildar, then the brother will be appointed as SDM, you automatically come to know about the problem, you understand the Panchayati Raj system, once you understand this then one You get practical knowledge about a portion of the exam and no one forgets it because after studying everything, you study and study and study and after studying, you are not even capable of earning a living. Brother, she is giving it, there is reservation, there is quota for the people, I don't know what the system is, we are left with number two, then we are left with number three, we are left with number four, then I want to tell you one more thing.  What will you do by becoming such a judge? Yes, what is the judge? You will find a home somewhere and then you will keep roaming in small districts. Some are going to Nu, some are going to Mewat. There will be posting here too. I am talking about Haryana, Haryana is one. Of the top states of the country and more than half of Delhi comes in NCR, I am not talking about the big state Maharashtra. If I say, then in Maharashtra you will find Mumbai, Pune Nagpur, not ahead, Pune Nagpur, I am talking about Maharashtra. How many districts are there? Later, later, yes, there is later too, Aurangabad, and more, and UP, should I ask? UP, Lucknow, Kanpur, Meerut, Ayodhya, tell me more, Varanasi, more, Bareilly, yes, yes, Amethi, Amethi, Rahul Gandhi's Amethi, tell me more districts, Robert Ganj, Mirzapur.  There are 80 districts, how many districts are there, where will you be posted, you will get power, you will have to sleep in the jungle, who has seen before whom people are getting power, you want that power.  Understand, those people who, if you are from a middle class family, my audience is lower class, not my audience, I am tired of telling you, what is my audience, I am tired of telling you, but still people, being in the lower class, automatically  Considering it to be middle class, they say no, we are not, hey brother, the lower class has to go, the lower class has to become a judge because they have got a lot of respect for so many years, neither have they got power nor have they got anything, it is good for you.  It will happen but if a person wants to live in a smooth place, earn money like that, get married like that and be a little urban, then that judiciary is not the place where you go, let anybody go and that, then don't write a comment that this is so.  This is how we earn, this is how we earn, how can no one earn, it is becoming tight, there are many agencies sitting on top, and India is becoming very tight, which is what you call corruption as n.  Have you seen the incentive that cannot be an incentive for next 40 years, you will be judged by 30 24 till 60 62 65 then it cannot be an incentive for you because India itself is changing and then if your big idiot gets cut then be very noisy.  According to me Judiciary is not something which you should start off at 23 24 25 Take a Call Understand  That law should penetrate into your soul's blood. It is a little okay. Third thing comes a lawyer who will practice under someone else and then he will say, bring tea, coffee, pick up the paper. Such work also has to be done, one has to work for six, seven, eight years. But I think it is better to do that work rather than preparing for Judiciary and not passing because by 28 29 30 you will become a man of your own, you will get a case, one or the other, a good one.  You have to work hard for five years in every profession. According to me, I will tell further also. Okay, in the fifth point verdict, I will tell what is my opinion. All the lawyers, whatever they are, tell as many children as they are, listen. These are the ways to know, but that's it.  I want to tell you that law is a very safe profession, no one dies of hunger, you, those notaries, those who give notaries, those who have rent agreements are also lawyers, don't they, they keep sitting like this, go outside to the courts.  So it's okay, so they keep sitting like this, right, they also earn 10, 12, 15 Hajj by sitting, yes, Son of So and So Lizzy and Lizard, yes, by doing thak thak thak like this, doing that, doing that quickly, the whole template is made for them.  Changing the name and surname, the affidavit turned out to be Chi Chi, you have to sign the affidavit, he is not doing anything, from somewhere you think that he is a lawyer, what does it mean to do law for him?  Yes, he is signing and he also earns money, but respect is not visible, people feel that oh man, some lawyer is spitting paanwa in his mouth and he is made like that and like that.  Now there are many sexy generation coming up, they don't want to become that, then friend, tell me one thing, what do they say about you, when Kesari, your Ajay Devgan and Shahrukh Khan are also doing it and that is surprise and  Surprise, Akshay Kumar has also come, so now don't look at these cycles, he too is coming, neither are he falling, nor are so many top stars coming, Zumba is money, brother, there is money, don't think too much about which one is this one.  Which one is this? You should not sit with him, you should not associate, you should not eat. Don't start doing that because ultimately you will rise. It is not necessary for you to be at the level of a notary and a voter. You can do it slowly, case by case.  You can become a very good lawyer. Lawyers are very powerful. Fifth point, sixth point, power and influence are very high. There is no respect in respect because there is nervousness, just as there is police, police are also nervous about the police. Where there is nervousness, respect is the default setting, it is stuck.  That genuine respect would be a half profession with difficulty, where it is in the heart and where that respect is, they are not getting respect, respect is in the heart, I am that.  I will also cover the profession, tell me which one it is, I will cover that too. I have a lot of respect in my heart, but he is not feeling respect because he is standing far away, it is okay, he has a lot of power influence. You must have seen top politicians whether they are from BJP or Congress.  The country has been governed by only these people so far. They are very powerful. You must have heard their names, that is, they have been ministers, even if they are living in Chidram. First of all, what is the point in even taking the name of Kapil Sibal? They are lawyers, whether your Ravi or not.  Shankar Prasad ji is the first, our late Sushma ji and Arun Jaitley, no one won that election, he also lost Amritsar but he was a very powerful figure in BJP for a very long time, very articulate lawyers, what is there at a stage? If you become a good one then according to me it is a blue ocean opportunity. I am saying blue ocean opportunity gal.  What does it mean to do, there is no competition here, I have to clear some exam that these five people will be able to clear, there is definitely an exam in Judiciary, but there is no one who would like to become a lawyer, brother, you become Chaudhary from Chhotu Ram College. Charan Singh University, you can go anywhere, there is a law college, no one can stop you from becoming a lawyer, you need a particular college, there can be trouble in not passing the exam.  If you are a lawyer, as I was telling many people, if you are doing a job, you are also doing a government job and those who are officers, they should do law, there is a lot of demand for young lawyers and this law is against them also because Your Articulation is Good Communication Skill is Good Personality is Good Wisdom is Good Now You Have Lobbyed Now Like Arbitration is Something Which is Catching Up in a Big Way But Lawyer  I have to become like now I am now there was a meaning I have become very busy because my work is very spread I do different types of work I do other wise I found that when I settle the family and I do this if  Had I been a lawyer, I would have got the stamp of a court as well as an arbitrator. Such types of real estate scams are prevalent among the builders and their common public that they take decisions in the courts and do arbitration. Because that problem will remain stuck in the court for 10 years, there is a great need of law qualified people here too. Law is I think a very important thing than investing in some B.Tech, P.Tech, which dozen lead you anywhere, it will really open your mind here. You will know the law. After knowing the law, it comes into your personality. You will know your rights. You will know everything. It is not allowed to be written on the vehicles like many people do. People write 'Gurjar Boy', 'Jat Boy', it's okay, doctor, journalist, they also write lawyers like this, it's okay, you must have seen that there is no loudspeaker on some vehicles, challan is issued, there is little difference in writing 'lawyer', I should not write it.  I am not teaching anything wrong here but I am telling you what is the thought process of a profession and there are lawyers like them now, I also give consultation to many lawyers because of them. Do so much of jobs like in real estate etc. I do n't give real estate on rent to real estate lawyers, people are nervous, as a result lawyer buys his house quickly, he does n't vet it, it's not SIP of mutual fund.  He used to say that I will live for 30 years and then I don't know if I will buy a house. He knows that I am not going to meet him. I will go and say that I am a lawyer, so this is a kind of dis. Now see how beautifully I age.  I am bringing the poet, is this a disadvantage? If you did not get anything, then you made your own arrangements, took money from father, took a loan, it was as if you took your own child, you took it yourself, this is a fact, I will tell you about girls because  I am also a marital counselor and I am the number one clarity giver in the country because I bring a 360 degree perspective. I will not just tell here and go on.  Let's talk about girls, girls will do law, now girls who are married to someone else are afraid of doing law because there is tension of section 498. Now a days, now she has become a lawyer herself, so she should not even hire anyone, this is the psychology.  There are issues but she will definitely get settled in a lawyer family, so if there are girls then by all means girls should become lawyers according to me and then they should become lawyers only like doctors girls.  Should you marry doctors, it is very beneficial because what is the matter, you will do very well. Just imagine, if you are a girl, a woman, you have become a lawyer, you are good, then you have to have children tomorrow, you have to raise children too, do not go to the court and stand in the sun.  It is possible but your husband is a lawyer so he will get a lot of work done by you, he will get the drafting done, he will get this done, both of you one and one become 11, you may not become 11 but you will become more than two, one and one you will definitely become three.  There is a family, the father-in-law is also a lawyer, the son is also a lawyer, the daughter-in-law is also a lawyer, the fun has come, the fun has come and your thought process should be like this from the beginning. All the lawyers are there and you are listening to me. Whatever difficulty you have faced in your law till date.  You can feed bread to your next generation. You know what I am saying, I will also give a verdict but here I am making a promise for the lawyers. If you are interested then please call on the number given below.  You write as a lawyer on how you can create your brand image individually. Those who are working in corporate will not be included here. The jolly LLB types here will tell you how you can increase your income by creating your brand using social media.  For that, if you want to join because I give this in private consultation, but today I want to reach out to maximum people in one go through video, come and listen, you are a lawyer, how do you know?  If you want to use it then please, if you are still watching, you are a lawyer and you want to use it, your income is Rs 50000, Rs 2 lakh, Rs 2 lakh, you want to increase it, then please write to me as a lawyer on the number given below. To give a verdict, I will tell you one thing, as India is becoming a more educated country, awareness of rights is increasing, businesses are expanding and contracts are being made in India.  It is becoming very difficult to implement, I mean because the law is like this or there are issues in contract implementation, basically litigation is increasing in India, if nothing else then you know that brother, divorce cases are increasing only, so if you are a woman and  What is safest for you is not even known in law, what are the different specializations, someone will become expert in how to deal with divorce, someone will become expert in getting compensation.  In this case, it will be a real one, it will be a consumer case, it will be a murder case, and someone with such a case will be a completely different meaning, it will be a corporate one, so in this, you have to take specialty in it, like in case of husband and wife, I tell the combination of doctors, wife is a gynecologist and husband.  Paidit is that the child is born from here, the child is here for the next three to four years, there is a lot of this in law too, so you like, if the husband is the wife, then the wife has caught her divorced person.  Husband caught hold of his other one, both of them are lawyers, they can also help each other, it is a blue ocean opportunity, according to me, people should do it, there is no time wastage in it and it is not such a study that if done, nothing is wasted, what do you mean?  Even if you have not practiced law much, you are a woman, like women study a lot, it is fine and do nothing for it, then after that it is fine, but there is no use of that study because I had done B.Sc., B.Tech. etc.  It is better to be a lawyer housewife than her and sitting like a housewife. At least you can spread awareness and join an NGO. There are many things in which you do not practice law but you need a law degree. Like if you are in an NGO then you have women's rights.  If you want to teach someone how to do something, then brother, you go there, it will cost you Rs 50,60,700 thousand, you are coming for two-three hours, you have to go, if you want to go for four days, then Datchi because if you have studied and explained the law of India, you know the law then you are an aware citizen, on top of that no one can come and fool you like this, neither a policeman nor any other person. If you also know your rights then according to me it is great.  Is it a safe profession in today's times and what is less in quantity? There are 140 crore people. If you look at the number of lawyers per 1 lakh population then it is relatively less and if you follow in America. Do it like they have a serial, Suits, you watch it, you know the good method and what is so hard about it, what is there in a law lawyer, even if you are not very smart, you still have references, you should know what the work is.  Where are the things that you can become good and the last thing is that no matter what is the impression of the lawyers but if you want to serve the society then I think the lawyer has the most direct connection by filing a PIL, he can directly file a lawyer. is public  Interest Litigation: Although many people are very politically motivated, this and that question also gets resolved in the courts very quickly, but if someone is not politically motivated and you genuinely want to help some section of the poor in the society, then you will also be a very popular person.  You can become one. I have seen many lawyers who go to areas where there are slums and poor people. Took some fees like 500 rupees, that too for paper work etc., clubbed whatever issues were going on, fought a case against them and became quite popular with them, later on became a politician, earned respect from those people too, earned a lot of money as well.  What happens is that even if you earn Rs 00 from lakh people, you become Rs 1 crore. It is not necessary that you have to earn lakh rupees from 100 people, that means multiply 100 by lakh to get lakh. Do it from 100, if only that number of answers comes, then there are lot of mechanisms, then you can teach law, then you can give consultation even if you do not do direct cases in law, because you know the law, then you can help someone like you, a real person,  Enter the estate and grab the builder buyer agreement as you are, refunds are not being done at many places, some issues are not happening like this, is anyone facing any problem? Blue Ocean has specialized there.  There is an opportunity according to me, so if you are not able to understand what to do after 10th and 11th, then I thought, when you are not able to understand, you have to do something, look brother, if you are very clear, then I want to become a doctor.  So, if you want to become an engineer, I am the same brother, if you want to become an IAS, you can also do law. You can also do lawyer. Law is a degree, whatever is left from that degree is fine.  The work of degrees is normal where there is no specific work, so you can do it, you can give any government exam, you can give any government post, you can give any government post, that is a facility for you, it is of Judiciary.  You can also give the exam, plus you can sit anywhere and become an advocate by taking your license and practicing law. If you take a license from outside, then according to me it is quite safe. And how did you like the video? Firstly, this is  It is okay to tell that people judge a little, it is okay to be afraid and do not give respect to others from the heart, everyone says that the lawyer is very sharp, he is very sharp, this is the lawyer brother, he is very sharp, so being very sharp is not a negative thing according to me.  If the society thinks you are smart then it is good, that is, it is better than a fool than a scoundrel, right? And do n't we need lawyers? Don't we need lawyers? When some scandal happens in real life, then what is the point of standing up?  You don't need anything for this. Reputation comes from word of mouth. I am saying it again and again. If you are a good person then you will also become a very good lawyer. You will be genuine, you will stand with the truth, you will take good cases and you will also have some passion inside you. And India needs good lawyers, so that means not those who do networking and jugaad, but those who are good at heart, according to me, they are needed and like many people do not want to go into politics, they think that only a few lawyers are needed.  It is the same work, friend, I don't know what will have to be done, it is like this, this is also your advantage because people do not come in it like what is a normal man in politics, he will not want to come in politics, if a different kind of man comes in politics then he is a normal man.  If they don't come, then they have got a free run. The day an educated, intelligent and sensible person comes into politics, many people will die like this because by the will of the people, hey brother, this too has come, it is okay, the same is the law, many people like this are old.  This way  I am convinced that if a new fresh lot comes then it will attract more clients and more public and there is a need for those people. I am seeing a good opportunity. I normally do not recommend any strong profession like I told about doctors, so I included in that.  Told that my friend is in it because I want to avoid struggle in life. Where people's chances are only half, one or two percent, why are you taking chances in becoming a lawyer?  At 90, if you decide that you want to become one, then at 90, at 95, you will become. Now that good bad, next time will tell how you become, but you want to become a doctor, what is the desire, the exam is not going to be passed and then that.  I have to spend Rs. 1.5 crores and 1.25 crores, I don't have father's money, so it becomes tricky, so I tell all the professionals. If you like this series, then please support me. Tell me how should I take this series further and subscribe to the channel if you haven't done so yet and lawyers, if you want to increase your income then I will do a workshop on it and will tell you the tricks of the trade. You are more than intelligent anyway.  A wise person needs a hint. If some of you are geniuses, then in less than a hint you will understand that if you are Shane Lauer, then how many people know you. Remember in life, how many people know you. Is More Important Than How Many People You Know Nothing To Do With Lawyer Much More Important Than How Many People You Know You May Know Five People But If 50 Lakhs Know You You Will  Do Well in Life So Use What I Tell You I Don't Do Any Time Passing Workshops I Tell You Exactly What Is To Be Done So Join Thank You Very Much"

    "content": "Hello friends, today's topic is job videos, I have shared them, first there was the lion of the zoo, then there was the lion of the circus, today we will talk about the lion of the jungle, do you want to become a lion of the jungle, okay, then for this there will be some attributes and some qualifications. And it is not very easy to become everyone. By lion of the jungle I mean someone who waxes up whenever date person has you up nobody tells in what to do when to do your  Hunts his life accordingly Lives his life This is not the first of all And it is happening Come 22 years of ahead You will have you go through the role of life Okay and Sam struggles Does n't happen on the first day If you are my  A little bit of the videos directly which I don't tell but my push is there if you watch it but you know we are in a situation where double income has to happen Vikram Singh Necessary double income i.e. husband and  Wife earning both earning money, now how many army are there from the people's will, this is the need that when you are earning well and by earning well, you will be free from the job, then the wife who is less than a stepney, you will give her four tires only.  The comment itself is fine but it is there and those whose wives have done or are doing jobs, if no one came and told them that their husbands can become lions of the jungle, then their expenses got reduced anyway.  Well, if they don't do anything then I will not discuss it because I will not make you even a little bored on Clarity for Youth, here I will tell you a simple thing that you need to do to become a lion of the jungle and it's prediction also I am doing.  For one people and you will be releasing next 30 years where will be maximum jungle ka sher only this cooperation and they will get this job 5000  Employees: 10 thousand employees, all of them will gradually become one 10 employees, each person will work differently and his work will be added, meaning it is something like today, what is happening, there is one man in this company, he works for 2 hours, 4 hours.  It is his day's work but he is an employee, you have kept him for the whole week as well as the month, he also needs security like this and you also have to rub him but the money is going more but he too.  If you want to keep it, then it will become less tomorrow, your projects will be wasted, if this is less then how can you do it from somewhere else, it is so less, you will get so much money, you can pick it from less than 10 places, now there will be no more hire and fire system, this provident fund, then give insurance.  Then give security and gradually the government is very protective, it has imposed such laws, labor laws, so basically wherever the economy is tainted, it will do the same thing as before.  Something like you don't employ plumber you don't employ again and again you don't say someone like electrician comes when needed he does as many houses as needed he has his number he goes does his own a goes this it d  If you give an order of D then start acquiring skills like this because if the skills are like this, if you have to leave on Monday, then it will also come out like this, then when you leave, the receptionist is sitting and will make you sit like this.  The one who speaks a little more English better or looks more buttery, if you seat him, then stop doing this Monday in these jobs. If you are in it for the wet version, now you have got it now, many people will not be left out now, it will be very.  The key to being alive is that we have to do less in life which we can do alone, we can do it as per our own and add value and only then you will go into such a state that when no one tells you what to do, then only that.  Actually Rich Will Be Full Because What's Happening I Will Tell You Right Now As long as you keep selling your time to him and create some small business or some equity in this business you will never become rich like a lawyer or doctor.  And architects will never ever become rich and they keep charging for any case because they are steel selling date time, they don't have to give time for consultation unless  You don't do something like this, you grow up and you are sleeping and you are living like this, till then you cannot go to the point of becoming a lion of the jungle, like if a doctor pays a thousand rupees for seeing one patient and sees 10 patients.  So a person earns ₹ 10000 or ₹ 15, let's see, he has a job somewhere, there is a person earning two to four lakhs, there is a man earning five to six lakhs, he is a pilot, he goes and flies planes, his salary is seven to eight lakhs, but he has a system on an hourly basis. so many hands  This much will be added, his job is not welcome ever, there are 50 lakh persons, this spy, seven necks, looks very nice but he is not a lion of the jungle, this is also only a share of the circus, okay, then he will have to take freedom from this thing, what about the people now?  It is happening, people want to bid pearl of their time, they want you to succeed, when the next time, when you say date, you want to promote, Namaste people will do it, money will increase.  Because you get so much money on this post, you get so much money on this post, but the thing is that it has a cap, no matter how many times you are doing one less thing, more of your time and energy and brain juice will be spent on the posts here.  Will come and you will get responsibility and your free time will be reduced and that free time which is in your early 20s is the same which is establishing you that now there will be less skill set or save brain juice so that you can get freedom from this thing.  Jaaye it is something like I will tell you Now you are running on the treadmill You are running on punch campier pe punch game pe Jab bhagne chali re to chal chal re to you can listen to the song You can understand the song too You are watching the news If you are listening then you are also watching the cricket match score. You are live in this situation. It is okay. You are also thinking about something. Your brain is still sucking. It is okay but you are running fast on the same treadmill. want to drive away  Now you have become eight, then 10. Campus 12, 13, 14. You can't divert your attention anywhere in the camp, because at one step your mouth bursts and you have increased your capacity within you. You are very happy that Bhagat was there on the first punch. 14th part.  I am still an achievement but now you have to chase him away at 14, aap aap aap it is like riding or tiger ek hota khud share banna aur ek hota hai like riding un lion ab What is the problem in riding shares? It is fun that I am riding a lion but ca n't get down, can't stop. Late, late, late, late in marriage, late in buying a house, doing all these things and becoming happy by living in this SAP mutual fund.  That I have collected 2 lakh 10 lakhs, I cannot get more freedom than this, I want to get married soon, good life partner, no money should be wasted in marriage, life partner is also working, already bought the house, the house is loan free.  In 32 33 34 35 36 37 years, took another one, took a rental, did all these programs, and the wife also raised some children, the children also grew up, the wife now has time to earn more money and her concentration.  You supported my wife the whole time because you knew that by taking freedom from this job, I would become a lion of the jungle and you supported me even thinking that I would get a promotion.  No, I do n't want to do well in the job. What a mess the husband is doing. 27 28 30 32 32 35 year old husband who does n't know about his job. In the job, the ring master is standing there to get your juice out. When he hits the code, you are the wife. You tell him, you see, because now she is doing a job, she would like to run the house too, brother, you also do something, I will not do anything because he is beating me, I have to do well here, decide at the same time, every man.  Who  I have decided that if something happens, I lose my job, I lose my promotion, I have to eat on the streets every day, I will get my wife's job done and see, every girl, every wife in India today is capable of morning love and doing her job, it is just a date husband.  Support D Fast Dajan Support D Mother of D Girl Dajan Support Even after having a child, she goes to work in America within a week, all that is there too, there is a Naripatta for her. And they don't have any system, neither does their mother-in-law, daughter-in-law have anything, nor does their mother have anything. If you can do it, then I am revealing the biggest secret to you. The biggest secret of becoming a lion of the jungle is that your wife is less.  She should be a doer and the one whose wife is a doer of [ __ ] leaves him and then does something and then tells very openly that I have left, I have done it like this. Follow me do this just like all the people who have left their jobs.  in their life You will find a common pattern, you will find their wife to be a money earner, this common pattern will be found, there is a very less percentage where the wife was idle, was a housewife, did not do anything, the children have also grown up, then maybe there may be support from parents without much support.  There are a lot of YouTubers, so this is very easy, just by typing 'Mol Metro', you will get a job like this, the job is already there, don't give up, yes, even by mistake, it is okay to be humiliated, it is okay to die of hunger, it is okay to remember.  There is no need to become a Pushpa. To become a Pushpa everywhere, there is no need for meanness. Some people are of lesser importance, it is okay for her that I will do it like this, and what was the biggest thing in Pushpa too, it is okay for her too, when  There will be a marriage and it was happening in fact, so see how it had become in the same movie. If it is okay then it is given realistically in life. I am giving advice like a down to earth leader. I say this again and again because it is something.  Understand things, work in English, become a super specialty, and on top of that, go away after making a video and feel that yes, it is okay, but if it could not touch your life, then the biggest secret you all learned is in your relatives, in your friend circle, in your colleague circle, in the group. Look at those who have achieved freedom, did their wives do less? If the wife did not do less, then perhaps their parents were rich or they might have got something. Such brothers, no one has the courage. This is also true and if you have  If I don't have the strength, then find the journey, let us take the journey, brother of self-esteem, if it does n't happen to us, Thakur, he did it to us, so it doesn't happen to us, and don't be like every gamut, let's collect chances and mind, maybe it was his fate, maybe it was Shayna, maybe he  This is the knowledge of Amit Sangwan that I am giving you in the knowledge that maybe someone had given him the war to all the people and he knew about it, today you have come to know, you know what you have to do, your madam is sitting, don't you have to speak?  If you want your husband to become a lion of the jungle, then you will become a lioness, as it is a practical thing in life, if you want to become a king, then life will have to make your wife a queen. If you want to become a king, then you will have to make your wife a queen. You understand what I am saying. Like everyone, that is according to the quarrel.  Guruji no, did you make your house a heaven? You have made your house a heaven. Will your wife be on the table because of the table? Smiling brothers and being romantic, giving flowers, mummy.  You are torturing your wife by doing such products, you will have to go through me, make it seem filmy, your mother, before saying anything to her, you will have to go through me, it will not serve you, the registry of your plot is mine, I am your plot, I have to make you a destination.  If you have it, then make it on me, this is an independent plot and the registry of this plot is mine and I will speak in it like this, when you say, neither she who will stand behind nor she will change the world, she will change your world, she will make you whatever you want to be.  Respect vices, while the society is facing inflation, the government is on YouTube, this secret has been told to the world, yours will continue like this, alas, the wife is working, money is running low, she will not let you die of hunger, the school fees will go away, the house, you have already made everything.  Something has happened, grinding is slow, friend, I will not become hungry, friend, I will take less now, I am living separately, I have no money left to pay tax, friend, I will do this much and after that I will come and give the world  I would say that the truth should be told, the limits of responsibility, parents etc. are normal and parents and not rich and wife and not working and he is just left. If someone has become one half then the first thing I say is no, if it is neither then it is not to leave.  Will give, then you don't let me leave, this is also a story of ghosts, brother, we are grinding, you don't let me leave, do less than your wife, only then will you get freedom, your wife will also get it, you will also enjoy and Mian.  There is a different pleasure in the little things that your wife does together. Maybe you have taught your wife some such small business, it is okay to do anything in which she is doing, then she needs energy, man and time to go on a stage, she is good in creativity. 12 hours of fighting life does not come out in the veins of the body, it will be spent in creativity. Keep your husband on a job. Keep your husband on a job. Tell your husband, why do you listen to your boss today? I am your boss, if you don't like me.  So equity etc., whatever you do together, when your husband and wife work together and earn money, the quality of married life increases 100 times. Happiness comes whenever your wife and husband do anything together, if you give meaning, because look what you wife and wife have done together.  May we meet a good one, may we give birth to beautiful, wonderful, happy children. Whenever we meet, there is always something good in any sense. It can never be bad. Let us meet you immediately. I am the sweet ghat of sherbets.  Water is the water of sweet ghats and the color of sherbets, both have to meet only then you will become a lion of the jungle. Respect and vice will give you the knowledge of the world. She will try. Today I have given out the secret. After today I want to do some jungle lions. I can make you sick, right?  I can tell, I can do pet consultation, I have liked it, there are its methods for you guys and there are more, it gets old in 17-18 minutes but now UK imagine because it starts from here because if this  Is not dan you forget it kitna gyaan le lo kitne padh lo kuch kar lo you can jam from other web time [music] banayenge ok thank you"

    "title": "Do You Want To Increase Your Productivity ？ [Poq2lNMbuj8].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, do you want to increase your productivity? I am telling you about this for the people who are in 20. There is a YouTube channel named Ankur Badi which is very popular. I recently saw a productivity video released by him. I have my opinion on it because 27. He has lakhs of subscribers, I am feeling that according to me, he has given a very wrong message, so I am telling him by keeping an eye on him, I am not criticizing him, okay, many people are there, no, you tell yours, it does not happen like this, there is a discussion,  The topic is that if a big influencer says something on a big level, I am going to tell you at what level it is wrong and why it is wrong, listen, whenever there is a big influencer, it is requested that how is his life going and at what point is he saying  But what are you doing, tell that name because the audience that is listening is not even close to that, for your productivity you told 10-12 points out of which you want the public to download 56, basically that sir game is of that person only  if yes then that would be one  No, my ads don't come, I do it like this, this is wrong in that it means that you should not put up after up to monitor productivity, the problem is that the youth actually does not have any major work. So he does not need to be productive and do all this, he needs to idiot, secondly he needs to sleep, thirdly he needs to see that he has to go and if he needs to go somewhere, then  Everything can be dropped and he should catch it, then its scheduled video people went to get water because you are young at the age of 24 you do not have to go into any discipline in terms of this scheduling, these officers, businessmen, entrepreneurs who have reached that level whose  All that work and time should be donated to those who are rich, may God bless you to reach the point in your life where all these productivity hacks are a must, you must try this, it is a bit of second and third order thinking  try to understand what i am saying sometimes this is happening here  I'm saying that when you're 23 24 then be alive you have the possibilities just be show date I have to go do something 14 15 16 hours to reach the story tux figure out something which is earning earning ability establish cash flow that if your scheduling  I became dependent on him because papa had told me to go here to pay the bill, mummy had told me to take father along, he had said this and I made a good schedule that you are not going to the story, in the middle of all this if you get a chance to meet the matter  If any lecture goes by, or any webinar goes by, or someone is giving you knowledge, or any situation goes by, or if you get an opportunity, then everything should be dropped, you should not be speaking and restricting yourself because whatever it is, whatever knowledge you have, you have this  Look sir it is cut copy paste of the world, bluntly big youtubers will say that you are doing this, you are doing this, mostly you should check those which are in English  There are books which our Indians do not have time to read, by doing it in Hindi, by joining one time, that history is being told through the story, the original thought process which is applicable to India, applicable to Indians, applicable to Indians, our ecosystem and situation  It is not being told in a categorical manner and the youth who actually does not have any guidance, today a boy of 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26 years of age likes it but brother, will it increase productivity, what will it increase by doing this?  This is happening, my studies are done, I don't need to study again, now I have put these small things in it, okay, put this on the computer, put these correct views, do something, do this, oh brother, that gives more stress in life Look, the thing that I remember is important, the one that I have forgotten but it is very important, someone else will remind me, the thing that neither I remember in life nor does anyone else remind me of, is so important  It is not even important because it will go bad, if it is something important, you can do it like this everywhere, people keep a to do list, it never ends in life and the story does not reach, after writing 20 and then 18 cats  Then it made it 25, then it gives the satisfaction in the short term that you are doing something, but even without doing these 18 things, maybe one thing, maybe that one number, maybe that one person with whom you can talk, you can create a network, some opportunity comes  You have a story, child power, this is D message, don't stress yourself, you match, this because I am a youngster, many times when there is a consultation, sometimes a conversation, when I go to meet relatives, then you speak directly because what do you say, show me the phone, show me the big ones  These are good phones, do it like this, 140 up, this up is for controlling this up, this is for doing that, this is for this one, this is for this one and this one color, this is for doing all this, a small diary.  You can also note that your  Was the money asked about the accounts of these people, they have nothing in 20 years, they have only 2.5 lakh in demat, two-four CPs, they have a little money, it is nothing, your syllabus is all about productivity and all this  It is definitely needed when you go to your Fortis and you have reached a certain point there, otherwise it is not needed there either, then this productivity is very much overrated and don't get bogged down in it, you just look at it like where are you  R reaching and see in every math, there should be a direction from you that I have to reach here, am I reaching here, don't micro manage it so much and don't micro manage your life because if you have made some schedule and you fall asleep in the afternoon then  Maybe it is butter, what do they do in motivation that I am in India day after tomorrow, I am feeling tired but I have to win a medal, then how are you living in middle, as many medals as you want, then are you in date, are you like date, why do you take any example of someone's life  Do n't take the example of politician or film star or India the day after tomorrow Neither the YouTuber nor your life is completely different from that story of someone 's life, it cannot motivate anyone, this is the truth, whenever you take an example, I do it like this, I do it like this, hey, I also do a lot of things like this, but my life is like this  -by doing this my life situation is so different that there is no point in giving you knowledge and it takes time to make effort to get rich from date stage and everybody has to go through date stage so 20% of this is brain storming at that time but interesting with mentors  Interactive intelligent people having intelligent friends not wasting time and having an attainable goal attainable gold this is very very important otherwise it itself will not reach you people like this cooker buland this story will not reach you people so next time whenever you make an schedule make it very loose key  Yes, roughly I do this mostly in the afternoon or in the morning when I feel like doing this I do this. It is very loose. Don't live life like a robot that I wake up like this in the morning and then I do it like this.  This is how I do it, take it, it will be done friend, what a life it is, I mean everything is under remote control, I am underweight, I have to work hard, take care of my health and keep doing something, don't micromax it too much, this is my personal research, IT  Work and those who nurture this knowledge also tell them only that CCTV cameras will not be installed near them, in fact they have to be kept in such a Sufi way, now what is the problem that if someone has reached then the person says that now friend he has reached here  If you go then you must be thinking about his life, it is not like that, many people's lives have been very right filed, but only this is visible and whatever is told in between is visible, I hope you people got a different perspective and in this way, I think you are a  This is a trap of this video and you will not put any knowledge in it and I am again, this is not to condemn the making of this, but a lot of superficial content is being made, the story is not being recognized, the story is not being recognized, practical and note things which  Practical and durable and understandable thank you"

    "title": "Do You Want To Know Secret Formula For Success ？ [7HgMNh76iDg].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, in this I will tell you all a secret regarding success and if you know this then you will get a lot of clarity. Normally I never give personal examples in this, but in this I will also give you a little personal example so that it will be easy to prove. So the secret of success is that many people are motivated, many people are coaching, many people are like this, if you look left and right and look on social media, we find very successful people. Okay, but no one is going to tell this secret which I am going to tell you and its secret is this thing, there is no secret of success, what is the reason, even the one who is successful does not know, I will tell you under some examples, okay Surya Apni Yadav ji  It is Suryakant Yadav ji, it is sky speaking, how he plays, how he throws for success, it is inherent inside the animal's body, it has some advantages, I will now tell many people about IAS coaching.  This is how you become, whoever tells the story, someone did this, I did this, I did that, thousands of people are doing it, it is not happening because even the person who is being created doesn't know, this is what I want to tell because so many factors are at play.  We are making out that even if a person becomes successful, he cannot analyze it correctly, so there is definitely a recipe, the reason behind people's cut and copy pasting of finding a successful formula. Do your own interpretation in the successful life of the people.  Your interpretation will be done by the people who themselves have achieved success in something, they don't know and I will tell you one thing about me, I will be a little curious, you guys are okay, I will tell you with my example and but what happens when you put a mike and ask? I don't know how the man should say, it is a very rare case, if everyone speaks then he will say region, no one can tell because region is a tribute, I used to wake up in the morning like this or I used to sleep late at night or I used to make notes like this.  It was like this, how many combinations can you take? Lakhs of people are already doing that combination in their life, so why is it not successful? If an actor's voice comes out in some way, it comes out only that, what that comes out, that is just the frequency, people like it. So, when you believe in this belief system that I am telling you, when realization comes in your belief system, then your chances of success will increase because then you are not going to do anything, you are just going to do things.  Instead of copying from side to side, you are in a process. Go away, come with my one take. Now I will also tell you my example that you have a process in your hands, do the process, read something, if you are a student, if you are a business person, then a business job is a process.  You have to follow that process, keep doing it, keep doing it, keep doing it, keep doing it, keep it consistent, so those are the factors which you do not understand and which lead to success, I will tell you through my another personal example.  There is a channel, I think many of the subscribers here should also subscribe to that channel. If you are not its subscriber then the request is to subscribe to that and if you do n't have this then do this and for both of them then do both. Okay Sangola this sutra.  You my YouTube journey, I have been on YouTube journey, I was there for 2 years, in 2 years I used to upload a lot of videos, I used to upload them in the same style, I used to upload very good videos in my life.  Pay and subscribe to his channel was increasing, it was fine, it was increasing, it was increasing, my subscribers are more in two years, my subscribers have been increasing in 2 years, my subscribers have increased 3 times in just 25 days, now someone say something in this, brother.  How did this happen, brother, I don't even know, did I give a very high quality video, did I get any injection, did I get a consultation consultant, magical type or someone, did I run Ad Run?  Did it or by running Google Ad, I did not separate anything, I still haven't done the infection, that means it has been added to it and you have something in front of me, I am telling this but I had my process that I will also come, I will make videos for my 700 video channel.  Pay 7075, I have to come on this channel also, I have to tell some small thing which adds value to the listener. There are very good comments on that channel also. There are very good comments on this channel too. People are saying that I am very happy.  You talk about what we can understand and I have not been able to get contact on the other channels since the beginning, Rakhi, but it is not that I did anything suddenly, I am embarrassed myself, I can only say that I am pleasantly surprised, I am happy.  Your brother will only consider it a success. The number of subscribers increased by a person after making a video for 2 years increased by 3 times in 20 to 25 days. That's when I discovered this thing. I also did other research.  I keep thinking that if I stop making videos then I stop making videos or I think man, this is just growing so much, it's a very slow pace, I had to go so fast, this is what people do, people get fed up of process  Because that big routine is less, come make a video, you run out of history, it is okay, to make 700 videos, you also need 700 history and you have to be ad, because it is okay for people to like it, otherwise the channel will definitely go.  Today I want to tell you from a personal example, I don't know anything brother and honestly there are no people who can tell you this because if you become a man or someone and someone tells you that the reason for your success is the first thing that you have become like by taking reservation.  Someone told me that if I had not actually had a reservation, I would not have made it, so I got the benefit of reservation, no one would talk, everyone would say, everyone would tell their story, how much trouble I had, how would I wake up in the morning.  How would my father carry it? Keep your Sonia in front. There are some actors, some are successful in something and the sportsmen who are successful, they do n't know their name. I will link up to this one, who is my mental model of swimmer's body illusion.  Also, because the swimmer's body is the same, that is why he is a good swimmer, he is a good swimmer, that is why if his body is not formed then what happens to us many times, many things happen, what do we have to do, we have to reduce our lot a little.  Do different things and keep doing them consistently, keep doing them, keep waiting for growth at the same time, Charlie Magar told us a phenomenon in this and told us that after doing Lola Police effect, you Google when what is it that you are doing one thing and then something else.  The factors should also be lined up in a line, then one plus one plus one is not three, it becomes a punch, it becomes 6, which means that the value of this individual factor was one, you are uniting this factor.  There was one and this normally should have become three, the 3:00 to 5:00 became six, this happens in life, but in this, if this fact was in my hands, then this factor was there, now this factor has also been added, this should also be added.  I don't actually know how it got added, what happened, but it does happen, but the most important thing is that I keep doing something consistently because if someone else doesn't do something then nothing can happen.  There is an exam question and you don't know the answer very well but you attempted it. The writing was good. If you had written something then perhaps the teacher would have given one or two marks out of the punch. But if you leave it black then no one will notice you.  If you understand that I can't pass, then what is there in life to do something? Now after that, brother, I got number A. I used to work hard like this, used to work like this, look at it, a person goes away after studying so much and after studying so much. Everything has been learned from this very beginning, read it more so that it can be asked from this, but what always happens is that luck is like this, someone has read only this much and mostly what about this because out of what he had to read so much, he has learned so much.  Read, more came out of that and some brother had read more than that, but it does not exceed the threshold, meaning if it was total then this brother read this much and came out of this much and this one read more than this but only this much came out of this. Confused in I Hope  You are not able to understand, I don't understand like this by drawing any diagram and everything, I believe that my audience will understand this, so to be successful you just have to do it, don't look for formulas and because the world said, he himself does not know what anyone is feeling. Many times, what happens is that someone is preparing such a dish, it is like making Golgappa water, it is like he makes it with some kind of chemical formula, something like that is not that much, he gets success and goes away crying on behalf of someone. Chutney chat is what makes the world, how did that one get its name, we make it very well, very good, why do you make it, our formula is yes, it is a secret formula, we will not tell mom, the things to say in our house, to say all that. This is what I want to tell you and if you will learn this science then there are many people who are saying that I have formulas and are selling formulas, all these coaching people, hey brother, if you know how to make people like this then  brother you  Why don't you become a simple question, give me a simple answer, or whoever is sharing knowledge with anyone, it is okay that I will make you this by coaching you, then brother, why don't you become like the coaches who coach all the athletes.  It is important that he has performed better than that, many times you must have seen that he had got a date versus claim, he earned a lot of money, did not score runs, but he did well on the coach because there are other factors in it. Very the end and also boat something, so what happens sometimes is the Lola Plus effect that these other factors are right, now they said that their coaching was good, whose coaching was good, whose now Sachin ji is the best batsman in the world, but the captain is not good.  You could do it only when you became captain and when you left it, you also set it. Okay, if you don't know then there are many things which you cannot tell, behind these formulas, don't send them. My advice is that you should discuss your process and  Keep doing date process and where something will work for you I will not say it is luck also because luck ko bol denge to then people sab lag bharose jayega and that dress was found and something good happened so this is my secret I can Say for success there is no secret it just happens and it happens for people who are doing something so the most important thing is that brother  Keep doing something for 10, 12, 14 hours a day. Keep doing different things. If you can't do one thing, if you can't do one thing for more than seven-eight hours, then do one hour for two. What is the reason behind doing this, so that the tax remains high?  They are doing this to reduce some benefit. This has also happened with many people. You will hear the story of many people and they can't actually know why that happened but they are doing this. I hope I have not. Confused people, this was my attempt to tell you that do not read anyone's biography, who was born when, how, what were the circumstances of whose life, what was the accounting book, all the things can never be brought out and date the person himself.  Even he doesn't know, it's okay, this is forced motivation, people have made something up, what was someone's life story completely actual, no one knows what it was and what is shown is not that.  You know, focus on your own life and stop doing motivation completely. If you want to learn, then let me teach you clarity in things. The name of Thought's channel is Clarity for you. I don't give motivation, I want you to give clarity because once in a lifetime, clarity.  If he goes then once the wiper of your car becomes like this, it is raining from above, then he is not giving motivation, he is cleaning it if there is water so that he does not come forward.  You can drive no matter how much motivation you give. It is raining and the wipers are not reducing. How much motivation do you have? You cannot drive safely. You do not need motivation. You need clarity. If it is too much then your fog lamps are on. And why should he [ __ ] it and if you can see something then the car will move ahead, if you are so motivated, it has no meaning. If you have to go to the bathroom in the dark at night, at some other place in your house, then everyone goes in the dark too.  If you have to go somewhere in the dark, you cannot see anything in the new place, then you will need clarity of light, otherwise no matter how motivated you are, if you cannot go, then my request secret is this, there is no motivation, don't try, follow others.  Big Success Every Big Success Extremely Unique Likes and Thumb Prints Sometimes you can copy someone's thumb print, you can't copy everyone's when that success will happen to you wherever you are.  Doing Reasons That Will Be You Need You Don't Try But Failure Is Something Which You Can Learn People do everything the wrong way by looking at the songs with failure, otherwise why is there a failure, how did it happen, what happened is not discussed because it can be checked in a more tangible way.  There are too many factors in success, there are 100 factors in being successful, think of it, there are only three or four factors in failure and if you avoid them, then you will probably be saved from failure and those factors are less.  I will discuss K20 in more detail some other time and will teach you on this. I have understood it very well and there are 100 facts in success, only 10 are in your hands, 90 are in your hands. Why are they coming? How are they coming? Is it under your control? If you can do something then concentrate on your 10 factors behind it. They will come 90 at a time. They will come gradually. I hope you will like the video.  There are some deep videos, if it is a little difficult to understand, then please write the difficulty and those who have understood, please write like this, we will show 15-20 in the comment section, A content creator, I will enjoy, not like this.  You will feel that friend, I don't know what I am thinking and no one is able to understand, it is okay if you see everyone found it difficult and did not understand then I will try, you know what and hard work is okay because these are abstract topics, cut copy paste topics.  It is not stolen knowledge from any book, it is not stolen knowledge from any other content creator, it is an original thought process and you may not have even heard of this thing before which I have told you because it is a counter narrative.  The belief system that has been taught to you and explained to you is different from the one that you have had for so many years, so it takes a little effort to understand and sometimes it does not work in your mind, it is nonsense, okay, the old belief system is a habit, it takes effort to change the thought process.  If you understand then please keep it. Thank you."

    "content": "Hello friends, today's topic for tempered glass is on the topic that if you are not getting the job of your choice or you are not able to work with something so called fashion, it is difficult in life. It is often said that fashion is  But this pattern is fine, it is said a lot that due to this the youth are getting very confused and running away from jobs, so I will tell you my take on this. Is it okay with you guys? The question is nothing but a strong feeling and  Feeling to change is just because of you, you are getting money today, I am also not the pension for tomorrow, this is effective life lock, second thing is you have to work Pawan Shiv Villain Shwetlana only you will meet people in this you will learn new things and  Which was your money, so good money, in demand in subscribe market, networking and working on scientific money only want to give back to power in later life and time but you can work  For Your Passion With Them Money Is The Account You Have A Home To Stair Car Basic Everything Stupid Boys Club Screen Less Fuel Normally Text Sure Investment This Is Very Foolish By Motivational Guru First thing is stop the motivation and get ground in life  How long have you been focused on the same [music] in Chittor's house, if the household work is done at all by the Sangh, then it feels very good.  It is very apparent love love love love all of you but they sit like at home neither is anyone doing a job nor do this work at home, this someone has also brought this subscribe and by taking a job you can stand on your feet and invest 2540  Live with but he takes questions, let's see 40 of us, 25, is doing such a thing that he manages his expenses in Rs 15,000 and after pregnancy. My brothers, if you turn 40 then only it will be meaningful, sometimes with a smile, sometimes with a 120 because it took 5 years to update the juice that I will make Lal a superhit, so he shot me with 5 years of experience, made me an apprentice, shot me with a networking site, made me Dhruv.  So much of possibilities for junior home I am Singh Dashrath A high percentage sitting at home To unemployment figures come that those who want to work and those who do not have a job  If you want to do a base line job, then you also have a son, I will not slow him down at all, that job has increased, the unemployment rate has decreased, the unemployment rate has decreased here, the people are the ones who want to increase improvement, then they have to increase improvement and this means a job with dimples, so first if  You people were looking for a job and 20 people were not getting it, then 20% should be from the job market out of 100, now Rishu gets separated. In the market and it does it to everyone because you had entered Chennai UPSC, Scheduled Tribe etc. Unlimited Unlimited 3070 16 attempts means you have made rule rule, it sounds good and you have done it for 16 years here only then it is not getting cleared.  When the chora became main then there was no refilling, sometimes it stopped somewhere, sometimes it started and life is going on and the person who was preparing for IAS then felt scared to clear it.  Because lots of people were thinking about their dreams earlier, then this is the example - government job, many people are wasting time in government job, private job is not available because brother, there is no stamp of ATM, there is no stamp of ITI and also remove the soil.  In some cases, there is a schedule, there was a job, service is being promoted, depending is good, it is giving more happiness, then you tell the husband, it is not bad, you do the charts, you go, learn, work hard, learn crores. Soft skin cheeky add value to networking. At least you will learn to wear clothes. You will learn to go to office, you will polish your shoes, you will get a haircut, you will shave yourself. If you are a girl then you will work like a girl because you will be sitting inside the house in kurta pajama and boxer short pants.  And you are brushing your teeth at 9:00 in the night without realizing it, I am late on the internet, you have woken up late, my parents look like this, brother means I am mother.  She says, at this age, I had become a mother of two children, that too is progress, I am not speaking like this by texting, as a protest, Gulab says, \" Dude, what are you talking about me at this time, it has been 4 years since I got the job.\"  You people are preparing for a good job here because you have to work for money. It is okay to take photos on Instagram because of corruption. Now your face is so sexy, it cannot be used to earn money and fashion is your passion to have 4000 friends on Facebook. Chrome  If you monetize, my brother, then you can get pension, if anything, it can be inverted, then take it as a patient, I am not refusing to pour cold water on a hot pan, but brother, start doing real work in your real life because our friend is in real life.  The population of callers is really less and the competition is actually less, people are running away from jobs worth Rs 40,50,000 because that too is not being used. Okay, so it was.  There is not so much competition, there is so much interest in the job, yes, government jobs, Group A jobs or we go to this kind of job, so you see which job is not much, in the coming times, I will make some such videos, if you want.  I will definitely make that such kind of jobs and tax ES can be joint here. Even in the competition universe, money will be spent, a little will be more, but there is no competition, so in this way, if you want any career information for you, then this  If you guys want to know how, please write in the comment section. Please tick the alternative career choice that I am a doctor. This means there is no competition here where you are your own competition. Yes, there are many such things that unite you. You meet many things, that's why do it.  You can do it and it is necessary for you to do graduation so that you have to go there and do it because if there is another option then you can go.

I will do an interview, subscribe and you will get to see it and this channel is also in fashion there, subscribing does something else to you, now it does something else, it changes with age, so what will be the benefit to you in that, then tension.

    "title": "Do You Worry About Your Future ？ [JUyH03Zzqo4].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, do you worry about your future is a simple topic, the answer is like this for many people, some people will be rare, it is okay, those who are more connected to both of them than me may not have the answer, but your answer is also no.  There is a video because mostly the answer is yes, so first of all we will think that if your answer is yes then do you care about the future, then many people will say yes, that is what should not be done. Kaveri is not very heavy, somewhere it is said that it is very heavy, like if you talk in housewife's bade, then housewife are very very pick up, other housewives pick up in 10 and talk, you are other bade housewife, especially in D.  30 and 40, that lady is very worried, will her husband be able to build her house, where will her children go, if there will be a marriage, what will it be like, okay, so the elders live separately at different levels, the students.  The story remains after 12th, I will go, after 12th, someone is going to college, we will get a job, if we get a job, then how will marriage be, if it will work, then how will children be, these are normal worries in many things, other vices, this means big marriage, advice is small.  I don't know how many worries there are at this level, there will be promotion, my impression will be good, the presentation will be good, there are many worries, then the channel will reduce them in one, I told you that brother, money will increase the peace.  Incidentally, if you have paisa sukoon membership, if you have not joined then my recommendation is please join by pressing the join button. iPhone users will get a separate link. If they do not see the join then why are you bothering brothers and sisters? That is why you are the same.  You are doing it because why do people care about the future because your present is not going that well? The one whose present is going very well does not weigh that much One Think Future Note Planning  But the future is negative, if you are appearing in the second air of IIT, then you are slipping but you are not very worried because you think that you have to spend only two years, then if you see your future after 2 years, then you do not give it that much weight because  Your present is fine young man IIT Delhi and IT Chennai and IIT Mumbai is fine and doing some good degree good branch you have got so you are like I just want to grind it personal I have you come  IT But there are a lot of people, majority of them are like this, they are not great in the present and I do n't see anything happening in the future, the salary is 35-40, no girl is visible in the age group of 35-40, okay, what will happen, don't take it to my house.  As for my parents, I have a house but I will not be able to live with them or even if I am able to live then I will not get a girl or I will not be able to achieve this in 20 years of my life.  Beating has passed, reducing the age of 40-45 years, children are growing up, their fees have been taken, it is not certain that they will settle down and this wife keeps on troubling, these programs are going on as per the wishes of the parents.  My wife has not become great, my parents' requests for the program not to be reduced and the children have started, I am just crying my heart out, it is a relief, I know how much capability I have, is my hair all falling out or my body?  It is declining and what does it mean now? The power to enjoy life is decreasing. If there is any juice in life then this is this marriage, this is this worry, because the present is bad, you are very because of you, the present is bad, first understand, take.  Come til you know this present is not good and that's the same your worried about the future talking to parents late or giving tax money to them because they have no spices or nothing for children  Is doing or is doing, has something happened to the children, Right Dr. Everything, Right Dr., which is your Taurus, there is not a single thing in the future, now stop thinking about the big things, because the present is not good, if you are not getting lunch then dinner.  There is no point in doing seniors, fix lunch first, if in lunch you get three yards of paratha with good pickle of potatoes, then yours taken care of will be required in dinner. If you have made good arrangements for the present, then you have to see that whatever things are wrong with you in the present, you have written down how many things are under your control, address them immediately and those which are not under your control.  They are not in control, those who are spreading raita, those who are giving negativity, giving toxicity, giving stress, because they are giving in comparison also, because neither story nor story will come, hey, you haven't gone for a walk, hey you.  You haven't bought a car. Hey, you haven't bought a house. Hey, you will get that naturally. You will get it naturally in friendship and relatives. You have to see whether you should do retirement and travel. Fox is going on in your life right now. Half of you are going to visit India. See what rains happen in the mountains.  Me too and other vices too, recover tax from there, recover ₹10, record ₹20, this traveling trick is available more because we have to skip the present, but some other detailed video.  I will make it on this psychology, I do not say at all that one should not go for a trip or should not enjoy cars or should not buy a big house, one should not have luxury, one should have everything but not everyone can have everything in life, this is also because if you look at it is middle class.  If you are extremely rich, then it is a different matter, there are very few of them, so the middle class will have to pick and choose, either get their children stuck in a very good school or go on a story tour which will help the children.  Brother, you should study well, compromise in the car, no, you have bought a good car, children are also studying in school, you go out for a lot, you are wearing nice clothes, then brother, there is no home in the whole of India, if you have a washing machine in your house. And there is a TV, sorry, there is no TV, there is a fridge, a washing machine and one, if you have these three things in your house then you are in the top 16% of the rented houses in India. If I ask about the house, then it will be very less but  Only three things remain in the story  Yes, you have a washing machine, a fridge and such, if you have these three things, then India's top one means no matter how old or new it is, one is not in every room, there is one washing machine too and then people take only one, if it is okay then India.  I have you see where you are right and in that you make your percentage merit list because what used to happen when you used to study was that you used to know the numbers and in the numbers you used to know that you have more in the subject. less in subjects  We used to work hard according to it and then the numbers were seen increasing till we came to 45. My rank out of 55 is 18th out of 18 out of 45. If I have children, now I will be 12th then brother-in-law, something was happening in today's world like I have given this example.  The thing is you are not checking this thing in such a percentage, our camp has been made our friends, now many friends are like this, it is the biggest disease of the middle class which is only  You will be able to save your money if you are following your correct lesson. Ship the ship, take it at home, do something of your own, then someone will come and take the car, why did he go in the car, will he ask who should go for a walk, what did you say to him, your children have to study in school.  This school is not good, now that one is very good, I don't know what magic will happen there, people, bill, comment, your money, this is the world, which I want you to tell and explain, you will have to come and do it, and then what is it when your present is under your control.  I don't give relief you start becoming worried about your future so first thing but you presentation note satisfied with present d second think which I want you tell because of two things I bill b finishing quickly kiss whose present is not under his control  There is a lot of variation in the future if you are very settled in your life when it is paying, Manish is ok but your finance  R and control you know where you want you are rich you know what you can't achieve c fear are some batsmen who were earlier they knew only two shots and they made their career by doing those two shots, they did not have much variety flamboyant only He was not there, hit a six here too, Mr. 360 Suryakumar Yadav type Virat Kohli was not like that but he used to go for a long time with his singles, Mohammad used to hit the flick shots, definitely hit one, hit this again, I mean very absolutely.  Random example, I don't remember it at all, but you realize that there are many people, they go through one or the other thing, so you have to see where you can fix it, concentrate fear and move ahead in life there suddenly.  That too of release will give you a lot of happiness. You have set up the children in your own house. You have made five by two. The children have not been set but they have been very good. You have set up a house for them. Young son, this is your daughter, this is yours, make this yours.  40-50 thousand job on the story and look at yours, I gave you the house and also gave you a car, that's it, the story means do something in any way and be relaxed in your life, it is very important, this is something which I think.  Most of you should start thinking this way, whenever I think about the future, first of all, my present is not right, what is wrong with the present, how can I fix it, second, why am I not in control?  The idea is to start cutting off the people who distract me from my control, be it relatives, be it friends, be it your nearest and dearest, start cutting off people like you, start getting started, because is it some stranger, now I do n't know you, so I can't control your life. I can't control you, I can't bother you too much, so you watch my video and it goes to your house every day [laughter] Before you can take control of life, you have to take control of your mind, your fear R F U people.  hoon do it on d  But also, it is not like this, many people, close relatives, especially parents, siblings, those who have very close relationships, they are probably doing it for the sake of torture, so it is not that you have to give any part, you have to check your feelings also, what are you saying friend?  Maybe you are wasting your time and resources, which are limited. We have time and resources and are locking them in the wrong place. Come on, my friend, this is wasting too much, don't spend it here, you can spend it here also.  Fool Left Out is also giving the closest advice, so it means divide it or else I will do it only with this much experience. Do you have a thousand photos on Facebook or ₹ 10000 photos? Bill note of the story. Define your quality of life, then if the future  If you are worried then you will have to change something in the present. Date is last message last date. Take away from this video is if you are worrying about future in your life.  Give you the bill Have you also changed something in your present? First of all, what is control? What are the controls in your life? What can you do? Then you have to see whether life is under control. It seems out of control. Auditing physical people.  Then after that, the last thing which I told, people should follow this one, if you have not changed anything, then it is the same moment, you change something like a simple thing which is worried about health in future because.  You are seen detouring right now, that's why it is the other vice, if you are running well, good, there is no pain in the story, there is no problem, the blue report is extracting fun, then bill, you are very but, something wrong is going on.  If something is going wrong then you can change it, what will you put inside the mouth and make it work like the body, how will you make the mind work, just give me two things, you can make changes, but I hope you will like the video.

    "title": "Does Law Of Attraction Work ？ [W5PpTaiVP0Y].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, this is a very popular question, this is asked to me also a lot, today I am giving you clarity on Law of Attraction, Law of Attraction on everything, people normally ask this, does Law of Attraction work or anything else?  It works, how does it work, why does it work, you have to understand one thing, when the British write books, it is okay, then a lot of things are followed in it, science finesse is not asked in it because the British.  Has written Law of Attraction, if someone comes from astrology, Vedanta comes from old Indian knowledge, then everyone needs scientific research and proof, then today I want to tell the same thing on this thing that life You think yourself, what is the law of attraction, I will think something and I will attract positive manifestation, positive thinking, so I am telling you the take on this only, first of all I will tell you on this.  What is too much, this is for lazy people, it is the exit route for them that I have thought something good, it will happen to me, you have to understand what else to do in life, I will tell you very well, you will get clarity and that is logical.  It will seem okay, first of all, if anything happens in life other than accidents, then someone must have thought, if not, then it will happen. For example, if you have to eat rajma rice tomorrow afternoon, then your wife or mother. You will have to soak it in the evening and night. You cannot say at 12 o'clock that if you want to eat rajma rice at one o'clock, then you should not soak it, then you will have to get it from outside only from Sugi, so there is something big to think about it. If that tea is also to be made then milk.  If there is no milk then there is milk to come, now that is also the law of attraction. I want tea. So the way people think of the law of attraction is that I want tea.  It is necessary and I thought very hard that someone will come, will appear and tea will come, it does not happen like this, it does not happen that it will come on its own because what is it, no, but this happened with me once, I was thinking like this, hey.  If you have 10,000 thoughts in a day and in 360 days, if you put in 10,000 thoughts, then by normal probability, five or six things will happen, then what do you think, is the Law of Attraction a theory?  If you have so many thoughts by doing something, then some of them will remain the same, then the Law of Attraction has to be thought that there is nothing in yourself, which is our knowledge of Geeta Ji, that is Karma, Karma is more important, your Mer  Act of Desiring Something Wanting Something Change Something Dozen Work Second Thing is Positivity Positive Emotions Thinking Too Much Positive  There's Something Called Negative Preparation It's Not Thinking Negative Every Time When You Sit in a Car and You Wear Your Seat Belt You're Not Thinking  Constantly an accident will happen, an accident will happen, an accident will happen, you are not  Thinking is a negative preparation that if such a situation comes, I am wearing a seat belt, it will save me, it is a safety protocol, it is called negative preparation, now why don't you think positive in this situation that nothing will happen, nothing will happen, don't think, child.  Thinking it is a getaway for those very lazy people, L for losers, L for lazy people, L for lethargic people. And there was a book called 'Secret' which then became a movie and then something happened beyond that and then many people started doing one thing. These things have been told by us and explained. First of all, if you do not have any plan in your mind that I want to buy a house.  If so, where will the house come from, but you tell me, it is the law of attraction. I thought that if you want to buy a house, it will come. Hey brother, if you want to buy a house, then first of all you have to see how much to buy, where to buy, how much money do you have, how much can you tolerate?  How much down payment is there, how much father-in-law is ready to give, how much is father-in-law ready to give, wife likes the house, 00 and other things, interstate is increasing and decreasing, job is confirmed, it is small, will not be missed, how much consideration is there, then that thing happens.  So, if someone catches hold of the Law of Attraction, then I want a home, I want a home, I want a home, the same thing does not happen like this, the Law of Attraction is mine, every man needs a good, beautiful, polite wife, every girl needs someone rich, very rich. Understanding Feminist Type: Wanted a very beautiful, handsome husband, so both of them started doing Law of Attraction, Law of Attraction, but what are you yourself? This girl, who has a dimple on her left collarbone, will spend her life living with her mother and work.  She is also active and beautiful and she also knows how to cook. These are the traits of five different girls. Now you want to attract them with the Law of Attraction and marry them, but these five are So first of all these five are not present in any one and if there is no one, then how will you attract and what is it in you that will get attracted, you are the one who is roaming around with the desire for this, then everyone has their own individual law of attraction.  Roaming and then they will create another new thing 55 55 Write any five times or 55 times, write for five days, write like this and then it will make your mind realign and it becomes like this and then  This is how it happens, if they are so weak minded, then maybe this means that for those children whose marks are perhaps 51 out of 100, hold them and make them write something repeatedly and make them mark 33.  If you have done this, it works for them, but the child who is a thinker, has a little bit of awakening of consciousness, intellect and conscience, it is okay, he is sitting at number 60, 70, everything is enough for him, he knows what he has to do, how to do it, best of all.  Big What is the problem in this, you have to think, you have to attract it, it is told how to go about it and there is no discussion about it, so many people are sitting like this is coconut, if it falls, then I will eat it, if I want to make banana, then it will fall, if it is fruit.  It will fall, you keep sitting under the tree and keep attracting it, keep doing it, keep doing it and don't move, brother, someday it will fall, but it is also possible that you are looking at someone else like this.  He came, he hit you with a stick, broke it, hit you with a stone, the stone fell on your face and the fruit fell there, you picked up the fruit and went away, you kept playing the Law of Attraction, this is a very good way to pass the time because there is no action in it.  And you see that whatever knowledge does not have action, that knowledge becomes very popular wherever you say that something has to be done, you only have to do it and it is you who is lacking and you could not do it Munna or Munna you.  Do it Munna Munni, if you are not able to do that then it will irritate the youth, but where something like this is so common, especially if it comes from the West, because if it is coming from here, then they will say that it is a superstition here. Apply something, if you do something of your own then there is a superstition as to what has been done but something is coming from outside, not let it manifest and let the nature and the world and the universe give this.  Thing and then all that universe of yours, that dialogue of Shahrukh Khan, the whole universe will align it like this and that is what happens, I have experienced this, you try and those people there have told me that I am also an astrologer but I also know this. Know that if you keep making 10,000 predictions, all five will be correct, there will be rain, there will be no rain, there are only two things - the sun will come out, the sun will not come out, whether something good will happen in your life or not.  There is a 50% chance in a thing, okay, so you are carrying a charge of 50%, the same is the case with manifestation of anything, if you manifest it from morning to evening in the Law of Attraction, then something will definitely happen.  There is also that tea example that yes, maybe mother or wife will ask, I have been manifesting since morning, hey, get up and make yours, are you okay, I woke up at 6:00. Manifestation is going on, make a maid and give it without asking, she also went away, make a wife, give it, the wife also left, Oh Mummy, at least someone comes from somewhere, at least something happens, it's okay, if something happens, then maybe if you keep waiting, then maybe  It will be done by evening, maybe if you get it in the evening, you have done the manifest, but is it worth it? What is the most premium thing in the world today? The most premium thing is that which goes away and cannot come back. That is time, here the premium of time is there, there is no calculation or there is something that I can manifest, 12 hours, 12 days, 12 months, there should be some kind of timeline or I am a walking manifester from morning to evening.  Do n't even sing that song, I want that, I want that, I just have this little dream, do something like this, keep wanting, keep wanting, it will become yours, before anything good happens, it is necessary to want it, otherwise you will not work towards it, but  And desire is not just the beginning, it is also written in this way that there are three steps in this too, first you do it like this, then by making this thing so big, it is being sold so well, very good, very good, read a lot, it is very secret, it is a very big secret.  What is this secret, this is A for Apple, B for Boy and not Plus One Two, it is a thing of the same level, everyone knows that if you want something then first you will have to think in your mind, then after you have thought, then you will have to do something, so if you are thinking.  And then if you are doing it, then you will get it, then what is so great thing in it, what is so great and special in it, but does it work, does it work, brother, does it work, all of them would have manifested to become IS, to become IS.  Have dreams at night and sit to sleep. Now that vacancy is yours for 180, then 90 of them go for reservation. 18 What do the gold people say and the EWS people?  If they take 90 and 18, how much will it become? 108, how much is left out of 108? If you are in the general category, then you can manifest in 72, 72. You are manifesting 6, 7 lakhs. Okay, so 6 lakhs, that is marriage with a popular heroine.  If she is manifesting Rs 2 crore then she will definitely marry Vicky Kaushal, which means now everyone can't become Vicky Kaushal or Vicky. What will happen through manifestation, attraction is also made a law, I am very attracted, okay and on the law of attraction, that thing is limited, then what is limited, then what limited thing can we do with the law of attraction, then there is competition, then I am for peace.  I attract, so that I get peace, I will attract peace, my friend, abstract things are good, I also say this, many times I come and try my best to explain, but this is  Something Na Jo Pura Mammo Jamo Hai And You Can Complete Avoid It Because It Breeds In Action And By Doing Action All Things Will Happen And In Law Of Attraction Many Times It Happens That You Attracted To Get Rasgulla And Then It Came To You. Gulab Jamun is also looking very tasty, so sometimes we think wrong things even in attraction, it behaves better than that, perhaps we did not even know and sometimes what happens in our mind.  Even when the desired thing happens, if the mind is not happy, then it is Man To Chanchal Hai. Rajesh Khanna ji has already told Pushpa a lot that Man To Chanchal Hai is the dialogue of which movie. It is okay to tell, if Man is to Chanchal Hai, then it is the mind and the law.  And don't talk about all this, do real work in real life, attract real people and real relationships, real money, focus on real things, focus on real estate, okay and you will do well in life, so this was my take.  On Law of Attraction I Feel You Can Completely Bypass This and Live a Great Life Without Reading Any Book on It Any Article on It and Anything These fads are there to keep people busy especially lazy people so that they feel that yes do something  We are lying down, Law of Attraction will happen, okay, I will write, I will write like this, I will write there, I will write like that, do the work, there is no need to write so much, work in real life. Do it, the knowledge which does not work the next day and does not give results or does not give results in three to four hours is useless knowledge. Remember this is the basic thing that knowledge has to help you immediately. Immediate means within minutes and few hours it has to.  Help, something should start. You start hitting setups. It may take six months to become abs, but when you hit 40, 50, 60 sets for the first time, you will feel that pain in the stomach.  You start having pain in the muscles. If there is no pain in those muscles then you have not set up, you have manifested your Law of Attraction that if I get a six pack app then no it will take six months to get the six pack app but that.  The pain will come in the body within six hours. Try the setup. If you do pushups, it will take time to build your body. If you lift weight, it will take time. But the pain in the muscles will come immediately.  The thing which is useful will start having immediate effect. Any person likes my video, he likes my words, he feels relieved after listening to me, if my words have any substance then he will feel it immediately, if not he will feel it then brother, that is nonsense.  This is something that you should carry with you in your life. Thank you very much."

Having mines used to give me income tax benefits, so people are smart and rich, which in India also, there were very few ATS banks, not many, now what has happened, you have become smart, Brijni, smartness has come to India, earlier it used to be done by the government  It has been banned, now it is such a thing that it has hit the business model of only 0.5%, not only point five but point one, the day before yesterday no one in India even came to know, brother, how many people buy two houses, how many buy 10 houses, 100 more than that You could have bought a house also, you would have fixed it for 2 lakhs, this is the biggest problem, not outside as you do, you should understand again that if I bought a house, then if I have income from 10 sources, then my income is fine, then if I am paying the price for it  If I pay 40% tax on that, I am alive, yes there is 40% tax as well, you guys don't think about it, it is just that, many who earn more money were paying up to 42%, last year they were paying up to 42, 43%, so that  from the lab  If you had their mines, then if ₹100 was going to the bus, then 43 rupees would go back to the person and he would have to pay only 57 rupees to the bus, rest if he had paid in cash, rent or event, you know everything about the system of India  So they were buying the property of the dhaba and this model used to work but now this model does not work and this is because of the taxation rules in it and which are different for us, this is a big message, a good learning, yes everything work, anything which is done through cash.  You are an asset which takes money from user liability debt is very good. Okay, if you turn your car into a taxi, then it becomes an asset and is useful to you. If I am driving a knitting machine myself, then I can stay in my house myself.  If you are living there then that is a liability, it is an asset when all those definitions, qualifications, all of that is very basic, but the thing that was bigger than that was because every time I have come to the point that now you must have seen that Indian YouTubers have started bringing them to the big level. ones  Ranveer Alava who does podcasts, he has come on the show, I had seen him on YouTube as well, he had come on two shows and he had the same specs and now he is Ranveer ji, he is like in Allahabad, he is always a fan, the other one means something to him as well  If you want to get it out in a proper way, then by becoming his fan nothing comes out of it, I forgot the 15000 apartment, it seems that in India also there are 15000 people, it is not possible because of debt tax, by taking it people will become rich, so buy 10000, there is no problem in that  but that model cannot be copied, so it was important for you to tell this thing here, but it can still be corrected, but the style cannot be followed by that model, I cannot do it single day after, but this is the work of Shakti Lal who  Most of my audience is a normal middle class person who has a job, does some small business, still he can earn maximum profit through this, I conduct many webinars on real estate, I participate in them  There is a real estate channel special real estate channel song and  real state if I never took its prince name on this channel so tell me real state is my youtube channel state you can search and subscribe it there you will get information there are some videos there are some things in that way I will teach you formulas that yes do how many How can this be done because every time in our country you say apply some formula, the government comes and changes it, then that caste, then you have to find something else, now how much loss was that government suffering and what else  After doing that, no one will ever discuss this on this platform because a rich man cannot cry, because he is a rich man who is buying a house, he can go and say that this is my business  It has been made a model, all the people will say that it was a good thing that they taught them a lesson, the public is the one who teaches a lesson, the public has become unconscious, the Overelastic ATS has now become its robot, because they are following it, what you want to do  But brother, this happened 8 years ago Thoughts are the same, what is your financial status, take away from this video and this learning, what is your financial status, today you are poor or a little less rich or you are limited to this level and here people's programs are getting spoiled, then Radha is disappointed  Don't do it because when you reach here you too will have to bear this pain, you also have to ask the question that brother, will we keep paying this tax, maximum 42%, yes we are enjoying, you enjoy, tomorrow your turn may also come, this is very sad  And he can even do a left right and go but I have a pending video that if I have to do Namaste friends only then why should I sit in Gurugram and say Namaste friends, why don't I go to Germany, but Guruji, why is he in Gurugram?  But why is it not there in Germany because there are different taxation issues and in Dubai there are no taxes at all and I am not going to talk about patriotism here, patriotism is there, it is a passion and I don't want that, I am talking about practical things as well  I will tell you the date dispite  Wattiver sadden okay it is good you stand in India okay there would not have been any patriotism angle in despitae okay he will become a moral science teacher he will have a very first order video I love my country I will not leave what happens I will say very much  It's a good thing, I am not condemning him, that is an important thing for me too, but the style, if you pay so match what you pay and you also enjoy it that I am getting something special, even then you should stand Bharat this am addressing you me  Yes, NRI audience this is addressing you, I am the NRI audience who has gone from here, why should you go back, raise your voice, why should you go back, I will also tell you that properly, if you want that video, then brothers and sisters, that video will also be available and one more thing  And I want to tell my audience whatever your financial status may be, the money hasn't come yet, it's not a bad thing to know that money will come but when it comes you wo n't know what to do, I want to tell you a small story on this.  By telling me this thing I finished the bill, what happens with the money, when it comes then how does the mind set change and how does one of the things happen which you know I am an astrologer also, okay so Vastu and all these things also  I do it, I will tell you, okay Vastu Astrology Vastu, so you tell me to identify, have you seen it, has it happened to you or have you seen it happening to someone else, then do write, otherwise it will happen to you when we live in small houses, that means we  We are relatively poor. Wealth and poverty are relative. It is not absolute. So it is never full. In front of Mukesh Ambani, we all are poor. No matter how poor one is, it is a matter of relative importance. So when we have small houses and they are tight, then you get an award in that.  Got some trophy, child got that medal, got some certificate, okay, if we get any such thing, we all get it, you must have got many people, we keep them decorated in such a way that there is no space, not even a wall to display them but  We keep them as our stories, if nothing else, we will keep them safely in a box of ours.  that by hugging her to the chest it is like periods happen and many such things were in my photograph, I was retiring from there or sorry, someone was getting posted, someone was getting farewell, all those memories were kept by you by doing this  And I also get those farewell gifts from there, people get small trophies like these, some mementos are also given by the elders, they are kept as keepsakes, okay and those memories are there for you in your life and you tell the story  The story goes that if you live in this house, you will understand that such people have never existed and they will never exist, my house becomes bigger, the horizon becomes bigger, the money becomes more, that the society throws away the head  Are a rich man, he doesn't get caught up in the memories that he got this, that, that, some certificate, that, some medal, if all these things are important for you in life, you get all these things from Jain story, then you are poor only because of your thinking, you should think first, you  You can become rich from here if you don't have to do a job and money is flowing in abundance so be careful about your degree brother Why okay I hope you are getting this point I am not spoiling it with people I am telling you very very clearly it is an in mind set every I come in clear brain which some system has put in place with its best practical Worli examples which are in India  We do not take examples from foreign countries. When I and those foreigners have to write books, they write from their own examples. We copy their knowledge. If it is important here, I hope you liked this thing and you know the difference.  It was told that brother we cannot do it because now the government has also added interest of 2 lakhs in area 24, there was a time when even 40 lakhs were earned, 40 lakhs were earned on a loan of 5 crores, so I have a loan of 5 crores  I am investing in eight properties and my income is Rs 10, so I could have deleted all of them from my income and created more assets and could have gone to this point. I have invested in 15,000 apartments only and have achieved this in the last 40 years of investing.  40 years of investment he got this rich 1500 apartment using debt but that has changed our love so now that has changed we cannot earn money many times you people feel that it seems that our system which is made  He just wants to keep us in the middle of it, that he picked us up from poverty and put us here, this will be normal class, this is your capping, just stay in it, it takes life to break this ceiling because above this, I mean, there is so much degree of difficulty.  The man goes and says, brother, is this all the work? If I earn ₹100, 18% of it goes into GST. I talk about digital income, whatever digital income comes, if a person earning digitally, like me or anyone else, you will be charged ₹100.  It does this through which digital money is transferred, service, consultation, any kind of this allam-m which is going on, listen carefully on ₹ 100, GST on ₹ 100 became 18%, so GST of ₹ 8283 became 100 GST and then on that  40-42% tax if his income is above a certain level, then brother, the person earning ₹100 is keeping only 40%, you should understand that if he is coming on 40 platforms, then that platform is on Razor or some other platform, hosting platform  The group that you want to keep or that side white, its cost will also be seven to eight rupees percent, so don't be surprised when you get in the digital, many times people multiply it, hey Guruji, you so many people ₹ 100  The ticket is ₹10,000, no sir, stay tuned to I-Bill, we will know about it in the next video, if you want, we would like to tell you how it is going, are you enjoying learning and you can give your feedback and subscribe to the channel yes we can do organic growth my marketing budget is you guys only okay you won't see me running any ad, this is how I went Google doesn't do ads okay my organic I believe in Ayushmann Khurrana model of movies okay congratulations for 18 crores Yes, 225 crores was nothing, it's okay, the rest of the movie has released, movies worth 300 crores come, 150 crores is taken by the star, his marketing is worth 50 crores, it's not that kind of thing, thinking this I want to tell you people, be very organic, don't be  Extremely happy with anything which is happening with me.

    "title": "Doing Comparison And Judging Others ｜ Fresh Take On This Two Important Issues [DHeuRlKnrHw].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today on Clarity Channel the youngsters are elders, for me even 40-45 year olds are also youngsters, 50 year olds are also youngsters. I will tell you a concept which has been termed very bad by the society but I will tell you the right way to hack that inevitable. Date is doing.  Comparison and judging are two ideal things, it is always said, don't book, comparison and it is said, don't church, it is like saying that it is not snatching work.  Don't worry or say it as you are told. Don't do it. This is bound to happen. This is bound to happen. Don't forget it. There is no benefit in saying yes, I also agree, but still people do it because no one has explained in depth what I am.  Like the teller, subscribe the channel, do n't do it yet, there is going to be a very deep intelligent higher order video, watch it till the end, sitting in a place of great peace, I am talking about peace, okay, I am in a great place, okay, so we will start first.  Then we will go into comparison, we should judge in judgment, first there will be comparison, you go to class, you say Shivalinga poetry, you compare with relatives, you compare with friends, this is Facebook which has become so many billion dollars, this is basic in human being.  Who is his wife, how beautiful is she, how is her husband, how are her children, how happy are they, this is just for the tableau because my friend Umesh was in the army.  He used to be less numbered than me, I was missing more but his life is looking more Zingalala, he is standing behind Leaning Tower of Pizza, behind him is a tree, behind him is Leading Tower of Pizza and he is taking a photo there, he is looking very happy, hey  Life has passed, I am left behind, if my wife becomes like this, I say, comparison should be done, a lot of comparison should be done, I want to tell you the method, compare the comparison. Do a lot but bring everything, you will say table, everything, so what is a table, everything is a table, whatever defines your life, if you want to compare, then what do people do normally? How have people made their lives miserable? You compare the worst of your life with the best of others' life. You have seven to eight people to compare, your brother- in-law, your brother-in-law, your brothers and sisters, your close friends.  Close Open: Whose life do you know very well? First of all, comparison will never happen with Mukesh Ambani ji because you do not know him and if you know him, then you know that you make comparison with him, that does not mean that comparison will happen with people you know.  If we believe that it is okay then the comparison is happening with the people we know, but what do we do if something good is happening in someone's life and my life is for example, you are not able to go out for any reason or  Or it is not your nature or your money is invested somewhere else. Where is your focus area in life? It could be any reason. Now you have a friend or a relative, he is roaming around. Okay, so now he is roaming around. You will see his photographs, you do not roam around, some other story is being played out in your life, a good story is being played out, the network is increasing, so and so is threatening, anything is happening, now you have compared this thing with him. Okay, then you will become miserable. Okay, now he may be making a comparison that your wife works, she has double income, or her children are more intelligent, or her health is good, or she has become spiritual, or this father and mother. Because even in your life there are different stories playing out, you are not even counting them, that is why I am here to bring everything, you are the table, you are the parents, you are the one.  You are in a relationship with your parents, it is your wife, it is your relationship with your wife, are you kids, how are you getting the values, how do you eat, how is your stomach, do you compare, is your bathroom cleaned in the morning, because they will compare, won't they?  There is also a factor, the hand-conceived people who roam around or the half-conceived people, it is completely desi, okay, some particular kind of food.  Eat, excise and do all this, so if I say the parameters of total comparison, then according to the data I have, it is 100. You can also make it 500, but 100 will be a rough life comparison which will define your life.  Let's do this thing, write all those parameters and find out all the things of your friend or relative and give him a number, then give a number to yourself and then calculate, then you will get relief. This is a big, full and hardy thing, it will take a lot of effort because it is very easy to make comparisons with smaller ones. Hey, his wife is beautiful, his husband is so handsome, his father is not cigarette, but alcohol, his husband is handsome, his husband is cigarette, not alcohol, his father is handsome, very desirable, sexy and handsome.  She casts her eyes on other women too, you don't know that your big, round teddy bear is only your teddy bear, only you can hug it and no one else wants to hug it either.  Is and that is your life, then you should see the ways of comparison, what do we want? We all want the best of life of those around us. We want a car equal to or higher than that of a relative. We want a house equal to or higher than that of another relative.  Some relative's child is studying in a school, he wants to be better than that, someone is going to roam around, he is going more, you will see that someone's life is not Zingalal, there is no Zingalala in totality, there are compromises and because you will do one thing, you  One  Instead of spending a lot of time in earning money, if you concentrate then your focus will get diverted somewhere, so you have to give your priority, this is life, it is a singer player game, it is a live single player game, that is not the meaning of competition, you are your competition, you are your best.  The biggest enemy is you only, you have to improve, it is very difficult to beat everyone else everywhere, like now when there are children in the class, because different aspects have not come in their life which I have given 100 parameters.  There will be four-five parameters in the life of a child of 15 years, 10 years and 14 years, so among them he competes in school that he has my marks, that is fine, he is an old thaharaunga because his area of ​​focus is limited and it is fine for him that in future he But as we grow older, you see, when you are 25, your parameters of comparison should be 20 because you were not married, you had a job, then you get married, then you have children.  Then children have children, then relatives also have children, then they put out their own stories, so this video is very deep, okay and now I will tell you this one about comparison, you have understood, I will tell you, judge, judge, people say, I should not do it.  I say that you should do a lot of things, but someone told you this wrongly, but first of all, before judging others, judge yourself, judge yourself as to what my belief systems are, which I am actually walking through life as a person, that is my real reality and that of others. not be  And I am judging him on the basis of his reality, so first of all, I should note down the scale of my reality as to how much is right and wrong, and first of all, I should know myself that I am sitting on the basis of my belief system and notions.  For so many years, is this okay, is this okay, who knows, there is nothing wrong with them, so first of all, judge yourself and secondly, many people make a mistake, you tell me whether you do it or not, they make this mistake, friend, this  Man  It is not bad but is it good or should it be fine? All these are good systems. Humans are either bad or good and you should not feel ashamed in saying this. For example, people do not say no, even Ravana has a lot.  There were no qualities. Yes, Ravana's qualities, you have to see what is the score and center from where he means like for example now it is said discipline, even Duryodhana had a struggle to build his body. What was the core of his doing? To give some weapons to someone, to reduce some wrong, you have to look at the center. Before judging a person, many people can be very lazy, they don't have any good habits but still they are good people because their  The core center is that my boss, my mother-in-law, father- in-law or someone's problem forcefully start putting people in the category of good and bad. People say no, there is no black and white, this grip is great, life is not great.  Life is black and white  Either the man is good or the man is bad. Now a man who is keeping his body good, wants to look sexy, is married but he is doing everything to make other females follow and like him or his.  Be it any extra marital affair or anything related to it, this person is bad. Now you cannot say that this is just an act, everything else is fine, only his core is bad, you understand that the one whose core is bad, he is a bad person now.  that 150 is good  If you do something but it is still bad then Ravana Ravana is the one whose intention is on someone else's woman, how much knowledge he has, how much goodness he has, only then people will make a video sometime. People are confused between religion and religion, they call it religion.  Hindi: Religion never changes, yet you have rituals which keep changing with time, but the things that have been said since thousands of years ago, that parents are parents, do not look at other's sheep, do not look at other's money.  put it wrong like this  Don't underestimate, the things which were applicable 15-20 thousand years ago will be applicable even today and 20000 years from now. So judge people on things but first of all judge yourself and don't be afraid to judge people.  I have head date confidence yes good this is not good how many are there now no know it depends no know it gray can't speak like this anyway basically what have you done everyone have done their  I am also a bastard, you are also a bastard, don't judge me baby, whenever I judge you, we both will keep doing our own nonsense, Raita will remain flat in life, this is basically the reason of the society, because if you are like this.  You will know that judging is not bad, otherwise you too will be judged and will be judged. On bad and good, you get distracted. Due to this, a deep video is being made. This is a very, very high video. It is in a very good and relaxed environment.  These kinds of thoughts come while living, that's why I am making a video that if respect is okay in Vice Gurgaon, then how did you like the video? Tell me, will you now judge yourself and people? Please write in the comment section, judge yourself according to me.  You should judge your values and once you have got it right, then judge everyone with the correct parameters. First of all, bring the parameter scale from somewhere and as it happens, gold has its parameter, 18 carat is also this carat.  22 carat 24 carat, then come with those parameters, first see yourself whether you are 22 carat, 21 to 23 to 24 to 18 or 12, whatever, then look at yourself, now if you fit the parameters from that, then these parameters are universal.  I told you that these are universal parameters, now people say who are we, why are we not the ones to judge anyone, brother, you are a human being, I have got the form of a human being, it is a big thing.  Judge more in this, the day if these people don't judge then only then they will get the courage to do less wrong to the people, to tease the girls and for some wrong reason, if people actually start getting judged for their actions then they will actually be judged by the poor people.  They do injustice, they exploit those who are weak, they harass those who are bosses, they don't know what they do in the office and they get their way, they are doing it for the good of the company.  We are doing it for the bigger good CD, the largest end date, this is nonsense, it is all nonsense, it is a fraud, judge him, tell the boss that you are ill-mannered, your judge, never tell anyone that he has these bad things and these good things, tell it to the guy, brother or  So this is good or bad, don't justify him that he is this, recognize his core, what I am telling you is that whatever he is doing, he is doing good, it comes from.  What are you doing? You raised your army to destroy other countries to protect your own country. Now what is this Russia doing with its power, what is it doing with the nuclear weapons it has created, to judge it? Look, our compulsions can be anything, we have to benefit, we have to do this, this is the dynamics, in this matter, the compulsions of the country then become those of the citizens, the citizens then do the same among themselves, hence life should be like this.  Rakhi: Clear cut in life, say that brother, you are a bad person, say it to your man, speak on his face, you are a bad person, but it is my compulsion, you have to tolerate it and I will not forcefully tell all my constituents that what is there in you?  And the deeper thing you should understand is that our mind also does not want to do wrong thing, we want to justify that in our mind if we say that by doing this we do not want to fall in our own eyes that I am doing this to myself.  I am associated with this wrong person for profit and I don't know how to do it, so you force him to find some good things in the person, those good things, I am telling you, even a stopped clock shows the correct time twice a day, so it is like this.  Nothing can be bad, the clock is not running, there is no friend, it is 6:00, but it is showing the correct time at 6:00 in the morning and 6:00 in the evening, so don't go by this logic.  Do n't go by this stopped clock syndrome that he is good in this, you should recognize the straight core of every person that whatever he is doing good or less, so called, what is its code, for which region he is doing it, what is the larger region. If the larger region is okay then it is okay, if I have a politician, he just wants everyone to do something wrong for himself and his own family, then someone of his is bad, now he is sitting on top and showing off, otherwise everyone does it.  see you later  So this is a very good parameter to judge people and you have to judge, without judging, how will you progress in life if you do not judge someone, whether a boy is sitting next to a girl, you are a father, a boy is sitting next to a girl, you will not judge that.  What is their thought process? Will they not judge everything? Be it property, money, marriage. What is their thought process? Will these people not check things? They will not judge. Now they will judge something but first their own.  Keep the parameters right. People do not want to keep their parameters right because it takes effort to see their parameters and then to release them. So I hope you guys enjoyed this video. Subscribe to the channel. See can't stop NR situations with Adarsh ​​See can't.  Stop judging Adarsh ​​it is going to happen and but you do it right they don't do this stupid thing is also ok I hope I told you this you understood and  How much do these people agree or not? Those who don't agree should write 'Don't Agree' because the system distracts you. Brother, every person wants to live in his own zone. He wants to think good about himself and also thinks very badly about others.  If he takes it then he will think that he will think about me, then he did not even think, this is good in this, this is gas, how to live, but this is from SKP, according to me, what is your opinion, please write in the comment section, don't stop judging, ideal.  Don't Stop Comparing Yourself Do It In The Right Way And Then You Will Release What Is Ho Life Will Throw Lot Of Lessons To You You Will Also Learn A Lot Thanks To You People"

    "title": "Doing This Instead Of Charity Will Give You More Sukoon [0h5njd8N0NA].en",
    "content": "Hello friends again interesting topic is two disincentives for charity, you know people talk a lot about charity, it is a big thing in the society, these people also talk about charity, in foreign countries also charity is a fashion, and I get relief by doing that.  Audience, the practical thing that I tell you in your life, to give you happiness in life, to give you progress in life, you should see that instead of calling charity charity, what I am going to tell you, you should do it for a couple of months and see. And then tell me brother if you want to donate a lot of money then do it, I don't mind that, it's fine but they talk too much, instead of this you should reduce whatever system you have below ₹500 or ₹1000, wherever anyone asks you  He is asking for ₹50, asking for 100, asking for 150, asking for 200, 300, up to 500, whatever your system is, put a cut off according to your supporters, my audience, I want to believe that ₹500  If it is up to ₹1000 then if you are taking anything from someone, you are taking service, he is asking for something, you are taking something from him, then do a bargaining band there and think of it as a charity, go and find poor men and beggars.  And I do n't know, he is not even doing any work, I do n't know, he deserves it and not also, he is sitting like this and begging, so you don't deserve something at a list from whom you are taking services, whatever these are the services given below, which I am telling you  I am saying that at least this person is working, he is working in the sun, he is working hard, you should not feel any pain in leaving him a little and what is the matter with that, this chik chik chik calculation of yours, did n't I come one day  Don't deduct his salary for two days, went to Nick's shop, it was 75 rupees, gave 100, it was 50, gave 75, he is the child of the fourth question, our society is moving in this way, I took 10 things from him, it is worth 50, Rakshabandhan will come again  Diwali will come Don't bargain, friend, don't do it. You want to go for a special charity or you want to organize a langar or you want to do some food bhandara or you want to show off in doing that, I want you to get peace or you think that it is  The purpose is more and on net daily basis you will have 30 to 40 interactions in a month, there will be a vegetable ready vendor, you will bargain with him, brother get it right, I mean vegetable for 80, no no give me some coriander and mint, from all these you can extract juice like this  People are like this among the poor and then they collect so many stories and then after beating drums and playing the story, you will do some hypocrisy of charity, why is it necessary to do it, leave it, don't put this pressure on yourself only that I have to donate and do a good deed.  I want to help someone in my life, don't make rotis like this, he is taking ₹500, yes take it, ₹500, no no, take it only 450, if not, then don't do it like this, hit your cut off if it is more than a thousand Bye Joe  Mend my words, I am not saying this here, you keep wasting money, but no story, someone came to repair the fan, someone came to clean, someone came, some printer came, some electrician came, there was a sewerage problem, you had a plumber came, something came among us  These people meet many people to bargain, then we want to go for a different story for charity, we want to keep some larger message and want to take a photo of it and then want to show it to ourselves because when you have a little abundance  You will show this mindset to others because if you start living what I am saying and save a little bit of ₹10, ₹20, ₹30, then you will be able to adjust with inflation and everything for your entire life as long as you are alive.  Also 50 thousand ₹ 1 lakh work people kids and where will he go, it is not known and in his name you got the vibes of the people from inside which you kept the troubles in your life because it can happen in these interactions  Someone who will even misbehave with you, because about this time I had also made a video, the new pain of the middle class, the lower class will not be very submissive, they will also argue with you, they may even abuse you, it can go to some level  If it spoils your mood, you will feel like this from within, something is fine, bitterness will also come, frustration will come, feelings will change, time will be wasted, that is not worth it, so those who have the spirit of charity, give it, brother, those who do not even have the spirit of charity  And those who want to keep it tight around their gums, there is no video for those below them, please keep it with Marshall, okay, those who want to keep it with big mosquito repellent, you can keep it like that, they cannot share knowledge with them Gyan can be distributed and it can be explained to those who are open to this thing, yes friend you are saying it right, we do a lot of charity and we try to save a few bucks everywhere and especially people like you are doing it  No, it was time for him to know, when he went down he lost everything  Two, you should get all ready and go out, this one who is pure from inside is from the middle class, especially among the middle class ladies there are many who are housewives or take out the last bit like this, they think that this is our earnings, it is not your earnings madam  Everybody send your leaves because these workers are spoiling the account, many women of 60 to 70 years of age have pain in their knees, pain in their body, pain everywhere in their life, but they have to save a little, story and for whom should they save it  Those kids are not clapping, the husband doesn't know anything, he doesn't eat, money keeps flying around, yes you incur loss, I do n't know the accounts but this 25 paise and 15 paise, I request all the women to make my audience 50,000 their own, 500 Wherever it is less than 1000, do not create much trouble in your life because no one can cause you a loss of ₹500 because ₹500 is a total thing, something will happen for ₹50, that is what I am saying  Yes, and think that we are doing charity because we are not doing any more charity than this, this is also a truth, no I went to the cow shelter and gave Rs. 500 on his birthday, friend, this is not charity, it is a small thing  Whatever you are giving there, definitely give it, but you should merge that and this. In this message, I am not at all saying that you go and donate to the cowshed and see, you donate clothes, which you so called have kept in your mind. They are doing it, I am not telling them to stop and so on but in your daily routine when it comes to actually quitting like this then your hands should not shake like this that if something like this happens to me then please please do this spread the cheese and like thank you"

    "content": "Hello friends, interesting topic, you must have felt that the world is behind me, but I am behind you, there was a famous song, its song, please write that, it is okay to increase your GK daily in the comment area, it is okay, the world is behind me, but I am behind you here.  I will give interest in Toxicity in Relationship that the same do people stand toxic relationship because you have many relationships even before marriage, okay why do you live as fans or and marriage People also travel inside, so I am giving freedom to this thing that we do not have to do it like the world is behind me but I am not going to do it like this after you, what is the reasoning, I am telling him that in a toxic relationship  What is it, a man or a woman, whichever partner he is, becomes controlling and destroys your self-esteem by shaving your body, or you don't have hunger, or you don't have confidence, or you just let it be, or you  It's not enough, by doing this you become quite a doctor, the world likes you, that's why I made the topic, the world is behind you, maybe you are a very good teacher, maybe you are a very good man, you are very respected in the office, your man is gender neutral.  The thing I am telling you is that the world is liking you, the world is behind you in a way, I would say that the world likes you but your partner has kept you under control and has lowered your self-esteem. Now what is the problem that  the world to you  You do n't have anything to do with what she is saying, you just need her love, you need her attention. When you are going to tell me the story, I will tell you with the example of a woman. Again Ritu is singing very well. Hey today your one is very nice. Saree Your looking very graceful this date Your women or whoever you are getting compliments and your husband looks like this to you but you do not say I want something from my husband only, you are an example.  But you understand that this thing is fine, I do n't want to take people like this here, there are so many instituted people here especially and what extra are you, then understand my friend, I believe it is an intelligent audience, it is fine, these are the kind of people who sleep.  Those who have such thinking, if you have subscribed, then do subscribe and there is no need to watch the video from now on. No creator can speak so clearly, I am telling you, it's okay, you understand people. I am in a lot of pain, in consultation, a pattern is emerging, it is happening with men also, it is okay, it is not that it is happening with the man, he is not happy or the girlfriend is not happy.  And she is kept in an institute, she knows that if I make her story more selfish and praise her, then she will not ask me, I am not such a surprised done housewife, my body is shapeless, now look, I am both a girl and a girl.  Going to talk from the other side, there is a balance which is like the body is in the bed and why am I saying this because brother, the body is the attraction, it is a fact in the relationship, it looks good, the body is yours, you do the job, not the housewife, you are yours.  Your husband is better looking than you, he is working hard with money, he is a decent man but you have terrorized him. How many people's life has been like this, what have you done? Madam would have kept it tight because this man's self  The esteem of this woman is very low and what is period time? This process of ours also knows our weaknesses and some things which are our pain points, maybe from childhood, it was not resolved with its help or mother did not do that much in childhood.  Coldness does not give love or the mother gives it to the other sibling. He is a lonely flower or he is a lonely boy. There are many problems in the psychology of lonely children which each and every child is doing.  Yes, you guys, I will make a video on this again sometime. The channel is fine on another channel, this is not a very good matter, then sister, brother, sister and two, it becomes heavy and many people sit with three, I remember attending their birthday anniversaries.  I give relief and give gifts, so you have to understand this thing very well that whenever this is happening please take this think friend, how am I with other people, other people tell me that I have a lot of logical power and a lot of clarity.  Is it or am I very  Well, do I do less or do I have a lot of knowledge about Math or do people like me at my job? It is my juniors who like me and you have to see theirs too or not alone, should I go after her or not when it is my wife and my husband who can do anything to me.  Will say, these are the things under control, there is a lot of such content and videos, now I want to see and listen, today I am giving a little hint and telling that are you the audience ready to do all this because I am only providing all these things for the tree members.  I don't even want to stomach  I am planning to do a lot of things for the bus, it is happening that some videos happen that if they go too much for me after one stage, then I have to read them to remove them, but for whatever reasons, first of all, you can see the bell notification.  Insert, if you are listening to this video, it is okay, if you are listening to the video, it will be released like Tantu, you will know that you can watch it comfortably in 10, 12, 14 hours, but many things are dark things, there are dark things of society, there are dark things of family, there are things which are dark.  but in the open Even discussing it, probably not that many people will be able to see it because he hits the ghosts, they become their desires, there are many of them, some do not like sweets, some have pain due to pressure and by pressing, the pain also increases.  But it gets cured and the reason behind it is that it touches and slaps. You must have seen that you have to remove the pen of the person who is pressing, but if one of the people moves away, then even one slaps the one who is pressing.  He too  It seems that friend, if there are more people trolling me, then I have pierced him like this and then I leave him and say, brother, listen, who has now understood the thing there, then come there who will talk there either.  It may be like this, in my vast experience of consultation, I am seeing these patterns that people forcefully give us toxicity sans ne can call it on, there is freedom, there is no power, there is no movement, you are liberated, neither am I here.  If you can't do this, then someone is showing that you should leave your partner, divorce them, leave the children, I am not saying this, I am saying make yourself a little dominant, your life will be fine, then this or this will also improve or improve.  I am talking gender neutral and he starts saying that madam what about lodging wait I go married you this photo what are you bringing to the table madam give another keeping me self esteem low that I  This is not less, you also do something less, broom is made in the house, utensils are there, food is distributed, there is a driver, there is a car, I am also talking about those houses, I do everything and even a woman does not do it and where a woman does a little or a little.  She takes care of it, she gives it so big like a chingham that I am putting a match in the child, hey, 12 year old children are not raised, 12 year old children are your plates, these children should perform your aarti first, two-four-five years old.  after that children you  Let's see, a child above the age of 10 years is not taken care of, he is doing his own thing for 17 years, 18 years, once you did it, that means once you did it to Hussain Bolt too, when there was as much as a gold medal, the race was not run. You have given birth to your children, you have worked hard, very good, but now you are 40 years old, your children are 12-14-15 years old, what are you doing now madam, so this is all about the society, now what is the matter with me, what is wrong with me?  First I will strike some dialogues, men leave and run away, then I will say something to the women, women will leave and run away, so I only know mine, either you must have seen the channel, many of them talk about such men only. Only he is a lawyer, he says that women are saree Gandhi and getting dirty with men and this is it and he is holding a channel, so all the men got stuck in it because his consistency is that man is poor woman.  If the devil is right, then why has he held this misconception that women are poor men, donkeys, so now I am relieved like this, otherwise I should also increase more. Subscribe to increase your number of intelligent people like me. If you consider yourself intelligent, then your  As soon as it increases, don't accept such foolish people, I am not that military type, it is okay to cut me down, people who write good comments in the comment area are good, that is, they have written good for me, the quality of a comment is good.  Also, what I believe in dialogue, not in controversy, dialogue is English, dialogue should be in dialogue and that man brings you to the table, that man is not important, what is what you bring to the table, what is important, what are we talking about, I talked very logically.  Have you given counter target? Are you more category or I am more poetic? This note is not important. Think what is important is what is being discussed. Topic is important topic.  Only on the topic, it is possible that sometimes you may not understand or like what I am saying, you may not agree or it may be that I have not been able to explain it that well, it may be so, but you can tell me the very effect that I am having on the topic.  If you enjoy it, then just write the image and whoever is listening to me today is liking it, he can show Jaspal that friend, I will increase one subscriber, I have heard that it is good because it is important to be in Patna, moral increases only through this.  this one If you want to see more content, my channel is all about stories where I will get more of that, Namaskar ji, if I can get my strength there then you subscribe, apply a little more force and say yes, one bada diya ji, today two badas.

    "title": "Ek Ajeeb Trend Which Needs To Be Stopped [B5y8V-oZLyU].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, a strange trend is going on and I will guide the youth because this youth is directly evolved in this. People from 18 to 25-30 years of age are a big part of this trend and what is this trend is not known to some people. Considering them very great in the domain, elevating them and those people too play to the gallery, maintain a high morality, then after taking them here, again bringing them down, that is one second, expecting undue from them, then this is the way to make a video  The inspiration behind the region is Vikas Divya Kriti ji, she is a very good teacher, I don't agree with many of her views, that's okay, but the deaths that have happened in the basement are a different matter in Rao Academy.  but he has endured a lot of trolling, does he deserve trolling? He is a person like me who doesn't agree with what ever most of the things which he does and how he positions himself, you can say that I am their  I am in the opposition but I want to say with disdain that he deserves that the incident did not happen in his basement, he has something else going on but he stands there with a larger than life image and children say that people come to Delhi because of him, so he  We have to bear this and in this they are trying their best to give Rs 10 lakhs and money for the death of the children. I am not saying give 10 lakhs, I am saying give 10 crores to someone, but if it is your mistake, here people will blame you.  There is a feeling that by shaming you, by becoming a moral science teacher, by judging you, by attacking your brand value, they are trying to extract it from you and you too are playing to the galleries because you cannot come and say it clearly like I say that give knowledge for money  Le bye bye tata there is no relationship, no guru, it is just a consultation you are idealizing Divya Kriti ji and all the people associated with her and I am giving guidance to the youth, you have to understand carefully that the person who cannot become rich himself, cannot make you rich  first of all this free electricity, free water, free education  The second thing that is free, what did Vikas Dikrit ji do, he told the children of Rao to come to our Karol Bagh store and we will teach you something for free, you need new students, you are taking advantage of their helplessness that if their shop is closed then all the  Students should come, I will give them some paper vapor or something like that, some test waste and once they enroll with me, then maybe later I will also give them a bigger course at a discount, it is not that I am thinking like this, I have no guarantee  No, but this offer which is free offer anywhere is a wrong thing, it will never give you anything, you can be looted by paying money but nothing great is ever going to happen for free, know this, if you take free knowledge from someone then how will you earn money yourself  Will you charge? If you have acquired any knowledge for free, then you have the moral right to pass it on for free. Yes, it should be given for free. There is no respect for everyone. Brothers and sisters, how many times should I explain to you that you gave money to the school. Vikas Divya Kriti ji is a teacher, you cannot see him becoming rich. Some of you are a guru, some are religious men, some are very nice, chubby.  A good man with good things seems like me, I should think like that about myself, no one can see us becoming rich, but this Juba Kesari, he can earn thousand crores, he is selling liquor, these Instagram2 many  Many girls make reels, what do they show, they can earn money because they are [ __ ], [ __ ] can earn money, alcohol can earn money, abuses can earn money, another Ranveer Singh's Bedi ad came, that was with some porn star, I don't know who  So he was selling some medicine, okay, this is something like this, he can earn money, he will get full respect, Deepika Padukone ji, she is a big star, she is authorized to do all these things, but some religious person, some guruji, some Vikas, Divya Kriti ji, some big  If you go around in a car and earn some money, then this should not happen because this is a good work, do not earn money through good work, you can earn money through bad work, you can earn it through gambling, you can earn it through robbery, by taking someone's money, all this  Money is allowed in our society Earning is Divya Kriti ji's fault, I am putting this in this situation, why are you becoming a moral science teacher, why do you come and see, talk softly, do it like this, hey, speak simply, we will take money, we will take money from thousand children, we will take money from 50, corporate social responsibility  Under this, just like other people also give, we will teach you for free, it is just clear, why do you get so Apollo jettic, you don't, they say that someone was saying hey, their English course is for 280000, I say it is a very cheap course for you to become an IAS  You want to become one, Khan sir is teaching you for even Rs. 7000, go there, someone else might be teaching you for Rs. 20, you have come to Delhi, go to a five star hotel and say how come the food is so expensive, it is not a five star hotel, why are you crying  ho, are you deceived, no, it was written in many comment sections that why are these entitlements of children coming because I am taking classes here for the subscribers and we the public, no one can take a glass, by saying the opposite, the subscribers will leave and run away  This will happen, that will happen, that's the fear  No, this is the fear, they are writing and their videos are coming, if they take so much money then they should give guarantee, guarantee that they will pass, guarantee is that we will all die, rest of the guarantee take from your father or mother Take a guarantee of something, when you get married, the boy is saying that I want to take a guarantee, any girl's father wants to take a guarantee that you will never shout at her, will not talk rudely to her, will always respect her He will earn money and he will do it and the girl's wife is shouting, take a guarantee from the girl that you will cook food, you will do it like this, you will be happy, who gives a guarantee about whom right now that I have no guarantee about myself that how will I behave after four days about any of my things  If he gives a guarantee, he means that any Olympic coach will make a student come and learn from him only when he guarantees that son, you will definitely get a bronze medal in shooting, only then will you come to learn. What sense of entitlement is this of the people, the Indian public and the middle class?  What else is the problem? I am telling them that you should also take coaching and you should also become rich. Has anyone stopped you from doing this?  The exam is not passed. You think that 80000 is too much fee. You have no idea how much is the rent of that system which is running. You have no idea how much is the next expense. How many teachers, lecturers are paid? Is its net worth  Is there a profit margin? Are there any challenges in it ? If a situation like Covid arises where money is not coming in and still people have to be paid, then I, like an entrepreneur, can buy a room in Mukherjee Nagar for Rs 8,000 and you can get a five-star hotel for Rs 8,000.  If you get a five star hotel room for one day, you will get it for 30 days and what else do you want for Rs. 8000, this is what comes to my mind, I am surprised, I feel that for so few rupees  Of situational awareness people, these will become our IAS, these will become our IPS, these are our rights, they do not know what is happening in life, how to do it, they have so much sense of entitlement, you have so much sense of entitlement You can read it at home, you can read it in your book, you can take notes from them, you can read it online, you can read it in the hybrid model, but the problem is not only of the children, but I want to say that the problem is of Sandeep Maheshwari, the problem is of Vikas Divya Kriti.  The problem is with some people like Acharya Prashant because they do good work but why do they wear the mask of moral science? I spend 1 minute on my YouTube, if you want then do n't spare even Rs. Don't spare even Rs. Brothers and sisters, subscribe to the channel, like and Also press the join button if you want to earn money and do your RR in life and want to cry and do this then go to these people and then troll them, no one can control me, Guru ji I respect you a lot  I needed some help from you, it will cost money but you are selfish, so you want something for yourself from me for free and I am selfish one, I am asking something from you, I am wanting to give something to you because you only want to approach me  Something so you are wanting something so in the name of giving you something I am wanting something so this is an equal relationship but if you want it for free then I am selfish this is amazing morality that is why the war in our country is not going anywhere go to America Try taking someone's minute for free, then go to America, Singapore, you get nothing by smiling and saying I love you, I like you, go and see, I have great respect for you, give me coffee, no one is going to give you coffee, you will get it in Starbucks like this I love you I  Love Starbucks I love the coffee I love the aroma no because what is the problem, they have grown up watching such movies because the children of today, their parents have given them wrong values, son, your father should read such movies  He may or may not have earned anything, but he had earned a lot of respect, respect is a big thing, your father's name is Master Dinanath Chauhan, then he becomes Amitabh Bachchan in Agneepath and then you can see what mischief he does because he has such a loser father No two tuitions  I got educated because I kept on earning respect and the one who teaches tuition is insulted like this, the donation of education should be free, good liquor should be bought with money, education should be free, amazing brother, all the dirty deeds, all the intoxications, all the cheap things, there is money in them. Yes, Jupiter, Guru will die of hunger and the crow will eat the pearl, why Kaliyuga, brother, why can't Guruji travel in Mercedes, you should feel very happy, your Guruji, remove Guruji, consultant, teacher, all of you, you learn from your mentor, some big person, I will guide you in those good things.  If he is roaming in good condition, he will take you around as well, he himself is in poor condition, so you take free knowledge from the poor person and you have to become like him, he is Juma Kesari, you will not say anything to the Juma Kesari people, we tell them, they can sell anything  Come and do anything rude, these are IPL matches, the cricketer will earn money, hit a four, a six here, he scored 15 crores, 20 crores in IPL, hey your Pat Cummins who was stepping into your World Cup and your  I was feeling a foot on my chest, you give him 20 crores and go to watch his matches, and who is Pat Bastard, the Australian Pat Bastard, okay bastard, you are giving it to him and here if one of yours earns some money, it is a big problem.  Let Pat the bastard earn, you have no problem, he is not only earning money, you are watching him, you are liking him, you are trolling him as well, he is earning money everywhere, a little shame from you, use your brain a little subscriber  I am trolling you people, not everyone, but those who think like this and keep this kind of 80, even such data is not wrong, everyone wants something for free somewhere and that is why now they will make it 10 lakh rupees.  I gave it, it will never happen and if anyone sends the video to Vikas Divya ji, he will say why did you give only 10, you earn this much and if you gave 10 then what big thing did you do, 10 and if you gave the money every time, then it means it is your fault too Hey brother you write to Divya Kriti ji Delhi Administration I am Greater Noida Gurgaon and  Hello all children, let's come there, you will get good rooms and good air, the area is also good, boycott Delhi, boycott MCD, boycott Delhi government, boycott everything, boycott Mukherjee Nagar and Odd Rajar Nagar, the people of Delhi are earning money and giving you city services.  If you are living there then why do you live there, they say it was in the basement then why did you go to the library, if you were not in it then what should we do, what should we do, then this is what happens with helpless people in life, you should get your fees back from there  I had to take it but everything is acceptable, if something happens then it is going on otherwise, so pick it up as it is, start a campaign right now, boycott old Rajendra Nagar and Mukherjee Nagar by hashtag, leave them, bye bye tata on your own, thank you for Kota also.  One day, hey, it is the medium of technology, friend, you do not have to shake hands with the teacher, thousands of children are sitting, they are sitting behind, you do not have to touch him, you cannot even see, in this video, you can see me clearly and hear me clearly what  You can see that the 20 children sitting at the back and in the front understand something and listen, and in such a crowd, will anyone read? Study it peacefully, do you want to parrot something? What do you want to understand? Those preparing for UPSC, what do you want to understand?  But why do you teach this high moral science and it also becomes this, just say it straight, it is an institute, take the books, I am giving you knowledge, you just give me money, that's it, if you enjoy it then it's great, if you don't, it's okay  If he is selling the course and giving it away then what will happen with it, nothing will happen with it, yes I have a pre marital consultation of Rs 400-500, it is super hit, should I take it from this, why are you asking me, no, but I am not telling you why not,  There is no guarantee, there is guarantee about only one thing, we will all die, why are the teachers giving so many explanations, learn, if not learn, don't learn, you go to watch a movie, you eat at a hotel, you say this before eating at the hotel Do a little test only then if it is good then I will tell you, I will not understand the review, how does the review system work  Do you guys even know that in digital, reviews can be managed so easily, you know how many reviews come, so you should keep in mind one thing that you do not get anything for free and since it is running for free, that is why you  You cannot do any of your work, you are so judgemental, every time you come you will judge me, if I do not make videos in high production value quality then people judge me, so whatever is shown in very high production value, it earns more money.  It is not they who are earning, we like them, so why not, I will do everything just to make you look good, by managing my production quality, I will make sure that the products reach most of the people in a reasonable budget, I am teaching this to you only because you judge me  Many people like me, I teach this technique to kids, this technique is also a very big technique, you judge it, what is the problem with that, when you start, if your production quality is also not good, then you will never make it because you judged me, I am saying here  I am saying that this will work for life long, there will be no education, no one will lag behind, some great animation  You will not come to acquire any knowledge, earlier the guru used to sit under a tree, neither the tree would move nor the guru would move, everyone would sit below and take all the knowledge, it was the gurukul system of India, the same one used to explain maths to you, the same one used to explain English to you  There was no teacher at that time who used to teach Hindi, Sanskrit or whatever and he also taught gardening, astronomy, astrology, everything, he was the only one and he used to sit there and teach cooking and also taught Surya Namaskar and he did not have any Shashi Shiksha  They did not come and India had 25th GDP in the world, now here the country is poor, thinking is poor, people are poor, everyone is poor and now there is a fight here, everyone wants everything for free, hey, it was not available for free even at that time, the children had to do labour there  The child had to grow the food there. Even today this system is running in many places, where big gurus have employed people on 101 jobs, they complete the work for salary and they are still happy because they get food.  If you get it, if you get it then you will never get anything for free, so you have to have some expectations This trend of pushing someone up is very bad. Why are you pushing him up, why are you climbing higher and higher? Those who climb up enjoy it a lot. When they were climbing they were giving respect. Did n't you see with what mindset you have gathered these people?  So, I should bring everybody together, many children are impressed by me, many youth are impressed and they might impress me and take me somewhere and then if anything goes wrong, hey brother, don't associate with such people, they are losers.  I want to tell you that you are a loser, you want everything, you can neither pay money nor charge anyone, you will keep roaming around like a poor person, the rickshaw puller is better than you, he does not say that it will cost Rs. 100 to go there, that's it, you tell the rickshaw puller a lot, Bhaiya  -Thank you very much, please drop me there for free, don't you say it, you know you have to give it to the rickshaw puller, only those who are in the field of knowledge want it for free, brother, if free knowledge is available then it will be a free job only, why do you bargain with the school person  I don't do it, the school fees are so high, why don't you tell them this friend  Why are you charging so much fees, you are not paying much to the teachers and this school of yours is 40 years old, you did not build it yesterday, whose money will you pay, why charge so much fees, if you bargain a little you will not do it there, there is no hospital there  I will not bargain with the doctor saying that doctor saheb, 5 lakh rupees to open a market like this is a good idea, you have already completed your studies, you too had studied 30 years ago, the fees were not so much at that time, you will not pay there also  You will put everybody in jail but you will give people a upper hand in the system here, that is why no one is coming, all the scholars will leave the country, Divya Kriti ji is such a scholar, she is a very good scholar, I respect her, I do n't understand some things  So we can always agree to disagree and what I am saying is that whatever I don't like about his words is not right, it may be that my thought process is wrong but if children in the country are ridiculing Dispina in this way then why don't they  They make it and don't respect it just because someone charges money, okay Brother, without money no one will come to clean the house, even for sweeping and mopping you have to pay, so whatever you want to say to your guru or teacher, lecturer, consultant, tell them, they will be available for free, now if you want good service then you will get it  If it is not available then discuss it further, no one is refusing it saying that you are paying 2.8 lakh I will not sit here, so sit in some other good safe place in Gurgaon, don't go to any other place, Mukherjee Nagar, that place  This is all I have, so you have to come there, if you are compelled, then your compulsion is taken advantage of, it is a simple thing, nothing is going to happen by crying because there are children sitting there protesting, I have to address those children also  I want, we are sitting here, we will fix it, Mukherjee Nagar is never going to be fixed, Old RJD Nagar will never be fixed, let R City be rubbish, old places, low line places, no one can come and fix it there, even the Prime Minister says if you fix these, it won't happen.  That place is not worth going to, it is a useless place, something might happen to you there  So for Rs. 8,000 will you get a five star hotel where you can have a view from the back and a view of the swimming pool in the front. You won't get rooms like that, you will be living in a ghetto. Have some self esteem, get out of that place if becoming an IAS is in your destiny.  And if you have talent, you can become one from anywhere else too. Don't these South Indian people become IAS? Does n't anyone come out from Chennai and Kerala? Is no one from Tamil Nadu coming out of UPSC? I don't see them studying in Old Rajendra Nagar, this Old Rajendra Nagar and this Maximum people in Mukherjee Nagar are from UP and Bihar, maximum are from UP and Bihar, I cannot see the rest, find your own place brother, why does everyone have to come here and after coming they have to cry about poverty, hey brother why are you crying about poverty Yes, brother, where will you get a room in Delhi for less than Rs 8000, please tell me where you can get a room that has AC installed, they do not tell you that it has AC installed, geyser installed, attached toilet, you do not have to stand in any line, you also get a bed  I have paid for the mattresses and the electricity bill too in the same  If it is included then what will be the problem in it brother, at least buy a yard for seven to eight lakh rupees, if you don't want to pay and if you assume that your parents are poor then it is not the fault of the people of Mukherjee Nagar, Old Rajendra Nagar, they will still have to pay Rs 8000  If you do not take it then do not study but this thing should not be taken because of my poverty if someone subsidizes it from outside and you are taking the help of reservation, you are taking the help of reservation, those who cannot take it, they cannot take it now why were you born  You grew up in a family where you don't get reservation, how long will someone keep crying about this and the crying never ends, brother of Yut, whatever you focus on, your life will be ruined, you will keep crying, RR says no, and you will keep doing the same and you will see this  that you will see it practically, yes what is this world, I want to tell the youth in this world, nobody knows you anything about me, everyone has tried their own thing, no one came to teach anyone, he came to give for free, all their own people died.  the heaven that appears  You can see them in heaven as well, they died on their own and only then did they get heaven, you too will have to die to see heaven, I am not saying literally but people will literally have to work hard unfortunately, no one is going to come and do anything or stop them  It is not going to happen and nothing is going to happen even by sitting on a dharna, someone will come and make promises to you by sitting on the dharna, nothing can be done, neither if some vegetable is prepared badly, it is not going to be rectified by sitting on the dharna.  No, the next one will be fine but here vegetables are not being cooked, first of all there is that infrastructure, I will do coaching in Delhi only, I will do it in Rajendra Nagar only and I will improve the infrastructure of Rajendra Nagar only and I want a room here only and I also want a room  You want one worth Rs 9000 and it should be breathable, there should be a balcony, there should be a view and there should be facilities as well. What are you doing friend, who will tell me? I am surprised. Do you have low IQ? Do n't the youth have intelligence? A little harsh.  It seems so but these emotions are getting awakened because I am seeing them  I am speaking and I look at them like this, the kids who are being interviewed, the news channel people are going to me, I feel like, oh hello, you are becoming an IAS, this is the knowledge of the public, you will become like this and then Your heart will beat so much for the public and as soon as you become one, you are selfish friend, you are the biggest among all, when you are here, you want something for free, then you have to do something here, then you don't want to do a job and if someone comes and tells you then this  Classism is happening, it should not happen like this, parents need to use their brains, stop sending their children to Delhi, they are very toes, they will not get any benefit here and they will come out as big losers, the chances of becoming a loser are 99.99% 075  But still the selection rate is not the same, all the people who come to UPSC and if you take the reservation angle then it is even lower, the one who doesn't get reservation then his chances are even lower, so don't waste your life at least daily, if you have to waste it then do something clean  place tax  Okay, if you have to waste something then do it in a clean place, if you waste your life in a bad place, you will feel more bad where the air is good, the water is good, mummy ji, my friend, you are getting mummy's food, you are getting completely clean clothes in the house.  The house is clean, I can see my father's face, sometimes I can see my brother and sister too. I have this book, this pen and I will make notes like this and teach you the exam. I don't have to go anywhere. I get my food on time.  There is no one to go to Miss, you don't have to wash your clothes, underwear and vest yourself, if mother washes them then you must be washing your underwear and vest yourself in Mukherjee Nagar, you must be getting the bus ironed yourself, you must be going to eat food, then if she is unhappy in class then brother it is better to stay at home  Read it, you will save two-four hours and if you get a clean life then there is a higher chance of passing here, this is Mukherjee Nagar and these people have done another scam, these people are huge, I hope you have some good videos till here  I am watching from and whoever understood this thing, brother, see this All of their cases are open in the name of IAS, then this will happen, they say that these people of ours were selected, listen carefully what do these people do, 10 lakh children give the exam, 15000 of them do the prelims, their children are among them  No, even among the 3000 out of 15000 who qualify for the interview, their children are not there but he calls 100 children out of 3000, calls someone for mock interview for Mock Inter and claims that they studied with him Hey, if 100 children out of 3000 do their mock interview, then brother, Haj was getting selected anyway, this is a big scam, a separate detailed video will be made on this, like and share this one, thank you very much"

    "content": "Hello friends, Interesting Topic Main Women and Bus Seat We have seen in buses, you can do this in metros also but let me tell you with the example of bus, it is written for women in the bus, it is written for women and this is my observation.  One has to sit in the bus to get the content and the observation of General Society which is under my discussion, tell me today I wish to give clarity on this, many boys and men go and sit on the women's seats. Go and women have to come, I will tell you from the example of Delhi, okay, how much is the remaining space, you guys write in the comment section, some seats are reserved in your city, it is okay for women, there are about 15 buses, there are some in each. I will also try to tell why this figure of 15 is there. Okay, first of all, if Shivri was for men then there would be no need for reservation. Ideally speaking, seats for ladies.  It should not be given, it is equal, yes, I will discuss it, I have seen many comedy scenes, as soon as you are sitting on a woman's seat, if a woman comes, then first close your eyes and act like I am sitting, she is also sitting.  It's okay if you don't pick me up, don't pick me up, then she will come straight, a little more aggressive in Delhi, girls and I don't mind her because being aggressive is their self-defense mechanism, a man has to be rude for survival, it's okay. Why should one wake up without being rude? If someone does not get up with love, someone comes and says, brother, brother, uncle is okay, sir, okay, please do like this and get up, then why would the girl be rude, her experience is not like this, she knows how to get up without being rude.  It is not just that what happens sometimes is that the man is a bit decent and if that girl comes and misbehaves with him then the issue becomes that why did you not speak comfortably and in many cases I  I have seen such a fight happening that it is a ladies seat, wait a minute, you are fighting, I will not give it to you, there aunty or didi or someone, I will come and give it to you, because this is a ladies seat, I will not give you a fight, all these comedies.  That is, I will not let the ladies sit, I will give it to her and she will come and sit, then why are these things happening, why has this society become like this, in favor of men and boys, I do not call it domestic.  Violence 498 Girls Dirty Girls Aggressive Men Are Not Able To Handle Because I only ever tell this to the tree person because it gets dark a little bit. Many people must have heard this who are my members etc. or in webinars but the fact is men are  Not behaving like men, no these girls, you are a man, brother, yes, it's okay, they are equal, first of all, man and woman are equal, neither were, nor can be, nor can anyone do.  Men and women are different. How can two different people be equal? Equal opportunities should be given. There are 30 days in a month at the age of 15. There are 30 days in a month. Menstruation occurs for four or five days. Menstrual cycle occurs for women between 18 and 48.  Whatever group is there, what does 18 mean, it is from 13, but if you look at the children who go out in this way, then they work out at 15.  If you see, some day someone had put in mind that if women of this group are going then it has to be accepted that if you ever see 100 women anywhere then at least 15 in that group would be menstruating.  Standing at the default setting at that time is a matter of difficulty, so someone has put a figure at 15, will they say now or not, why not at 30, at 50, at 15, now many people say. That all the women who are there should sit on the 15 seats. Why are you sitting on the other one? Now even a woman has the wisdom to say that if this is a woman's seat and the rest are sitting empty, then I should sit on the vacant seat because one of my women is mine.  A sister of my gender has the right to sit at 15, but people think that no, she is only 15. Why, when God made the gender 5050, then why would only a woman sit at 15?  If you don't want to come out then this is not an idol society, we don't have main Shivas, that's why we had to make a lady, if she is pregnant or has any problem, if she is older, then brother, you do n't have to come, I am old, I am a man, but this is a young girl.  Still, you will have to pay while sitting on a woman's seat. Who gives up his second reservation where there is no women's turn? There is a reservation system in jobs or competitive exams held for big institutions.  Does he leave his wife? My father is an IAS but I also get it under the law, so I leave him because he is mine, no one leaves his own, so why do you expect from women, where rice is given to someone.  The government has given ration, it is an entitlement, if someone leaves his share where he has got it legally, then why do you expect, why are you shaming him, the society has to see that this is needed because. Men are being brought up, they are being brought up, there is an issue inside them, it is the woman who is bringing them up, look at every man, whether he is someone's wife or not because you can remain a bachelor, sister may not be someone's because she was not born but  Everyone has a mother. Does the son understand his mother's pain? Does the mother tell him openly what are the issues? Son, why am I irritable today? Son, it is not because of your grandmother.  Only and Papa because I am having periods and this is that time of the month when a man's patience levels go up, he feels like not working, irritation levels remain, cramps come in the body, why don't men become sensitive?  It is shown that only mother is his idol, sacrifice and everywhere else he has a sense of entitlement because son, you have come, I have prepared the food. Hindi You have seen all the old pictures of that one Nirva Rai, she is making it like this, she is doing all the work in the house, she gets up in the morning and starts working. Mothers hold all the boys and say to them, wash your underwear.  Take na tell them, wash your clothes, na tell them, dry your clothes, don't you have a bedsheet, you are a son, you have become a son, India, especially for boys in North India, boys have been born, the biggest achievement is that it is your catchment, we have been born boys.  Yes, we are born as boys, it is our greatest achievement, all this has happened in Haryana, especially boys in Haryana, now change is happening, well, through the videos of people like us, there is nothing greater than being born as a man, nothing.  Great there is nothing great being born as a woman it is like we have to look beyond gender we have become a boy so brother you are a man your responsibility is protection  And civil women say whatever they want, fight for their rights, okay, there should always be equality of opportunity. Well, you come to ask for your place everywhere and you get equal rights, but then why can't you stand here, oh very much.  She also stands up, it is not that everyone wants it, everyone says this, many girls say that you should keep sitting but she will definitely scold you, so whenever you see such a situation in the society, next time if you see it like this, if you  If you are sitting then please tell that man to get up brother, don't argue, this is theirs, the government has told me, I see men traveling in ladies' place, then the police even beats them with batons, lady police beats you, don't travel brother.  It is going empty, let it go, it is empty right now, then it will be filled later, now you feel empty, oh it is going empty, we are going here filled, oh then next she comes, now you are feeling a little empty seat, you sat down and then she comes.  gone again What will you do, if there is an empty seat in the bus, it is okay to sit, but as soon as she boards, you will have to give her seat. And from somewhere, please, I have a request to a few people, friend, historical, if you look at the British, then watch their movies or their old ones.  If you want to say My Lady, My Lady, My Lord, you will have to say My Lady also. You will have to respect Ladies First, which is an English saying. It is the British who have the most respect for the ladies.  Women are fed first. Which are the institutions in our country where ladies and children are fed? I see it in weddings or at many places, this is a normal setup. Men are the biggest talkers. Ladies should always be first, everyone is there.  In anything, the priority has to be given to ladies and children and men, so I said that we should also have a commission, oh friend, drown yourself.  Men, man, man is running the world, man, I am also running the world, so I am the one who needs protection, who needs protection, whoever does not have equal rights is not equal, man is running you too, if it works, then the world will work again.  So no, why do we have this competition with girls? Any girl needs to be respected and protected, whether she wants or doesn't want, that's a different matter, if she is ill-mannered then it does n't matter.  She has bad manners, she is a man, you are a man, you will do such things, why do you get involved in a buffalo, why do you get involved in a buffalo, it is difficult, being a man, being a real man, a real man, a complete man, it is not easy, I have seen women go through a lot of hardships. And then it seems that why didn't he do it, many people will stand up, you will have to have patience, you will have some patience, now I am digressing a little.  I am getting out of the bus and coming back to normal behaviour. You keep it a little, we have seen a lot of cases, if you have a little patience, there will be people, this is the era of social media, videos and videos are made, everything remains, there will be people, let's call out.  Their Bad Behavior Also, you should see why half the time women react like this because the DNA they have been carrying throughout their life is that they will tease, touch, molest and then some.  If there is a problem then it is their self defense mechanism like I don't want to take the name of some particular animal but you can see for yourself that anyone will be an animal in fear, I am calling an animal an animal because a human being is even higher than that, any human being.  Will it be an animal or any creature, let's say when it doesn't behave rationally in fear, it comes to bite, then you should look from within that what has society done to this girl that the girl is coming to bite, I have something inside. Our gender has not done butt since What are the experiences of her life, what are her childhood experiences, are they from college, are they from the bus? Who was touching her? Look, women are so intuitive and have so much wisdom. Call it that they have different sensitivity or whatever sensitivity they have.  That a woman is standing like this in the bus and a man is standing like this and the collision happened like this, that woman understands that it was because of the bus hitting the brakes, was it because she was willing or was taken advantage of, that much intelligence is there in her, there is a difference. She is evil, isn't she? She is not calling out, she is growling from within, as if it means that she is an animal instinct. If we talk about the animal kingdom, it is better if someone is teasing like this. It means that they are saying that  Instead of us traveling, it is better that decent boys should travel because out of 10, two are decent, eight are scoundrels and two are right thinking, so we will remain like this because I  They don't have time to check many times, to investigate what were your feelings, so they are trying to paint everyone with one brush, but this is for the boys to do and whatever is going on in the mind of the boys, that is what is going on in the mind of the women.  They take it because the universe has made it such that a woman has to become a mother because when a mother has a small baby, she cannot say anything that she wants this, so that instinct is given in the girls without saying anything.  what needs to be installed And what is happening is that call it radar or call it frequency or call it whatever makes sense in science, now that you have one of these, improve your behavior a little and every human being has a sister, mother or daughter at some point of time.  There has to be someone, it has to happen, everyone has to be a mother, so next time through this video, if you leave your seat or ask me to leave, please write in the comment section. If I have managed to impress even 20-30 people. So this video is successful Please share this and I am not speaking from a high moral point here, I do not want to become a normal moral science teacher of the society, I also say this to the society, I am a practical man but I am saying this simple thing that if you do this you will feel.  Nice a man always feels nice when he behaves like one and unfortunately those who say men are becoming less, don't know which party you are becoming, what are you becoming. You men have to be brave, those who are our soldiers, if you ever interact with anyone, the number of people who do the work of killing and killing is fine, the legal people who are in the government system are very civil, check, check, check.  You may be familiar with your relatives, that organization thrives in Shivari, and that is what the women and the women like the best one of the best straights in a man, whether they say it or not, they say it tomorrow. Like you, many times I also take classes on how girls like boys actually and there is no problem in becoming like this. Shivri shows that if you are going then you have opened the gate for someone, you have opened the gate of the car.  Pulled the chair, these people do not become slaves like this, this is civil, who will teach, where will teach, I am teaching, you have to learn, in the comment section you will find webinar info group, I will teach you that a good man and a man who is called real.  How to become a man who can attract women, for them it is a matter of security for them, for them it is a matter of trust, for them it is a matter of respect, so that is the respect of a woman, you will get affection, whatever is dependent on the relationship, you will get everything but sitting.  There have been such bitter people here and there are no such people anywhere and there is no cost in doing all these things, it is okay that you go and make hair spikes like this, make something like this or make Dole Sholay.  No one asks for them, no one asks that much, went on a bike, went on style, manage the basic etiquettes properly, you will attract, then the looks will also be useless, the intelligence will also be less, the money will also be less, it will be better if you have a little good manners. Go, if you want a webinar on this with almost free cost, then please write. Boys, boys, especially, okay, yes, teach us Guruji, no one is teaching us, everyone does this to us because  If we live like this among ourselves too, is it okay then please write in the comment section that you have to organize, I will get it organized, I will do only the free one from the For The Age group of lets, it is ok between 202 27, 22 27 28, if you actually  We want to come, we will not make you feel like this, we are like this, how can I be nice to woman, then I will become a slave, who told you this?  Who told you that if you are nice and Shiva then you become a slave, you are no longer a man, where did you learn this, who taught you this, who taught you in the family, write in the comment section, then you will have to change the thinking level, please share this video, like it comment.  Please write in the section thank you very much"

    "title": "Financial Influencers Ka Kaala Sach ｜ Did You Also Lose Out ？ [nFhLclV88bg].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, the dark truth of financial influence, this is not a sensation type video, that topic has been posted but has to be posted many times, to tell it, I want to tell the dark truth of financial influence and you tell me whether this is the dark truth or not, it is okay, please check it completely. You can check this very well by applying it on not one, not two, not three, but all. Brother, in the last two or three years, these financial information have told the whole world that rent  Why is it better to stay at home? Why is this SIP good and buy all these stocks and do not buy a house? Knowledge in a pinch, in a pinch, and courses, by selling, by selling, by selling, they bought the house themselves. Now they show half of it, they have done it and  Half of them are not shown, the only difference is whether it is the dark truth or not, brothers and sisters, you tell me this, you tell me this, the financial YouTube and this influence and all these become big and the knowledge is complete because you have been invested in them.  5000 10000 20000 is fine in SIP, hit your limit in two-three years, it has become 2 4 5 6 8 10 lakhs, this is it, if anyone has more than this, then tell me will it be a gain of 10 20 30 or 5 10  It depends on when and what market you have entered and where you will reach by selling financial products and getting you to download these financial apps.  By selling financial products to you, doing affiliate marketing, typing with all the financial people, you have been engaged and have bought houses yourself, real estate and many of you are also taking real estate courses and about real estate, real estate.  They are also talking and then now they have started saying under the garb of transparency that we too, we have figured it out that how will we do it. When I was speaking for 3 years, brothers and sisters who followed my talk.  Curry because I always used to say that look at real estate also, real estate is good, I never said that stock market is bad, I always say this dialogue that brother, we people of Haryana will eat gulab jamun and kheer also.  We will eat and also eat halwa. Why do we say that this is good, that is good, that is. Do you have only one bowl, something can be eaten in the whole bowl, a little bit of something can be eaten. Buffet is eaten but how much loss is there if you are listening to this video and because of your because I have heard from many women that my husband listens to that influencer and he did not buy it, now he cannot buy it because of the property.  The rates have increased so much in Pan India Top 7 10 12 cities where this urban crowd lives, whose property is left out in Bengaluru, Pune, Gurgaon, any of our top cities.  It is okay in Hyderabad and below in Mumbai, where in Mumbai, take 7, 8, 10 cities. It is okay including Kolkata. Okay, so brother, tell me whether the rates have been calculated and whether the rent has been calculated because this brother always says that the rent is at Rs. 3.  What happens is that if the property doubles and the rent is still at 3, then the original price has become 6. And if the property doubles again, the rent will still be at 3 but now it will be at 12. No.  While explaining the matter, it is easily known to them that you brothers and sisters have bought a flat worth Rs 1 crore and its rent is Rs 25000, although in today's cases the rent is also Rs 44 but only three people are paying it. They say this from their own mouth. So brothers and sisters, when they  If a property worth 1 crore becomes worth 2 crores, will the rent remain only 3 lakhs? It has become 6 lakhs but that 6 lakhs is also 3 lakhs worth 2 crores. So we will tell this story again. 4 After a year, I sold you, it is going to be three. Oh man, if I have taken NHPC share for ₹ 1 or I have taken ITC share for ₹ 1, then if ITC share is ₹ 400, then rental dividend is given at ₹ 4.  If he is giving then I have taken it at 100, for me it is at 16, no, wo n't you say, no no no, it is actually at 4. Only for you because of the current price E 427 Hey brother, how will I invest, I had invested ₹ 1. If I tell you one thing, if I bought 1000 shares worth ₹ lakh, brothers and sisters, at an average price of ₹ 1, then I have 1000 shares.  So when I get dividend then will I get those Haj Shers which is 1000 Shers then if I am getting ₹ dividend then that  It will be called 4000 and if ₹ sorry is at ₹ 4 today according to today's 417 then for me it was at 16, I got 000, this thing you understand that if the quantity is 00 at 4, rental aid at 4 means dividend.  Meaning ₹ Dividend I hope I am able to explain, my sh doesn't come very quickly so I hope the audience understands something, so much thinking  An audience is needed because the one who is talking about Shik Shik shows that he is wrong. Again, let me explain in detail, if I have a share of Rs. 00 and its dividend is fixed at Rs. 4, then that means I get ₹ 1 dividend on one share. Yes and No. How many did you buy for Haj worth Rs 1 lakh? If I have Haj shares then I will get Rs 16000. Now if I am getting Rs 16000 as dividend and my capital is invested. If I bought a house in Janakpuri 35 years ago, half of their subscriber base is less than 35.  So that example will never understand. Hey brother, some day you will also become old and keep on doing these things. Then the black one about whom I am telling and the brother of Janakpuri is flat only DDA.  It was worth 2 lakhs, the Maiji one was worth 3 lakhs, it was made by furnishing the house, after that its rate came to Rs. 1.5 lakhs, its capital price once hit 2 crores, now it has fallen down and goes the other way.  It 's okay, after falling again, it's 170, 180. I'm telling you a real type example, I'm not fantasizing, so brother, it's a 70, 18, 80, this is one story too. Will tell him that this works out to just 8 only so mutual funds have given share market is actually given at 14 and something that means hey why won't you count his rent not you but you had taken a loan and the interest was gone.  Also yes yes yes but I didn't even have the money when I took it, someone had it for 3 lakhs, he had 3 lakhs, did he have 2 lakhs or 2.5 lakhs?  The loan was taken at that time, after which the loan was also repaid and after the loan was repaid, income tax rebate was also taken on the loan. Even after that the rent kept increasing. Today the rent is 45 lakhs. Sometimes it would have been 3 lakhs, sometimes 2 lakhs, sometimes 2 lakhs.  Brother, he is also earning 100% rental lead for the last 20 years and beyond that, brothers and sisters, I have put the money that came from the rent in his mutual fund and there  He grew at 14 so now tell me where are the returns. Ask Warku ji who is an excel expert? Post this case study sometime and see, Warku ji has reached SIP till 90 years. Now he is also writing books but Everyone is misleading everyone in the wrong way. Without a house, marriage is not happening. You bought a house in 24 years, 25 years. Hey, how can you buy a house in 24, 25? How can you buy one, why not?  Do n't spend on the wedding, neither the boys nor the girls will buy a house, no, but so much expense, yes, so much middle class, such a crazy butch spends so much, actually he can give them a house, yes I am not joking, I don't say  Give me a house worth two crores, give me a flat worth Rs. 70 lakhs and 80 lakhs, give me half of it, make part payment, they will take the rest of the loan, their rent will be saved What I am trying to say in today's time if you  Do Not Buy a House of Your Own Chutku Sa Match Box What many people like to call Match Box in the Sky If You Don't Have a Match Box in the Sky You're Going to Bleed a Lot of Rent and Not Create Wealth That's the Message This is the Dark Truth  Anytime because come and tell me once, after that videos are not made again. Videos have to be made daily. Best mutual fund for SIP. If you start SIP at 22 years then How much benefit will you get if you do it for 30 years? How much benefit would you get if you did it 8 years ago? Okay, now hey man, he is tired, man, you have realized how many apps are available these days, put any interest rate in it and it is done.  Presuming that I will get returns at 8, 12, 14 or whatever at 14 is a wrong assumption after 7 years when the economy will be Rs 3 trillion to Rs 5 trillion or five to Rs 10.  If you increase your base then it will not be that much. A student who scores 90 cannot increase his marks at the rate of 10 per year. Why is he sitting at 90 marks, but a week student who scores 3035 marks can increase his marks every year by 15 at 30.  From ji I have taken number 38. From 38 to ji I have taken 50. From 50 to 60 I can reach soon. Why is the base lower? As the base is more  It Will Become Very Difficult And It Will Become Very Difficult To Get Any Return From Any Asset Class Single Digit Returns Is What Maximum You Will Be Able To Accept In Coming Times So If You First Build Your Base In Real Estate More This food, clothing and house is a requirement of a human being but they will never tell you, they will tell you that you are buying a house for the bank, the bank is benefiting.  The bank is benefiting, beyond that they will plant your pepper but will not tell that if you commit because many people will be affected by the moment you commit a big amount chunk to the home and suddenly you will not be interested in this car. Because you will not buy a car as often because once you have bought a house, you do not change things so often, then you wear those shorts and vests for a longer time, you wear clothes more, you wear the phone more.  Yes, even when you go out for a walk, you people assume that this is financial influence. Again, they know everything. They are all smart. They assume that all the money that is going to the house and the savings that is there, you judicially. It is not assumed anywhere that you will buy a phone worth Rs 500 instead of a phone worth Rs 20,000, you will buy a car worth Rs 10 lakh instead of a car worth Rs 6 lakh. You will buy a car, instead of spending Rs 3 lakh a year on traveling around, you will spend Rs 7 lakh, you will start a program for your child's education, hobby classes, you will start his tricks, there will be no money left, even if you have no assets, then something will happen.  Not only do you have this thing which is being presented in a wrong way again and again, it is very wrong and these people themselves have earned money by suppressing it, there is one in Raipur, YouTube, tell its name. What is that, my father and mother do not let me do it openly but I will tell you what to do in real estate, what is the name of it, do something like this, just because you speak the truth, a dozen absorb you of giving a lot of bad advice and then  Everybody is changing the tune and now we will change more tunes in the future Mama tune changes Many people's tune will change You haven't seen me changing my tune I am telling this consistently and even today I am a stickler  I am telling you by necking out that there is a bull run till 2029 30, this 1 trillion dollar real estate will become the only real estate in the economy, 330 340 350 billion dollars is going on, now it means three times only real estate, real estate will grow much faster than the  The Economy Itself and It Will Become About 23 24 on Off the Economy in the Next Se to 8  Years because of so many phenomena are taking place, people want to stay in independent units, daughter-in-law, son do not want to live with parents, divorce is happening, couple who used to work in Bangalore after divorce, the one in Bangalore does not go to the job with the parents.  If you don't want to live with your parents, son, if you don't want to live then that divorced girl will also not go and stay there, she will also stay there somewhere, she will also stay somewhere.  The tradition of living in couples is going on, getting married late, now you are delaying the marriage, then you are also earning money, the girl is also earning money, ideally speaking, if they had got married on time, 25 26 27 28 years.  If I had done this then they would have stayed in the same house but now they are saying that we are not getting married or are awakening our conscience or do not want to get married or are having a heart break or are not in the mood right now or right.  Tantalum Male is not getting a partner, both of them are not getting married, so both of them will want independent units to stay, whether they are from one BH, two BH, living in or with a friend, they are changing daily.  There may be some wish but there will be a requirement of the units and the society is going in the way when if we have these surveys and census nowadays then it would be considered rude.  The data is bad, it will never come out because you will never collect it, but these are some good things too which we get for analysts, if you take out the data and see the numbers of an Indian family who lived in the same house.  How many were there? There was a time when you see that seven to eight people in a family lived in one household. Physically, eight people lived under one roof. Was the roof small or big or very big? That number is falling, that last.  Time recorded it was I think somewhere between 5.2 or 4.8 Now I am saying it will fall down to four and then may be three so what will happen is i If the population of the country is 150 crore then 150 Let's do a rough calculation of crores and see how much difference it makes. Take 150 crores, that's 150 crores, if those 75 lakh people live in one house.  If we live in a unit, we need 20 crore houses. We need 75 crores of houses. If we find an average, we need 20 crores. Well, if five people live in one unit, then we need 30 crore houses. If only five crore people live in a unit, then only five people live in one unit. We have five people and if we divide by 150 then we need 30 crore units. We need any kind of floor, flat, builder floor or any house, cottage, whatever you call it, it is fine and if it is five to four.  If it goes from F to four then we need 37.5 or something like that and if it goes towards three then we need 50 crore units. Now you will see the complexity of this that what is happening inside the village, migration is happening outside but  What is happening inside the cities? If you see inside the cities, then this average will be less than that of today. Already the average of India is high in the villages or the poor are very poor people, then when the very poor are  If you are me, then you are a family of eight or ten people living together. As soon as you get some money, the first thing a man would want is a little pre-order. We used to be nine people living in one roof, now there are four and five of us.  A lot of requirements will come from the bottom up to deny that population is not growing to that extent in the coming times, although it is still growing at 2 crores. 2 crores means we are still dying 2 crores.  If I divide 80 lakh people every year by four, then it will be 70 lakh. This is only organic growth. A different game of migration is going on. A different game of buying the remaining independent units is going on and the requirement is more in big cities, only then you will see.  That the top 10 cities of India are doing very well in real estate for the last two-three years and I see them doing well in the next five years, so continue to understand this. Product And Understand Real Estate I Bring Real Estate Awareness Like Nobody Else Does In The I Call Myself The Number One Clarity Giver On This Topic In The Comment Section You Have More Than A Whatsapp2 Maybe Well Beyond That I Do Polls And You Guys  By participating in those polls, they also see the results that this is happening and it is a very high number, right, so nowadays on the TV screen, this will become PM, that will become 00 people's vote.  It happens that the Chief Minister is arrested, will it have a negative or positive impact, on top of this, there is the result of the survey, how many people participated in the survey, 1300 people, they make such a big channel, brother, I alone am sitting with so many.  You will get direct benefit and I will also get benefit because real people have real opinion, only then I come and tell you the trends and all these things, so please you can join both the things and also the other one."

    "title": "Finfluencers NEVER Tell You About This One Factor While Investing ｜ Catching The Trends [gYaagYF-So8].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today I will tell you one important factor in investment which is not being done by any financial influencer on YouTube because everyone has made a model. Brother, for a job worth ₹ 15000, you ship it for ₹ 2000 and every year if you invest 10% of your money.

You will definitely get this 15%. Like if I have scored 150 runs in 15 overs, then 500 runs will be scored in 50 overs. It will not be scored. Brother, your victory will fall. You may have ₹200, ₹300 more notes left.  Look at the country, it is what it is, you are happy to go, so Papa said, 50 came only for 50, only Papa did it like this, 40 used to come, Papa did this.  It is 50 but there are 90 A's, 92 A's are there, if the base is too low, then 92 is not going to be 93, you will have to study to get your life. Do you understand that this example is given like this, but the fact of life is this only investment. 22 March  You will get ₹15000 ₹25000 ₹30000 ₹50000 if you are happy with the work and here.  Be happy that you have given so much in this mutual fund of SIPSP game, I will put some money in Bitcoin, I will put some in Ethereum, that uncle told, he told then block thinking technology is doing very well, then I will put it there, then I will put this NFT.  I have forgotten that I used to talk a lot just now, people are asking about what happened 2 years ago, and because it is taught further, because nowadays what is there in promotion, is it any of our own these days, is it my channel too which is like a dialogue.  go closer  Subscribers are increasing, big people start approaching me sir, promote this, do this, do that, then I don't know what you will do, sir, you have to say sir, it's like this, friend, it will be sent in 2 minutes.  All the financial people come and say anything, this one who [ __ ] up, I don't know why you get paid for it, brother, you get paid for saying once that you take this, but man, you have wasted that crazy experience.  It's off time. Do you have to read books? Should you read the books? If you haven't heard the books, you won't understand. You have to look at the books. You have to read them in your mouth. You have to make notes and you have to read very few books. It's not necessary to read a lot, but this.  They will come and say anything and then they will say, what about us, we are a medium, we told you to promote it and I also did it, oh brother, nothing is achieved by your doing, I do n't know from where you are getting all this income.  can play games  To whom you are telling, if you watch such videos where your aspiration is easy, you will do it yourself, you will break it, then you will understand, never even plan the consumption, now you will see the change on YouTube because I am also a YouTube creator, it was explained to me how to do this thing from above. Make a band, now you will see bands creating Datsun, many times people ask me, friend, you praise yourself, you are a promoter, I know my own brother, what I am, I don't belong to anyone else.  Know, that's why I do n't promote it to anyone else, that's why you won't see that brother, you take this one, take this one, I promote someone, people are also promoting me, brother, you do it, I don't, I promote myself.  I do it for myself, I don't know what my quality is, I have faith in myself, I know that I will give you value, if I claim 10x for sure, I will give you 5x, I do n't know about others, so right now the creator is getting the message from above that brother, you are the one.  Say something like showroom, only then you will see financial influencers, they too have nothing. Now check on YouTube, everyone's title is being fished because it is being tightened from above too. Responsibility is very strong.  You can't come and say that I have so many subscribers, I have told you so much in my eyes, it is your moral duty and the law is also being strict on it, which is a very very good think.  Tell me your template, help in decision making, understand the thing, take a name and do the rest, brother, the world has to do its hard work, right, I am investing in stocks, I am doing it, hey, I am doing it, so you also do it, otherwise  Don't do a few things, I will tell you openly and clearly. If you have not joined my Subscriber Info Winner Group, then you will get the link in the comment area. This is a request to all of you who want to understand things openly and in detail. Want to do Prosperity, I have to say every time that whatever is my video, the thing I tell is not fake, it is a realistic thing, this IT Bill Note is upper very sexy IT Bill Note gives you very immediate great hope and IT Bill Note changes your life.  In one air completely but it bill definitely whatever it bill be it bill be real it bill take you you many people are saying that sir there is a lot of transportation  I have benefited a lot, got a lot of clarity, despair note, telling exactly what you do, not telling exactly, loose in big template type, it is okay, that is, by doing that, people should learn their own, understand their own and test themselves, do a back test, whatever this tells, do a forward test.  And as I said, as time goes by, 10 months, 12 months, whatever was mine, you can cross me, subscribe to three channels, it is not necessary that you have YouTube.  Just protest yourself from the noise of news newspapers and useless agenda and propaganda and let you easily see that this is what is happening, these patterns are getting played out, so in the future also, I will reveal the patterns. Middle class is visible, investment is visible, housing is visible, money is visible, relationship is visible, trends are visible.  I am giving them more videos and will keep uploading them. I request you all to please write in the comment area that if you want videos with such trends then write t. Trade on tt or write the complete trade, then if t will show it to me then I will tell you the exact details and  Then you look and find out the trade, the benefit you get is that yes, this is a trade, this is the setting, I can take profit from it like this, mother, if I want to suffer loss in this trade, then I will suffer loss. go back  Or if I can take advantage of the student, then I can take advantage of the strength. There are only two things, that is to catch the trends, this is very very important because when that trade data is distributed, accumulated and then published in the newspaper, then the story has been played out. Brother, you have to catch it first, until someone has understood it, has not analyzed it, has not yet come in the public domain, people do not know, after that, when it is done, it is done, after that, then there is the song.  There is no juice in the song, the juice is when it has not been put, like it has been put in the machine once, twice, thrice, after that, there is nothing about it.

    "title": "Four Things About Which Youth Is Confused And Bitter [TZeMxTAxUgM].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, the topic for Yukta on Clarity is, I will tell you 425 things for which you will see today's youth very negative and bad. If you are their parents or someone around you like your younger brother or any sibling or you can share this video with them. And you can monitor, maybe you who are listening to me, you may also be in this category, maybe you do it tomorrow, so sorry if this kind of me doesn't hurt you, M, this is not, M, this is to tell what is Today's youth is very good about four-five things and a lot is going on in social media, I am not talking about this sir and among all the things which I am going to tell, but most likely one or two. You will excel in things and I will also tell you why you should not be included in these. First of all, Butter is right about girls, girls are not good, people do blue stock on the character of girls, general opposite sex, now they have lovers.  Their heart was broken, they did not get the feeling, they could be of any category but this is going on big, then the one who will make her brother's area 498 by marriage, all the girls are sitting ready like this, may be your excuses too, whose youth's excuses  Do you ask them? You are a family ready to find a boy and ruin his life because it will be fun, this is the goal of our life. We were born a girl and I am doing this to show that it is a logical thing.  do it with this  First of all, there is no saree, there are issues inside you, these are the issues, most of all it is the team of psychology in teenage and early onwards, by doing too much porn masturbation, porn masturbation and all these things, I have messed myself up a lot, psychology and everything after that is real.  The ability to attract people in the world is not that much, then when this program is not happening then you should go to a doctor, a good doctor who can short out you and put you on some right lessons. Now you are going.  Janta Chetan Jagane is okay, this is the biggest thing. The second thing is that the one who is lucky in the job, the one who did not get the job is crying that why did he not get the job and is going to do preparation because he has been riding a bike for 30 years.  The public is getting the preparation and the jobs are not getting the government jobs and the material that you put in your mind for the preparation of government jobs, even ₹ 2 cannot be monetized except by learning this coaching in which you have taken coaching and that knowledge.  of  If even ₹ 2 has a monetizing value, please tell me, what story you are attempting for 22 to 30 years, you are not passing because 198% will not pass, the number of jobs is the same, then what is this in 30 years?  The more they are going to wake up later because now they are neither getting married nor getting a job nor anything else, their sir program has been ruined so this is a very messed up trade which again is being seen a lot, okay third  The thing is that the one who has lost his job has a lot of butter in his job, what is his job, the blood is being sucked in the job, the salary is very low, as if people come to me and ask in which company of mine, in which company do they reduce me, now I have taken the name of the company.  One is ok till good company but my [ __ ] is very less and my [ __ ] is getting sucked my tanka tankha bahut kam dete hai standard tankha ke dete very little Only one thing happened, Guruji, what does it mean, are you enjoying, they give me less salary, you pay me less, Baba gives you less salary, no one has worked in this company 34 5 lakh 620, but all the scenes are there, all of us are of the same age.  Me too, our tax is not much, our tax is not much in five years, our D day after tomorrow, the value of your organization is less, in case you have to increase your bill.  Value pay in capacity if you are attentive, he is a very good actor, I was watching an interview of Manoj Bajpayee ji, I want to learn and tell you, he played the role of Biku Mhatre in Satya movie, ok only after that he started getting the role of villain.  But 8 Months on Set and Didn't Expect Other Rules Because You Didn't Want to Get in Date Easy and Lot of Money Was Coming in  If he had thought about the short term then perhaps his filmography, which is so big and so good that even today he is a top star, if you look at the OTP platform, then it is not possible and it is very difficult, so it is a big problem for everyone. When you are getting such a thing which anyone can replace, you are just getting bored right now, so you will enter it, then it will be done there too, it is not that anyone will give money for free, there will be no brain juice left there, yours, Rijiju.  energy some value  You will be left with 30 to 40 to 50 thousand in the bus of advertising. This is happening in many places, in such places where you have little knowledge, something is happening that by adding value to it, you can move up in life.  But people do this in desperation, girls are doing saree like this, I can tell the story blindly, if they get the story, girls are not even thinking about their life, what is this value of mine, how much tension will there be in future. Mostly they will have lost 30-40 g, then now they are marrying me as a boy so that they can get a job and then there will be less money in marriage. This thinking will give some pain, but in reality, this is another subject of pain for the war.  That our parents do not understand us, your parents do not understand you is a normal thing, can we say this, you do not know how to understand your parents, yes it is easy to say that they do not know how to understand, then mother, they are also students. Your parents accept it once, it is okay then you can become a good teacher, you can tell them your actual feeling that in doing this like many parents say that you have got a government job, many times the youth comes to know.  Like me, through videos or in general life, some Shikha explains that friend, nothing is happening in this, my marks are not A, I am not able to get even in the cut off or I do not have reservation or I am creamy in joining.  Whether you are in a layer or will I support you, whatever it may be, there is no let me do thing and if the parents do n't understand or you will do it, then sit down with clarity many times and explain it well, here the parents are very much, according to me, parents also have a lot of role. So that you can tell your child like this every week, yes, there is something which is difficult for us to understand and we are not able to understand, is there such a thing, why are you asking, Papa, hey man, they say nowadays, isn't it, in social  the place is running  The fake generation says that the previous generation does n't understand. We are ready to understand. Parents will have to say this to understand. Okay, this is me and my video. It seems a bit boring but it is practical. Ask and then no in anything.  You have to ask your parents as well if you understand, why brother are you not understanding logically? I want to tell you the problem. Your parents understand everything. They say no, we are all you, which means you must have heard it like this, I am yours, I am yours.  Okay, then your Bapu will listen to the dialogue like this, everything is to be understood, it is okay, but he is the one, he also becomes a scoundrel at times to the parents, yes, I am not understanding, no, I am not able to understand, but I also don't want to date them.  Many times even our own son becomes like this, do something like this, ask him clearly from within, calmly and comfortably while sitting over a cup of tea, or do other programs program your father? These are your people who program the one whose father spends his Farada comfortably. Father will talk, today I have brought something special for you. Yes, after talking, he will tell the truth, then he will tell you exactly what is the actual problem, it is okay because he comes according to the marriage, brother, don't get spoiled by the marriage, there are a lot of vehicle accidents.  Things are bad in life, it does not mean that people should stop driving, be careful, wear seat belts, drive well, do not drive under the influence of alcohol, follow the rules, then the same thing happens in marriage, IF YOU FOLLOW CERTAIN  Things, why have you become so much, how are you Saree, Shakti, what all the boys used to do, first tell me, you must have heard in the 90s, a very big movie was made, an iconic movie of Sunil Date was also made, it was a big hit, on dowry and it was burnt.  It is okay about the type, at that time the girls did not say that we will get married, no, what happened to the boys that why would they have to suffer so much, how many would have to suffer even a little, can any boy be burnt, is that much? So it has not happened till now, so there is no need to be so nervous, what the hell, what are you talking about, it used to be like this in every street, in such and such place, there was no time for him, that stop got fat, do n't get trapped in the negative story. Be practical, my brother is a woman.  I am a very good person, I am waiting for good partners in my life, if your level is low, then it is okay, then you will not find anyone, he will be very knowledgeable, marry him, the one whose level is low, he will be yours.  Take me up on the level, friend, she is waiting for the person above her. If you lie in the mattress, you will remain lying. If you are here, then she will do this to you because if both the spouses think that I will marry the person above me.  If you want to get married, then you don't have to get married, power, because even if you are equal, it won't happen because if you are not on top, then this one will remain, I want this one, and even if you are below, then this one will not happen.  You won't do it because you too  If you have to do it so that it takes you up, then all these are sitting in the red corpse, brother Kant, you are my relative, in this also there is a reason to say, it never happens like this in life, in some things, you are here, in some things, she will be found here.  So life goes like this, in some things you are here, in some things he is here and you give me the color of sherbets, what can I say, my friend, if things get resolved then you find your sweet ghat water and the color of sherbets and  Where is the meeting, you meet me, don't cry, what is the program, do you have to go to the doctor, Sharma is not telling me in the survey, he will tell me in the consultation, I said, tell father, how to tell, what to tell, what were you doing in the last 7- Which Chetan was awake for the last 8 years? Okay, how will we tell him? Okay, I am ashamed of my mother, I do n't know what to do after going to the doctor, I will get tagged in the beginning, the program is bad, my self-esteem is going low and so on. from inside he  I am irritated that because of you, I mean, the opposite sex is facing these psychological issues. Many boys do n't even consider themselves undetected. What happens is that a person becomes very crazy and the world will come to know about it, but that.  So 0 0 1% is there, everyone else has a degree, this one is perfect and this one is definitely worth telling the story, then there is a program in between, so this is counseling mentorship guidance for those who are struggling here.  And it is definitely hanging, it is not possible to say how much you guys are identifying. To cure this pain, I do everything from videos to courses to other things. You guys are platinum membership.  If you want to take it, which is my second big channel, you can go to it and please remove this bitterness and bitterness, there are many girls too, I have addressed boys more, there are many girls too, that too is my mother.  I have never been happy. Nothing has been kept in my marriage. I have lost a great job of 40 years. The rent is at 12 per cent, the food cost is Rs 12,000. If I buy clothes there, I have a shortfall of Rs 5,000. I am short of petrol or anything else, that's it, Papa.  I take it from my mother that I ca n't pass in 40, it's fine but I definitely don't have anyone's interest. This story is playing out for many girls too. Look around you, how many are like me. I am like this.  I am taking observation from him, which is not visible to you people, is visible to you people, maybe you are also going through it, 40000 50000 Ishti is not going to increase the salary on top of that, something else will have to be done, multiple things will have to be done in Navami because As soon as you think that my salary will go, 10 boys and girls stand up, Sir, I will do this for 35 less, will I also reduce Saturdays for what less, if you get specialist and Unique is not reducing who has a lot of time in training"

    "title": "Full Clarity On  Mr Narayana Murthy 70 Hrs Debate ｜ Must Watch [Bgtm2cqqbIA].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, a trending topic is going on, many people have said a lot but now I, the number one clarity giver, will give very good clarity on this. The statement of 70 voices of Narayan Murthy ji came and there was a lot of discussion on it that 70 hours of work.  If it should be done, then there are many corporate hoochs and business tycoons who are Saajan Jindal ji, this Ola wala is also there, Agarwal ji, all yes, it is very good, it is very good, it should be done, 20 47, take the country like this.  We have to do it like this, we have to do it like that, I will discuss it under seven points, I will watch it till the end, even if the video gets long, it is very important because it will bring a lot of clarity, otherwise the youth will remain confused as to whether one should do so much work.  Work life balance is saying that should not be done, should be done, before that let me tell you an interesting observation. It happens only in India. There are two types of people in India, those who have work, those who are working and those who do not.  I do n't have any work. Okay brothers and sisters, the one who has work is also crying and the one who doesn't have it is also crying. If not, then tell me, whoever is doing both of them is lying dead, I do n't know how much work.  It's done, we don't get money, we suck blood, it's done, and second brother, we don't have any work, get us work somewhere, this is the biggest thing, second, in the beginning, I want one thing, my first point will be that this 70 hours They were asked to work  So in 70 hours, if you ask too much, I will tell you in some calculations. These are very good points. They cannot be answered in a one and a half minute video because too many articles have been written. Open letter to Narayan Murthy. Chetan Bhagat ji said something like this.  If no one is going to give the clarity at the superficial level at which I can give it at the soul level, then it will take time. First of all, if someone asks us to do a lot of work, like Narayan Murthy ji.  Did you do a lot of work yourself or does anyone else do a lot of work? Too much is okay. Identification with one's work is something that can happen at any time in life, that happiness index, happiness, all the things will happen, staying connected is the biggest first point, so this is too much work.  Let's come to the second thing that Narayan Murthy ji is talking about 70 hours work and many other people are supporting him a lot and it comes from the top, so he is not a grassroots leader, he is an old man of some time. 77 years have passed, they have no idea what is happening now. This is also the problem of successful people achievers that how will the ground reality shift when they became successful because they were successful in 90's and not in 80's.  They came and hit their peak in 90's, so it has been 30 years now that they have no idea what India will be in 2023, it is clearly visible because  I want to ask that what are the 7s talking about? They are not talking about IT, they are just talking about themselves because I will tell that thing in the next point. Somewhere in India, a bridge is being built in Ley, is there a shortage of men there or do they need more?  Everyone has to work because yes, in 70 hours, we will accept one thing that physically a person can work for 40 hours and the one who beats the clock for seven days or the one who drives an auto rickshaw is already ready.  He is working for 70 hours, then only when his body is sick or it rains or there is no work, he will not work. Otherwise, those people are locking him for 70 hours and if brothers and sisters, you should consider cuteing as work because it is for work only.  You are wearing clothes for work and every time you are at home, you get a message on your mobile phone, someone is working on your team or group, someone is asking for input, someone is asking for data.  That is also work, isn't it?  There is such a useless work culture in India, this is also a big reason that people are leaving India and after 76 years of independence, these people come and say that work for 70 hours a month, this is the achievement of our country. After a year, let's move ahead, the point is that the IT people, not including or their company, and all the clients in the US and clients outside, all of them charge them on an hourly basis, according to the project. And they give monthly salary to their employees, now their indirect way is that brother, don't stay till 40, 45, 48. First of all, this labor loss must also be something. In India, it is 48 hours. In other countries, later I will tell you about which one.  Do you keep that also on hold or not? You will work for 70 hours. If someone gets a lot of money for working for 70 hours then it will be 70 rupees. 80-90 can also be done. Some man is making something by hand and he is getting money on a quantity basis and if the work is not getting finished, then it is his wish, isn't it? He is putting in 70-80-90 hours, he will earn money.  Which one is he refusing? The problem here is that the money is not to be paid. The biggest problem is that the money is not to be paid and the work has to be done. The biggest problem is this fourth point whenever hired.  Talking about calling, we have to do it for the country, if the country wants to reach here in 207, then we all will have to do this, we all will have to sacrifice, whenever we talk about higher calling and the country, after 75 years of independence, then your idiot.  Youth should release this issue and are comparing it with Japan. After World War Two, which world war have we entered? India's situation.  World War Two in Japan and you are telling us to follow Japan and follow the condition of other countries. Look at their condition right now, they are not getting married, their children are not being born, it is possible that Japan is no country to be followed like this.  It seems that the Japanese are very hard working, there is something wrong with them brother till date no one has opened their mouth and told this. They are not very extremely happy and to be proud of people at the work place.  They are dying, if you see those sex dolls and I do n't know what other things, see Indians ca n't identify us and this happens in speaking like this because we are very docile and have friends from a friendly country, so we do n't talk about such things.  But every time go to the example of Japan, they did it in World War II, look at what they are doing in 2023 and where they have reached this stage.  Will you do this by making the declining population the country in 20 47? So whatever it is now, let's end our life, jobs are being created till 47, let's not discuss this, do you know elections are coming to divert attention?  I will not make it too political, I will tell you about how many people are working in what work culture in other countries, we will discuss that also in the next point but this is higher.  We do not have to go on calling because if the individual is doing well in life then the country will also benefit. At home we would first say, brother, everyone clean their rooms. If everyone cleans their rooms then the house gets cleaned but everything.  If you adopt your own area of ​​duties then it becomes like this, you want to say a higher calling to straighten your owl, you have to work for 70 hours and further it will come out layer wise, now I will give you some calculations, fifth point, something.  I will make the calculation rough and tell you, if there is any mistake in it, then remove it in the comment section. According to me, it is not a mistake. Brother, there are 24 hours in a day and 168 hours in a week. Because the week has been talked about, 70 hours of work should be done.  So there are 168 hours, everyone knows that out of that, brother, you will sleep for 56 hours and it will take you an average of 10 hours to commute to work. In big cities, there is more traffic in Bangalore.  There is a traffic jam, but take 10 hours for both the commuting and commuting time. 10 hours will have to be given to personal hygiene which includes bathing, brushing, washing your clothes, washing shorts and vests. This will come, it is okay for grooming for your personal hygiene and haircut. Sometimes you have to go and do something, you have taken out 10 to 70 hours to work, okay, after that you need at least 10 hours to eat in the day.  Eat three times, this is when you have to eat, if someone is talking about cooking, then brother, then add the time. If you have to prepare it yourself, this is already cooked. To eat, you have to drink tea, you have to drink coffee, you have to work, okay, you will save 12 hours in total. After saving this, if you add all this, you will save 12 hours. Now in these 12 hours, you need me time, you should do your exercise also, you also have friends, relatives, parents, I also have a movie.  There is eating out, there is laser, there is bank work, you have to look at your investments, you have to know about your investments, you have to know where your money is going, brother, what compromises will you make in this, then what compromises are people making in this? Watch carefully what is happening, suddenly people are reliving, youngsters are reliving and these people have already done this and are asking to increase it further, right now they already do not have time. Youngsters say that there is neither time nor money, they have sucked the entire soul, so what to do, we will not get married, this is what people are doing, they are delaying marriage, they are not getting married, they are not having children because they are seeing it, brother.  I do n't have time, I don't have energy, how can I give it, if I get married, my wife will ask for energy, children will be born, he will ask for money, brother, this is not happening as a result, he is not getting married and what will happen in future.  so short  Term, we will take advantage of ourselves. After listening to this kind of story, a person going forward will see that man, I have become 38-39 years old again, I have become 40, I have got married, so why am I working, for whom am I doing it, then that wisdom and intelligence.  Will go to raise consciousness because ultimately if you do not get married, then you need to do so much work like a donkey, then go away as a single man, if he does not have bad habits like alcohol, cigarettes and such vices.  The rest of the bad habits that they say are not expensive, if there are no addictions then it is not that expensive for a single person to live in India even today, then he should not buy any great property, he should not show anything great to him, he will not do anything anywhere, he will keep roaming anywhere.  Then whether that country has gone to the right place or to the wrong place, when the people go to run all their rationality, intellect and consciousness, then who will work for you? Then I have calculated this from 168 years and told you that India is at 126th position in the sixth point happiness index. We are crying country, we feel very good in our hearts and we have a false sense of sacrifice, what have we done, I don't know which of our movies are these, there will be details on these in a separate video, there will be a lot of details in this, this point is very much based on our psychology, but this  It is our whole age as a country that we have to sacrifice, live in pain, it is fun to do our own thing because if anything is going well, it is going well, we are having fun, then the system starts feeling guilty.  The system has been made in such a way that you will not be made rich, even the rich are made measurable, those who are doing jobs are also made everyone 7080 so that the one who does not have a job can be told that those who have a job are also You are not very happy, see this, in this country people are preparing for IAS for 9090 hours a week, they are working 90 hours to get a job, divide the intake by 131 hours, 12 13 hours.  Children are studying who want to conduct competition on IS, it is not that it is not happening on daily basis, if you go to foreign countries then in foreign countries you will get this data of Denmark, Finland, Germany, 26 hours, 27 hours, 28 hours, less than 30 hours, so much work.  The work is getting done because I will tell you what is the biggest thing, the seventh important point is fine, anything, say productivity, productivity is bad, Narayan Murthy ji. Therefore, more work has to be done, what is productivity, there is an input, it has an output, so the output upon input is productivity, how much effort I put in and how much result I got, it is not about the result, they are saying to improve the result.  Increase the input. Hey, if the input is increased too much and the result increases only a little or does not increase, then the productivity goes down. There is no need to worry about it. In a country where so many people are unemployed, engage them also. you engage them Because I had told earlier that the one who has work is crying, the one who doesn't have work is crying, so you took everyone, gave them a job, now you basically pay them 3540 hours and make them work for 70 hours.  You want to charge him for the next party on hourly basis, you yourself want to see the IT people, if a man does moonlighting then it is a sin, if he does any other work then he will say no, then I am not working here for you.  Tankha Brother, you are getting 70 hours, not 70 hours. I say that you should work for 80-90 hours, but you should work for 30, 35, 40 hours for the company, hit the limit and do the rest for yourself. And the way they are doing it, because they are  On top of that, they don't have any grassroots leaders, they feel that we have become so rich, we are doing so much work, then why don't these poor people, these children, work for nothing, hey brother, let him drive himself.  Of  He has to come, he doesn't have a driver like you, he comes after hanging in the metro, just changes, he ca n't be productive there, when you drive and come back, there are phone calls and emails and productivity is on behind you and you give him time.  Let's count in the working hours, you don't have to go and bring vegetables or attend parent-teacher meeting or anything because you have heard that story, you must have seen another story of Narayan Murthy ji, his wife's Sudha.  Murthy's 'I was there' thing is that brother, by selling your simplicity, you are getting that PR done, your UK PM is your son-in-law, I went there to me, he said like this, the address is 10 Downing Street, what a story that is.  There is a need to love your simplicity so much, if you are so simple, you go to Kapil Sharma's show, you go there and speak your own words, this class is cattle class. When I went to the first class, he looked at me.  So I was surprised, I was wearing a normal saree. Hey, Mysore silk sarees cost Rs 1.5 lakh. Normal clothes can be bought for Rs 10,20,30 thousand. Branded ones are also available, you will take all these also, these sarees are cheaper. When did people accept them? I don't understand, go and buy it in Bangalore and see that sarees cost Rs. 1.25 lakhs and are worn by ladies.  If she is good and looks good, then it has been made into a narrative that a successful man is a seemingly docile, hardworking person and you take something out of his mouth so that the focus goes there, we all have to do it for Bharti, we all have to go like this. They may not be able to tell people by being so articulate now that at seven points everyone knows deep down that nonsense is being done, everyone knows that nonsense is being done because if there is a  Work and you are getting paid for it People will work as many as they can physically to one We have n't heard stories about one time pay Nowadays these boring roles don't get paid much, only these drivers get paid on hourly basis first. So they used to turn day and night, they needed to tell someone, infact there was on the other side, they were not sleeping, that was that it becomes risky that they are driving without sleeping because once  Incentives come when ever the incentives come You don't have to tell anybody how many hours to work You give money, you pay in two ways Two people will work as many days as you want But you have to suck people's souls on Saturday Sunday Without paying money and then when the new generation is smart, the people are smart, they are protesting, so to put them in guilt, which ones are there even before generation X?  Boomers and these are even before that, they are 77 years old, Narayan Murthy ji will come with his story, then all their corporate humps will jump, we also work, our father also works, it is Sajan Jindal ji's right now, your father.  He was also an industrialist, so now he is caught asking this many times, look at the politician's politician, how many hours does he work, the biggest politician of our country? Hey, a woman wakes up at 5:00 in the morning.  She also sleeps at 11:00 pm, she is also working 17-18 hours a day, make her do it, a separate excellent video will come on this and I will reveal a lot on this, I will show everything that a woman who gives birth to a child has to do. Start with caesarean operation, tore the stomach, look at the blood for mother Bharti, this child is born, she is doing it for mother Bharti, she is feeding milk at night, she is not sleeping for two hours, why won't she do this for the country, for Maha Bharti?  Khan will run the country, tell me, I will make a video, it will be very interesting to watch and the eyes of these people will be opened and then the work they are doing will seem like any donkey can do it, hey, you give me power, I can work for 18 hours.  I will make me the biggest leader of India because friend, when I work, the work will be done in 70 hours. If there is anything in that guy's life then there is nothing left, I have got you a job, no matter how top you are, you belong to the corporate, the government.  Whether you are a minister, a sentry or anyone bigger than that, you take the presentation, you make the food, you speak like a laat sahib and next not good fad, finish the hide, make this, remove that, remove that, isn't it?  Whether it happens like that or not, do it like that, brother, you are enjoying it, so what is the stress in it? Go from one place to another, travel around, go in first class, go in a good ship, stay in a good hotel, hey, he is a common man.  A poor man spends money and dreams of doing tourism, this is happening in your job and business, then you are saying that this is the work, everyone would like to do such work in India, at least give me a chance, I will work for 18 hours.  Condition environment, good food, fragrance, beautiful people, good clothes, everything is good, create such an environment, you will do anything, you are making fun of those children that why don't you work for 70 hours, if they do then how will they live, who will bring their vegetables home?  Who will cook food for him, his father will take his mother to the hospital, and I did not even tell him that in the 12 hours that were left, he will have to go to the hospital, there will be some illness, now if you will not get it, then someone from your family will also have other things, you will be here for 70 days.  Increase the hours, make it 160 hours and take the name of the country. In everything we are doing for the country. Hey, to put China behind, Indians have not taken birth to put Chinese behind.  Was not born to beat China, this misbehavior is like typical Indian middle class parents in parenting, see next to them, see how well Rohit sings, see Neha's English, see how good your English is, see how far behind your numbers are, now Indians have to  Look at how many China there are, there are 1.5 crore incidents in China, we cry tears of their blood, go there and see what China is, it has gone ahead, it has gone ahead, no child in China has any problem.  There are no aunts, no maternal uncles, no aunts, no aunts, no paternal uncles, because there is a child policy like this, there are no relations, you do this program in your country and then keep doing the work, then ask what is their condition. You want to become China We will leave China behind and become such world gurus that we will follow others and take the name of others. On one side, world guru world guru tells the world to do like this, world guru, what is the world doing to him?  It doesn't copy, it doesn't beat the world, it is our way, if it can be made into a very deep video, but I also know the limitations of time, I know it was an iron job, everyone did their own work and the British had a great system.  He has designed the system in such a way that you could neither call it a communist system nor you could call it socialism nor you could call it capitalism. It was a great system. He must have studied economics extensively.  I was not getting into the category, this is the system in place, you will go and work for Narayana Murthy's company, they will suck you like this for 70 hours and then they will tell you that you are not worthy of anything, your performance is not good enough as per 40 hours.  And then they will say that you are doing national building of the country, your mental balance will not be right, you will not be happy, then where will the nation come from? Nation is nothing but its people nation.  If it is not boundaries then keep changing boundaries. Even today boundaries are changing. If you go and check then in how many 10000 years India's boundaries have changed 200 thousand times which is called India, I don't know which countries were here. What changes have taken place and are still changing, states keep coming and going, state ministers keep changing, districts keep changing, everything is the same.  Change keeps happening in the dynamic world, but the people here, we are who we are, we are the country, we are the country, if we are not happy and are not becoming happy, then this progress is not for whom, it is not for your children, who will give birth to children.  He is saying for the sake of 20 47, you are saying sacrifice, make sacrifice for whom, there will be no one because you will not leave time to have a child, on stress free time to have a child, a man who is a husband.  He will have to have sexual intercourse with that wife and it cannot be done in one go, it will have to be done several times. How will a person who works 70 hours a day be healthy and not under stress? Think for yourself that you have to be so blunt and tell this in spite of being a family channel.  I wonder where are you leaving time for having children? You are not leaving time for anything because the people above have enough of these programs; these programs are not running, they enjoy this only.  out of 12 hours for him  You also have to take out some time, which I did not tell you about and I am telling you now that you have not spared any time, neither will you do exercise nor will you have any agenda or program of your own, all your programs will be theirs and where is the money to be spent after earning it, they will say and mutual fund.  Is it right? Mutual fund is right, no remaining 70 hours Narayan Murthy Here mutual fund is right, just finished then what will you do next, what do you have to do mentally, don't want to become their slave for 70 hours so can I  I am saying come towards 30 hours, it should be a matter of four days a week and it should be of 30 hours and if he calls you to suck blood then stay mentally switched off, do your household work in the office, no one is going to teach me, I did this once before.  I also make videos and I do the same training. Earlier, I used to help corporate trainers in batting on their behalf and sucking their blood. Now I do all these things for the employees who want consultation.  To do something of your own, I have a simple pre-marital consultant course. There is a two and a half hour workshop of ₹ 777. You can start a consultation of ₹ 5000 after watching the recording. Work for yourself like this, 30 hours, 30 hours will work for yourself. And you will do 30-40 here, then gradually when you start getting more money in your work, you will leave the work. Every buddy should join, do a job with everybody.  Don't give your body, don't give your mind, and don't give money. Don't give your body, don't give your mind. What are these people doing? These people are not satisfied with their body and mind. Money means money, they will kill your ₹ 1. If they had to give you ₹ 1, then they will give you 80. They have taken away your body and money too.  The mind is also taken, even that satisfactorily comes in Potter, those who suck the hope and take the soul, they are the worst people, okay, this is the same, they will listen to you because they will buy all the time of life and  What story will you tell in vain, you have to work for the country, the country is 20 47 straight, 2023 is going on, you have finished 24 years, give us the country, who will be in the country, brother, who will be in the country, they also work like me, but more for themselves. I am not working for some company. If you like me because if I were a video channel for a company then they would have removed me from this channel and if I had left this channel then all my subscribers would have been left here then I  Someone else [Music] youtube3 They created the platform, then people kept adding, kept adding, kept adding and today their net worth is 420 crore dollars, which you multiply, it is 35000 crores. Hey brother, what is your daughter, who is Mrs. Prime Minister, First Lady of England, is she?  Is she the Richest Lady of England? Has she earned? Are she the lion of Phocis? Have you gone to the top? You have set a work program for your children. Tell the rest of the children.  Work 70 hours, your children should work 70 hours a week. Now you tell me this simple and simple definition of work, see what I told you. If the work is in such a beautiful and sexy environment like I described earlier, who cares, everyone will do any labor.  So he cannot work for 70 hours, his body will break down, he has to sleep within seven hours and he cannot work, but if we look at it in terms of seven days, then he is also working for 56 hours, whatever he does in India.  There is work, if we work more than this then we will become like this. There is only one gender which is female gender in India. No one talks about it, brother, why is its work force participation decreasing so much? More women in 1992-93. India used to work as a percentage of the population, but today it doesn't show something that it is our policy makers, politicians, these corporate leaders and the big people who are running the world in India. They don't pay attention to what environment they have created that women ca n't work even today, there is respect and because if you say 70 hours then women will never come in the workforce, here comes the man, this robot will want you as a woman.  She ca n't come, where will she be able to see the children in 70 hours? Today, I am not able to manage 40 hours with a woman, who says that she has to get married, has to have children and not only one but two, she has to do it with him.  40 hours can't be managed, it's like this, you want to take her to 70 hours, then basically what do you want to do, yes 70 70 all 70 Mahabharti Mahabharti, that Mahabharti, she is the woman, she is the woman, she is the woman, she is the one who will give birth to children in this country.  Will take it forward, you are thanking the next generation while you are here, mentally you will take them somewhere like a heel and you yourself are eating peda by becoming a heel. Shake your head, do it in such a simple way and come up with a statement and say something, you should do that and everyone will listen because first of all, whatever happened to IT, India becomes the same, this is from IIT and then beyond that.  You became successful, then beyond that you became an IT person, then brother, your son-in-law also became the Prime Minister, then you will have to show respect and listen to him, then you will have to do that with him. Sajan Dil Phir Woh Ola Wala Phir Yes Yes Yes Should be done then this generation is still not stupid, it is the Millennials who are stupid because those who are mid level managers are sucking the blood. It is the mid level managers who are sucking the blood of the young generation.  And they are giving him the feedback that Sir, he doesn't accept this, Jan ji is smart, so he is being told that he will open his mouth big and he will not be blamed, son, he should work hard. Son, hard work is not good, no, you have to give, you have to do, you have to do, it is not good at all, what ever is used, release hard work, from whom are you taking. Hard work for yourself is very good, but for others, smart work is necessary. The more hard work you get, the better. Work less, now no one will say this with a straight face, work less, no no, we have to justify, you are teaching us wrong, I am talking about crushing the believe system, work for yourself and get a job one day. Leave this Why should one Infosys and a company create this platform Get all This is a sweat shop, just like clothes are stitched inside Bangladesh, for America they call sweat shops, sometimes there is fire there, sometimes there is nothing, it is not a labor lodge, it is yes No, they don't get it in terms of dollars, but they do n't get it in terms of rupees, they get salary and those clothes are expensive there, here they created this platform, these people have collected a lot of children by doing everything. Then they took the work from this man or from these companies, they did the coding, this was the button, it was okay, now they have got so much, they told him to do the project, they said to one of the guys, Son, you are the project head, he is with you, suck the blood below.  And do this work, now take money from them, give them salary on hourly basis, just like the British used to do, earlier when the British used to rule the Indians, here we have Rai Bahadur, this Bahadur, that.  For bravery or someone higher up in the police used to give him a little award, he used to hit the lower stick with more force, it is okay and only the Indians used to beat, the British used to beat the British a little directly, Indians used to beat the Indians only, they used to give them only respect, then one and a half.  Gave respect to him, told him stories for 70 hours, he is sucking the story of Mahabharti from the country, hey, I am saying this, go away from here, do your individual work and these people here Contact the people below and start giving them work. There must be someone who will be operating at a level below me. He has to create his own website, he has to set his own algorithm, he has to create some features and he has to make his own.  You have to make an app, you have to do something, join them and then 1015, which is this team, if the super supervisor of this team revolts and these 10 people say, we will separate and we will start our own small company.  Let's create and do direct deals, the big company has gone to the fence, this is the simple message, other wise, they are earning all that money and the shareholders sitting in it, who are the founders, are the biggest ones, that is why they have 35000 crores of $420 to 82.  Multiply it by 83 and this is different from the rest, everyone has given it to the children separately, everyone is fine, now there is no one to do personal attack but me to show the reality.  It also has to be told that brother, our program is set, you are doing 70 hours of someone else's work, you leave, these corporations and institutional institutions should not require more than 20, 25 to 30 hours of work, such people work for 60 to 70 hours on setup. He is working but he is doing it for himself in the institutional clinic and if it is his wish then he is doing it and if he wants to do it then he is doing it, if not then he is also not doing it.  The country should create an eco system where the person who wants to work for two days and wants to do only 20 hours instead of 1010 hours and then wants to do something big for himself, he also has the same work as the person who works for three days.  There is work for the one who works for four days. There is work for the one who works for seven days. There is work for the woman who wants to work only in the morning and evening. There is work for the one who wants to work only in the afternoon.  There is work too and it is all flexible  The key is that today you look at these maids carefully, I say no every time, I do not want to show the middle class down, but you look at the maids, they go where they want to work, if they do not like the work, then this is how  They leave like this, leave like this, it seems that they have no character, no fapper, no exam, no test, nothing, if they find their mistress to be ill-mannered then they say, I would have respected us too, I don't come, there are four more mistresses standing there.  They are making them work for 70 hours because this is the bad condition of the middle class. The condition of the middle class is so bad. They are making the rich richer and then paying the poor. This is the job of the middle class, that is why you are born and this is Narayan Murthy.  Yes, all I want from you is that you should keep paying the poor for their services so that you can serve the rich. I am stopping by talking very deeply. How many people have heard this great talk, then write down Guruji. Listened because it is told at the end on the show stop itself, let me repeat it again, all of you who are my audience, middle class, rich people are making them rich to make them rich and are paying the poor.  The poor are going like this and this is happening, you are not going anywhere, nothing is going on for you, he is also doing catchup somehow and these people are going up and on top of that, they are leaving this slip.  give  Work 70 hours and you work so that we will leverage our time because we have bought your time. The best way is this. You have 24 hours in your life. You can work maximum 182 hours, you cannot do more than that but if  If you hire 20 people and make them work 12 hours a day, then 240 hours of work is being done in a day. This is leverage for you. These people become rich and you can do this in 40 hours.  Not satisfied, this is the Illuminati, this is the Illuminati and this is how the Illuminati works through someone who looks like that, has a good mind, which is fine and accepts it, but they say very quietly and in such a way that no one can say anything to them.  There are many people among us who say very similar things, that this is a very mean person, they call someone like a cow, then we call him that he is above controversy.  And we will not say this and on top of that, your brother-in-law is the Prime Minister of another country, the one who ruled you, but ask him, he is working 70 hours there, what is the situation there, what is the situation of inflation there, what is the situation of rents there?  What is the condition of the public there? It is fine in England because whether the Indian public listens to you or not, your son-in-law is close to you, he can listen to you, how much is he implementing your language, how much are you implementing there, Tarai. Don't go to Tarai, let the rate increase a little, let's get a little bit of what we call the comfort level of the British of foreigners, should it be like that of India in the default setting, we live in Majri, that Tarai, Tarai, don't go there. Because we are so used to living in the lowlands and here you are telling us to work for 70 hours, children, will our lives be saved? Will you work for 70 hours? You were born to take back China and Japan.  If you are born to follow then I hope you understood this video, you will share it. Despite this video being long, I have given full clarity point by point. Those who enjoyed it, please write in the comment section and share. Thank you.  Very Much"

    "title": "Full Clarity On Sandeep Maheshwari Vs Vivek Bindra Controversy [brC2dOYbO28].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, there was a lot of demand for this, I was trying to avoid it but some things are not avoidable because of me across all my five channels, should I make any video? Tell me sir, make this video, tell me sir, please give clarity on this, meaning my astrology.  Sir, I am giving clarity to the youth on this, if I go beyond that, I mean, sir, I am giving clarity to the youth because what is the reason because these two are Sandeep. Maheshwari and Vivek Mindra between both of them I think there are five hundred crore subscribers, if we got together then maybe we will have to tell that it has become youtube3, no one gives the clarity that I give, this is my claim, is this claim true or not?  So in the end of this video, you tell me, I will give full clarity on this issue. It will be fun to watch it very well, I have not got such clarity on this till now, I have also watched many videos of even big names. Have seen this and other wise also, I have seen the controversy that is there and mostly everyone follows it, beyond that I will give clarity in a very loving manner, I will tell who has suffered loss due to this and what will happen in the future, the future of both of them.  I will also tell you what is going to happen next, I will also tell you if it will be fun, so let's start with a little personality talk from Vivek Bindra ji, no one does the way I analyze now.  Why are you praising yourself again and again? I will tell you that too. Okay, the personality of Vivek Bindra ji is very intelligent, he is very intelligent, he speaks very quickly, his enthusiasm is high, both are in the motivation space, the space is there, I don't.  Like at all is fine and because my focus is on clarity and you must have also seen that nowadays people are using the word clarity more instead of saying motivation, because of marketing and what ever is fine. As far as we know about Vivek Bindra ji's childhood and what he told in the open domain, he was very young, I think he was 2 years old. When his father expired, his mother also got married, so he had a struggle in life.  And what was told in their own language, Ikan etc., there were many people who were with them, who were the followers of Lord Krishna, they have very good knowledge of Gita and such verses like this.  There are many such people who now oppose it by rote and will say to them, Oh hey, this is a gift of gap, gift of gap makes such fools, hey Saraswati's blessings, do not call the blessings of Saraswati Mata as gift of gap, gift of.  The gap is a big thing, brother, story teller, talk about good things, brothers and sisters, talk very good, the story tellers who talk well, I do n't know where they are sitting, brothers and sisters, they are sitting.  Or are you not sitting, who is the greatest story teller of India and I am not saying this as a condemnation, it is the story teller's time and till date only those who can tell good stories have reached somewhere and the public is sitting to do the rest. If there is this gift of gap, such people look down on it that it is not a big thing, it is a very big thing, talking, the way of talking, the quality of talking, there are records in this book in their name, they cannot be found just like that.  Many of those are also fine but knowledge is specific.  The tange force of business is very good, the knowledge is deep, the examples are very good, the connection is very good, the happiness on the face is so much that it irritates many people, how can anyone be so happy, he has a lot of followers, 2 crore plus 2.3.  There are 2.4 crore subscribers but those subscribers can probably respect him but cannot love him. Now all this is coming out, I will also tell about Sandeep ji separately.  They will tell about everyone, they will tell about the personality of both, people have done that, this is good, this is bad, that is good, we are good with this, we have done this and that, now something from their personal life has also come, that Raita has spread further, many times they say  Doesn't it feel like that, and when that condition changes, if there is some star, then only bad news comes from all sides, so that is also there, we will discuss a little beyond that too, but first let us tell you that you will see videos of them dancing like this. Absence, how to [ __ ] like this, do it like this, we are dancing, the way of saying is, come on, next time, say again, follow me, do it like this, no other man is the one who neither watches nor lives like this, but this is the one who seems to run away.  Isn't it and said, walk, walk, run quickly, run quickly, if you follow them, you get breathless, it is not for everyone, it is fun to watch, it takes life to do, so now let's move ahead, what was this business model of theirs that caused so much noise?  there was a stir in it 50 course and it was talked about and what mistakes were made which they have also admitted and corrected but when the rumor spreads then it becomes infamy and when it gets infamous, when you rise by your name you fall by it also, it is okay and wrong.  Is that IBC International Business Consultant etc. something like Rs. 50000? First thing I would like to say is their free content. If you watch the free content channel.  But everything is available so free content is very good, so if free content is very good then paid content cannot be bad, it is a matter of normal wisdom, further we will talk about whether it is beneficial or not, we will talk about that but fact.  This is that the content is good, okay, it is a mess, no one has analyzed it to this level, it is a mess, if someone had been there to tell them or explain it, then maybe they would not have made the mistake or maybe  When I tell him that he has done a realisation, he created some content of his own and gave Rs. 0000 to support it. He has explained all that. You all know that we have people, there is animation, there is a team of so many people, there are expenses, there is water, there are big people.  They come here to people, they float the name of Baba Ramdev from their faculty, they use Vivek Oberoi's name, big names from outside and they do all that, then it is a brilliant system.  You have to see that when you join a gym and take membership, now you have not become thin, muscles have not been gained, then you say return the money but the gym owner will say, did you come to the gym every day, did the trainer tell you to do set ups like pushers?  Do you have to do this bench lift or do this? Do you have to do trade mill? Chadda's got any course, any knowledge, anything is a consumed force item, you cannot speak after consuming it, you are dirty, dirty, dirty, your idiot is cut, then cut, it is like you went to eat, it was not good, you go and say, review.  There is no problem in defaming the world, saying it is useless, she will definitely side with everybody. Mis selling has happened in the sense that you sold the course and then in the course you focus on the course.  It was not there, the focus was on selling the course, now I will tell you where the big mistake happened, the big mistake was that you told the person below you to sell the course, IBC was done, he was very happy, he sold one half, he got commission, then when he went to sell more, he got  It was not sold, then he said, hi, hi, useless, useless, what is the reason, because every time, such a big name teaches such a big business, he will tell the story to someone who is selling the course, now he will go and check, he will get the number of Google 3G.  You will get the company number and direct  You will call and he will say Rs 5000, we give it cheaper, it is direct, you should not give commission to him, so you can't be doing this thing that you are also selling direct and you have made the people below also direct, then when their course will not be sold, then the model which has been made further.  If it was there, she would abuse you, wouldn't she? And because whatever new he is taking, he is taking it from you, either through an insurance policy or perhaps the model of LIC is that they can take it only through agents.  He does not abuse anyone because LIC does not sell directly and no LIC agent abuses LIC and whoever wants a policy needs a policy. The biggest problem is that people do not focus on the content of the course. It is like you.  You are going to a school and in school, you have to study knowledge, increase your skill set, want to learn something, so do not focus beyond that, focus on getting admission in school, you have done B.Tech, what will you do now, sir, B.Tech course.  I will sell it to you. It is something like you learned a cooking course. If you are into cooking then why did you take a cooking course? So that you can cook food, you can eat it yourself, you can feed people and when you come to school, no no no, you took a cooking course and the course.  By taking this, you are selling that course to someone and you neither know cooking yourself nor did you do that course properly and that course was only about cooking, so now it has started coming in the form of a scam, still this is not multi-level marketing, people.  it multi multi This is not level marketing. This is normal affiliate marketing. In multi-level marketing, the levels are multiple. I sold you, then you sold to two people and even after selling those two, I got some profit, then that is multi-level marketing, but you sold.  If there is any profit and if he is selling from one source only, then this is the main source, which is the organization of Vivek ji. He has IBC here. If he sells further, then only he is getting it. Is there any change in between?  If it is not there, then there is no need to spread the misconception that it is not there, it is there as much as it is and this affiliate marketing is being done all over the world, who is not doing it everywhere, you have taken all those courses and those things. Those people who give the badge of identification, what else is it, the one who earns money, he falls in the eyes of the people that he is doing it only to earn money, what else, what good did you do, what content did you give, that is different on personal life.  so come People are saying the same thing, you used to impart great knowledge, yours is good, someone has written a message to me too, Sandeep Maheshwari's depression is being detected, Vivek Bindra is beating his wife and your FR has been posted. Everyone's number will come, it is written somewhere on my channel, your number will also come. By doing this I want to ask that our number will also come, everyone's number will come, did I write that normally I say no to trolls?  Normally he doesn't answer but what is the matter sometimes, sometimes when someone is typing like this then I feel bad because I get the feeling from inside, I wrote this on this very channel, in my opinion, someone has written in some video and I have written a line in it.  I said, look, we all will have a turn, but what about you? Your turn has not come, the story is not starting, someone has risen and then fallen, okay, it has reached here, that is why your turn is not coming.  Neither getting a job nor getting married  No children are being born, no life is happening, no further scandal is happening, you are in life, you are sitting clean or after taking a bath, nothing will happen, no bamboo will be played, no flute will be played and everyone is waiting for their turn to come.  Yes, your number will also come, yours has also come, you have also fallen, no one insults the public because you are a subscriber, so how can they speak bad about you, here people speak bad about Vivek Bindra, of Sandeep Mashori.  Speak bad about him, either take Sandeep's side or take Vivek's side and you sit like this and keep watching and no one does anything to you, isn't the public the biggest scoundrel, brothers and sisters, this is the country where people go to pick tomatoes.  These are worth 00, so we look at each tomato like this, this is India, you have made a fool of us by taking a course of Rs 50,000, you have made a fool of us, you have made a fool of us, the public is stupid, the public is stupid.  You are an idiot, more than half of the listeners who listen to me are not my subscribers and certainly not my members. How can you say hi, I will unsubscribe and you will have to ask. This attitude is not there in Vivek Bindra nor in Sandeep Maheshwari.  This is the attitude that brother, we are giving you something, I am doing good for you, I am a very good person, I have done good like this, I have given this, I have given that, say brother, it is like this, what kind of course is it?  Will it be beneficial? I also do small things. He asked me whether it will be beneficial or not. I said no, please find out, tell me why, try this, make this claim, because what is a claim, it is lovely too.  Karti Ghori will become done, isn't that one and that one not coming? Hit which one, the girls will come, which one is it  The world is doing like this, why are you feeling so scandalized, who will send their course like this, how many will come like me, tell me, we will come and do it, tell me what, only this much of your money will be looted, see if you want to loot but this is not the attitude.  If it doesn't work much, then only I have so many subscribers, so the content is the best among them, my retention rate is the highest, watch rate is the highest, social impact is good, Social Blade is a site, you can know everything by visiting it.  Well, both of them are sitting with crores of rupees, more than that come to me across the channel, I will not talk about one, and there is retention time because ultimately I will tell further, the public is a scoundrel, the subscriber is a scoundrel, no one is straight, 0000, hey, 51 thousand rupees.  If you buy phone then you hit 50 reviews. You have to buy train ticket. If you want to buy plane ticket then go to 10 sites and see where you can get Rs.  3300 is available cheap, you just pick it up and do it. Hey, greed is there, there is no interest, there was no interest in doing the course, there was no interest in updating skills, there was no interest in running your business, sell it, sell it, sell it of your greed.  Someone took advantage At some point of time I will just tell you that in India there is a top lot, then there is a middle lot and then there is a bottom lot. These people had to be targeted who would have learned.  Had they studied, they would have done something, they would have got some benefit, now they have reached the people here, now everyone will abuse everyone's desi ghee, don't regret brother, feed everyone desi ghee also, don't regret, whoever has the habit of eating ladda or any other oil.  Or it may be eating redi's momos, they don't digest that thing but you get greedy, you are creating content and it is selling very well, so even those who teach this business are not able to do it.  Was it ours or will we move later, goodwill got loose now let's talk about Sandeep Maheshwari ji, everyone's favorite, he has a very soft spoken personality, he seems to be opposite to Vivek Bindra ji, as if his education is of the same level and all these levels are here.  Okay, okay, look, there is no right or wrong, everything is as it is, someone or the other will attract someone else, everyone has their own style and attitude. If they have their own following, then their short spoken personality does not make one get scared after seeing them. When you see Sandeep Ashwari, the first reaction from inside, whatever you see, you will not get excited. He is short spoken and it does not seem that I cannot reach here, this will tell you.  That yes you can reach here but brother, they do not have any specific domain knowledge, they have a driver knowledge which understands this word and mental model, they will know the driver.  Knowledge offers knowledge is not deep knowledge, they can do good, they can do well and that is also known because any of their content is direct, now like I am talking to you, I am talking directly, Veg Mendra ji also does it or his It happens so quickly, like this, doubt comes from here like this, then see repeat after me, you can do it like this, whatever the market likes, it pleases you like this, brother, it takes a lot of knowledge to do like this.  Or a lot of knowledge is needed Sidhu ji Sidhu kills quickly and then he is like this brother, he has knowledge from somewhere, he has taken something from somewhere and has hidden something and he speaks very quickly and there is no written script and he talks directly. So that means I am sitting with a thought, okay, as I am saying this, I too am probably sitting with a thought that I do not need the help of any man, no editing is being done, no editing is being done for one and a half hour.  By doing a session, 20 minutes of juice is not being extracted, 25 20 30 50 people are not made to sit like this, they are not asked leading questions, yes, to drive an agenda, then it is like this, now they say, Sandeep ji says yes, I have.  Don't create controversy, I have not even taken the name. Hey, what is the need to take the name? Tell me, you are a big politician who has a white beard and wears glasses and brothers.  Sisters, it's all like this and you won't be able to know which one you are talking about. You have put that tie in the thumbnail and the one wearing a suit and the red tie is his only, that is Mindr ji's, then why should I speak?  If there is a need, then say this, this is what they call, it is not right to act like this, what is his claim to fame, what is the claim to fame of Sandeep Maheshwari ji, as soon as I say it  They are sitting with an army to write something down, the army will come, hey, they don't charge money, they haven't monetized their channel, so today let's talk about it, what is the benefit they are getting, if they haven't monetized their channel, then what are you getting benefit from it? We don't like ads because Sandeep ji says, I am talking about crores, if a two-episode ad comes in between then I do n't want that if a poor person or someone is watching me, then he should get the ad, for whom he is doing good.  is it yours After watching the video, he did not want to masturbate, he had to waste one and a half hour's time on the pawn, the same youth thought that you did it in 5 seconds, that is one second thing, I tell it anyway and today I tell it openly because who has told till date?  No, there is no knowledge, service is given to people, number five or six out of 89, you make them an associate beyond that, they will not get any ad, I have taken it, every person has five or six people in his family, Papa. Mom, wife, child, friend, brother, sister, everybody, watch the hours, you will not see any ad, you will not see a single ad, then how much is the profit, it cannot be more than ₹, second thing, brothers and sisters, today I show my business skills, the one from Stanford.  And on top of that, Harvard Warbird, listen, my brothers and sisters, tell me one thing, if an ad comes then it consumes data, you are sitting with the data too, so if that ad is there  Data worth ₹ 1 is also being lost. If I watch ads worth ₹ of YouTube2 throughout the day, then my data gets included in it. If I clicked to avoid ads, we will not talk about ad blocker locker, it blocks YouTube2.  Do it and they are trying to save a rupee, it is okay, then those who do not see the ad, they have to pay it and the data that will be saved will be of ₹, so there is a profit of ₹, so today itself they all said Sandhi Machine.  Me too  Monetization I will also talk about that, there is some earning of 20-30 paise from youtube1 video, some of 10-20 paise and that is the lowest in India, in US still I am talking about 7080 paise of money, whatever money is in rupees then  In India, that 102 paise is for AdSense account. There is a formula of 55 45 percentage in it. Okay, so what have you done to it, friend, tell me one thing, a person's 50  You have taken advantage of the money, what claims are you taking, has it become great, I can also sell the course, you cannot sell the course, your knowledge is above, if you do n't sell it, then you will not make noise in two minutes, this is also a fact, if you speak.  I still don't take money. Now let's talk about this with someone. What is the benefit to me in the world? Hey Chaudhary has his own pleasure. Beggary has his own pleasure. I don't take money and don't monetize. In every other video you say like  I am in every video  I say that I am the number one lover of clarity. Everyone says something or the other to increase subscribers, to impress, to do anything. If you speak in every one, then it is definitely a spice, is n't it? You don't monetize everything.  Donkeys, horses, lame horses, they are all monetized and you invite them all on your channel and they were on so many channels, but you did not invite us, I am the one with the most knowledge, I am youtube1, you have invited me.  I did n't invite you on the channel, why didn't I invite you because I don't have subscribers, if I had five million you could have invited me too, that's a different matter, I still don't come because I don't appreciate what you preach, it's okay and it will happen one day and still no.  I will come but others will come. Yes, you are doing great work. No one is doing great work. Every buddy is on fame or money or boat or Chaudhary Hut or knowledge. Why don't the leaders say all this? Ministers have opened up, serving ministers of big governments all over the world have asked youtube3 IAS officer wants to come, IPS wants to come, Minister wants to come, sentry wants to come, everything wants to come, so say that I would rather come.  I am doing good, I am not doing good, everyone is building their brand, today I will talk about business because some of them are running this business, some of them are not getting any views, you are sitting with 3-3 crore subscribers.  3 lakh views do not come, getting views on youtube0 is like considered bare minimum for a creator, so if we assume that this video of mine is being made and how many subscribers do I have, let's assume it is 170 something like this, then it should be 177000, brother, it should come at 10.  So you should come on average, if you don't come even after 1st, then no one sees you anyway. People come, don't know if they had ever come at some time, saw you, now they are gone. After listening to the number of subscribers, you go to see how many views are coming and how many are coming in the last 10 months, how many are coming on 10 videos, look at that, that is the thing and if someone watches even 30 seconds of that video.  So views count is there, friend, this video has 2 lakh views, so if someone watched the video even for 30 seconds, if someone watched 28 seconds, then the views are not counted, if someone watched 30 seconds, now it is 30.  If someone watches 31 seconds of a 31 second video, then the view count is done, but brother, the retention rate is only with the creator, it is only he who knows it, so I come in such a hurry and call myself number one.  So I have good feedback, I know that even if very few people watch my video, the one who watches watches it very well. Good comments also come in the comment section. You also write. One of Sandeep Maheshwari. Claim to fame - This is what earlier used to speak, what words were easy, now it is not easy, people like us have taken away the air since last two-three years, what is easy, nothing is easy, it is not easy to clean your stomach in the bathroom in the morning.  This is easy by force, it is easy, even after doing it, people can't say bad because no money has been taken, this is the only thing other wise, there is no benefit, it is like running on a trade mill, brother, the work is free, it is free only. with money  Good things happen in life, there is no guarantee by giving money, money will be wasted in many places, but till date no one has benefited from free electricity, free water has never been good, remember this sir, there has never been any benefit and now for so many years.  After getting so many subscribers, Monetize Kar said in the last video, why did he find a noble cause in filing a court case against one person, till now you should have found the education of children, poor nutrition is going on in India.  At some places, to increase the skill set, they would have given some courses by purchasing them from others because you cannot make them, this is a fact, it is okay, at least they would have done something, they would have opened a university, given money for education, given scholarships, given 50 works.  It could have been done till now, whatever sacrifices have been made in so many years on youtube0 90, people skip add in 5 seconds, some 5, 10, 20 seconds seem forced, so today I told everyone. Brother, can't you give one rupee? Should the creator stop his ads? There are so many 1.5 crore channels made for you. You can't spend one rupee of yours. Google3, give five numbers. Everyone will do good. Four.  Give gifts to people, give gifts to mom, give gifts to dad, everyone's mom and dad, everyone watches youtube1 and four more, then take four more, why are you taking such a favor of ₹ that I do n't know, you have done a lot of great things.  This model of Sandeep ji, many people praise him till he reaches 3 crore subscribers and till he reaches that stage like I know, look at you, there is no example of me, a housewife is not complete without marriage, a housewife is greater.  There are two brothers in Kailash, one brother is abroad, is it okay or does he work somewhere outside? That brother and his daughter-in-law do not even ask whom. The elderly couple who own a house in Greater Kailash and this daughter-in-law is serving  She does not take anything, does not monetize anything, says Namaste in the morning and evening, after serving for 18 years, the house worth Rs. 18 crores became her son's name, but the one who was the daughter-in-law's husband, she would have said, ' Son, if you have served a lot.  Brother, she was his investment for 17 years. She didn't even suck. She was great. She was great, so she took a bite of greatness in one go. Everyone takes a bite. Some say, I am not doing it now. I am not doing it now.  I am not doing it now, keep growing, keep growing, keep growing, I am doing it now because the rest of the team must have told me that every person has to grow. Hey brother, Mukesh Ambani is giving jobs to so many people like this, Adani Jobs.  He is giving, not spreading the business. No, that is also a service to the people. He said, I don't take money for anything, I do it for free, then what is the benefit of 5 crore people? Did so many people come and see your views?  so many people  You might have subscribed, some might have unsubscribed, some might not have done it, you do n't see anything, anyway, off your subscribers, don't watch Sandeep Maheshwari ji, now he gets angry even when he says that, he gets chilly, he is much younger than me. I am not much older than them, I am only two years older than them, I am also telling you this, go and check today, theirs and mine will not be seen anywhere, by the way, I am telling you that this is Dr.  Eating 'Peda' suits many people because you have attracted all their energy just like that. Something is happening to the losers. There is a time to scold them. Hey, wake up. All those things come as soon as they move away from that loser mindset.  When every person comes out, he has not understood the content because this dozen takes you anywhere, these are all very bad things, these are round talks, first of all it is easy, it is easy and he is like this and she is crying, those boys.  The children are those whose parents did not listen to them, if not then we listened to them. Well, these are some creators like this one and that one is our Acharya Prashant ji. Their subscribers are increasing. India is going in the wrong direction, this is the barometer. Now come and tell me, they are whipped a lot, look at their army of Acharya ji, look at theirs, they are sitting at four, four, five, five crores, but will you find common subscribers of both of them, who came to this shop first? Took out the juice and then something happened but some of his intelligence awakened and his conscience did not awaken, then he went there to awaken his conscience, but he is doing nothing, he is doing nothing, he just comes and takes motivation and goes to sleep, now that is easy, it is easy, I have stopped saying it is easy. Why did you stop saying that it is easy because ultimately our people came and said that it is easy, there is nothing and motivation is nonsense and many people got relieved, what is motivation? In the morning, as soon as I get motivation, I feel that I have achieved a lot.  If you do nothing, then let's move ahead now, whose loss was this? The timing was very well chosen. There was a fight on 67th December. Vivek Bindra ji probably had a fight with madam and he. The video was released on 11th December. Man, when  When down and out happens, many people come to defend me. I am not criticizing Vivek Bindra. Here I am not a fan of anyone but I am going to tell the future of both of them. What is the fate of Vivek Bindra ji? Bringing big people does not mean that if I take big people, that is the benefit. Brother, if you are at the level of ABC or CD, if you bring a PhD English scholar, then it will not be beneficial for him.  It's all Shobha ji, it's all style, there is no need, keep teaching silently and comfortably like a down to earth leader, it is better, when a person with 2.5 crore or 3 crore subscribers sits, then some Tom Deacon Harry can come. Anybody you can get because he will also get views, he will also have a name, then you will keep interviewing him and other people, bring that Khan sir, he has so many subscribers, he has so many subscribers, all the YouTubers, if everyone knows what it is, then your ability to get.  Anybody is not something great, he does not gain any knowledge by coming there, there are some case studies, there is no practical benefit of Mahatma Gandhi ji.  Tell me about this, tell me about Doval ji, all this is pass time, this is also fine, it is like Dhruv Rathi has a little spin, he is on Wikipedia, he comes with something, then the youth goes there, all these shoppers.  There is knowledge that nothing will be achieved in life like this, you take hold of Elon Musk's model, take hold of Jeff Bezos's and do it. If you live longer, you may be in Ara, Ballia, Bastar, Samastipur and you are learning Elon.  What has Musk done? Brother, that eco system is yours, neither Samastipur nor Bastar, so you have not left it, it is okay, you live in Basti, you are okay, you live in Roberts Ganj, you live in Mirzapur, now enter there.  I went to your IBC and after taking these courses, you did these courses there, you don't understand them, I tell you people, listen carefully, this is from my IM, big colleges of Ahmedabad or Stanford, Ivy League colleges are fine.  Get hold of some big ones, London School of Economics, take out the content there and distribute it among the poor in India and say that brother, you know this, it is available for 1.5 crores, I am giving it to you for how much, what will be the benefit of 15000 rupees?  He Be Able to Understand Anything in IIT Why did not everyone get a job in IIT Daily? Because many people got into it who did not deserve to get into it because there was no crutch. Why do people commit suicide in IIT to enter IIT? It is so difficult to enter IIT, one should party inside it only after getting the stamp of IIT, if one gets life, then why do people commit suicide in IIT because of the paper.  You are not passing. Why are you not passing? Because you simply did not deserve to be there. You were not able to study. You found it difficult. You did not pass. This is the main thing. The basic thing is that when you do not meet the standard of qualification.  No, you say that this is a thing worth Rs 50,000, you do n't know what it will do, yes, it has power, yes, those Rs 50 should be sold for Rs 80,000 according to me, but sell them only to the right people who will actually take advantage of it and they will take advantage of that benefit.  That's why I am saying that there has been a lot of loss, there were children in this ecosystem to take advantage of that, but you have sold so many, you cannot sell more with the audience you have, you have limited sales.  If you can do it then you have increased the ecosystem. You have given up those of your IBC, you have given up a lot, sell, sell, sell down, now it has gone here, it cannot give that benefit to the people here because the others did not even do the course, they are sitting at zero.  If you multiply zero by 10 times then it will remain zero. Now they had to earn money by selling the course. I told them that there is flow in your model. You have also given your number. You are also selling the course, so when that number goes,  These people will buy from you, your direct employees etc. will directly say that friend, if you take it from us, then the model is spoiled here, if the first thing is you should not have done this, you should have sold them on your own, you should have told them children this. You have knowledge, you have some business, you have some accounting, you know something, I will take it up, someone is sitting on zero knowledge, if it is zero, then he is sitting on income, if it is 10 times zero, then it is less.  When these IMs take tests, they make you work hard, don't you say that you can't join IMs, you can't do IT, how much study do you have to do for that, the percentile should be this much to give the test, gave the exam here, gave the cunt's exam, then my analytical in it.  Skills are checked, this check is done so that after reaching there you can cope up with the syllabus, then they see you in GD, then they also bring all types of children in their class.  There are no freshers, there are 2 years, 4 years, 6 years, 8 years of service, IM has different weightage, even today the common man does not know about the admission process, how much weightage is given to 10th and 12th mark sheet, they give to graduation. How much weightage do they give to marks? How much weightage do they give to their entrance test marks? How much weightage do they give to GD and how much weight do they give to job? They all have M.  That in the class representation, there should be science people as well as arts people, boys and girls, freshers, people with 2-4 years of service, and people with 10 years of service, so that the class remains balanced and they are peers among themselves. Peer learning happens in your IBC, there is no peer to peer learning. You were bound to be defamed, that was bound to burst, whatever it was, now what else is the harm? It is certain that Sandeep Maheshwari ji will also be harmed by this because this is his unruly nature coming out. He had done such small things earlier also.  -The fat people are after YouTube, okay, I do n't know whether they will follow me or not, okay, but it's the same thing, ask a lot, live in an attitude, okay, so what have I said wrong, I am saying that brother, I am not reaching anywhere.  Today I have repeatedly complained that I do not monetize, today I have monetized and told that you are doing good to someone for a maximum of 30 paise per day. Let's see who will become a tycoon by doing good for 30 paise, okay? Maybe you don't even get videos every day, maybe no one even watches yours, so maybe you are getting only five paise worth of money. Look at one rupee, who should YouTube1 take? Youth should be proud that you are doing a great job. One more thing.  He was explaining the harm done due to Vivek Bindra's model being messed up. Still, his 10 day MBA guy is coming, so people are focusing on him. How can MBA be done in 10 days? Come on man, I have kept the name.  Go watch that video on 10 day MBA. I have seen that there is content in it. Now I am not defending it but I am saying brother, the content is strong. Look, it is getting more views. Despina is traveling so.  Much from the personal system, whatever has come will happen and all that has happened, okay then something will happen, there will be fights and quarrels, we cannot be so judgmental, that is the job of the police and law to see but now what is happening as a  The content is getting 78 lakh views and Sandhi Mashori's views are 2.5 lakhs, so brother, who is watching how much, who will be the judge from that, go and see now.  There is no 10 day MBA, a little MBA can be done in 10 days, so another conspiracy theory of mine comes from this that all these college MBBS and those who were short-changed were also very angry with Vivek Bindra that he would close his shop if  Genuinely, if a person learns more things for less money from small courses through free content, does 5 10 15 20 Hajj on his own time and does the work, then who cares about them?  Will see because that is why the focus is given again and again on the certificate, that Sandhi Mashar is saying that no one has the power to live in your certificate certificate, today the power is only on knowledge, but earlier Guruji used to give knowledge in Gurukul and  Guru's knowledge used to be there. If 10 people sat under a tree and took the knowledge, if they took the knowledge then that knowledge had value and who went there and told the name of the Guru under the tree and told his brand image. Showed the certificate, it was not like that, said that knowledge is visible, it is visible on the face, look at someone's face, talk to someone for three to four minutes, do n't even talk to anyone, it is written on the face, who is so intelligent, what strength is there in whom, so this is  Certificates have no meaning anyway. In fact, none should be given. Tell someone to read this. If you understand then go away. Tell me, what is a certificate? I have learned cookery from there, certificate. Hey, you made carrot halwa. We give you certificate, you make roti, you make vegetable, make paneer, bhurji, make matar paneer or any dum potato, we will tell you that certificate is there, now you have to lick it, now bring a middle three star rated cook and someone with superior presentation, Sashi, Japanese dish with big hi-fi and  Sell Robert, when he goes to Ganj, he will abuse us and say that he gave us the Hajj, what nonsense is this, he robbed us, it was better for us, whatever that is.  If you eat then now Vivek Bindra ji is giving a lot of his knowledge in the product, which is fine, but when it comes to applying it on yourself, if you go to the wrong audience, you will get scolded. Why did you go to a small town, I say small.  Many things cannot be done in the city because the eco system is such that they do not value your knowledge and you yourself gave them the model of selling the course because it seemed like a get-quick thing, isn't it?  If it is increasing in popularity then don't leave it because in it you have said that I have so many parameters, I have made a dashboard, if you do this much, if you do it like this, you will get it, he will do it like this, then there is a difference between making it and following it in real life, isn't there a refund? You have done your legal duty of not giving it but that is mis selling of the product which is not needed like ULIP Unit Gender Insurance Plan is a scam product in itself no one needs it, don't sell it to anyone but they will say because  Insurance is different, investment is different, we have done this brother, you will not get anything from this, everyone knows ULIP is a ruined product and the world has sold it but still it is sold and that product itself is useless, no one should buy it. Neither the rich nor the poor should buy this product, but this product was wrong here, so it is the MBS of the college and the loss will be that now the knowledge which could have been obtained anyway, will be said to be in institutionalized wages only. Tomorrow we have to go and take it, there will be a difference beyond what other people used to sell their courses and things because people will ask for a lot of guarantee and warranty, like I say in everything, guarantee of only one thing, we will leave this world with this.  Apart from this, if someone is giving you guarantee of anything in life, then he is not fooling you. You are an idiot because you are learning the guarantee from him. Now you will say, he is giving guarantee, no, no, that is the benefit of your being an idiot. picking myself up now  It is a very difficult thing to be considered an idiot, if you learn the guarantee of anything in this life, this marriage will work, this flat will work, this government will work, this leader will give me happiness, you can take this guarantee that I will get up at this time in the morning, I will make the bedsheet on time.  But I will go to the bathroom, my stomach will be clean, I will clean the bathroom, I will make my own breakfast, I will reach the office on time, I will not fight the whole day, I will work, I will come on time, you cannot guarantee such a day for your body, you will do seven things in it.  It is written that you may be able to do four, you may be able to do five, you may be able to do even seven, but you cannot take a guarantee. No one can take your guarantee. If you are learning guarantees from the world, then is n't it foolishness and someone is saying the same thing?  He is giving a guarantee, hey, anyone is giving a guarantee, he is seeking, Sovan is a guarantee, Sovan also defaults, the government also defaults, the economy also defaults, it is wrong to do so in Kolappan certain world, a little bit of this even from Sandeep Maheshwari ji.  It's a request and it's an advice. Who are you to give me advice? Why is there a need to be? You are also giving advice to the world, we are also giving it. Freedom of speech is fine. I told Vindra ji just because your content is good. And you claim that I am doing a lot of good, what is happening on the ground will be checked, people are crying while asking for money, seeing great absence and happiness after seeing such a great image of yours.  People are getting irritated right now many are enjoying. Look at the losers, he used to motivate us. Look, he himself has turned out to be a beast. Are people enjoying? This is telling the psychology of the people instead of suggesting that I like someone, someone.  I follow him and if something like this happens in his life then I should feel sorry for the person that what happened to you, the story is being told that you were fighting with your mother, your wife came to save you and Hearing the wife doing the same is not the same till date, meaning which wife will come again to save the mother-in-law, now the police will look at her and what else she has done. Something must have happened, but why do we go into someone's personal affairs? It is fun, is n't it?  To see the fall of Sambeet Bada Gyan Pelta used to say, Gary bhi karke hai ek ka hai from US, that too, very family family, and that kar uter famous, ok, influencer, very similar profile, he got divorced.  Big people there and in the US too, in the US, divorce is not a big thing, every other person gets divorced, it is okay, so yes, we used to be treated like a big family, even a person like me gets scared.  It's as if my God's program is going well, but man, look, the public is waiting for us. What happened to you, tell us about yours, tell about yours, tell us about yours, friend, what kind of public are you, accept that a man is saying the right thing and  Something may go wrong in his life. It is possible that something may go wrong in someone else's life, but what is the point of this? Vulture is all about enjoying. Well, I leave it to you guys and no one is benefiting from this episode, no one.  Isn't it the benefit of YouTube, isn't it, Uniraj, one YouTube forcefully forced the other one, I will do it like this because brother, you have to launch your business a bit, you have to monetize that series of yours, it was running at 2.5 lakhs, there was a controversy, it got 50 lakh views directly.  There will be a spark, but this pot of pot, no matter how many times you offer it, it doesn't boil again and again. There is a saying that you can be satisfied even with two to four lakh views, like me, organic growth, word of mouth, Ayushmann Khurrana, no marketing, no sales, even for me. I too get a lot of collabs, which FM do they come that say yes, you will get so much money, brother, promote yourself only, I.  I don't believe that books can be heard, books can be heard, songs can be heard, brother, books can't be heard, even these are the things that I am saying. The communication that I am trying to explain is less verbal, it is my emotions, hands, body language.  It is also communication, it makes more sense than this, so if you just listen to someone like this in a podcast, it will not be as much fun, but here it will be more fun because it shows the truth of a person's face and emotions too.  They are also very important for communication, the way of reading a book is different, notes are made for it, one sits after reading four pages, things are not heard while walking like this, if you have to reach somewhere, you have to do something, then things in which you do not believe.  What does the public even care about doing, but the public too, you, someone, yourself, now all the users say something in between, okay, add, some run, some don't, some affiliate, some do stuff, some do, everyone has their own models.  to the public  Say everything is free, it will be good for you, YouTube is a market of 12000 14000 crores, the creators of India, the thumbnails that are made, right brother, these are made for 50-300, the good ones are made for 300, the bad ones are made for 200, the good one will probably make for 300.  If someone makes thumbnails of Rs 400, he will be fooled, then someone will make thumbnails of Rs 500, Rs 200 or Rs 500.  If you make 30 40 50 videos then it has a separate expense. If someone gets the translation done then it has a separate expense. If animation comes then it has a separate expense. People do not have this idea. People do not have the idea that there is GST too, digital space.  If you earn money in 00, then 8 is GST, then he takes the platform fee, even if youtube2 takes three rupees, when you open your account, you will know that you earn 00. Actually you earn only Rs. 35.40. If the customer gave it then the person to whom he gave it earned Rs. 35.40. In between, someone else took away Rs. 60. There is also the government which takes the tax, I have included it too, so this much is left. That's it.  Every time thinking like this that this is happening wrong and should be free and he is great, this one is not great brother, no one is great, all ours are here for someone and Chaudhra  There is no fun in anything like becoming a Choudhary because the ultimate real person knows that here on earth everything has to be left behind, wealth or here, get a taste of the Choudhary forest of the world. In any way, we are fakirs. You have my channel.  If you haven't subscribed, we will take this mobile phone of ours and go away. You can do it like this and say, it will be nice to see man, he is such a good man, he is a beggar, people like this beggar, people like to hear it, beggar is marketing in itself.  Very strong, if you won't see me, will you listen to me? You will even come to a cave in the Himalayas, I will bring my own, I will take my mobile, nothing is going to be left behind, all this nonsense, no one has time, if you go once, then you will see how much more sad you will be.  A man's style is more than can be said. Any person should ever remember that if he does anything, he should say again and again that I am doing it for free, I am doing you a big favor, I am doing it, I am doing it, there are only two things.  there are only two things  Is he a very stupid person? Okay, or is he a very dangerous person, one of these two, one has to choose, the third is that there is no option, he is dangerous because he does not know where to go and what to do, or he is a fool because he cannot earn money on his own.  Ca n't do anything for himself, he ca n't do anything for you too. It seems like people like this will become associates and then they will say like this And if you find yourself fighting for some other human being, don't say it like this. It's about our conscience. Why did I speak like this about Vindra? Why did I speak about Sandeep Maheshwari? Do you know that you are his brother? You are not reaching anywhere. Don't waste so much of your life. If your husband stands up for his wife, then stand up for your mother.  Neither life is the same, only this heaven is found, it is said, we are not there, we are not there, which is the dialogue of Kashmir, this is heaven, this is heaven, only this heaven is available, take a stand for yourself, do n't get depressed in front of your employer, stand so much for yourself.  Take it in front of your parents, do n't show narcissistic behavior, don't stand like a donkey, you come to stand for someone else, I am never mine, if someone trolls me on any channel, someone says, I don't expect my subscribers.  People like me, go and fight, brother, I am Guruji, I am a man, I can fight and speak for myself, you don't have to tell anyone, here I see, I have said something to the leader in our country. How did you tell our leader, how did you do it to my Twitter, how did you do it to my star, people are afraid of not getting into trouble, like this is the case with Sandeep ji, he is afraid of getting into trouble, will he come here or no, it is very good.  Nothing good, they too know us, YouTube, everyone knows each other's status, what work we do, what we do, how we are, how we earn money, food, everyone knows everything, just like everyone knows the realtors in real estate.  It happens that in a hospital, the doctors know the doctors, everyone knows everyone, the lawyers in their business know all the lawyers, what we do well and what we do badly, tuition, the master who teaches us knows everything, what we play.  Everyone knows how to play, but this high moral ground is a dozen work these days and if you suck from high moral ground then you are a fool, it can only be said that every man is for the views on his own, now that  Views What does he need from this, that is a different matter but it is for the sake of views, he is earning views by doing it for free, and if you are saying one thing again and again in everything that I am doing this for free, free, free, that means by troubling you.  Is it somewhere else that he needs to come and say in every other video that I am doing something, I do n't know, your brand is growing, do you sell any of your images? 20 30 50 60 70 8 Photo of Hajj.  Do you sell? Someone asks, brother, how can you take a photo of me for 5 Haj, take it like this, I will give you 00, there are so many proud people sitting in India, everyone will take photos, then why are you able to sell it for 25, 30, 50, because one becomes a brand associate. These are more like the ones who actually sell paan and tobacco, but there is no ad for paan and tobacco, so do Juba Kesari and do your ad here, take that, that, that.  The saffron which is sold is not worth Rs and the goods worth Rs 2000 crores are being sold here, so it is such a market and say, I do not take money for this, now someone come and tell me, which means who is your Akshay Kumar and which is this Ajay Devganj? Shahrukh Khan ji, we do not take money, you are promoting it, you are doing everything or nothing, I am not saying that the photo is equal to this, my aim is not that they are selling the photo or that it is a wrong thing.  It is a good business, it is a good thing, but it is sold, its brand image will be yours, make yourself so many subscribers, then you can take 9 lakh 36 lakh or whatever from the consultation, it is okay, you can get your free free free free free free. By doing 99.99 for free, by doing 01 for free, do it for everyone, so don't have a high moral ground of coercion, it is a business model, everyone is following their own different, how many have I seen? Under the examples, it was told that she takes the house of the greater class, the elder daughter-in-law or the younger daughter-in-law, whoever lives with her, the friend, the mother, will take the tea, these people will take the hard work of 18 years, brother, oh sir, you have got it worth one crore, don't you know, 5 lakh 10 lakh.  The second son and daughter-in-law were sitting in the package. They were getting rich. On their monthly salary of two lakh rupees, everything was looted. Even if they had lived together, it would have been 18 crores.  Instead of the house worth one crore, it would have been divided into seven and 11 crores, if you did more service and took it all away, then you got the benefit of that hard work, so you earned a number there too, whatever devotion you do, being a good person.  That too and then monetize it also, when the new thing is chit, my patvi, my aada, my father 's yes, it's a nice approach, I also normally teach people to follow like this, so brothers and sisters, now what am I?  Sell ​​yours, my happiness course is about to end, decision making. If you want to learn decision making, I did a very great workshop for only 99 rupees for two and a half hours, where I taught business, what are the mental models and told all that, the same mental models are on my channel.  It was available for free long time ago and it did not even reach thousands of views, meaning it went away in its own form and as soon as I monetized it, brothers and sisters, and as soon as I added it and as soon as  I have a big subscriber base and Bhai Saheb has become very in demand. This is the truth of life. When there is a free advertisement in the newspaper, those smooth pages are thrown in the dustbin. You pay Rs for the newspaper and then you keep it for trash. Because ₹ has been given, the thing for which money is given is kept with care, free never has any value, never learn anything for free, free only works for free, it is not necessary that you get value even by paying, this is a truth.  Is Somewhere you will give 3000, it may be worth only Rs. 300, somewhere, if you have intelligence, that is, you have a lot of intelligence, then it is not a matter of intelligence, then you can make it a bagger, this is also a fact, only then you are very much like me.  I am going to tell you one of my secrets, those who are listening till now, a very big secret of my channel and you tell me whether you understand it or not, it is important to tell and those who were watching the video till now, write us your secret in the comment section.  If you know, I would love to know. Okay, I told you something at the end. Okay, if you watch my Clarity for You channel, every video which I come and speak is on 99, Hindi only, then I speak half a line in English.  Ek aadha koi word English ka bol deta, it's pure Hindi, it's ok, but in my thumbnails and within my topic, the topic is in English and a lot of people, which is also youtube1 base or my Kinship, acquaintance, my category, they come and say, 'Hey sir, write in Hindi, many people will see it, no, my audience is not an audience, who understands English, deliberation, I don't want a pure Hindi audience, those who don't even read English, do n't even understand.  Because if I go for them they are not my audience and will abuse me, they will not benefit. This is a deliberate attempt. This is a very deliberation. Attempt I know the very fact if I can put short thumbnails better thumbnails good determination I under sell it under that so that I want to stick to it I don't want to be you know Maheshwari sir and others are sitting with 3 crores of YouTube and Even 3 lakh views don't come, this is how it happens, you add people, add them, then there is no benefit to them, organic growth, slow growth, useful people.  Because you are also as good as your subscriber's intelligence, how is the intelligence of your followers, that is your brand image, look at Salman Khan's followers, he has some programs of a different level, look at Shahrukh's, he will get a different base, you are right, everyone is different -  Everyone will look different because they associate with those things. Rajini fans will have their own attitude. Everyone's matter will be different. Everyone's matter.  Yours may be different. Okay, I have told my cook that I will give Rs. 00 if you do not ring the bell, but he does not agree, not even Rs. 500. Now today he will have to offer Rs. 1000 because I make videos in Abhijeet Murat and this  Abhijeet, I make videos in Murat because I am a bit of an astrologer type of person, so my timing remains like this, ok, no problem, I have lost Rs 500, today I will have to offer Haj, ok please like.  Share this video and get more views. At least cross it with the 10 per cent formula I have given, which will be a great insult to you. Okay, so at least the subscribers of my channel should cross it by more than 10.  So you should watch this, at least it is okay then share, subscribe, further you will get to know very intelligent and good things. Thank you very much."

He will also try to know a little and Today's podcast will be about youth. India's youth these days around problems What kind of problems are you facing? And what is its practical and simple solution? Maybe we will talk about this today my first The question to you is that in the beginning i.e. today Let's talk about a few years before 10 15 years First in front of the parents and also in front of the children There is no option for further career There used to be less confusion. In today's time when we say that there are options it is a different situation, a different There is confusion, children can decide for themselves. Are their parents able to guide them? In which field is your career? If you can be successful in life then first The problem is this, the first question is this. In which field should I make my career I am Shar Many people will come to you and ask this What should we do, I have done it, I have done it, now I have done it. What There is a very simple answer to this confusion. Let's see this and that in India There are 144 crore people so everyone is not confused Many people have this thing but those people These rich people discuss who they are There are people who have no confusion about the rich It's okay for Alia Bhatt to have children. There was no confusion as to what to do. Abhishek Bachchan ji was not confused Shahrukh Khan's children have no confusion Mukesh Ambani's children are confused There is no confusion whose children have it. middle class kids are middle class Whose children will I tell that to, poor people? Even the kids have no clue Dad is earning 10-15 thousand rupees, mom is earning Dad is working as someone's maid. Rickshaw pullers are doing kid can do this Can Do Anything Better Can Do Anything In Life is long and it depends on the parents. He can do anything if he doesn't have money. Father is earning 10 and son is also earning 15 is or daughter is earning 15 it is considered a Progress is delayed and there is no confusion. Confusion: She can go anywhere and work Can't I in the Great Indian Middle Even in the class Indian middle class, he That is inside the job which is Indian Middle going about their business even in class ok, some shop has opened, this is done They too are not very confused I know something will happen or else it won't happen. It's ok to go to Chavadi Bazaar. Sir, his children are selling small cardamoms. There is not much confusion that oh is It's not about where to become or where to go. confusion one Limited section which is a very big section It is middle class and it has government employees. children of employees the most The second one is the corporate people who are confused. What is the reason behind Mansabdari system? Let us understand the times which existed during the time of Mughals. Where the king was the Mughal emperor. He was made a Mansabdar but he owned 5000 horses. Had I got more money, I would have been able to take my revenue. Was able to do everything but could not transfer If I could do it today, whatever parent By doing a job in life, he will become his own. One cannot transfer goodwill. Doctor if his child becomes a doctor Chartered can transfer patient Accountant can also be a lawyer for clients Can do it, even an architect can do it But the one who is going to do the job is something I can't do much then her child Now we have to fight a battle with zero confusion. Why does confusion arise? It arises because the The great Indian middle class has Those who started progressing slowly He joined the workforce in 1970-80. They had children who were the first born to freedom The country was very poor before independence. Even children used to do anything in 70's and 80's If anyone did anything, it would be with 40-30 people. It was better, then their children came, now they Whoever did whatever, whoever was born within 80 Born Millennials who speak Lately 70 80 They also looked like father if they were clothed. clerk is better than chapada clerk ka bachcha Became Group B Became Group B's Child Group A will now progress if India progresses. The child who is coming in the market in 2023 Don't take a good startup from your dad If you are IS then how will your child If you understand how to become a Tehsildar then how to become a Patwari. You are a group officer, the group is also an officer If anything, your child is not a shell. ok so now the confusion is this There is no confusion, we are actually saying this There is no confusion, there is no confusion, it is Just my aspiration and my status Difference and Confusion between Other Wise Give no confusion, do anything, this is the problem There are still questions left to discuss further. If you do, these things will come out. I will tell them, right now I am just telling you this I wonder who is confused and for what reason? The only reason for confusion is that They want to become something with money They are not interested in livelihood Not interested in social status If there is interest in livelihood If I were there, I would do 70 things myself. He said, I have five channels, that's my only channel. Apart from what I say publicly 65 If there is other work then why is this an example? Should you get into it I'll do the same thing Because of region confusion, hence Haryana I say brother he will ask for rose I am confused if I will eat berries or not People in Haryana say I will eat both You have only one bowl, give me two bowls. I will eat both and also eat gulab jamun. I will eat rabri and also eat paddy. I will take it and eat the kheer as well and eat it whole I will have the youth made no no my I have to become a professional again, we will discuss that further. If you do then this answer will be clear to you but Confusion just because parents in my job Mijbil you are yourself misbehaved wage or corporate he is not happy And every person should be happy in default setting If he wants, he sees that my Parents are not happy with their life The pattern is visible in his next things too Why don't you marry? Mother is not happy. By getting married I am a girl, I have become something So I will not marry because marriage Doing it hurts every day, today's youth Smart but they figured it out What not to do, what should we do This is confusion and what happens when you You cross a lot, don't you? You have less choice then you say Yes, and those songs have always been made in India. I was sure that Roshan will make my name famous in the world. Lal Durara is hiding somewhere Don't get into the kids of today They have entered into their parents and the same This transfer of energy is called man It's working like we both do it Are we making our father proud? are working and dad's I want to ask your name Roshan What is the name of his father who is President? Not many people even know the name of the President. Maybe you can't tell in India but Don't know the name of the President's father It will happen that even after becoming President, father's If the name doesn't shine then we are me and you. what to illuminate Why should I take it? It's simple to make a name famous. I asked you a question and how many others? Famous people are Virat Kohli King Kohli Will Kohli tell my father's name? Kohli is roaming around a lot after telling his father's name Father's father is Virat Kohli's father. Tell me the name, now that name has become clear. What if I don't know my father's name? We need to get the concept out of our minds I will explain with a practical example Tell your parents, brother, do whatever you want. It makes sense that what is happening is dynamic. It's a world, many things are changing Artificial Intelligence is coming from six Seven skill sets are required for seven to eight tasks. Will do what today's youth of 20 years is listening to He will work till 80 years of his age In the next 60 years at least it will increase by six to seven years. Will do six to seven jobs and may also be unrelated can there is no work if some buddy can get In Today and Continuing People Who Are in the Government jobs are also listening last 20 who has been working for years and is working in government What work was being done even in the job? His job is government but he is like you. You belong to social media, you belong to news channel. If you have experience in this, tell me. You were doing it 10 years ago. Didn't make a difference in the way of making the difference Including who we are interviewing today This is you who sent me the link and we We were discussing even this is not changing Something changes every three months or six months. So what should we do to focus more? It's important to start doing it right. Let's move on to the next question and this The question is about our education. It is related because the problem facing the youth This is what happens, I even did college. I also graduated, I post I am a graduate and also studied from a good college. Even after taking it, I still don't have the job of my choice. Those who have already got the job are getting it. They feel that their potential Justice is not being done to him or is he not doing that much? Are not able to earn and future is also like this I don't think he'll be able to earn that much. both those who have got jobs Both of them are upset as they haven't got a job. The stress in the life of parents is that Even though we have educated the child, can't do anything special Look, many people have given a very simple reply to this. If you watched very old movies, you would know this. Otherwise go and do movies in 1960 Dharmendra used to come in 50 late 50 60 I have also seen the old one and that in it Nor was there an engineer Babu in the village. I used to fall in love with a village girl. And a bridge had to be built there and that He used to keep a roll of paper with him like this and He used to roam around like this and hire himself. Everyone and only that bridge was being built at the end. Some government employees used to be older than him. Everybody respected him by calling him Babuji Babuji They said and that person is someone competitive Graduates did not pass such great exams. It was only about graduate BA and those movies. I used to come son, you passed me mother Mother, your son's first tankha has passed. There was such a sense of entitlement that if you If you do a degree or study more, You will get a job, your life will be good If it happens then people pollute extra The biggest problem in life is that brother You are a 120 for two in 20 overs so 300 Runs will be scored because the run rate is 6. Do extra polling but brother take 1 SP also. can be out and if a good pin If the shutter comes at the end then it can also become 350 or 400 Now the problem is that those who If you are graduating then you are graduating. Value is not equal to The paper on which the degree is printed There is no value, there will be a paper of its size. Now people will think that what brother? Sir the child will not do it anymore it is not ours If people do then they are roaming around with degrees. He has no value, no skill set There is no and bsot syllabus engineering Now put pendrive and floppy disk inside also. We will teach you something from the beginning, not the syllabus. There's nothing practical these days, kids! Those who are doing graduation themselves say that there is no reason for this. But we have to do it because we are graduates. The marriage has to happen, how will it happen otherwise, wife? who marries nearby Will do fine but don't focus on money and The jobs that are there have no meaning and This entitlement has arrived here the entitlement It has come to pass that I I would like to meet a girl whose There will be a dimple on the lift wheel whose height will be 5 feet. She will be 6 inches tall and will be working for her mother. Will prepare and keep food. Must also know how to cook and I think you will be a great life partner. I made this figure of my partner that I will marry only such a girl and before that My bell will ring when she comes and the flowers outside It rains from somewhere now this has to happen in real Life, you turned 25, turned 28, turned 32. It's done, it's not happening and what are you saying? Why am I not getting what I deserve? I want to say who said that you We deserve it, that's what we were told. But who told you this, this is the syllabus? I thought it would happen once you reach here. It may not happen like this, it may not happen like that, it may not happen like this. Hey brother, I told you that story. no it doesn't happen but it doesn't happen Then why do they go to college? Yes, why? You go brother, if you shouldn't go then what? Even if you don't become a graduate, it's better for your children. If you are giving any knowledge to people then you Hey brother, you send children to this man. You are setting yourself, he is not asking Ask whether this middle class is stupid or not Why am I not getting this, asked Papa Because you talk in the language of your parents Son, once you complete 10th and 12th, life is set. Son, I got good marks in 12th. Got good marks but 12th So there is no point in being competitive exam is held Son, once you finish college, you will be somewhere. College is set, now what after that? Do it, I am saying it above all else. People from IIT Delhi also need IET, isn't it? Some people are not getting jobs, everyone is not getting it. Not getting IT Delhi worth Rs 5000 I am telling you, I am not talking about everyone. A lot of packages are also available to some people. If you are not getting Rs 75000 as a fan then this Thinking I'm walking around with a degree Its quality is no higher The quality of education is below that of America. Money for American quality Now that faculty will have to pay their money Where will you get a university now? There is more name left in our Sonipat But brother that faculty will not discuss If you bring it from outside then you need money, right? To bring an intelligent man then he Education has become expensive, good one now has money So if you don't want to give then that government will also give something. Don't say much, say friend, everyone is a graduate. Go so that it does not happen that I killed your son. You did not let me graduate, you gave 00 00 School fees are higher than college fees These colleges are so expensive that they are open. What's the point of more, there's no point in it But it's like you become me, why should we stop? Son, you do your BA and then you do MBA. You do your PhD and then news will come. Application for Chapra job in UP PhD gave days and he got selected there too if it weren't there you wouldn't tell me tomorrow You have to select shellac which holds water. Have to feed, have to post photo, pick up clothes If you have to move this stuff here and there, you have to do it. Should I take a PhD? He will remain confused only he will say I am to k for this job then brother why are you coming Is it here if you are qualified? You know that PhD is not worth anything. If you know where the problem came from What is it that people are gathering their Like he collected stamps and coins as a child Used to be happy by doing something great, right? We have taken such degrees that we are collecting them. They have practically no meaning. The country has no entitlement to so many MBA is coming, there is no need for so much. No business is happening in our country I need so many MBAs, this MBA Basically it's a telecaller, a boy wearing a tie. Good morning sir sir sir will you take the plot sir Will you take the flat sir? It was your requirement sir. Don't want real estate don't want I don't want cold calling I don't want it Want not want 00 Let's meet in the morning Two people will call from 1:00 PM to 1:00 PM Will say send good brochure and no one else They will buy it and will do two sales in the whole year If yes, then according to that they will get 15000-180000. They just go from morning to evening, they feel they have work This is the hard truth of Employment in India because their To add value by improving quality You weren't taught anything in college, now call me. Just comes what to do next and senses off The entitlement is that I am an MBA. so something good So this was the main very bitter and sad s yes Yes, my next question is like this: Said that now degrees have no special value is no longer the one on which this degree is being printed The degree has less value than that paper. Then the next question that arises in the minds of parents is What if it comes to collecting a little money I should send my son abroad, daughter should I send him abroad? should I go to America, Canada? Australia UK go anywhere and out Go and study and settle down there? this solution This is the biggest thing, so what is geopolitical? This situation is happening to you in the world. Don't know who will send whom back and when What could be the reason now that so many have gone to Canada? Whatever happened, it happened now with Trudeau Everyone knows what happened so how safe are you And What Will Happen in the Middle East You have got citizenship from the Middle East It's okay and everyone has their own Something is going on in the system, the biggest thing is this Is it true that even if you go there, more than half the people Indians go on student visas If you only cut onions at the dhaba, If you want to go to Indian dhaba and chop onions only then Why do you have to go there and then study and onion? If you want to bite then bite here then there will be no problem. This means that the middle class here is Driving a truck, cutting onions at a restaurant, like this If you do manual work in India, then shame on you. They will wonder, oh what is he doing This is the work of family and relatives. There is no problem if you go to Canada and do it Because the dignity of labor becomes That is one and not here in that country Nobody knows what he is doing No one knows what's going on there So if you don't want to go at all then you should You have to go to a foreign country when you are in India. You have studied well, get a job here Have been and from here your firm is such that Are you sending it or are you sending the foreign form from here? I am employed in Big Four, Big Six or any too in all and she takes you so that When You Go There You Learn New Things It Is very important now as you now media If you go to space once, it will take you two years. For That's The Way You Will Conduct Yourself By Coming Back Will Be A Value Addition You just walk away with your face raised and I will come back. If I had to do something, I would have to eat onions Only petrol pumps will be cut and refilled. So after cutting onions there we filled the petrol pump. If you come back to India then will you have any value? There is no edition and you will keep doing the same work there. What made me happy that I got 12 dollars an hour? I am getting 10, I am getting 20 dollars. There is rental so much that you go into the basement. You will eat frozen food, sweep and wash utensils If you do it yourself then you will progress or you will Went down here to sweep your house The utensils were being used, they were at least middle class. At least if all the children do this work at home I make my bed and clean my room Washing clothes should not be sold there by parents only. All the boys will go and throw these tantrums themselves. The one who does this wakes up here in the morning, mommy grandson. Make me some tea, I'll go for a stroll I will come like this, oh brother, you are like this Discipline: You will go there and teach it. It's okay if parents don't send the youth out. If you want to go for menial jobs then that is Middle class youth should not go there. Should go to lower class. Go to lower class. No more because this picture will come just now Donkey Shahrukh Khan's theme is also ok It will be something like this to see and this picture is super I am already telling you that it will be a hit because This is relevant. Your question is very relevant. This issue is very relevant and on this There is a lot to learn and there is an answer to it. Shouldn't Shouldn't Go, It's Not That Simple But I will still explain it in a simple way. If you are going to do lower class work Basically you are going to upset the British. and they are going to enslave them. If it is literal then brother, don't go there. By going you are taking science forward. You are doing research, you are doing software You're basically holding down a good job, Pa6 Your Jugaad of the month on Hajj above 000 dollars If so, then go there with your face raised. in the basement live in a dirty place, stay in a dirty place there too And if there is crime and issues then it is not Well, more than half of the youth want to go to Escape the Tomcat Parent Who Is Causing Trauma He doesn't let me live, what will the father do? What will you do, he will say I will go out I will sweep you away just to live. Not giving it if he tells them that you are The work you have to do there, here If you have the passion to pay, you can have a Team of People Working for You and You Can Do A start up, you have to work so hard It's cold outside, there's a war outside It goes what is the biggest problem Brother, you will go there and survive. You can save some money but don't get married Can because his wife also has to work A man cannot support his wife. There is no chance of a child in Tankha So there is no future for you, right? Will there be marriage or will there be a child? Will there be a child? Education is so expensive, don't you need the government These mohalla clinics will be available in schools And free electricity, free water brother, America is there There is also a root canal to remove the tooth. I also know people who come to do treatment They come to India after getting caught and then go away. There is power and waiting from above There is a list, you will go across the India You will go to the counter and say, \"My dear.\" There is gas, he will give chemistry. take medicine there and see you You are saying that your tooth hurts. No, you have an appointment in four days. See if you get what you want in India. I like to say that India is not medical. Brother in India money in your pocket If so, you can get treatment somewhere within seconds. And if you don't have money it will take 15 seconds Meaning it will take some more time, 10 seconds more Wise everything is available here so this is just The drums of water are pleasant and practical There is no and maybe this movie will come, all these I think she will address things. So that's what I'm going to do with this in a very short I am adding to the question that What are my parents thinking about sending me? What was he thinking when he sent it and what was he thinking when he sent it? Think that you don't want to send me any more to hear this. How to take decision after look very short They have to take a simple decision that if I I am sending you to study there. First look at the aspect of study By the way astrologically I say foreign The settlement of the country is a cursed combination. born in one's own soil, found in the soil It has to go or it will turn into dust. Something is a curse, yours is fine, something else is fine. Government employees, politicians and the like are people of they know them we We have made the condition of our country so bad that this Started living in the country, they know jinn tax He has kept it saying that you go and set out outside. They send this money a lot for settlement Many people after watching this video They should take advice anyway. Have to take it and feel that after studying there I will do something if I deserve you so much If we were there we would have done it here also and if you You only have so much money to go there Water has to be spent, it is very expensive to do this If it is then you can settle it here And I am saying this to the youth and Indians I need to go out to do business or to travel But don't get stuck in one country, I'm saying. I am in India and stay for six months. stay out sometimes for two months and here for two months go here and there and do business import export jugaad When you provide services to those people of the country Do not send those who do not have the clarity that Will he do anything for education in future? No idea what college is worth Because in your Delhi and here so many Agents are sitting there, they don't know this Renaissance University is not there tomorrow After going there I came to know that hey, this is that. It was not even recognised, how much will you check Friend, you don't want to study at all. Send it now, he was sent to Ukraine for studies. If they want to become a doctor then Similarly, the incident happened further but even if this happens If you had gone, which doctor would you have become first? You go there and learn Russian for a year. Be ready, you are ready to work so hard So there's a lot here too If it goes then according to me it should not be sent Most people are absolutely clear child going to school of economics You have got a scholarship, you are brilliant, look at you As an escape, will you go to the country or here If you are not leaving and I am leaving then That region is not there, nothing to do Ok this is the main thing ok next Let's move towards the question and there are lakhs of rupees in it. I think the number of young people who Today's people are busy and they are government officials. To show job preparation to the world The question I am asking you is that I I am preparing for competitive exam I am preparing for a government job the age at which he has the most He has more energy than his five year old self Spent a year preparing for that government job after which he is left empty handed And then he goes into depression, these lakhs What's happening with the youth in numbers Because he is disillusioned with private job It has become official at any cost. Job I want it yes it had gone a little bit yes I your question was about government job yes government I had a question about job. Yes, why do people waste so much time? See that first a jump in government job You are from a very poor family and your There's no way you don't even have a business There won't be any money, you can't jump butt Social status if one exam is cleared I would have jumped in and gotten married Market also drives endorsity What is the second thing if it is a matter of psychology? I haven't done it on any of my channels either. This is so much original content that has been posted so far I am giving it to you, you can spread it Because I have never said this openly. Although I have to make a video on this Tha But For The First Time Fresh Pakodas You The pakodas I am frying here are If you go into Indian mindset 100 150 The DNA of 100 years ago tells us a lot I remember my grandfather's father and many people Grandpa's and Grandfather's father's Generation Indians were whipped and beaten There used to be sticks when there were slaves. Who were the government people who killed these British people? Britons don't kill, Britons don't kill me too Made a video, that too will be done. Maximum at any given point of time remaining The ratio was more than 0, which means it is Indian only. Now, which Indian used to kill which Indian The Indian who used to kill was the government official. The man was fine, the government man used to kill now The government man who used to kill was also a historian. Used to be flogged, used to study in upper class system Caste people say that lower caste people should do it. These were the landlords, they used to own them, so That element was still there, but the government Naukri the great government job of the The British who belonged to the lower class anyone by giving him a job in the system Gave him the right to beat, gave him the stick He used to clear his own things. I have so many questions, I will tell you. Freedom will struggle, I tell you No one has recorded this yet. Not very politically correct and sexy and She doesn't seem diplomatic so she goes inside. I have come to everyone's country, even though it has become free. Our DNA says here or somewhere behind I was thinking that if I have to take that for myself now I have seen some movie after failing 12th. No but its theme is such that I If I have to do it in the system, I will be it. The feeling is different, there is no way, then that. There is a lot of motivation factor in that. He knows that I have not had sex for five-seven years. He knows what he is doing and his life is good. This is the only way he can come up I am telling you why I am from lower class. The rich are wasting money and their children are not coming. Middle class is doing middle class now Through my videos I have been working for two-three years. I am telling you that many people have stopped doing it now. Did it because the middle class released Said that even if my friend comes near then Papa Papa Why can't I become a group in my group? I will do it, Papa will be happy someday otherwise. Middle class or anyone who has access to money Who has a house in a big city and some money It's okay, he is not going, official, official I went to small town people and were poor This is what should happen and this is what should happen. I want it but his psychology is such that he wants something else Can't do it and once what once There is no addiction in giving exams once. Your paper prelim has been cleared somewhere. The numbers have come, you are left in the interview, will you tell me? Now no one tells that I am left out of the number. Son, 200 Hajj people are left from number two, isn't it? Everyone would come and tell their parents. Is left from number two whether it is from number 20 If this is also true then many times what happens when you're studying at home What happens at home if you are studying a lot? You get food and your parents too. You are not complaining, you are also working hard. If the parents also have sympathy then You start finding preparation easier. Once revised it is something like that You are doing 11th class six times seven times The syllabus is the same for any competition You are preparing, you are doing it for the first time. If you do that syllabus for the second time then it will not change. If you are reading the same thing again and again then it is easy. It happens and now you think man I have done more, now I have done more butt It's not yours, it's happening to everyone, you understand. When we graduate its time for There should always be a maximum of three tries Government's so that people do not impersonate but give The government also knows that there are not so many jobs. If we take away this hope from people then Then there will be agitation, told the government If you go and give you a job, the government said Scheduled Castes are castes upto 37 years of age Please attempt 15 atms. Someone's age was reduced to six, someone's age was increased increased the relaxation, did everything because of covid Come, give me relaxation, this is not an exam. Take it, India is there, it tastes good. India now has to tell us what to do Don't bother us like this You don't want to be our moral science teacher anymore. He is doing it, because he won't do it, right? People don't have an answer for that. Okay. I don't want to be an officer You assume that you are an officer somewhere Either your father or your brother was in the government. Someone has something and you are spreading knowledge. Someone else is saying, 'Brother, don't do it, you are better' You are jealous of me, you don't want me to be your brother Who forbade you but in 30 years? You are worthless because turmeric The valley was formed on June 20, 1576. There is no monetization of this information There is no use Quit India When did the movement happen and then this happened and in the country When was the charkha adopted in Bengal in 1905? Partition happened Who was Mir Jafar Mir Qasim What were the Mughals? Who were Babar? Who was his father? Humayun's or Humayun's was his, he has got no Meaning Humayun died after falling down the stairs Akbar was coming from his library with that It took 10 for 10 and it all died. Information is of no use in practical life Not when you come in like a lost gambler Are you coming out of UPSC? Market value is zero if even No one fears gambling, gambling is gambling. So brother he will play now how can you call a gambler You will tell me not to gamble, he is saying this India guys are making dream 11, I come every day Sara Country Dream 11 is making 50's We have to win, now what will you tell them? don't pretend you say It is irritating in their hands and this makes the most Big loss it's not happening tell you I am telling people what is actually happening. They say that the damage is being done that If people waste five-seven years There is no loss to their life, it is there If there is loss, then perhaps it is to suffer loss. The real loss Vishal ji is facing is that The one who got the job, the one who became so much Bad one out he ain't worth nothing His reels on the very first day of work Want to make tata teena like this ting ting ting By doing Ting we became IPS I came to do that work There is nothing in me then he says here So I did not get respect because of the actual work. No one performs the aarti from above. The minister beats the canes here Would the public even ask questions so sexy? So not as much as was said, it is something Like no one says heaven in heaven It is heaven, it is heaven, it will be found in heaven. If you meet and enter, you will find out that it is hell. Then someone said, the messenger of Yamraj said this The trailer was for calling you son. Now what is this inner reality? Now he will not tell anyone that We have come into such a loser profession, haven't we? Nothing works for us here, right? And we are actually Babu and we are like this Will do nothing for anyone in government job It's okay but it will take out frustration Then on someone on whom it will go out and the way Through technology, this government So many things are being taken out These people will just remain feedback givers. Big decisions of the government today Vishal ji Big Four Big Five in Ministry There are consulting firms, consultation is done by them only. This journalist is being taken, he is J. No sir, generalists are general people. He doesn't know anything, he is not a specialist. Government is still holding this outside consultation People are saying do this, do this, do this Do it because look at the government's thousands of crores If you want to take money and distribute it then No one knows the efficiency, right? What is there outside that you have to do business with? If he gives 100 crore rupees then there is no accountability Even a CO can be a failure if it is not done properly. Let the quarterly results not come, what is there here? So share from the government's own pocket. Well, that's just people's hard work. tax is the money that comes from tax They can do anything if they get it. We say we are powerful, you are not powerful. Those who cannot take home with themselves what happens to you when its offering is received Do you know what will happen next for Sara? The entire system of corruption will end. Because Indians will become very highly moral Because technology will arrive many years earlier If you remember from your father or someone If you ask, he used to be a lines man. That person with the telephone was a big nuisance. I used to add wires and the bill would increase and decrease. There was a landline and sometimes I could get a connection. It was not there, it had to be given on Holi and Diwali. And it was a big nuisance because of the lines man. There used to be a man not so long ago Youngsters wouldn't know it was like this Now that the mobile has arrived, it has become irrelevant. This is this, this lines man, this is what happens to him. Nobody knows that corruption is irrelevant. Earlier this ticket used to be reserved. Now it has come immediately, IRCTC has come online. She has come and becomes big. Earlier she used to walk. We will take tickets in the middle and will mention your name. Will do this now that all Aadhaar visits have been linked. If this happens then technology corruption will end. Will do it in future when there will be corruption No Vishal ji, social status is not available. No power, no respect and no money If you have it and you have to work, then it's a government job. There will be no fun in the job when this happens then these people will stop preparing And this paper is slowly leaking that This is happening now just like us are telling What is not happening, those who understand it That's the realization coming to those who are in denial You are demotivating us and me. So someone said, you say that your children want to send to government job After reducing the competition, I said wow, what a passion. It's mine, I will make five channels. People of World India should not do this and my It means wow if the children get a government job. I mean, it was fun to make accusations. I mean wow I'm working so hard ok for a government job that i Open the channel and brainwash from morning to evening. I am saying to the public that brother, you don't think like this. So it will be said that it is people's job to say this but this When genuine people give feedback on their own That friend, sometimes only a job in a government job Is there security for anything else? There is no security inside Covid The private man was in his house, the government man People were outside saying no official, oh official. The man has risked his life Elections will be held not government employees I can't say that the stomach is not going to come inside. Government employees work 24* Do it at normal time when the government You have to get the work done, don't refuse it. Can he, he will say, son, go there That's a picture of getting the election votes. Thi Newton There are four men sitting in that village If I vote for you, I will reach there too. Government and government employees should go there Can't speak like a corporate i don't Like the Boss I'll Leave the Job You Can't Leave Government Job When Ever You Wish Know You people, the government is such that even if you come If you wish to go, we will tell you like this. Not that I have resigned, we are like this If today's youngsters feel that this Okay, tell me, you don't want to do the job. Yes, you can be forced to do it too. Yes it can be done please come to our place You will find out if you get a government job here in the country. There are many departments of the government that you can enter. Will go as per their wish and will not do anything else You can become a government employee If you are working then you can't do anything. And today you cannot do it as per your wish. Being What Ever You Are Can Do a Job You Can Do You Can Do 10 Other Things But Government I can't do this thing when people know If it works then you will be clear. will do good to a lot of people one Nowadays it is said to follow the concept It's like someone asks what should I do?

We are gamblers, we will tell you how UPSC To clarify, Vishal ji, this is a laughing matter. If you calculate then it will be Rs 400 thousand crores. UPSC has a coaching industry where 180 IS selected whose 20 crores Tankha is 180 IS of the year 20 crore tankha If this is a year then Rs 40000 crores should be spent. Productivity worth Rs 20 crores is being extracted Because look who works as much It is considered that much in GDP, isn't it? If I am giving you two lakh rupees So that means I will add your work worth Rs 2 lakh. You are doing the tax of two, you are doing the tax of five. You are in the same ratio, isn't it 400?

Nice living in cities and wearing nice clothes their kids are enjoying themselves and This is what they are becoming, they are becoming smaller. Some are being installed in the districts in the cities. It takes two-four-five years for them to grow up If something happens then they go to the secretariat. I quit my job for 40 years in Haryana A bureaucrat is famous in his 60s Posting has been done and it shows 6 Posting but the room itself changes Even the floor does not change, four or five floors. If there is a secretariat then the floor should be covered once or twice. Floor changed, Arwaaz changed in 10 years The room has changed, he is the same and brother.

Ask the employee who can't find it. I am sad and I am in trouble Tell me the government employee whose age is 10 155 years. If you are in job for two years then there is Harim period A man may look good in 15 years There is no one who is happy, so people say If you are not happy then leave me hey brother It's like marriage marriage people are not very un I leave because I know I won't get another one. Let's make do with that, okay? I don't know why. It should happen because man himself is mentally Would have been so bad physically and emotionally He knows I can't attract anyone. If partner has to suffer this then this is what.

    "title": "Gen-Z ： Unveiling Their Game-Changing Work Mentality [T5wynJFWVjQ].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, the topic is very relevant. It is a topic for the Across College Group. This video is for the children of Jayanti and K generation. This video is for the second generation. In a little generation, I will tell you a little bit about the future, who are the children after 1995. Currently, those who are below 28 years of age, we put them in 'S', 'G', the first ones are the millionaires, who are between 81 to 9495 and the ones after that are  He is an ex and is a Millennial, he feels like he is a big fan and right now he has become a boss. Recently why am I making a video, a tweet was going viral in which it was said that he is a boy and not of that generation.  He says, give me a salary of Rs 50 thousand and I will reduce only 5 hours and I will not do it like this, I will make a little fun of it, Uday Elder Generation and many people said no, no, there is some truth in this too, so there is a discussion on this that this  Understand the generation that is I am not following the old people, I am not following the old ones, I first make my personal opinion and tell the question opinion, whose side I am on, it is okay so that it becomes clear in advance, so that if you think that he is 22, he is prejudiced from a non-brother.  Those people say in Body Grind, I am trying to tell this that the next generation has very clearly figured out what they do and what they run, there is no doubt about it here.  This is absolutely correct, but I also, what work, what is God, what is ultimate, what is this correct date, has not been figured out and they are not going to guide them because India should do less, they do want promotion, don't you want promotion at all, how can this happen, they are not able to understand, then they are not getting guidance, but what is wrong with them, please tell them that this path is wrong.  Now right, they do not have the idea of present people like me come and I want you gift, the name of the channel and the people bill give clarity to everybody D Holes Samaj Xanax, those who were born between 65 and 80, now they who struggle with this.  The generation has seen it, if it has not seen it, then the stomach has become Bharat. When the stomach has become Bharat, then that person does not suffer that much. You have to understand one thing basic thing that why do we do what we do when we do it for the sake of money. Yes, yes, we do it for the money, stop it, friend, if you don't get a mother then what will you do when someone's retirement, if he is satisfied with the things he is doing, or if it is less or not so much panic, then his yearning should also be less. Among the big lions, the well-to-do families of the rich, take them or close them, their children are no longer desperate and if they are not of the generation that is desperate then they cannot be made fun of, they have to look towards an achievement. If you are listening to me, then brother, if your children are not desperate, you are panicking about what is above food, clothing and shelter for them, then you feel that either you are the last one or the other person who should have accompanied you is not visible.  Last, everyone wants to go to their own lesson, your destination is different, where your destination is, maybe they are starting from there, you have to understand that many new children who do not have pressure, I also give them the flexibility to become something.  Is  There is also consultation as to what to do, what to do, it was to be settled, now in this matter, it is not the generation which is delaying the marriages, it is the fault of the previous generation more than the new generation because it is said in the society that if such a set is established, then only then the marriage will take place, why? Brother, why can't two uncertain people, who have been brought up by their families, get married? The girl you are raising is alive, the boy has also not gone up, here everyone is living life in this society, so why should you blame him for this?  sail You are taking care of her, tell both of you to join me, now we will support you a little, get married, no, she says there should be a shuttle, she also says if she won't settle, I will have to compromise, so at least settle.  If you can have true sense here, there will be no marriages, this is also a fact, the institution of marriages is also in danger because something has happened and this generation, which is the new generation of our children, after 95, it will become old.  The generation is getting confused because Sunday some of them hold on to them that this is so and these people have released something that these funds are wrong then they do it on them, ok our people are wrong, you tell me then you do this and there is a problem here.  If a person does not want to sell the hours of his life, does not want to sacrifice his life, does not want to work as a slave to someone, then what did you do if you uprooted your job for 25 to 60 years, what did you learn, are you also doing a job?  If you were learning something, then at the age of 25 or 24, you got a job in a company, you worked in an institute, you should have understood everything, how cash flow happens, what are the rules, regulations, supply chain, then you left it in 35-40 years and did something less. You could have done it, you have served for 60 years, so what can I do if you shot me, if I did not do anything to you, then what can a person do to become a teacher, if they don't trust them?  A person who holds a job at the age of 22-23 and works for 60 years is a very average person. Write this story. It's okay, doing a job is not a bad thing, no one is interested in doing a startup, there is no point in doing a job for 10 years, 15 years, 20 years.  Why, it is a wrong thing, it has to be done, it is a situation, it is a compulsion, but even in 20 years, my eyes are not open. Even in 20 years, I am not reaching a place where there is peace by doing something of your own. This generation can find peace by making something of your own. Now she is not ready to listen to you, she says, Dad, what are you doing to me, because of what you are doing, what is the reason, what Dad has done, what the previous generation has done, she is not looking happy with it, if she is 48 air old, Dad does not look happy with his job. In my married life and in my general life, the child silently followed me and started asking, no, this is a great taste of father's, this formula was very good, I will do the same for every son and daughter who is his.  Father did this, wanted to separate her from her, mother did this, what are girls these days, my mother got married at the age of 22, I was going to be born at the age of 24 and she is not happy, she was a housewife, this was this, now I have become something.  I will not do what my mother did because she is not happy, because she has figured out that there is happiness in this matter, no, now I want to move on this matter, I am going, we will discover whether there is happiness there or not.  Will butt on this lesson  So no, they do n't have the same security on this and that's the same I am not listening, you are understanding this point which I am saying, how is this happening, why why is this happening, how children, listen just because of you. Life turned out to be a bit miserable. It was not so miserable that you tell your parents to your children. Son, I too have experienced this but it is more of an attack and we used to actually enjoy it, so when we came to you, we did not even tell.  What kind of fun are there, but today we are telling on record, son, it was a lot of fun, tell me friend Sharma, why are you feeling shy? If it is and if your life was so miserable, if mother lo and you actually did not enjoy it, what do you think?  Then you have to impart the knowledge of rights to your child, not only do you not improve your life but you don't do anything for yourself, so leave him now, I will also give you the bill due to the fact that you are not such a shinde, if he knows then the parents.  If you don't understand then brother, you have to understand such people and such things who see the latest and future trends and things and understand that you have to join. For clarity, this is the channel that you want to take membership of.  For this topic, this is to take things in one direction, to take things conclusively, to choose an interesting sub-topic, to do something, to do a two-hour workshop, to do five topics in it, the wilderness conflict.  It is important to resolve on your parents, just because your parents do n't understand you, why can't you give up on them, also you have to explain, you are a fool, and what did it come when I never had childhood, I will tell on that also that I am not able to explain.  So what is this color, do you know that it is wrong, do you know that those parents are bullying you, you are not told to shout at Shiva, this is also color when n.  The child articulates well in front of the parents. The meaning of articulate is not so difficult. I was not able to remember it in Hindi. Okay, so when you talk rationally to your parents, you probably listen, periods and the parents also listen to the same when you talk rationally. So children will also listen. You are human's children, everyone has a mind, everyone has a mind, then caste will not listen to the things, whenever this is coming from ignorance and it is coming from a sense of note. Using control gives over and the child is having sex, I am controlling the penis, if I do n't agree then it will be taken out of my hands. When there will be discussions on this feeling, then discussion cannot take place. Shakti can come here like me and help in this conflict resolution.  Karte Mera M Here Criticizing the parents and criticizing the children is useless. It is useless to say to a generation that we were great, it is not. Every successive generation of human beings has proof that you should be butter.  Previous one And if it is not there, then it is okay, then the previous generation has fielded humanity, otherwise we would still be in the category of apes and monkeys. They have improved gradually over the last so many thousands of years, so don't give up on your next one. Generation and then he is running our very intelligent and intelligent Chetan Jag's bawdibuch, he has also got 1 crore subscribers, now he is fine. Now they will fool so many more people that a lot of big things have to be done to save us in the earth. The biggest thing in the earth is that the earth has considered itself a child. We have to save ourselves and you are the only ones who cannot give birth to children then children.  You will say that Earth is a child, Venus is also a child, March is also a child, Mercury is also a child, one can go there and cry, there is nothing there, those planets will keep roaming there, so many planets are roaming in the entire universe. Like our round here too  The one who is also roaming around, whether you will save yourself or not, then when you give birth to children, no one will do it, he will just raise his children and is not going to give clarity, he is going to motivate, he is going to provoke, he is going to say alum, have you read this?  Everyone is going to do I think note it is correct okay how did you like tell the video don't give up on this news generation they are the smartest one and they are so smart that to understand them you will also have to be smart if you  So no, you are a stepwell, nothing is ok, hundred percent sir, then learn it, talk to them, wish for them, they definitely need guidance and the previous generation has their wisdom and experience and knowledge of what technology they have, their courage and their survivability.  The one who is sure that even if money comes, one has to enjoy, one has to relax, one has to make oneself happy, one has to think about the streak of independence that is inside.  If there is a mix then our country and humanity will go ahead and there are 140 crore people in our country and the generation I am talking about is born after 1994, it is very much, even if you look at it in percentage, it is 35-40% instead of 50%.  If they are close then do n't take them in the majority because if you trouble them on more stages and then don't do anything then the society and the country will not know what to do.   If you have not subscribed to the channel, then subscribe yet. Do you want to take membership? What is the cream that in your 6-8 months membership, peace and money will flood in your life, whatever you have is fine, it will flood and the date is de claimed. If you  If you want to take it then you can take it. You will get to do workshops and seconds in it. There is some old recording material that you will get to see. You can try membership. Thank you very much."

    "title": "Govt Job And  Bade Shehr Ke Bache ｜ A Practical Advice [2q-GHHcxVIY].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, very simple and good topic, children of big cities and government jobs, I have not yet covered this aspect on government jobs, I have covered different aspects on this, children of big cities should not do government jobs, this is the message of it.  The reason I am telling this is because many people are coming to me for consultation. To get a government job, you need an exam. If you have a particular kind of intelligence and hard work, then anyone can crack the exam, even in small towns.  Big cities don't have that much of it, but the children of big cities are not happy. This is the message. They are not able to live in government jobs. A child from Gurgaon, who studied in schools here, cannot be happy in Fatehabad in Jind by going to Haryana Government. I am telling you that you should check the same thing in your provinces. If you come from a small town, a small town or a small village, then it is okay. Take a government job and that is the same.  If you stay in the house, you will get more respect and the nuisance is also more because the whole system works in such a way that my work gets done. My child is inside it, so you will get the feeling of being in a big house even in a big house. Now I will tell you about the few who are rich.  Are you upper middle class or middle middle class? Their children are also not happy in government jobs because they cannot directly affect their families. You are employed in Chennai and are residents of Haryana. What good will you do in any bank?  Banks have gone to PSU. I had made a video on PSU once before. Please only people from small towns should join PSU banks because there are postings at such places that all means of transport will be used for your mule to reach many banks. Means of Modes of Transport is read in first class and second class that this is the ship, below the ship is the train, below the train is the car, then there is the bus, then there is tractor, then there is tempo, then there is Vikram, then there is scooter, then there is that.  If there is a bicycle and then there is a mule, then they will go till that level and then they will be very sad and then they will not see any progress in life. Many people 's wives are not able to work because they are in government jobs because they keep roaming around.  You can easily become a DPS teacher for Rs 50,000. If you are living in a big city, you can make Rs 50,000. PRT, PGT, GJT, PJT get more money, but I am telling you about an average salary.  If you are happy then you also do your work, if you have a house in a big city, then you do not need to go anywhere and do jobs in small cities. Bypassing it is not worth it, the money is so much, it will not be fun.  You will not be able to get those things. Yes, there is security of job, but there is no security of place. Today here, tomorrow there, you will have to stay away from your wife. How many people do you know who are watching this video and are already ready in this situation? Please comment.  Write in the section so that those who are trying to enter into this situation and belong to that big city or upper middle class, do not get trapped in any kind of government job.  Those who are trapped in government jobs will not get the sense of perceived respect in the times to come. Many people feel the pain of someone whose tomorrow is theirs, I am removing this thing from them, then they will say what nonsense are you saying like this.  Don't do it, I mean, they are feeling pain because they feel that they might get influenced by my words. I can neither increase nor decrease the respect of a government employee, I am a commentator and an observer of whatever is happening in the society.  I can tell by looking at Aankhon Dekha condition, All India Radio guy Aankhon Dekha condition, Aankhon Dekha condition, this is today's day and that in the future and you will see that people who will come in to the government jobs will not get that.  Kind of social status which they have been enjoying for a very long time till now and if you happen to belong to a family with decent income and happen to stay in big city in good schools then you can get a government job from where you have studied. Your children will not benefit in this. You would like the athletes to study in the same schools where you studied. If not better, you will not get that opportunity.  The wife is not going to get the opportunity to work, you are not going to get the opportunity to grow, invest somewhere, monitor, build a house, nothing is going to happen and from here to here, posting from Etawah will happen, it will become Mirzapur and then from there.  You are going somewhere in Supaul district, somewhere in Bihar, you are going in Motihari, you did not sacrifice anything and did not keep anything, if you were from a big city or from a small one, then you are used to it, then you People from small towns are completely impressed, they know how to make nonsense, nuisance and domineering, make their own reels, show off all the charm, they will get the taste, but their taste is also going away in seven-eight years.  The fact is that even those who are coming from small towns are getting ready for 10 years in a government job. Long means they have had too much time and those who are coming from big cities are getting ready within two years.  Then what is the problem after two years, I am not getting free because this is a government job, it is like riding a tiger, you can ride it, it is fun, but I feel scared while getting down, it seems that if I get eaten, then she would be free. Not even because it is achieved with so much hard work and so much sense of achievement. The first time a government servant will ever tell his family, friends and anyone that I want to leave the job, the first reaction of the whole world is crazy, what a crazy person.  Will everyone get this reaction? Are you crazy because friend, the world is there, if you are leaving then you are leaving, I am the first one to say, don't join, you can do 10 thousand things in a big city, if your base is setup, you do n't have to rent.  There is a lot of opportunity to be given, there is a government job, please leave the jobs for those who are poor, backward section of our society, if your family has become above one level, then do not make a big deal about it, nor will people treat me like that.  Including those people who will get the opportunity. Suppose, 5000 people did not get government job because of my video and if 5000 government jobs were given to a poor family, then this poor family is not going to clap for me. I also know what nonsense he is talking, that is, because.  They want that feeling. I am not going to get that feeling. I am also telling you that until you guys see this message of the country and that game of yours comes into your hands.  It has become raw. Yours has become raw. In childhood, we used to play. Those who remember, it is sure that it is raw, they will understand what I am trying to say. When a small child used to do it, he used to feel like he had something in his hand, there was nothing in his hand.  Big people used to play, now this is the life of a government servant in government jobs, he feels that he does n't know whether he will change the country, he will do nothing, brother, he cannot change anything, a government servant cannot change the paint of his house, his office, his office chair. His pen cannot be changed  The stand is there, it cannot be changed, the printer is there, it cannot be changed, this is the reality, the change is happening at the level of the politician only, the government servant is a very servant type of person, no one will come and tell you openly, how can the government servant tell his insult?  Who will do it, no one will do it, there is no benefit for me in coming like me, but what is my job, every one or two months I feel like doing it, now Saniyal ji is advisor to PM, he has also made some such videos etc. I have been making this for a long time that do not waste time in a government job. I feel that one day, in the coming time, within a year, government servants will be told that officers of official tie-up will come like this and  They will say that ours is a rubbish job, don't worry, this is what the politician above will say so that this one who has created so much ruckus, is n't this job a government job, a high job with high reservation or a little less, by playing background music that she is getting down from the car, Tata  It is happening to them that their father is doing the same, one day he himself will come and tell you the dark truth or no, it is very tough and don't waste your time, but this is not told to him too, this is also a matter of trouble because how did he say it? Spent my entire life and then you will say that whatever we have reached here is completely meaningless. Brother, even saying that, I know that it is not easy. I understand the pain of them but then I Be people like me, independent, come and tell, that brother, you have openly told the right thing, it is ghar ka thara, which is called in the native language of Hariyani, Bhai Thara bat is the right thing, don't you understand, I am trying to address my this thing.  Core audience Haryana people, whose words are fine, brother, clap, it's not worth it, it's not worth it, they will say no, no no, what do you know, they will take bribe from me.  I am not sitting in Switzerland, I am sitting here telling you that it is not worth it. I say that the one who takes a government job in 2024 will do it till 2060. If my brother is 24 years old then he will do it till 2060. Okay, so it is worth it.  This is not the direction in which we are going. You will get stuck and will not be anywhere. Go and ask the government servants who are related to you.  You will have service for 12-14 years. Ask him, brother, are you liking it or not? If he says he is liking it, you will find five such people who can speak anywhere, five people are in government service for more than 10 years.  It should be 1 year or 2 years, then the taste comes, there is a honeymoon period, above that 10 years, if you say five then do five, you will not get three, you will not even get two, you will get one, you will get one who enjoys half.  It will go somewhere or the other, it will not be found, I am telling you this, please check and watch, like the video, share, thank you very much."

Things like this, now I teach you people very intelligent things, you participate with me, whatever age you are in life and whoever you are, be it government, some corporate, some business, some student, some educated.

All the yeses and noes, all the yeses, Acharya Prashant, who is joining? Those with intelligence, wisdom and consciousness are not joining, are those in IT or are anyone enjoying? My Acharya Prashant and I are the opposite of the  Same coin, I will explain that also today, okay, it is very interesting, let me explain, in all our actions, everyone has written yes. Okay, someone is not that, okay, everyone has written yes. Now understand carefully whatever action we take in life. Like I have to eat chickpeas tomorrow, I have to eat whole chickpeas, I should eat oily things on Saturday, don't eat it on Sunday, if my stomach is upset, if I have to eat chickpeas instead of whole chickpeas, then I have to soak the chickpeas at night because what action to take?  If I have to eat chickpeas then today the thought will come in my mind that if I have to eat chickpeas then whatever actions we do now all stop now now I have to write in agree and disagree if what ever I say if you agree type A if you disagree  Type D What Ever Action We Do I'm Not Talking of Accidents Accidents Nobody Wants Nobody Thicks Okay But What Ever Action We Want in Ours Life which we have done has been thought by us then only done Do you agree with this type A if you disagree with this type D This is the basic thing that brother, I have to do anything, if I have to give the IIT exam, then In my mind I will think, am I right or mine, I have to do a job in a corporate, I have to do a government job, I have to marry this white girl, I have to marry a black girl, I have to marry a beautiful one, I have to marry a good natured one, I have to get rich.  I have to do anything with the poor, I have to do any kind of action in life, so my thoughts are there, my thoughts are very good, okay, very nice, very nice, okay, very nice, okay, so now understand carefully, it is a great thing.  This is the abstract thing of knowledge that is coming, this is the truth of our life, the situation in which we are, this is whatever situation you are in today, brothers and sisters, listen carefully, this is yours and the situation that you are in.  Know your status according to money, according to relationships, according to job, according to knowledge, whatever can happen in human existence, your situation is this, you reached this situation because of this action, you took this action, these actions  Because of these thoughts, brothers and sisters, you came to this situation, you took these actions, because of these thoughts, because of these thoughts, these were actions, you reached here, but brothers Sisters, now I want to ask you, what are your thoughts, where did they come from, where did they come from, thoughts come from feeling emotions, first of all comes an emotion, we all know emotion, etc. There are different types of anger, fear, greed, jealousy, envy and English, English felt.  Take your greed, lust, all this is made up in English, I don't know it, you know what feeling is, that feeling is not in our control, that feeling can be manipulated. Feelingless, after that the passion ended, I am passionate about this, it was a feeling, which gave me a thought, which made me take action, which brought me to this, but this feeling itself has changed, now I am understanding something, now those who understand, link  Gaya S, write those who felt like it, write M, I will tell you more clearly, there is nothing to be shy about, not everyone is the same and if you have understood the fear then write it, many have understood it, any one has understood it MMO Jamo is not the one, there are two or three people, the rest are able to understand the maximum, now let me tell you again, I want to tell you that your feeling can be manipulated, son, it is my dream, you will become an IS, that's it.  I told you, I have got your feeling, I want to make my father proud, I want to become an ice, daughter, we have not had a son, you are our son, now you have to do it, you only have to do it, this manipulation is going on in our country.  Indians Are the Biggest Manipulators and Hippocritus' Why We Are One of the Most Unhappy People on This Earth Despair is here, mountains are here, deserts are rivers, fertile everything is here, weather is good, sun rises but still we are midges and those countries are nomadic.  Which countries speak Nordic countries Norway Finland Denmark Six months the sun does not set there In many places it means the sun does not rise Those top three In the top five, this clarity has to be achieved first in life. Yes, it is so simple, that knowledge is in your face, all of it is shown on your mouth too, but you do not understand, number one in speaking sermons is our country that you can do it to you. You should do this yourself, no one does it yourself, everyone is sharing the knowledge, so I will tell you one such thing which will make you understand something in life. If you have understood this thing that I told you now, then type yes and that now.  Even if you don't understand  No, what I have linked up is this feelingless action with action, the result is yours, so this result that you are sitting on is not you, it is someone else, understand this thing, then when you do not like this thing. You have to reach this level of feeling, that is my first class emotions, you have to understand the emotions, you have understood, everyone has understood, still he is a human being, it is okay if he does not take the name, otherwise he will feel bad, okay, there are one or two, who did not even understand this, then  I will try after that  Then let me tell you one thing that those who study from me keep teaching, you know that I humiliate, it is okay that the job of a Guru is to humiliate but not to suppress but to lift up, that feeling is one on one.  Student and Guru feel inferior. If you actually feel inferior, then you cannot study and learn from me, then I will do that work inferior because what is the point now, even after completing the hard work, if it is not there then it will be no.  Then you will have to listen to that dialogue of I will kill Jalalat, whose last attempt is still no. Now listen to what I am saying, brothers and sisters, listen carefully. Whatever you want in life, you can get it with hard work, with wisdom, with patience, with guidance. You can get whatever you want, you need a car, you need a bungalow, you need money, you need a beautiful girl, you want a rich father-in-law, you want yourself, if you want anything in life then it will be fine, but what do you want in life, you don't want it.  Can I repeat again, you can get whatever you want in life, you can get it, but what you want in life, you can't want it, I want what I want wherever I am born, what will come, you can't want it, now whose understanding is it  If I have understood then write yes and if you still do n't understand then write no and whoever enjoyed it and became PP then write PP. Brother, this is a very big thing, I don't want to waste this knowledge by writing it in books. money  I will teach you in the course, not me, publish the book and I want the knowledge to be yours and then because I have written the book, the knowledge will be in my name, the plague will stop, if you cannot earn your living, then I will tell you just like this. Give me money and sell that knowledge in your own words. Who said that my Sandeep Maheshwari is selling me? All the big names, etc., who have made all these things are cheap, they don't even give me credit nor would they have given money, so I say that I am a common man.  Don't make me this much  Wise man, did you understand it at the right time or is there still a no because right now there is no no, write a no because even if you want to insult me, it will give me a stomach ache, hit me with dialogues, just say it now, manipulate if you want. That desire is there, it is feeling, it is emotion, one thing, tell me, one thing is no, yes, now five or six people have said it, you still don't understand, so brothers and sisters, those who still haven't understood, then listen, I can explain it to you. Can't understand it for you You understand I can explain things to you I can't understand You have to see because those who did not understand what I said do not have to take this course, still I will talk for 10 more minutes Okay okay what to cover  If I have to tell you then this is a prelude, so see friend, many people have given it, many have given it, but brother, those who are not able to understand, you have not even understood those things, if you are understanding then don't waste. Do it because I can explain to you, I cannot understand, it is okay for you because now the Indian education system is such that those deep things like higher order thinking are not told, higher order thinking is nothing, whatever I am talking about, I am mostly you all first.  We do fear thinking, we do it for a few seconds, I take people to the fourth order, I myself try to order it, how is the brain's curd in this, understand what is an order, whatever is happening, it has an effect.  Would  This is the first fear thinking. This is the first order thinking. This is the first order thinking that if we slow down the pitch of Ahmedabad, we will win. We will spin. This is the first order thinking. This is the second order thinking that if we slow down the pitch then we will win.  The fast bowlers were doing well and if our toss is not under our control then what will happen then it came to light that Kamas won the toss and put us into bat but in last 2011 Saghkara won the toss.  Had he taken the batting, dew had come at Wankhede, the World Cup had been won, Dhoni had rotated it to 275 runs, this time too it would be like this but it did not happen this time because this time he was in command, he had the idea of ​​what was happening.  What misbehavior would it be? How would they have batted first in the entire World Cup? They always did it because of high pressure matches. It is better to bat first, put runs, score and then but then they did. Very smart enough, so if in that situation the people who got scared first, they always died, this is the effect of the effect of the effect of this third order effect of this effect of this effect of this effect is the fourth order because whatever is happening due to that happening.  That which is happening is above that, whatever is happening is above that, so those people who are manipulators, are luminati, when they have to effect this thing then they do this first and then by doing this, this happens.  from this  By doing this, this happens and by doing this, this happens. They wanted this. Most of the people who will be public are crazy booze. Mostly the poor girl sees this because of this, she is never able to link up here or link up.  There are many analysts Guruji who don't know what is needed, so much so that the person gets tired. Those who open these shell companies in foreign countries and do transactions, they do layer upon layer upon layer upon layer of the company.  No matter how much your mind goes to investigate everyone, he gave money to this person, he gave it to him, but he gave it to her, he gave it to her, but his shares were swapped there, it became his, you know that something wrong has happened, you know that someone got it done.  Yes, but its trail becomes a nurse of the mind, but because of the agency, there are countries, there are people with brains like ours and they enter inside it, someone like me or someone from whom someone like me has learned, they will find out that son.  On this onion  It's like you have to go through a lot of things and in the end you don't get much of anything that what happened, so when you have to learn things at this level, because this is happening to you, this happened to your father and mother, no one is doing that to you without knowing it.  I am not doing it but it is happening and people are in a dilemma and are not able to come out of this dilemma. How many people are understanding what I am explaining till now? These are the type of yes, those who got no five or six times, go. can because  Then they are wasting time, if you are not able to understand then it is not necessary because I can keep explaining, I can't understand. Those who have the habit of watching presentation through slides, it is the formula generation of watching formulas, most of the people give formula, shares of something.  If you talk about it, then you will directly ask that friend, tell me only Sher which one to take. If you talk about teaching astrology, then you will say, read my chart, it is okay, read mine, it is okay and anyone else.  Do something, those who have made so much of their life, the person who wants to become a consultant, who wants to earn money, this is the course on how to do that, I will explain further, okay, I will explain further, so this course will consist about I have caught the base of emotions.  Let us first understand them, after that we will understand how job and marriage are linked. Investments are linked. If your marriage is wonderful, you cannot invest even if you are earning money.  Your Marriage is Possible Your Marriage Will Safar Your Marriage Will Safar Job is not going to do well Investment will Safar All ten three things are linked but the problem is coming from emotions and feeling Wife Batmeez Jaaye To Kaise Jeena Hai Wife does not live with parents  How to live, parents are struggling, so how to live, I had just discussed a lot in consultation. Now I just want to know, whoever is listening to me now, whoever is listening to me and she is female then type F and if the male is listening then his female is sitting next to him, she is also F, all of you type F if you  Women are listening to me, any one can type F, the number of women is listening and the woman next to them, do that, the number of women is listening to me, the email is listening to me, I want to tell you everything, a lot of women are listening, and a lot of women. he is bigger and  Only women will answer this question, only women will answer this question, it is okay, if a man will not be able to do it, it is okay for women only, all the females can answer, yes or even mails can do it, okay everyone can answer, this is a big dialogue, isn't it marriage? After this, the girl leaves her house, a big debt, the situation is told by telling the situation yes and no, in North India the society is mostly even in South India, if yes and no type is yes and no then you write. No, no one has written this yet, man, if the girl leaves her home, then the situation is created to give the girl's elder sister to him. Is it weak sex or is it victimization or if the girl leaves her home and comes back, then something like  Oh my God, she is the property of the society, is n't there a place like Sunita Balhara and the world is in front of me, okay, I don't know yet, it might be happening in many places that they don't go to the boy's house, they go to the girl's house the other way, this is the saying.  Isn't it true that when a girl is going to bid farewell, everyone is crying, whether it is false or happy tears or sad tears, I do n't know whether it is okay but tears are definitely coming out, it is written in it on everyone's weddings, okay?  Ok but tell me one thing now if you agree with this then even females will also answer every buddy. Look at everything that happens at 90.  The truth becomes the absolute truth of life, there is nothing, every buddy lives but what ever I am not saying is the truth, then it will give happiness, okay and this absolute truth does not happen by doing anything, but 90 but 95 wrote yes, now Joe  I am the one who speaks, listen to him or her who agrees or disagrees. I tell many women who feel this way that there is a lot of healing in consultation and Awareness also spread, I say madam, it is absolutely right, after marriage, the girl's house is left behind, but madam, if the boy's house is changed, then yours has left only the house, but the boy's house is the same.  Only the people change, this is the true state, if you agree then write A in the statement or if you disagree, then no no, those mom and dad remain the same, they live in the house, no, there is no change, what nonsense are you talking about?  Whether you are agreeing or agreeing, now everyone has started agreeing, now at least one half should disagree, one Annu Dalal did not agree madam, parents change, mother-in-law becomes mother, you become the husband of that woman for many mothers. Who are you? The mother-in-law is speaking. You get separated. The father also gets separated. You are treated like a separate entity. This is really a pain for all the men. Females will not let up.  Females are already there, I am feeling that you are happy, it is okay in disagree, one half is speaking disagree, the rest are speaking agreeable at 90, and the one whose parents are not changing, the one who is not feeling that his parents are not changing, his mid-mable life. Well, I don't know. Not many of you are married. Even the men were young. The worst condition is that of men. Women are given training. How to set up mother-in-law before marriage.  Mother teaches us to do this and the girls themselves are also smart. Boys have no syllabus. The boy's mother says, Son, what should I teach you? I will set this and then she fails. I am talking of 2023. She feels that my mother-in-law has  If you had set it for me, then it will come, should I also set it? What to teach the boy? The boy is not being taught anything, yet people are teaching it to girls. Something goes wrong in a girl's life after marriage.  There are 50 people to cry. You can cry in front of the police, you can cry in front of social media, you can cry in front of friends, you can cry in front of your mother, you can cry in front of your sister, you can cry in front of your brother, you can cry in front of your mother-in-law, you can cry in front of your father-in-law, you can cry in front of your neighbor.  And something miraculous is going on in the boy's life, in the marriage and he has to cry, if he has to go somewhere, then he cannot cry in front of anyone because as soon as he cries, everyone will smile like this, there must be something missing, why are you crying madam, this is the truth of life. man more  Men are committing suicide, women are going through more trauma, women are also suffering pain, I am not taking any side, they are idiots, they are females, they are editing mails, they are people, they are not touching each other, there is no harm but what I am trying to do is this syllabus.  I will tell you that these are the parts of the happiness course to resolve, 'The same thing is the job', now I will add a touch of narcissism to all these things. Husband collides with a narcissist. Mother-in-law collides with a narcissist herself. What are the traits of a narcissist? It comes to light after 20-30 years. Oh, my husband was a narcissist or my parents were also narcissists. I will tell you what would be a good example of a narcissist. And now you tell me what is this trait.  How many of you have felt that I will not tell anyone's name, I will not tell anyone's name, it may be you, it may be your wife, it may be you. Your mother may have been your father. Just visualize the scenario of narcissist parent. There is a function happening. It may be a wedding or a birthday party or it is a public function where you are invited. You are a child. Remember your childhood but childhood trauma is taken care of emotional trauma all.  There will be some healing in this, whether you are a child of six, seven or 10 years, whatever age you are, you are crying. Whatever bad may have happened, the child has a million reasons for crying, he got hurt, he got hit by some child, he fell from the bicycle, he had a food plate, visualize any reason, the child is crying, the mother comes and the father comes and so on.  What ever the parent comes, the parent says be quiet, everyone is watching and listening, why is he doing? The focus of the parent is more on that he is loving me, he is crying, why is he crying rather?  Then actually knowing that friend, what is the meaning of this? Have you encountered this in your life? If you have identified, husband- wife fight can also happen. The husband or the wife has given a lot of trauma to the husband and the husband shouted something else and the husband is getting a little angry. But it is public and the wife is getting this effect more or the husband is getting this effect more that people are watching Let Me Tell You, there are narcissistic people in India.  The percentage is very high. Most of you listening also has a scale from one to 10 and 10 is like ultra narcissist cannot be consoled, repaid and help most of us. I would say okay why would I rate myself from five to six, so many people.  Sitting is a degree, nothing is absolute, one means a very confused person, an alien person who is not even me, and it means too much, there is a gun case, many people are sitting on six or seven, it is okay to see this. Soham Katheria ji, I did not ask about false. I asked respect or identify the situation. Don't identify this situation, it cannot be false or understand it from something like that you got a stone on your foot and you did not feel pain. A man does not feel pain, that means it is not like that. And those who are associated with me, those who understand my things and can answer questions with me and understand that you should not put them in the buffalo, you are in the buffalo with the Guru. Reach somewhere after a while. No, don't add buffalo. It will be a dialogue only. There is something that is true and false. It is asked, it is true and false, it is a thing of true and false, it is a thing like this, it is a phenomenon. You have seen it.  So you identify it as black sun event, they all say that white sun is white, it is white, unless someone has seen black, then brother, there is no black in it, you must have read it, you have read the book Black Sun Event.  Okay, character of a narcissist. Yes, I am not going to tell you that I have a class. I said, five classes, six classes, okay, so now I will do a little more quickly. I, you guys, are not connected with anyone in my thoughts forward, which is still there and some more.  It's a matter of five minutes, 10 minutes, whatever interests you, A2, do it for me now, I will take a water break for a minute, I will drink water, and speaking for about 35 minutes, I will drink water in 30 seconds.  Please, you guys I will drink water, you guys don't write this A2 please do it I won't know anything by typing it then I will give you the link of the poster and you can do the payment and join the course text T A2 They do SHS, okay, okay, many people are doing it here, you can clearly move ahead, what will happen next, many people have written here only, they will not get anything, you will have to do it only by me, what do you mean by this, minimize.  by doing or by doing  You will have to go out, you will have to go to your place and you will have to do A2, I am okay, let's move ahead, how many of you are facing some situation in the job, it means not one half, generally, okay, today I ask you one thing, okay big, I am not sharing the screen right now.  I will do it but you guys will tell me today is 8:1 am now, in the last 12 13 14 hours i.e. from morning till now my claim is that the number of people you are listening to is 365 people.  My claim is on everyone, everyone has something or the other, some hot talk, quarrel, disagreement, irritation, something must have happened. If this statement is true then write T and if it is false then write F. Before writing, think for a second the whole day.  Any clash, from parking to boss to wife to house to maid, has happened with everyone, so the type tree is fine, the one with falls, I can tell you how much is there, there has been a lot of frustration, that's why.  Have you done the timing today? I am also Guruji, I am an astrologer, okay, one is Ayush Pacholi, only one is right who is saying no, one is Anshul who is saying no, the rest one is Sharma, one is Namyachi, the rest are writing true and all the others are false.  You are writing that maybe someone may have got frustrated with them. You are understanding. They are the people who will not accept it. It is okay if you feel frustrated today then someone must have done it. Now let me ask the person who did it.  I, that is good for me, it is fine, so brother, you must have done it, today is Dwadashi, the date is Dwadashi, there is energy on the day of Dwadashi, I am telling you, okay, so yes, I will teach everything in Happiness, I will not teach astrology, it is not astrology, it is about astrology.  There are different classes, okay, when it came to happiness, when I told you, it turned out to be true at 90, it was 995 today, that's why look, it's your timing, is n't it yours today?  Feeling frustrated, stick happiness in the evening. If you put water in front of a person who is thirsty, he will definitely be sold. I will also teach you marketing and sales. By now you all must have realized that first tell me if my sales and marketing is good then type G.  If it is average then A is not perfect then it is not giving you the choice. If you like average then it is A and if you like good then it should be normal. Okay and I teach this and also give consultation on this. I also give consultation to people on this, people have to do timing with the day and what happens in you are an astrologer, it helps you really know the emotions you really know, okay, okay, so no one said average, in this one.  I have 100, someone has also written excellent, very good athlete, so you have to release that I will teach you this also Baba, there are people like I was. Discussing something, I am not getting irritated with my love Mukesh Ambani, I have opened five six channels, people are getting irritated, hey, you earn money, you do this, you sell courses, hey, you also learn, but come, get robbed or learn.  If you loot a mine in this country, then which one is 25 Hajj and the same amount, I have 15000 people in it, 25 30 50 60 and they are also good, I do not say anything bad about anyone. Not for anyone, I don't say that even a course of Rs 2 lakh is bad, it will be fine for someone, I too, but I say that mine is gold, mine is a bagger, it is a bagger, it depends on you, so we don't get a job.  We will also discuss in this course: From emotions to jobs to marriage and after marriage to investment and women, you have to attend to the woman in your life, your husband. Both husband and wife need to.  Attendees who are going to get married, who is unmarried, type U, who is married, type M so that I can get a little idea, unmarried, type U, ok, married, do M, if M sounds more, M is more, so brother, wife.  Yours will come and the unmarried one is unmarried, brother, it is okay to join with one of your parents, otherwise it is okay to live alone and the unmarried will benefit the most. I am going to say whether you yes or no.  It is okay to tell me that I am married, I am feeling okay at 60, 65 and 35. The one who is at 35 is unmarried, but the unmarried will also get a lot of benefit, only the married will be able to reply, the unmarried will not be able to. You can tell me the number of people who are married.  Here, answer those questions which have happened, which was your wedding function, which is called wedding, not marriage, it starts after the wedding, which wedding took place.  Your function was held, that is, the function of your marriage, the person you were married to, the discussion about that function continued for one, two or three years after the marriage. In how many people's life is this happening and in how many is it happening right now? So, there was no discussion between Veri ID and Jinke as to what was given or taken, whether there was respect, what food was there, whether the cheese was bad, was it okay, who gave the money for the mare, there was no conversation about the garland, so many things were resolved.  If it has happened, then tell me, nothing happened to us, Guruji, and you people are writing all the IDs, you are writing very IDs, one is saying that we are talking after 25-30 years, so yes, this is what I have to teach you, this is what I will tell you, it will be fun. So that this does not happen and now I will tell you how to close it, I will also tell many parents, many people are getting the idea, it is good and I am all taking this because I want to.  No no, my topics, the people who have invested money on me without even asking me, what am I going to do, so at least look at this, my topics are popular, so for you guys, this is not a free session for me ever in life.  No one is free, I do not do any work for free, even in this one, I am using you guys so that brother, I am getting to know that my topic is right, my words are right, my observation is correct, now one more thing.  let's do one more thing How many parents here? You too can be that parent or your parents, depending on the judge, make you feel guilty in life that brother, we have done so much, made so many sacrifices, done so much and they just keep telling us how many types of parents there are.  Yes, how many types are there? Yes, let's do a little, tell us to do more, what to do every day, brothers and sisters, do you want to get rid of this life, do you want to join tomorrow's happiness like this, curse the night by doing like this  Long ago, I have not watched TV for many years, but once upon a time, this Zee TV, this TV, used to come on at 11 o'clock, I had pain in my knees, then I went like this, I was so fat, then I got this, then I became thin.  It is done and this is a belt worth this much, but today it is available for this much, but if you buy it now, then how many have seen that D, Type S, who have seen that D, Type AD, have you ever seen that D that comes at night in your life?  oily knee pain  My hair has fallen out, I had become bald, then I got this and then I had this, then I became fat and suddenly I got this. Englishmen used to come, used to say something from behind. There were products, don't they come these days? Do they come to me?  It seems that I am the same but he used to feel very good after listening to me. Okay, and one by one I will tell one more person who was the strongest in marketing and on whom I always used to buy something and always I  I used to get whipped at home. Okay go.  I used to be made fun of in my house, it has been many years, I mean many years ago, it is thousands of years ago, when I used to travel by bus, okay and being young, I was even younger, just think about it.  It was quite short, okay, it was more time than childhood, it was less than youth, okay, there were only a few years in between, I think it was only a period of three to four years when I used to travel by bus to go anywhere, so at that time  No person ever boarded the bus at the stop  He used to come like this, come say hello like this, he used to have a comb, he had a pen, there were four colors in the pen, then he used to say, there was a medicine for knee pain, then he used to say something like this and this is like this It used to be colorful with five-seven things and I used to try it like this and he used to say by doing this much like this and I just give this to me too, how much are these and if you buy these four, then it is not worth 100, not 50, not so much. And me  I would always go after shopping and then every time my family members would ask me what did I buy today, tell me okay, I don't know what pill you have taken, it will become like this and I used to go like I don't know, immediately someone will give it to someone else to see for you.  I brought this for your knee pain, is there any oil with dirty bass, has anyone ever opened it and thrown it all nonsense and it is such that I am repeated, I use to get fooled and I don't know what every time I sit in the bus, the product is also different.  I used to meet their butts then I learned from them that they give me. No one bought it. I used to see that everyone is eating their corn, some are drinking their water, some are drinking juice, some are looking here and there.  Looking on the other side, one was listening, everyone was taking interest, everyone was listening, I was buying, okay, I have bought a lot, then I don't know what I have learned, I have learned something from it, the work is going well for me, it is okay, I have learned one thing.  Always you know instead of because I was food and why I was fed because I never required that thing but those things were sold to me and things that I never required but he was shown that man this is a very good thing so  I Learned an Anti-Thesis to It You Never Sell Things to People Who Don't Require It's Like They Say in the Market  Why would selling a comb to a bald person disgust him? Once you tell him to make you itch, if you can't release the itch with a comb, it can be done with a stick or even with a pen. Giving will disgust you, so never tell him to sell anything to you.  Anybody who does not have a requirement in his life, so when I come genuinely, I bring those things and only then the thing hits which people genuinely identify, see this.  Without me, people conduct many of their own workshops. You must have seen many courses and webinars. They get engrossed in the conversation. None of you are speaking. Only I am speaking. The voice is quiet but everyone is enjoying. I am getting feedback.  And I made codes and my job is to enjoy, to do more, to do more ID, and in Yes Agri, yes Agri, but on Pa 10, there will always be those who will not enjoy, those who will not do Agri, you have to learn all these things, I have some things.  I will directly teach you some things, learn ternate, my last class will be food for the soul, that's what we are here, if someone is doing something, accept it, then what kind of food are you giving to the body, then we keep giving it the opposite.  But what should we make him consume? So I will talk about food, I will also talk about things. This will be the last class. Investment will be discussed very strongly because everyone wants money. Do people have no idea about investments?  The same five things in life: Real Estate, Stock Market, Mutual Funds, Gold, Bund, Physical, if you go somewhere sexier, then Crypto Currency or your Bitcoin, if you go to too much of something, Antique Furniture, Paintings, if someone else goes, then deal in 6 or 68 things.  I have a lot, but I am going to tell you the code behind it. I will reveal the investment and the code to you that brother, listen, mutual fund has an expense ratio of one and a half per 35 years.  You invested, if it was to become one crore rupees, then you will be given 30, 35, 40 lakh commission. Do you know anyone? Only then buy ETF from mutual fund, my friends, not of gold, sorry, not of gold, normal which comes in Nifty 50 and Nifty 100.  It's nifty, what did I tell you, it is not for free, I am taking something from you people, I am taking something, so I am giving, this is what I am giving today itself.  I am giving it now so that I know that not everyone will take the course but if they give 50 minutes of their life with me then I will not let it go waste. Guruji Bhai, if you come, you will definitely take Prasad, brother, the day your Sensex is in Nifty Red.  On that day, hold one of your ETFs, whether you want to hold Nifty 50 or whatever index you want to hold, Nifty 100, Nifty 150, midcap or whatever.  You invest in it, if you have Rs. 0000 per month to invest, then brothers and sisters, how many trading days are there in a month? Approximate so that I feel that there are some stock market people too, somewhere it turns out that all are mother-in-laws because I am  I am going to give all the details here, some are saying 22 days, some are saying 21, let's take 20 days friend, Holi Diwali, after taking all this out, 20 days is ok, now you will get it in 20 days.  If you want to invest, then in 20 days the market will be up and down also, that is, they say green, they say red, it can be red for five days, it can be red for 10 days, it can be green for 10 days, it can be red for two days.  If the stock is to be put on the same day it is red then it is 500 then if you have to put it for 20 days then the average will be of one day. If your average is Rs 00 then if the market is red on the first day then put two and a half on the second and third day.  If it was green on the first day then you did not put it then Rs 7500 on the fourth day if it was red because it was not put for two days then you invest in this way for 10-20 years. My Trident test technique has terrible returns. I do not have the habit of showing the results as it is Excel.  Just show me how much I can't beat, then what is it then, that is, it has become a show off, anyone can do such tricks, okay, these techniques are the cheapest because in exchange traded funds, 01  There is an expense of 2% which is charged and the rest is not your holding charge because if you have taken shares in de mat then no one is holding it, he charges Rs 400,500,600 for maintenance and whatever happens just in the mutual fund. If you put one crore rupees, he will take one lakh and a half lakh rupees. Now brother, that guy is also buying from the same 300, 400, 500 companies.  And how many active mutual funds have outperformed ETFs over 10 years? If you tell the market, if you have done so, then keep taking them out again and again, keep showing the performance in two-three years. How much has done so much, no one does this much.  If you see the investment of 40 years, you will be beaten fiercely, but no one will tell you even this small thing. Kolappa Tata, is it Rahul Gandhi's right, Tata, bye bye, it's just someone's listening, this is all the channel is. Finally, now I am going to open an investment channel as well, if you guys bless me, okay, I am going to open a finance channel. How many of you want me to open a finance channel? Type F or tell me friend, that's enough, don't listen, okay?  Type too much, otherwise, whatever I tell, no one will tell, brother, and I don't tell anyone like this, I never speak even though I am speaking on recording, I am not a moral science teacher, I am not a social great man, I don't want to. You  Respect me morally, I want you to respect my intelligence and wisdom, I don't want to respect these useless high morals, I am a person of low morals, I am not forced to go into morality, this is why I will open your notes in the happiness course.  How to ask for money and ask for it as per your right and whoever asks gets it, if he gets it as per his wish, then I will open a channel, it will be the best channel, there will be less subscribers. Not everyone understood and not everyone understood, if I tell you just this much, then what happened in the whole time, let me tell you about the emotions throughout the time. Emotions are very important for investment. Those whose emotions are somewhat under control, a few are under control.  So don't you get some control, tell me that money, otherwise these candle stick patterns, all these terms you use, all this nonsense, how do future option people make this, I am op  I will tell you on the channel how to make Morak by putting it on groups, okay so now brothers and sisters, how many of you are interested in joining this happiness course starts tomorrow so type here and also so that I can get slots because I have a lot of slots.  It is not creating any FOMO at all, this is the only mercury left, there is not much left, it is in hundreds now but it is possible that it will be filled by tomorrow, this is also possible because this recording is also being released.  I don't know if it will be released somewhere, there are a lot of fans, okay, you are listening live, so whoever joins H2, here I am getting it written for myself, otherwise at 7 PM tomorrow, after that we will decide the time.  I will make sure that it is okay for you to make it and it is okay, the class duration will be of two hours, see friend, it will be of two hours, if it becomes two and a half, then I don't know, recording will be available on your life time only, get it done. Recording, making your content, making it on your page, making your content, consultation, I will teach you that too, I will teach you that too, because what people say, will increase confidence, will teach you communication skills, oh brother, I will do that, can you teach me how to cook, you train all the waiters.  If there are waiters then anyone can come. Food is prepared in the kitchen. If it is good then people will stand in line and take it. Content is the king. Do n't know what to say, you will get confidence. What confidence will you get if you send a child on the stage to speak? Friend, it means there should be content, there should be content, then even if you bring the truth, people will still listen. Even if you are dumb, people will listen. Even if you are not sexy, people will listen if they are getting benefited. Market is not content, people are teaching everything superficially, it has no meaning. Communication should be done like this. You should look in the eyes and then you should talk like this.  Here you should listen to people, I don't listen so I don't let anyone speak, I have been speaking for an hour, 335 people are listening, so isn't communication happening? I am also selling goods, I am also communicating, you also listen.  What could be better than this, luck and should listen to anybody, this fool is made so that you keep listening and you keep buying goods and you should never put your mind to this side. No one trains you to come, you are trained to always remain the same, you remain the same, tell me, here we are, you have to be a good liner, I should be a good liner, he is quarreling with me, not showing patience, do anything.  Remove it immediately friend, do n't even talk to him, say that you have got only one life for patience, only time is short, those who tolerate nuisance do not have patience, I will teach you the most about who lives the most under stress. If there is a dish of stress in life then let me tell you an interesting thing. Stress which is there, do n't you understand, is a vegetable, a disease which is caused by stress, any disease, now that disease has to happen in life, it has to happen due to stress, but who is more susceptible?  Like you must have seen earlier when that food or any dish is prepared, you must have seen it on TV on YouTube, you are listening at the age of 2, you are listening at the age of 30, you are listening at the age of 35, the disease has not come yet, but when will it come?  45 50 55 60 But first I will tell you that brother, you have bay leaves and cheese and this dish of yours is going to be cooked, so you have to throw those ingredients. How many of you are people pleasers from your life. People Pleaser Type PP is the short form of Power Punch but here if it is People Pleaser then type it or you have a wife who is under stress or someone of yours, brother, how many people have you gone like this?  Those who are judgmental themselves and the most judgmental fear is that someone is judging them. Now it's like I am judgmental at all, otherwise I do n't care who is judging me. Even today, I am on record as if I am judgmental.  Was working with my brother and some buddy said, this is his father, he was as old as my brother and half a year younger to touch his hair, black hair is fine, all my hair is white, so anyone would have made me a father on the basis of hair, but I  Still, black people don't do it, okay, so how many of you can be like this, I have gone to hell, I have to earn the money of white people too, if someone thinks I am old, then what if my wife knows how much I am, I have to earn money from some other woman. People troll people despite having white hair. Some insult people with black hair. No one will listen to them. So it is their virtue. They eat their bread. How many people are there who can strengthen theirs like this? your sleep  Cald weekens market, so they will not say to call it a skin skin, it will be that you will go ahead, you will go away, all these things are left, you are the time you finish this course I am, I am very much in your life  You will come to know why Raita is spread in your life, you will start seeing patterns in life and will say, oh no one told this before, when you get all the knowledge then it will take two to four months to digest all the knowledge you have.  then you  If you want to truly imbibe that knowledge, then you will have to teach. You will have to teach in your schools, colleges, Lions Club, your community center, you can start it by going anywhere for free, like if you go to Connaught Place today, what if?  What is the English language of the boys who dance toes? Suddenly late. Some word for it. Common word for it. Fighting it. What is that called? Suddenly, everyone comes. Give some money anyway. The policeman comes.  What is you doing, what are you doing, what you are doing, it is not a flash, it is not a flash No, there is no flash dance, there is no flash mob, that happens in US, that is not even a skit, no, don't wait a word, I know the word, what is that, not even an eeprom, not even a freestyle, no, no, some buddy, what do they say?  They say something to him, he dances like this, he does something, busking, yes who's got it right, Lasky learner, friend, Lasky learner, you come, man, you know busking, what's called busking, what is busking, okay, so so, this is your busking or  You learn it you just and you start some day you take a topic of SaaS some day you take marriage some day you take investment  Something in this investment, you don't have to be very technical about it, you should know the basic thing, till date no one has become rich by investing, tell me the name of anyone in the world who became rich by investing, the first thing people write about is buff, hey brother.  His time is Hathway, it is an insurance company, he gets constant cash, then he invests it, due to this his share price has increased, due to this his value has increased, he did not earn the money by going anywhere.  You understand what I am saying, but Buffett, I myself have cut it off. Now tell me the name of someone else. Oh Rakesh, Late Rakesh, he used to do trading, brother, he did the most trading and earned money through physical activity trading. He invested a lot in him.  I bought shares of Titan, if I bought them, then no one became rich since yesterday. Something is happening, this is the biggest misconception. Now I will open your notes like this in investment, you are 5 rich, rich 50. You will have to follow the cash. You become rich when your savings are earning 90 95 and your expenditure is 5 10. Then only you are able to keep away from the market for 10 20 30 years. I bought a car and now I am traveling around the country.  When he came, gave birth to a child and got married, he got settled, became rich and humble, this is a basic thing, a very basic thing, but this is very basic. Even the basic things, no one understands or explains, everyone is busy in stories, you put this much money here, put there, don't buy house there, do this, do that, then this will happen, that will happen, and you many people, the world becomes very happy after hearing that.  One does not become rich, one becomes rich by working and earning money, Shahrukh Khan is 6200, 50 crores, he became a judge by investment, no, it is by investment, from the movie which he  Earnings were done in it, savings were done at 95,98 from it, he bought shares, bought a house, bought Mannat, made his own Red Chillies, put a fix in Red Chillies, then produced a picture, did this, did that, then bought shares, bought stocks, put it in his company, put it in stocks, he put it in equity.  Entered into startup and don't know how to run a business. Bye Bye Active Earning Nobody Talks About Active Earning So This Course  When I will tell you and my aim is you do active earning to two consultation a day earn 000 put that in mutual fund not mutual etf is ok and then keep putting keep putting keep putting and then see magic happen how many of you agree with  This basic basic investment theory which I told you please type A or you think no no yes  Will we become rich by investing? And how was it told like this? Friend, I don't know if anyone has become rich by investing. If you know the name, whoever disagrees, please tell me the name of that person. He must be that kind of person and will be rich, because as they say, one buffet comes out.  Buffet, I have told about Shahrukh, I have told that some goods will have to come from somewhere, Ankur Wari is saying, Hey brother sends courses to Ankur Wari, now I should start telling about my courses, his kind are such that they are not made by investment.  He is not my father, he is getting regular income, A Shrivastava's income is coming, Ankur's income is coming, he is not speaking the words on his own, the nest also tells me, I don't even have expenses on two, now you earn, if your expenditure is two lakhs, then your income is one crore.  If yes, then you will definitely become rich, because you did not tease him, the rest is fine, yes, now Ramdev Ag People, no Ramdev Agwal, La Broke Money and T Money, I have been invested sot money.  I have been so much invested in Ro Moto Cop and its four shares are yours Vijay and KD Same thing there every buddy does something to know and then that thing keeps going up there is an activity happening understand that the rest of you  What has to be understood further is whether or not that maximum wealth is invested. Hey brother, that was his capital. If you invest Rs. 000.  You are there per month and it also gives 25% return and I am investing one crore per month and I am making an FD of Rs. 6 but you cannot invest it in mine. Your 000 is mine and it is one crore. This is the amount which is invested.  Important people, you will always be told that by putting in lethargy to withdraw small money, this will happen to you, that will not happen because your demand will come to spend. Because if you have an income of Rs. 0000 and you are saving Rs. 25000 out of it, the rest of your expenses are Rs. 25000. If you are saving again and again and you will get married, then the piggy bank will break. If you don't get married, then you will have a child, then the piggy bank will break. If you buy a house, then it will break.  When you buy that car, it will break down. If you go out for a walk, it will not break. If it breaks, it will never be repaired. How?  Can you live a life with 60 50000 of salary where in you have been put in 25 and you say I will not touch this 25 then where will you get married, where will you pay the school fees, where will those big expenses come from, that regular income.  If you come from India then your regular income will be Rs 2 lakh. Do you know what inflation is like in India? People with lakhs and no income are not able to invest and become rich, it's just a matter of survival, that's all you put in, it's a car. How many of you agree with this, it's like type A. How many of you disagree with it, it's like type A. D Quickly, brother, we have to increase the money, only then I say that if someone's wife is earning Rs 35,000 as a teacher and she does not have to pay tax. 35 4 50 Tax is not levied even a single rupee and she is earning tuition and she is also doing consultation and is earning up to 70 8 9 Haj. Tax is not to be paid even up to 9 Haj. That's what is saved. It's okay to invest by cutting back.  By doing that, brother, that money will make you rich, if you don't tease it, it will make it, so the focus should be on increasing the income. People are not focused on increasing the income. Okay, all of you.  Agree no one disagrees so ok at this we will close it now so quickly as many of you as we can stop the recording h2 you can now whatsapp2 15"

    "content": "Hello friends, if you are below 40 years of age, it is 3839, whatever your age is, it is more than 30, okay, it is more than 30 and less than 40, you are basically watching this video in your 30, me and you in your life.  I am middle class, not rich, not poor, okay, this is a very complicated definition, but I belong to this class, what do you think, okay, so I take decisions in consultation.  I am going to help in the making of this car, I am in a foreign country, what should I do, how should I do it, is it okay, this is my salary, this salary has nothing to do with me, I am going to give you a figure today.  I am for the decision making of the network and write to you. If you are in your 30s and your network is not Rs 8500000 then do not buy any fancy car and do not go on any foreign country trips. Jain no one has anything to do with life, I have gone to the network, what is the network, all your assets are yours, I am not throwing other cash, it is not about others, my net assets are yours. Net liability should be close to 85 which is equivalent to ₹ 1 lakh. I could have said crore but it will also be crore. If the dollar becomes ₹ 100, then this thing is fine.  Remember, you should have only 85 lakhs, it can be your fixed deposits, it can be shares in demat, it can be mutual funds, it can be gold, it can be any property other than living in your own house, is there any affordable housing for your 25 lakhs?  Ki or something small and there is some plot of saugaj which is worth 30 lakhs, if there is no loan on it, if the story is a loan then mine it if the property is worth 1.5 crores.  If there is a loan of Rs 1 crore, then the network is withdrawing Rs 50 lakh from there, then II Network, I am sir, I know the test of audience is ok, then brother, it should be of Rs 85 lakh, it is more than Rs 85 lakh, give this, everyone should do aspirational living.  Buy your car, whatever you have to do, do it further. It's okay, many people are doing it for less than that, if you are doing it then it means you are spending more or your salary is not there. If you are 38-39 years old. And you have not reached 85 lakhs, it is okay for me to tell everyone who is watching my video, that means you are not earning money from your job, you are spending more, it is just a simple thing, so you need increase and income.  And reduce your expense date you decide a bank mark I am giving an average in India I am telling otherwise no one is going to tell and understand like we say no brother is a 6 feet boy or a human being, a man and his  If his age is 30 years, then brother, his weight is ideal weight, it can be more than 80 kg, it can also be less, then brother, if he is 80, then that means if he is 10% fatter than this, then he has become overweight or if it is this much percentage, then  That has become the base, every definition remains its okay, if it is important then take reasonable mother, okay, although 72K will be in the blacksmith side, if it is 6 feet, but if it is 80, then Ideal is your blue pressure. Blue pressure is also said to be 80 by 120, so it is necessary that it happens to everyone, it goes up and down with age, so its tolerance is a matter, 130/85 is also fine, but it is in that range.  Cut off A also goes to 90, meaning more than 90, if the lower one is 90, the upper one is 140, then you are going towards hi blue pressure. In this way, I have given a figure to my audience today.  Give brother, you are 40, if you are 32 and are sitting at 85 and doing ok, this is the wicket to take off, then brother, you are at 85 crores, which is at 8500 crores, which is his street, but someone tell yourself that brother, you are an average student. Above is average, topper is incompetent, as they say, brother, if there is fever then the temperature is 98. Someone's temperature will say that 99 is a little fever, so like this. I am taking the example of 2023 in India and telling you, make a note of all of them and tell me who is above it and who is below it. Now you are gone in 33. If you have 95 lakh network then brother, he was buying Creta now.  My wife was saying on  Do you want a Creta or can it run less than me or should I buy an Amazing or a Swift so that my wife can drive that, I will drive this one, you have to think, I am not doing that but there should be some benchmark to say yes you are doing ok Indian 26  Whatever it may be but I am going to book people date you are a new 30 and if you have 85 85 lakh is this d first think 100 thousand key network is this d  First think should be two million dollars, then later 8.30 crores will come, that is lying on the second, the first stop should be for any youngster to make his network 100 thousand and go to the safe, after that he can take leave and break also.  You can upgrade yourself by congratulating your studies, you can reduce something like this, so I hope you will keep this golden figure, you will understand and please share this and parents also join, their children are very happy.  They keep doing this left and right because sometimes it seems that the network is not worth 85 lakhs but the tanka is for 2.5 lakhs and the rakhi is for three, so it seems that I can afford this much, so I wanted to tell you a benchmark, I hope you.  understand thank you"

    "title": "Hospitals , Medical Insurance Aur Ek Kaala Sach [vrImI-27NFA].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, hospital medical insurance and one more truth yesterday, I was telling the truth so that I can get some eyeballs, because you know this by telling the truth yesterday, but tomorrow is the truth, okay, you people are going to benefit a lot, no one told me till date. Probably no one would have told on YouTube that there are many medical professionals and all of them are behind the posts too. There are many big YouTubers, they also tried to tell the medical fraternity to tell them that as they say, there is a lot of morale.  If you have a profession, then that's another bill to decide. Are you doing it in a noble way or not? You cannot make your profession absolutely noble. Your actions will also be checked, so I would like to tell you one thing, mostly you people have taken medical insurance. Many people have not accepted the issue of periods, one of my tips is if you follow it, then do it. If you don't, then don't do it. If you do, then write it in the comment area. The advice is very practical, whenever.  Admission is done in a hospital and the patient is taken to an insured person. If there is any situation for admission then the first thing to be done is to check whether you have medical insurance or not. So if you have medical insurance then you will tell me boldly whether it is mine or not, this is not a record. You don't have to say anything, I am telling you the reason, until the diagnosis is done properly, please do n't tell me that you have medical insurance, because now many people will say so and then you will be accused.  The diagnosis is also dependent on how much to take from it, there are CCTV cameras installed, now all the hospitals in India are also not talking to everyone due to which, something like Singh, outside food is not good, so all the hotels are bad, IT is very bad at this time.  I am making this video out of fear that someone might do such a thing to me, but as I can see, I am feeling a pain in my stomach from inside. I am telling you all the cost of risk even in an ad, so please do not hesitate to comment.  side  Support as much as you can, subscribe, Namaste, thank you, like, and understand the thing, how many people come, how do you look, because they are like you, if you have a big car, when will it open, then more money and a poor man, you are related to me in this group.  I discuss as I tell from the topic, sometimes people question, what difference does it make, your medical insurance is 20 lakhs, 30 lakhs, 40 rupees, he is taking it. Hey, I do it, the body is yours, the body is yours, the money comes only from the make-up procedure, 10000 rupees were charged for the admission, even in a five star hotel, the rooms are available for 10-12-15000 rupees, the hospital did not charge how much money for the room. Even if he kept it for 5 days, the camera is worth ₹ 10000, it is also worth ₹ 15000, how much is it 8000, then how many lakhs did he take? How did it cost Rs 20 lakhs?  To do some procedure, to open some, to band it, just because they are not giving you money, someone should take out something from inside which was not necessary to be taken out, what am I trying to tell you, I am here medical and I am not asking you to become a doctor yourself. Please, I am telling you to be smart, I am telling you to be a tease, you get yourself diagnosed in a government hospital, then you do not enjoy going to a government hospital, you are a decent person, you should not be made to stand in line there or if you are not called there then you  The diagnosis is clear, what is yours? In extreme emergency cases, the man becomes remote while doing the king, there is no doubt about it, but in that too, you can play smart act by doing two, you do it, it is not ours, if it is not there, then that is a useless thing. Once we find out that we have insurance, we will bathe you with the Gulkos from Dhaba. I am telling you each and every thing, which test, which morning, brother, you have not given it at all, you have not given it at all.  There is a pain in the stomach. Sir, please complete the brain test. It is very bad in India, but brother, there is a target against them and theirs. Till date, someone has come and tried to cheat me. I do n't know what to give, I don't even know, this is my channel.  I don't know who will do what, that's why I am not telling you by name, the name is painting everyone again and again, I am also many things, no matter how domineering you are, become number one, clarity is scared, the good ones feel scared, everyone feels all this.  are  If you are a driver then I should do it, what pace should you be in and this is the video, don't share it, this is the video which I am yours, I am the same clock, I am on YouTube, who has to come and speak in some videos to your subscribers and lawyer subscribe and that.  And brother, don't share the audios to too many people, this is also an effect, then some other story will start when you do it, because then they will take away the money, this is the commission, once they will know that this is a matter of taking away the money.  It is already taken out, as soon as you enter, the first thing is the insurance, this also stop, take a breath, we will give it, it will be done, yes, tell us how we will give it and then tell us we will give the cash and they are giving the check right now, now take this cashback and then reclaim it also.  It happens through insurance because he will open something of your loved one which he is not supposed to open like showing the car which is not working now, gear oil is fine, no, yours is worse than everyone else, you will open that too in the doctor, turn off the engine. you went  If you do something for someone then give something else and this happens a lot, I have been there for this, if there is no emergency then there is no treatment in emergency because what is above life, sometimes there is a process in which if there is no emergency then  I am here, my request is that you should do the diagnosis instead of doing three tests and one more tip is very good. If you enjoy your subscription, please write. If it happens with parents, then all these things are honey and nectar.  There is no PK, so it's okay. Keep the doctor in your circle of acquaintance who is your closest relative or you know him or you have ever served him so that he can guide you well because they know everything about each other, like if you are in real estate then I am in real estate. I know what it is, mother, I am an astrologer, I know everything about it, because the person who practices his business, even if I don't check it myself, the moment he hears it, he comes to know that he has put it in his ear.  it's good brother Sir, take the commercial 6%, then you know who has fallen into whose stomach, you are right, then it is known directly by ear, you have this kind of lover, it is complete, then friends, you get to know whose murders brother.  You know, like this, doctors are very good, many doctors are many doctors, many doctors are very good, so the good doctors you know are acquaintances, acquaintances, relatives, friend circles, here are your mother, low clients, you are also going to do some business.  I am a doctor like you  I know note de time and doctor, so now if something ever happens to me, I have a doubt, so I have kept the numbers of the good ones or the good ones, I am brother, this report has come, man, he is saying this and then that.  Guruji, this low sir is blaming me, okay, now he is a genuine man, then keep one or two more like this, keep one or two from the government, then tomorrow you take what you want to take because ultimately the body is yours and God has given it to you in the form it is.  no such doctor again  He can make it and give it, he can take out anything or vice versa, put something inside the plastic, they say no, get a stand inserted, a nano team has gone, what money do you have to pay, the government has done well to reduce the steno rates too, okay but brother.  If not, then definitely he is instilling it in you now. There are two-three alternative doctors in him. They are very good. I am not even taking the names of the good ones because there is a very strong team of bad ones and he is also after them. Okay, you.  Google it, it's ok Doctor Jhajjar has nothing to do with promoting anyone, but he tells something alternative, all of them are of the Mirchi caste, brother, I will die like this, but your mind is also too busy in the situation, there is no time, then no one can do anything.  It may be fine but where you are getting time then all such diseases do not happen which do not give time, 95% of the things are such situations, you get time because these people also say come tomorrow and come the day after tomorrow.  Come with this report, come only then, it is the program of a man gradually, so please check the rest of the things yourself and just because you have medical insurance, it does not mean that you can get anything done, I have seen it with great pride, brother. This is not an imaginary brownie from a real example. Did you guys like this topic? You liked it. You enjoyed it. A practical thing like this is important in many things. That's why I come here after coming here. No, he should not become like this. Don't create active waste, don't even create panic, don't create panic, just tell the subscribers at your own level, brother, there is no need to make everyone happy, someone quietly whispers this to a friend, brother, see this, see it next time and please.  By doing three or by doing, make doctors your friends. How will you get doctors? You will find doctors in India who do not collide. You will find someone in the street. You will find someone's brother. You will find a friend. You will find a friend's father. You will find him in your own circle.  I will meet him, check which one is hotter, hold one, hold one, hold the other, hold this because this caste also invents many things, now I will not take this one to that one too much, so many like this.  Some videos are always made to tell what has not been told. Okay, there are many things and diseases which can also be invented. So check three times, check with people. Independent, here you are telling all this. Tell me all one.  If so brother, then the matter is wrong.  Then it will happen but check and take counter opinion. People don't even give you a chance in the first place, they make you panic like this brother, the program will be done there, so do the procedure quickly, everyone's target is mixed, it is completely corporate colour, brother.  This much amount of tax has to be paid in the quarter, the program comes, the customer looks like a host, he has come, now this person is guilty or has Pitra Dosh, at least some of your ancestors do not spoil anyone's son, then everyone.  I am not blaming but this is how it is and this is what is happening, where is your body and what is anyone doing, it does not mean that the program is fine and you have come on this, I pray that no one has to face any issue. thank you very"

    "content": "Hello friends, today's topic is, many people are on social media, I am also on social media, I also have a little audience with the kindness of you people, why less is more, most of the time is stuck, the topic is ho, you deal with hitter is fine. How do you have to deal with the weights? Some people in your life will come physical, some will go for something else, so you have to see this that you are sitting in a setting, you are sitting in the drawing room, you have a very nice curtain, it is very nice, soft, very good juice.  The music is also very good, everything is good in life, friends are also sitting well and conversations are also going well, suddenly a mosquito comes and humming, so what do you do, if you look at everything, mosquitoes are attracted.  Will someone say, ignore it, it can't be like this, then whenever you kill him, you kill him, then this should not happen, I am not going to do this, you have to go and actually kill the heater tool, you have to treat him like a mosquito, get out immediately.  Friend, don't give too much explanation, many will come in life to trouble you for doing like this. I think you want to date him, the world is fine, you understand what it is like to date what cash will change your reality, now when you are the one, you find yourself explaining yourself.  Must tu me people ron di you be very very of debt because you are happiness will go people will hit because you know people fine time tu hate  Somebody Like I'll Tell You Makes Videos With Examples And Just Understand It Has Nothing Less So Now When I Read This How Does My Thought Process Come I Did n't Answer But My Thought Process Is This That's why my friend, I don't have anything less to make a punch video than you, so I want to make a punch video, but I made one, you don't have anything less, you will watch that punch video and then come and laugh and then  After all you will write and if you don't have less then understand that I am absolutely beautiful but I am making a punch video but how are you? Think about what you have, if the heater you have is not actually there, then go over it again. What is the need, I mean, even if a man is not making good tea, then what is the need to drink his tea again and again, make your own, drink someone else's, do something else, this trailer is not comfortable with them themselves and dose is required from you.  crazy  Take it by getting an avo response from you because your life is miserable so when this poke poke is an I think descent you are okay with it then by poking you it elicits a reaction from you so that your stagnation gets shaken and your peace  If one goes off mind, if there is irritation on the face, then their day is made. If one has to destroy them, then there is only one way, just ignore them. They cannot take this thing, otherwise it is so much. Bhatt would write something like this, I am lucky that I don't get to see so much, but just ignoring it doesn't matter because it is our normal habit that 99 people will do something good, otherwise the focus will go there, this is the fact, man, this is my jacket, this is absolutely true. It is clean and neat. If there is a stain on it then it is 99.9% clean. But if it is a stain then the attention will go only here. This is the human mind. So brother, we will have to remove this stain from life or change this jacket.  If you need to do something or need to do something then address that thing. You can ignore whatever is coming from outside in your life. When you reach a stage where you ignore it on social media but in real life. Sometimes you don't know, he comes, I come from a serious place, so you have to give back, you are him and everyone else 's brother, it doesn't feel good to meet you, many people will come, hey, you have become a big man, now only Han will listen to us.  Tell them, 'Haan, I have found a big man, I will not listen to you. Now you guys, she will not be short-tempered. What is her way of talking? If you have not picked up someone's call, if you have not been able to pick up, then what is the way of talking to her directly?  I can't even speak, I was busy, I called you, I didn't pick up, you still have time, he needs something from you, understand, people here couldn't understand the difference between selfish and selfish, let me tell you, you will enjoy listening to selfish.  Many times people say that a person was less than you, you did not do less for him or if you were able to do so then he will call you selfish without releasing that he had to do less for his self which you did not do because you had a prayer engagement or  You can't do that if you were not in the mood or you were not feeling well or something else then he is calling you selfish that I came to you, you did not do less for me but you did less than me, you worked hard for your life.  He has reached this position, he does his own work, he does it in any way he can and he doesn't need you, you need him and he does n't come to you, now if he calls you selfish then how selfish you are, brother, don't go like this.  If you ca n't become like this, then spend your money, you don't understand one thing about this, I will make a different video for you, it will be long for you, okay, what do people do in that while sitting with influential people, but you have understood this.  of  Trollers, hitters and people, look, it is a simple thing to remember in life, even after 20 years you will find a man, you will not remember what he did wrong with you, what he did right, but your body will remember what made you full, your soul will.  Remember, he made you full. If he has made you feel good, then you will meet him with love. If he has not made you feel good, then you will avoid him. Listen to your body, listen to your gait, just listen to your instincts, do not remember me.  It must be that exactly how was that rude person, a man forgets the exact details, but you definitely remember that friend, this man made me feel good, so if not me, then remember the one who does not make you feel good, whoever it may be, you.  He has to be treated like a corn and a mosquito, there is no way to see him, you can understand by seeing him live, this thing should not be right, he will come back to you again and again to do something, I was just kidding, leave it.  give this  I am teaching everything at a deeper level on the Happiness Course. If you want to join the Happiness Course, please connect on WhatsApp. And please be a part of the course. How did you like the video? These are very subtle, small things in life. But they are very important, like the definition of selfishness that I told you today, write it down in a small copy somewhere and apply it and try it next time to anyone in your circle.  You call you selfish, please give a reply back, why do you need this thing, you do n't want it, I don't want it, identify you, it falls short, I can't, I'm not in the mood, I don't have anything else, so remember this thing, thank you."

    "title": "How Does The Babaji System Works In  India ？ Buisness Model Discussed [rkf_eMNGRCU].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today's good topic is about this Baba's system. You are understanding everything is fine, I am also a Chhotu Baba, it is fine and when I too get messages, I realize that what a game it is, right.  And how does it work, so today I am going to share such a great video with people, I am not going to take the name of any particular big name, those who speak like this are all frauds but this is what happens and this is how it works, I am full inside.  That's what's inside this other big hoon, other platforms comes and talks nicely, supposes and there's something that people can relate to, it reduces people's pain of losing or makes them feel good, so there's a lot of wonderla in people's lives. Okay, like I do not mean astrology, one of the main things, you people must have seen through my videos, I do a lot of things. Okay, from real estate in real space to spirituality of monitors, everything is my own.  Okay, people come with a lot of devotion, they come with a lot of respect, because even if I liked them, I would break my mask by telling them a very heavy consultation fee. Is it okay that they have so much money and suddenness?  If you fall in my eyes, you too, you too, behind the money, I am very fine, because I don't want to hang people, okay, because what are the people, they are absolutely dubbing, many and many times, is that you, if swimming is not known to them.  They will know that if you are drowning someone, then if you go near him, he will also drown you. You have to keep him at a distance and do not let him drink too much water, he will drink a little and just keep him afloat and You have to swim like this, he will come near but you are taught, I have learned that this one who survives has to be kept away by slapping his hand with the leg, otherwise he will hang completely and will panic, okay, this is what is in life, now what?  which is  These babars exploit them, their front is free, everything is free, it is our movement, if they give money then people start ditching, the middle class suffers a lot, no one is making any money from it.  If he comes to know that the very lower class has no money, then people can make ₹ 2400 crore by just mapping the numbers and counting ₹ 200 each, then they can make ₹ 2400 crore. My audience is the middle class, so I am addressing them more that this game of stupidity is going on at a different level and if it is going on, we the middle class are in great trouble because of this game, but we too.  It is not that middle class people enter and enter the games, but they are not fasti but they are fasti in Wonderblaze because in the story also some person is telling you a simple thing that where there is no one in earning money.  Just say it straight to your face, I will take money from you, just like someone else says to you, you must have heard it, you are a bald bald drug addict, in the beginning when someone had to get into the habit of drug, they had to give him the drug for free, in the beginning someone should say something.  No one cares if I take so much money for this, now as if I am mine, then someone in my name wants to do drugs, I pay a few rupees in the beginning, this is the fee, then he runs away because I am not actually doing drugs. I am adding value, so now someone comes to me with a problem - mother has been robbed, husband has gone to ruin, Guruji, you are the only one who has enough money. If someone wants to buy a house worth Rs. 2 crores, it means that he does not have the money, but he is poor.  No, now I have told you your consultation fee. If you tell me something, then switch it off immediately, that is, how did I help him? Brother, whatever problem you have, it is below this consultation fee because off course you have to resolve it.  Only two things can happen with the consultation fee, Shakti, your problem will be solved, after clapping, he will go away happily, he will say thank you and then he will come again or will send it to someone, or you will be cheated that brother, it did not taste good, there are only two things.  Shakti, you just went to watch the movie, the ticket was for ₹ 300 ₹ 500, you had fun, which is called getting money, so you enjoyed it, there is no cheating and the movie turned out to be nonsense, so what?  People will not go there again to see the actor. This much will be there, you will not be losing any more than this, but where this babo's system is running, what is there in the beginning, it is seen that it is free, wherever things are free there. URD products should stand up, but middle class people don't stand up. Wherever they go, now they will charge. You will come to know and then your heart will break. They have to do it. Take the name of anyone to get hundred percent. I am the one who is 1990 percent good.  good institutions Everyone is running, everything is going well, but they need money, hey, he is also late, he is so late for yoga, that English speaking person is downstairs, he is doing some engineering, he is also doing money, as many people as he is, the expenses are gone in the beginning.  Why don't you tell in the beginning, because if you tell in the beginning then no one will come, it is a truth, now what people like me do is tell in the beginning, now I have platinum membership, its fee is very high, no one has joined without it. very much  She said that even in Netflix they do n't talk much, check it out too, it adds value to you, there are courses in it, all the webinars, links to all the webinars are free, the old content is there, there is an astrology course, there is an astrology course, I would like to start teaching, I am not a consultant.  Lot of people are approaching me for consultation I am not doing but if you want I can refer you I am someone give it a match cheaper  Give me more butter, he is gone, he is butter and money is also less, I am late, so why do you think more money, I am more, I am more late, now I am the one telling you, I am that consultant astrologer, once in my life someone came to me.  Then again, she definitely doesn't have any chance of getting close to me or anyone else in her life, but as of now, I don't have any advertisement of my own, I am not doing it, right now I am just teaching those who want to learn Astrology, I will start a new one in Navratri.  If the batch is ok then join, I will do something in a different way, it will definitely happen in platinum membership, if you also, I will start a star bar, if someone has a shop only in astrology, but he does not want to give a monthly payment, but that is different.  There is a buffet, but if you want to take someone, it is different, so come again. Okay, look, now I am not in the middle, I don't send anyone else's till 20, I have a lot of offers, so I also have to sell myself, otherwise.  Meaning, something has to be done, okay, so let's move ahead, so these are the Baba's who are the most exploited, they take the Wonder Ability and catch hold of you and in Wonderlaati, you go to them at speed, then there are some Baba's who are only old people.  Attract and their template is to bed mouth the next generation. These are the stories of Gujarat and they enjoy it a lot. They are from Gujarat and there are two-three more like this. You may not meet them, you may not even know their name.  Address  If you know the name then you can write it. It's okay. People's awareness will fail. I don't want to take the name unnecessarily. It's okay for me not to mess with everyone so much, but that is a simple way to attract the old people. Come tell the old people what did you get, how are your children.  Has everyone come here? Now is this here to give anything? Then there is that one with the ladies. Is it okay to do that with Rajasthan etc. Tell me which one is that. She says leave her husband and take refuge in her, which is this.  God knows that by doing this, many women get peace. Tell me the one who has trouble in her merit life or any woman. Today I am going to tell you, watch this, it is going to be a very interesting video, join me if you are okay.  You are a woman, your wife is Shakti, if your husband is listening, he is his trouble inside the house, cooking food, going to school, picking up children in the morning, husband can do anything, Shakti is there, okay, now play with him, he is his problem.  Addressing him, helping him, doing his own contribution, now all of them are hanging in terrible ways, sitting comfortably in saree and you are the one, now these five days have become a day, oh these 5 days, 7 days are not there.  The story also went on caste is right wood have enjoyed only right right right wood have felt peace only because of eye or dirt and gone there okay mommy or there are many whose husbands have gone and children and children and that  They don't help, they don't say Namaste, it's okay, they do n't say Namaste, they are sitting like property, I don't care about anyone, they are taking all the institutions like this, but yes, we are a little bit because they are the ones who are talking, the next generation is actually useless.  These are the terms of fear of retirement, if I see your property worth Rs. 4 crores, then I will go there because is old age such a thing, isn't there someone who is 6263 years old and 65 years old?  So brother, he can live till 95, he needs 30 years of emotional support, he needs Namaste, he doesn't have a husband, he doesn't have money, when I don't have him, he is in the form of property and the family members are also living in the property and they don't even say Namaste because they also feel that  This is our home chicken's jaaye dal par type type, I have got such a feeling, because now there are many people in the market, I am telling you how this public is sitting here to exploit the crackers of your family.  All are models, women are women, elderly are elderly and now those with children have also come, the conscious 20's left today, what did your parents do? Are your parents happy? If you look at your parents, don't you feel happy?  What is there in them, they studied, got a job, then got married, then gave birth to me, then gave birth to my brothers and sisters, kept fighting among themselves and like this, there are also two or four diseases and kept fighting among themselves, in that you have thousands of happy days.  Who  He was never captured even on Time Photograph, never even on WhatsApp, never on Facebook, he is not there, friend, how can you remember, I am addressing the children, 24 years old, 28 years old, when you first came into the hands of your father.  The feeling of when the delivery took place from the hospital, that father unfortunately does not tell, the fault lies within the family, this is my channel, this is the family channel, what I have discovered, leave everyone's knowledge, all religion, all comfort, all joke.  It is inside the house only and people say that the tribulation is a challenge. The one who is standing at the border is a brave man who has been a child to us and is giving us protection, our soldier brother, but the one who is the mother of the family and the head of the house is also no less brave because his loved ones.  To fight with, to quarrel with one's own, the one who is for the enemy, the one standing on the border has a gun, someone will come and kill him, it is clear who is the enemy, who is his friend, who is his family.  The family is 500 kilometers away from here, he is standing on the border, he is doing very great work, I am taking his example, he does not have much role in this video, it is okay, the family is standing in the mother's house, whose wife was given to the daughter, not the daughter. Gave it to him, Gave it to his mother, Why did he give it, Why didn't he give him time? Everyone is dancing with the man, He is getting buttered, So Babaji is sitting for him too. If the children do not do what you say, no man, then you are like this property. Yes, property batch, do everything, teach a lesson, but do not fall prey to these babus and external influences. He has grown up and talks rudely. If you are the father, there is a difference between you and the father because we say, Father, God is very big, we.  Father is the supreme father, his is a very big thing, what are we doing today, mother and mother become very concentrated, mother and mother are very respectable, heavy, but as they say in movies or in life, or there is too much footage, it means I want to reduce it.  I am not speaking but I am from, the role of the father should also come from the story, the mother has given birth to one, after 10 years the role of the mother becomes mostly that of worrying, doing less, giving birth is a bigger thing than the one who gives birth. No power, it's okay, they give birth to you by risking their lives, okay, they are very revered, but in this, father is now mother is revered, so father can't be like this, can a bad boy give love to a bad girl, he is a father because if one of ours Supreme Father is a man, so even with him, we can do anything as a gateway and his hand is there for us. If you always tell us according to your feeling, what kind of relief it is, do you think that your sorrow will be defeated or not?  Didn't remember him, did n't remember him for so many days and then when you are in trouble then you remember this father in real life, this is the real father and he is actually there by connection only, your child has not done yesterday for 3 months, 2 months  not from and then tomorrow Hey papa, I want this, dad, I want this, if you get stuck like this then you should unite the whole world, but dad doesn't do it because I am the only person who can tell him this thing from inside, the rest gets sorted out, Namaste, it has been sorted out, okay.  My ideology is that when I say that if unruly children misbehave, then you have to ask your friends what mistake did you make, either you gave birth to them or you have made a mistake that is why they are misbehaving.  It is your fault, because I am the elder one in the Shivalinga, I have heard it myself and my younger one, someone gave me a very small one, I am still 2 years younger, okay, you are elder, you are elder, you are elder, if you are elder, then you are elder.  When the formula of 'Wale' is now applied on big people, all the addresses you people, siblings, Vibhuti, rags, rags, then how can you write down the dog, you identify with this ID, if it is okay, then he was called 'Bade Wale', so he is big.  Whether you are 2 years older, 3 years older, increase your dead years, increase it by two and a half years, you are big, you are big, you are big, your parents are even bigger, aren't you, when you are 2 years old, brother support, you too are mature and heart should be bigger and everything should be better. Okay, then why mother is not yours, if she grows up for 25 years, then write the name of all the Indians in the families who created this non-SD milk, Mother of India, the day before yesterday.  The one who told the family to talk to the family again, do not stay close together, stay close mentally, first of all stay close physically and the outside system of business model school is set up to exploit this message, someone is taking the children away. Some of the parents are taking the father, some are taking the mother, the one in the house who will collapse as soon as the mother leaves, the house is fine, nothing will work, he is fine in the house and some are the ladies.  If it is doing ok, then tell me what is the system and what is the experience of you people in this big one, do tell it in big one. If you liked the content and have not subscribed the channel, then please subscribe and one more request to those who are subscribers.  Okay, so brother, add one or two more subscribers who like this kind of content. Please add to the parents in your house many such things which are useful to the parents.  You want to say that you don't get it and you will never get it, but my videos will be given to them and they will understand and the notes between you are so silent, go and subscribe, it will come in their field, okay, they will also know about it.  It will not work, they will not like many things about me, I know that but there are some things which are power to hit the story or the story in a positive manner and try to live with all the family in such a way that whatever is the problem, there is a little baby in the conscience behind each one who  Rota is relief, will you address him, what do you want, do you want respect, if you want attention, then asking is creating a problem in children's life by saying directly, give me respect, take whatever you want from me, why am I doing like this, I will not give this, not that.  I will give meaning, if you are angry from inside, don't tell me, if you are angry, then you don't talk to me, you don't give me any feeling. Hello there, the bus has taken the bus, I have to pay his school fees, the child has no homework, the wife has her own troubles.  He may also have his own programs as per his own wishes. If you have to go to the gym, don't do this. Tell him in time for the sake of parents. Brother, today you have given me time, can you ever tell me, brother, who are you? Our sense of humor is very bad.  There are many such comedians in our country and those who go to comedy and laugh, we never see comedy. Comedy is the truth of our life and there is pain in it, but everyone laughs. Even in my videos, many people find Start Seat Dr. Comedy.  some comedy has happened  That laughter did not come, then as soon as the whole truth came, the whole of our emotions which we are not able to discuss because what is a comedian? Wearing the mask of a comedian, the truth of life will hit you and you will also laugh, that too.  If anyone laughs then I am Guru ji, but this truth which I am killing seems to be a comedy to the people, witch is ok, witch is good, if you basically don't enjoy life, it is okay, then whatever fun you enjoyed."

    "title": "How Government Jobs Will Transform In The Next 05 Years ｜ A Glimpse Into The Future [8Oy3pC9h7tU].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, I should do government jobs and future of government jobs, we will discuss this and I am seeing the youth ruining their lives and ruining their future. Now many people have picked up this topic on YouTube, which is good but it is also conclusive.  No, no one is going to take him, they make him in isolation and he is not able to go on the journey, they say don't do isolation, understand his essence, you this government.  When what will happen in 5 years, who will do it, I have listened carefully to you, according to the preparation you are doing, it is also a matter of who is passing, according to what they are doing, you are relieved to make videos for them and what they are doing. His element of intelligence is very high, he knows everything what is happening there, I am here to tell the rest of the people, the children of the rich are not coming, the government is not conducting exams for the middle class children, the children of the lower class will go and absorb  In 5 years, 6 years, 7 years, you will feel that this is raw, there is nothing, no power, no position, no digestion, no one knows who is preparing or who is new, so he plays a lot of roles and makes me mine.  If there is trolling the most, negative comments come, then on such videos, I get a lot of Guruji type adversaries, I like it very much, but in this one, yes, you will not get it. No matter how hard you try, I am not fast yet.  You cannot drive in rare view. Double, which is the double for this? No, but I, my uncle, uncle, uncle, Tejaji, his, her, he, he was like this, he, he has made it like this, I, you will not be able to make it, I agree, he Everything is artificial intelligence, everywhere, your family, identity card, everything will be linked, there will be no scope for corruption, there will be no decision making and there will be no taste and the posting from here is from there, so is the child from a poor family.  It is a good thing for him because his father is very poor, he is taking the exam, middle class children will not be able to take the exam and when they go there, when they go there, they will go into the system because of fear, fool, good factor, bill not be, fear because of brother. Again there will be a prejudice, now I will not talk about so many classes, classes are being talked about, so there is a lot of gossip in it, if a group A officer's child is attacked by a group A officer, then the news will never be published in the newspaper.  I can't, it was published in the newspaper that a rickshaw puller's daughter did well in the exam and a porter's daughter became a maid 's son, which became a very good news, but think of it, now it has become a social jump for their family.  There are too many porters, ready made rickshaw pullers, they never got a jump in their society, that rickshaw puller drove an auto rickshaw, he was a late auto rickshaw driver and could not become a plane pilot in his life.  At any time in his life, the jump that his daughter or son has taken will definitely take his family up, but this is not happening in the middle class. In the middle class, the child is not running ahead of the father. When this is happening, then his moral  And the motivation is that of a beginner, it is not much and when he is not able to achieve even this, when he does not achieve the government, then he does not know what to do next, then when he gets involved in entrepreneurship and these things.  He realizes that he is at least like an auto rickshaw driver because he has to do something every day only then some money will come, now he is not able to understand what to do, here the middle class is very fancy, the rich do not know the way to earn money, the poor do not know.  Do n't want to follow the method of earning money because they don't want to become poor. Exam story emerges. Second aspect of government jobs is going to happen in future. Girls should do that job.  When the government does it, it is good because they provide them with maternity leave facilities, leave, whatever facilities a woman needs after getting married and raising children, which is a good thing for those who belong to the backward class of the society, but not for the rest of the people.  You will be able to enter and if you enter then you will not be happy. I have been removing you people from the government since the time of the government so that the competition is reduced, I am saying this to you brother, you will not have 14 hearts, you are an average.  You will be called a human being, no great person will feed you, no great clapping, this cannot happen, if you come from a small family, from a small village, or from a small city, then you will get a little respect there, the person who is living like an urban person. Previous  He has been doing it for two generations, it does n't matter to him, there is no one to perform Aarti in his street, he is a property owner worth crores, no one is going to come like this, your exam is over, the story is no one is going to come for a government job.  Exams, now you tell me, government jobs will automatically reduce, notifications come out for government exams, then exams are not done, exams are done because they do not give results, if they give results, then your quick study gets done and then exams are conducted many times. Then the paper gets accepted and then it gets canceled later. How long will they keep doing this thing? This government is bearing everything, everything is government tested.  The government will take out all the sari, they will take it out like this, while doing so, they will take it to the elections. The one whose government has just been formed, has no interest in giving a job after doing the exam, because the exam has been done for 5 years now, all that is done by the pot. After that, he does this every year that even if you vote for me again, I will do the exam paper, then there is a change in the government, then I get reset.  So many states, I am crying and everything is going on, you don't have to do anything, whatever you are preparing for the government, you just have to meet your relatives or friends of this post, ask how happy they are, if you think they are very happy right now.  We are having a lot of fun and I am talking nonsense, so brother, at least prepare but go and ask once because many people are following the perception that the big coaching institutes are advertised so much.  And they are glamorizing these things so that a common man does not even know that he has entered the house. If this one officer does not find out, then find out the PCS. If he does not find out, then someone else should go and do it below him.  Ask brother, how much is there, there are very few people to tell the truth which they do not know, you are only suggested in official capacity, you will challenge him and you will involve yourself and I am making a difference on the society and it is making.  Impact and debt give a lot of satisfaction and when people like us talk carefully from inside, what is not a challenge, now people will talk in the past, will glorify and if India was so great then look at all the indexes and see where it is.  Now if you tell it then it becomes political, this government has made it very big and the government did not do it, the officers did not do whatever they are not a politician, the situation is a politician to make it worse.  Politician is responsible to do good also Politician is responsible Government officials Officials are absolutely clueless They do what they are told from above They do what they are told If someone has to say something, give a mattress code here, they will give a mattress code, then they will say, pay the wrong person, give it yourself, give it yourself, give it here yourself  They will be busy throughout the day and the story about whether that mattress has been opened, water has been taken out, oil has been taken out or nothing has been taken out, that decision is being taken from above, they do not have it here, so when you are in the system, then see this in the system.  Bitterness will go away if you are coming thinking that you don't know what impact you are making. I think that if a poor child comes, he will be happy then only one party will feel that he is doing something because what will he be able to do in his neighborhood.  Her understanding of people and her fulfillment levels will be butter because she will invite her family members to her house because it was a relief to live in such a kutcha house, now even her government house is not very great, she did not feel happy, not like the tap of Jaguar. But it is good in comparison, then its sense of achievement is very good. If you live in a house where there are perfect tiles, there is strong Italian marble and everything is fine, tinsel, etc. everything is installed. Now you are in a government house where lasers come.  There are doors, there are no bands, if there are bands, the windows are Madan, if there are bands, then they cannot be opened, you are struggling like this, the back is dry, the grass is growing in front, your family members have ever come, you are such a proud one.  She will not give any feeling and then you will never be happy, so when you are not making her belong to Tabla, then there is nothing further in this lane, because every July, first July, three day after tomorrow, she has to get increment, otherwise she will be in 3% increment, otherwise you many people say When is the security of D? Brother, when is the security of D? When is it the security of D? When is it the security of D?  Let 's go, posting in a minute is a caste, someone has done something here, anything, big or small, has been posted out in the media, whether it is his fault or not, he has a wife, a child, school, he has to do it at all, someone has to do it, so see.  Take it, you have to do it, who has to do it, you have to take a tomorrow, you have to take a tomorrow, it is very easy to say when you have to do it, the child's second three classes are from three places, fourth is from two places, no school change till eighth.  are done and then wife  She folds her hands, brother, whether I am staying here in the state capital or in any big city, I am doing great things and that is known later. Find out from someone, you worked hard for 7-8-10 years and got the job, then after coming into the job, you get the job.  If these surprises happen, then I am telling you this surprise first and I am telling that after the next 5 years, this job will remain for these people, whatever I told, and when it will go to these people, it will be given to them already on time, as it is called from here.  cream out  This is milk from which everything has been taken out, then when you get it, you will eat it. This is also being said to those who have just come to the government from a very lower class and have served for 10-12 years. They have got a status of living, it is also said that now they have become fans, bypass these jobs here, leave these jobs and give this to someone else and those who will get it, their social status will keep decreasing on one thing which is my prediction.  The saree made by me is fine, SN astrologer is not doing it, I am socializing from here that girls will not marry in future, it will be unlike a government servant because of this, which thing in marriage market decides is more in demand?  She has come because that girl will not be able to do a job if she is married to a government servant. He came here, story, story, he is roaming around, he is not roaming with us, Shakti, he also has to do the job and if he also has to do it and you also have to do it.  Brother, you will remain separated for the rest of your life and then there is no benefit in it anyway, if the results are like this, girls are government servants, then you will know that you will look for a job for 7-8-9 years, you will be 28-29 years old, then brother, you will be 35 and you will be looking for a girl because.  She doesn't want to do it and you were wondering what happened to me, I must be cheating, it was said that government people get the fat ones, this and that, who told you this, then it is the same thing, you don't invest looking in.  Rare view, even mutual fund people also say that passport form is not an indicator of future performance. Read the offer document carefully before investing. So here I am telling you the offer document. I hope you read this video very carefully.  What is after this is a little earlier, a little water has been added to the milk, the cream has not yet come out. Hey, bye time, your exam is clear. There is nothing in this milk. Nothing will be left, everything will be taken out. It will look like curdled milk from which cheese has also been taken out. So first the cream was removed, then that cheese too, nothing will be found. Friend, what is this and three trillion, three and a half trillion dollars, India 7-8 trillion dollars.  In the next 15 years everyone will be running Tom Dick and Hari will jump, all this will be seen, if you are my friend, then the numbers would come behind, see what he is doing, this will happen to you, then you are sitting there with your 3% agreement. Well, these are some great shakes, neither in terms of money nor in terms of social status, and please do not write this again and again, who comes for the sake of government job, here he is your number two earning, it is quite high in many states.  Why has it reduced by the time it gets completed? It will take time. In Bihar, it will take time. In the rest of the country, it is completely over in 4 years. In Bihar, it will probably be over in 10 years. So what are you doing by preparing now? It will take time for you.  posting will come and go Till then that is your band, now what will you do, you are not getting anything as you thought, the story is not getting anything, you cannot tell the story, this one is so much and brother sir, this one is so much, now please marry, they will not go, there will be no marriage.  If there is no marriage then sir, then how come the person who got a lower job will get married because in his social setup he has become a big thing but because he is in the middle class level, he has not become a big thing. This is the message so I hope you. Understand Take This Point This Video Write in the comment area so that other youth can also see for themselves that yes he is doing this then yes maybe he is saying something then he is saying the right thing. If you agree with what I have said then thank you very much."

    "title": "How Indian Employees Can Protect Themselves From Toxic Work Environment ？ [Fo9wKovRsQ0].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, it is a very important topic, there is a lot of clarity for the youth about the toxic work environment. Two or four things have come again and I want to go through this video for those who are from Janji because they already have a lot of issues about these things. I will tell you about them under two or three examples, but I would also like to address the millennials here, those who are born in 1980 and early 1990, I would like to address them, so let's start first with our dear respected Narayan Murthy ji again saying, I would like to reiterate that there is nothing like life balance, I don't like it, he has come again, two, three.  One thing I want to ask to Narayan Murthy ji through this video is that if there is so much work and there is a need to work so much for 16 hours, then how much  There is unemployment, why can't you give the work to others, why do you have to get the work done by the same person? More problems are happening with you people. Like in the old times, it did not happen that a rickshaw puller drove a rickshaw from here to here, so you have to pay less money. Basically, you have to put in more effort, there is bargaining everywhere, with the rickshaw puller and the vegetable seller, so these companies have now fallen for the same work, they have fallen to this level where they want you.  To work for 80 years and pay you for 40 years, the biggest problem is that people have to release now and this is what I want to tell under my videos that senior management likes senior people but this channel of mine is for middle class.  And junior level, I am telling you that what you get is for listening carefully, you get one for doing minimum and one for basic performance.  If someone wants more than that performance then incentive structure will have to be put in place because like us we are share holders, we invest in the stock market, the maximum pleasure is ours, we will take the share of the bank, you are sucking the soul right now. Two or three things have happened recently, you people must have seen it in the tweet, if not then I will tell you which has gone viral. There is a lawyer, a senior lady lawyer. She posted a message that what do the people of this generation do in it?  The message was that ma'am come to me I am leaving this office at 8:30 now which is late as per him and every standard so tomorrow I will be coming at 11:30. He was not asking, whatever it was, he was informing.  And this thing was also made a big joke that look at the kind of children these days, they have to make up for it the next day, they don't have to burn out, why are they making fun of Millennials just because of their mother-in-law sometimes?  If this happened to you and you had to bear it, India was different, it was your compulsion, maybe your parents were very poor or your aspirations were like this or it was acceptable in the country. Once upon a time, this  There were whips in the country, indigo was cultivated, the British used to rule over us, so a lot of things were nonsense but the country is independent now slowly like we are 5 trillion 7 trillion 10  If we go towards a trillion dollars, our actions will behave like a half trillion dollar economy. People will behave less like these children of today. Their parents may have a full house, they may not be so helpless, so if they are behaving in this manner.  It's a very perfect way in fact everybody should behave like this and this needs to change why a work can't be done tomorrow not only Kabir Everyone remembers the couplet of Kaal do today, do it today, now there will be doomsday in a moment, when will Bahuri do it, it sounds very good, but brother, it was for those who procrastinate, who were not ready to do anything, this social culture has come.  Where work should have been done as of yesterday and then a new work again new work new work these managers are senior managers they are doing nothing except passing the  The parcel came from here, was laid there, stressed in, stressed out, they don't take anything and are moving up with their incentives, the lower employees should become the culture of India, brother, give money and watch the show, get 100 hours of work done, 120 hours. Will pay by the hour Why won't you If you start getting paid by the hour Then I'll see how much work they will have for you in  Freaks work which they have means now take out this data, then take out that data, then take out that way, now they give presentation, they give these clients, why do they become so many slaves of clients, why your foreign countries which are developed countries, western countries, are there any? This is how the work culture is, when their same company operates in India, they say that no, no, there will be changes at the last moment, we will do it, because if we do n't do it, then some other company will take so many people.  If so, then why are Indians so available? There is so much demand for work, they are given as examples and they are made fun of. And yes, when someone like Narayan Murthy ji comes and speaks, then if such a great leader is on the system.  The industry will come and say that the wife is a Rajya Sabha MP and they also take the example of Modi ji and say many times that Modi ji does so much work, Modi ji, there is a lot of difference between giving such work and doing the work.  Regarding Modi ji's age and stage and seniority, he has nothing else to do other than this, no bringing vegetables, no taking children for a walk, no giving medicines to parents, no one has any responsibility anywhere, now to expect that everybody else will do that it is not possible.  It just shows the heartless nature of the top management everywhere they will ban you out and then throw you like a used chingam like this  If you throw it away like this then whatever attitude you have, why do I have to come and make these videos and this channel again and again every month, to just tell there is nothing wrong happening, be ruthless in not getting misused, the amount of money I am getting from it. Do more work but there is no need to work twice as much. That is the message. If you are from a very poor family, you have many compulsions and you live in fear that you will be fired from the job.  So those who are forced to do off courses, their compulsion is taken advantage of, but I am saying that there is no need to be forced, if all the people are like this then it is not so easy to fire, hire again, select, train for those six months.  The company has to spend a lot during this period and all the companies have to now come to an end because when only the chief of Wipro says that he is there, he will come and say that there should be no work life balance.  There is so much need to be discussed about work life balance, so this every buddy has to do introspection because of that, brother, there is so much need to be discussed, so what are the reasons, stress is increasing, people have now started saying that  Marriage is an optional thing, having a child is an optional thing, sucking your soul on the job is not an option, it is not a choice, you have to do it or not.  To me, in the long term, the social fabric of the country will be affected by this, the GDP of the country will be affected, everything will be affected, just because you want corporate profits so much and to suppress corporate profits, I say the government should impose tax. Because if you suck so much blood and keep the profit of the employees at 25%, then the owner enjoys it a lot, doesn't it?  It is a lot of fun, get 80 hours of work done, pay for 40 hours and say that you have worked for the country for 40 hours. Which private enterprise is this and what is happening to the country? If they pay taxes, then they should do some other work.  What about the health cost which has been increased? That is not a negativity. People are having mental balance issues.  People are having health issues. People are having physical issues. People are having emotional issues. People are not getting married. Who will bear the brunt of all this? You have created a fad behind productivity to push China back. Be China first, first bring a party rule, first implement like there is communist party rule, get everything like that, do everything like that, and then start.  It means you want to start with what ever, it means you will not pay even after accessing it, you have to become China, you have to beat China, you have to beat China, it means it is typical, that is not the mindset of an Indian parent, seeing the neighbor's child showing off his child.  How many numbers do you take? How many takes? Hey, look at his neighbor's parents too. The parents will not be checked. Only the child will be checked. The pedigree of the parents has no meaning.  That How Intelligent How Very Intelligent Parents Are Child How Can Children Be Very Far From What Parents Are If Apple is in their DNA then Apple will do Apple Orange will be Orange Fish will be Fish Bird will be Bird Elephant will be Elephant So if we are elephant  If you are there then brother, you will move only at a cool pace, now you can beat the elephant, beat the hunter and whip it, it cannot become a horse, you have to move at the same pace, but rest of the things.  If we do well in some aspects in our country, if our growth is limited to 6.57, then this is productive productivity and it does not increase after 141 hours because of the law of diminishing returns. A person gets tired and unfortunately in our country the number gets reduced.  Only off arses can be monitored and due to glorification and glorification of the same, inefficiencies are lost in so many systems.  All the questions have come, how should I manage, how should I do this, if I do this, then we are benefited, but after coming here, we have to make videos because even we cannot bear so much, so many cases, so many cases, so many sad cases are coming.  People are sad, children are suffering from diseases in their 30s which were not heard of even in the last 50 years, that is, digestive gut issues are happening so much because food is not being eaten on time.  Stress is so much because everyone knows that whenever there is stress, gut issues come, food, digestive and all these issues come, so through this video of mine, what I want to tell as tech audience who is listening is to take tech.  It is a take away for all of you, don't take tension at all, don't take it at all on the job, do n't take it from inside at all, do n't take it at all because even your CEO is not taking it because he is also thinking how to offload his share.  Should I run away, with whom should I collaborate? When will the company take over the company's losses? Someone somewhere is doing anything by taking the money and you are like this and what is their expectation? Those who are startup owners, founders, owners are CEOs, top management, what is their expectation? He is taking as much stress of the job as he can because he is a direct beneficiary because he is the majority shareholder, you can take as much as you want, but how will you take that much, your company will take that much.  No, it's not your baby, the maid who works in the house can't take as much stress as the mistress of the house, she will sweep, run away, shout too much and ask someone else to get it done or increase the money and the money is not yours.  If you have to clean under the bed also and don't increase the money, you also have to get dusting done daily, so don't increase the money, you also have to get the fan cleaned daily, then it won't seem that much that there was a broom.  If the pot is used for cleaning utensils then the broom and mop are used on the floor. Where did the fan evolve in this? If the fan is evolved then you will get more money. Even the less educated maids are of lower class, they are so clear in your mind. If you are kept then the broom is used as a mop.  For I am address as an analogy I am not trying to put people down that you do this even I am not I am praising the lower class  He understands the class so well, there is a roar of eight hours, that's how much time will be spent, get more work done, get overtime done, if you have to pay money, get it done, see that contractor even dozen, even attempt, he says today you will get one and a half daily wage, three hours extra.  After resting, he gives half the daily wage. Dependent on, sometimes this kind of work gets stuck, but you people are getting misused. Even in RC aviation industry, I have seen everyone there is smart.  These happen because there is not much of a nuisance there. As soon as an aircraft lands in Mumbai and the connecting flight was going from Mumbai to Kolkata and it is raining in Kolkata and the pilot there is beyond his rating and another pilot has to be brought, then  This pilot's wife says that my working hours are still left but if my official duties were to end, do I have to pay all the allowances there, only then will the pilot sit in the plane, this happens a lot in many industries where  But if the employee has a lot of nuisance then check that if you have a nuisance then see and then if there is no nuisance then you will have to tolerate the nonsense. Be ready with that when you are selecting your skill set and your career and you are progressing then understand.  Do what is your nuisance ability in your organization. Never ever, whatever knowledge you are sitting with, then alone beyond that.  Sit down, don't share with your colleagues. Do n't be a team man otherwise you will be replaced. Be that spoken or what ever that item which cannot be replaced. If you can be very easily replaced because  Would want you to like that, I did different videos, one of my videos was a hit, Don't be a team man, okay, that's that too, I want to tell you that B.  Extremely smart, what ever knowledge you are sitting at sit on it, work should not work without you, it should be like this and those who are smart are doing this, those who are stupid, they keep sharing knowledge for free and keep feeling good, the boss comes and is very easy.  He will say, friend, this one should explain to him also, say sir, I don't have time to explain, there is a lot of time, I can't explain, I can't become anything, your boss will want you to be dispensable even.  If you have some skill sets and if you are dispensable then brother then only option left for you is sycophancy, this too many people are doing it well then you have to give feeling to the boss, you have to do sycophancy that is the only way you can survive but in work I often  -I am saying again and again, no, there is not that much work in India. If there was so much work in India, then how would so many people be unemployed. There is very little work in India.  Efficiency level is very low, mostly we are passing time as Indians, we are useless working today, those who sit here, our working is not like work today, it is the fact, but again and again someone says no, dig a pit, fill the pit, dig a pit.  The approach of 'fill it twice' is going on that every day dig a pit somewhere and then fill it, then sow and dig there. Why are you digging a pit, brother? If you are digging a pit, then go deep.  Water will come out in it, there is no purpose, there is no purpose, something, something, something has been twisted, the lower employees don't have that much intelligence, what is happening with the people at the top, you have to do more work in the matter of decision making, because there is a  Inefficient guy sitting on the top, his creativity wakes up at 5:00, then he starts distributing work. Brother, your creativity wakes up at 5:00, then your diary.  Make a note of it and get the work done tomorrow morning. If you wake up now, it will be done today itself. Whatever you were doing was routine, now there will be a meeting and that will be fun and it will be a lot of fun to torment people.  He comes because nothing good is happening in his house. Which I know that when I go to a cinema, no one in your house asks you, neither do children ask, nor does your wife ask, nor do you feel scared. While going home, I see many things. I am also explaining in the relationship course to those who want to enroll in my relationship course. Tell them, don't be afraid, tell the employee this simple thing, do n't be afraid that nothing will happen, don't be bad mouthed. Share this knowledge that you have taken with someone.  No, drink it quietly and be smart, it's okay, be smart, and don't burst the pod, it's okay, and that's another meme made for work, don't worry about work, and mention it by worrying about work.  Show that you are very concerned and mention it, do the work, don't worry, do worry and mention the concern, it is okay, the rest of the tension is not to be taken from within, there is absolutely no sense of ownership, who will be the owner, who will be the top management after the owner, who will be the sops.  A junior employee should not have any sense of ownership. This is what they will not teach you because many times I too used to get offers for some corporate training. Make fool of these employees, they get a lot of money, you have seen that a teacher calls by doing this and someone or the other comes and says 'Alam Balam', 'Come on, how is the Josh?  You should not go, you should say that your stomach is upset or you should not attend. If you attend then you will keep thinking about something else and you will be fooled. No one will come and tell you that you have to fend for yourself.  Always Have That Much Energy to Do Something on Your Own Work Hard Always Work Hard but Not for Your Company Work Hard for Yourself on Your Safe Once you work hard on yourself, you will reach a position where you will be able to add value  In the Life of Others and Then Nobody Can Replace You Easily and You Will Be Rewarded for What Ever You  Have to offer other wise, they will keep you as a ghost at the job, you will not be able to do anything else, you will go home, just take two pegs and then get ready again in the morning, or those who are not going to peg will be asked to do meditation, meditation is the worst thing to be made to do.  Meditation is not a bad thing but it has changed the way in the society, I will get up and do meditation, now you were sleeping, video on meditation is pending, if you want.  Write again because I am also scared of that. Last time I attempted it, I used a lot of abuses because at that time maybe I was not able to explain that much or maybe that much people were not ready to understand but if you are ready to understand now then I will definitely make a video.  I will like it and share it. Tell me how you liked it. Thank you very much."

    "title": "How Many Stocks You Should Have In Your Portfolio [2NewU2ZN4_s].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, a question is repeated a lot on different platforms, which I hear, how many stocks you should hold in your portfolio, there are many books on this, there are western literature, there are knowledgeable people and according to all, there are many who, especially Buffett's  If we talk about it, then 10 stocks are enough. Well, many have come up with formulas that yes, there should not be more than 5 but these one stock is according to that.  So 20 is done, 20 is the minimum, here I would like to tell you that I would like to tell it in a slightly different way, I would like to say that first of all, it depends on the portfolio size, if you are starting with Rs 500, one lakh, two lakh, then maybe one  Two or three stocks are enough, now there is no point in buying two stocks for one lakh, that is my opinion, okay, second thing, you should have a calculation in terms of sector. Exposure is also just because you have taken a separate stock and put a limit in it, then it is not that you have entered into that sector like financials, banks, entered into the same or entered into insurance, or entered into FMCG or entered into real estate. If you have a lot of real time exposure to real estate then avoid stocks, this is also a basic thing, so you should practically count the stocks in the 20's as we have counted for one.  Retail Investor But more than that, if you are more than 30 to 40, you cannot practically follow them, nor can you see their quarterly results, nor can you read the annual reports, nor can you know what is happening in that sector, then I would hit a limit of 30 to 35.  A portfolio of 40 will be a decent portfolio. What do people do many times? Instead of keeping it in the watch list, they also buy 10 20 3 Haj so that it can be tracked but too much.  Stocks which are on these tg groups and these on tips people and those who buy lottery tickets just by watching the business channel and many people like I know are sitting with 100, 150, 200 stocks also, it becomes difficult for many people.  Let's give the example of mutual fund, there are normally 50, 60, 70 stocks in mutual funds. They have employees and educated people from 10 to 10.  12 People inside a fund are there to monitor. The fund manager is dedicated. His job is to make his living out of that expense ratio and the fund management fee. What these guys are charging you. So don't compare them. You have  A full time job, you have 60, 70 stocks, according to me, a person cannot follow, yes, he can definitely take advice, I should take this, I should take that, I should take this. Having anything more than lets say 40 45 stocks is like buying lottery tickets less than 20 is like that roll of 5 kicks in so anything I think 30 to 35 stocks should be a decent decent number You simple topics like this If you want to learn about finance in a very simple way, then you can tell us. We will keep bringing more such videos in the coming time in the comment section.  There is a Subscriber Info Webinar Group, you can join it. There are many plans for stock market education in the coming month of June. We had done the first one and got a very good response, so there will be some plans in future as well, so you can join that too.  Thank you very much"

    "title": "How Middle Class Ka  Obsession With Facts Is Not Taking Them Anywhere ？ [UiSH5fbSMAc].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, you must have seen the topic interesting. Brother, talk about the facts. The video can be live changing. You watched it carefully and understood that I am India's number one clarity giver. I want to say this in the end of this video, you can tell me that.  Whether I am there or not, Guruji will not get my paper checked. If you have your own paper then write it in the comment area. When my paper will be checked number one clarity giver and if not then write nonsense nonsense meaning small word.  If I understand that nonsense too, then today I will tell you through examples and I will tell you why the fact is nonsense and what is above the fact. If you want to be rich, you want to be intelligent, then watch this video and this is the video that I  I have to tell the subscribers, don't send it to your subscribers, anyway this video will be copied, that's a different matter, but do n't send it to anyone, don't spread unnecessary knowledge, whoever got it, you can easily share it with them.  Let me talk about the facts, I will give you three examples and then move ahead. A board meeting was being held of an FMCG company which has stores in big cities as well as in small towns, so thefts were taking place, its data was very large.  In small shares, they found out the fact that if there were thousands of buyers coming to the shop, five thefts were happening at the shop, while in big shares, only two thefts were happening per thousand people, so it was very easy to take out insurance. Now we have to install CCTV cameras, we have to invest more money on security, even among the small lions, there are more thieves among the small lions. Brother, there are taxis, these are the facts, there is more theft here and thousands of people come here to buy Pachauri. Be it a caste, thousands come here to buy it.  There are two thefts, there is caste in the big city, so now we have to control them and catch them. This meeting which was taking place, brother, if you are a servant, then even if you remain a BP, keep sitting, you are a servant, you are middle class. Keep it in mind, many times people think that I have a salary of 50 lakhs, even if I have given you 40 50 60 70 80 lakhs, you are still middle class, you are not rich, even if you are sitting with a salary of 1 crore per year, then you are not rich, you are middle class, you are middle class.  Class upbringing, middle class thinking, then after discussion, when Malik signed it, Malik said hello hello sir, we have discussed the fact of you, you have decided.  Malik goes but when you understand things in Sanoj's way then only you will progress in life [Music] Four times more thefts were taking place in terms of actual theft incidence plus there the society is sold at a higher price and if the turnover was more then there would have been more thefts in the actual society.  It was happening there, then at Malik's dinner, the eyes of the rest of the people were raised that brother, you had given the interpretation of the thing after making it a fact.  I had left the people of the city and had declared while the theft is not much Malik moral science teacher has become the only one who has seen where my theft is happening most of the time, he had taken out the fat and given me, he was my first example and will give the best biodata. Listened carefully with me.  It's okay to go, let's talk about the facts. Brother, you know I am in real estate. I have very little relief at times. You people are also connected with me, for that, what is the percentage of India's land area in the world? Let's talk about the facts.  If you do n't know, then it is two percent. Okay, you check it. Two percent is our world's area, factory India's population, the world's population is also an idea of ​​140 crores, how much is the world's. If you divide it then this is the last decimal fact.  So now this third thing, the facts have been told to the public, brothers and sisters, 18% of the world's population is living in 2% of the land area, so the land will definitely become the power, brother.  Sir, take a plant, plant, plant, this land will do good for real estate, so this is a fact, number one clarity, if there are 140 crore people in our country, then there are 35 crore families, an average household of people, by the way, the strength average is 5 second principal.  If you take 35 crores, we need a house, it can also be a flat, I say this, there will be one person on the ground floor, one family, there will be no story, every person in the whole of India will have a ground, ₹100, every person will have a ground floor.  But if he stays, we will give him a house of 1000 feet. Who is the family? Average 1000 feet is too much, you know okay, we will give 1000 feet to the family and every person goes to do business, some go to school, less go to hospital.  If someone goes to Railways, he has only workspace there, be it a factory or something, we will give 200 square feet space to one person. 200 square feet means 20 Bye 10 feet camera, when a student goes to the class, the class itself is 10 out of 20. There are 40 students. Okay, so here we do not need to land everyone on the third floor, just like people do in restaurants, hotels.  Even if I am giving 20*10 rupees to a person inside or outside the place, even then if we say that every family in India will live on the ground floor, every family will live in 1000 feet.  People also live in jhumki huts, you know it is okay, people also live in 100 feet, 150 feet, 200 feet houses in Mumbai, you know where I am from, everyone will live on the ground floor in India and everyone will live in 1000 feet, even then brothers and sisters. When you add, not even 1% of India's area is divided. Yes, it is a mountain, it is a mountain, we have many rivers, it is the desert, it is the Run of Kutch, remove all this, brother, I am still on the ground floor.  If I stay, I don't have less than 1% land then this thing and how this is not a tax relation. You understand, I will explain it to you very well with the third example and will tell you what is important. Stay connected in the video, only then you will know that. What is important than doing and the real India and the people who have become successful and rich, what do they focus on first, what does any person focus on, I am going to teach you that, join the middle of this video.  If you are enjoying till now, please like it and also write MSG. Take a breath, do not get angry. If you have not understood something yet, then we will move on to the third example. Battle of Britain was a part of World War 1939.  It was the time of 19441, when Hitler's Germany used to attack and the fighter planes there used to go to fight. They were in the Battle of Britain. Well, it was the time of World War, so when their ships returned, it was very sad.  The English pilots and the English engineers and all of them saw that the oil that was in the fines behind the ship had a lot of bullet marks on it and there were a lot of bullet marks on the wing as well, so they sent back 100 ships.  There are so many bullets in each of them, so now they said that we will apply armor plating on it so that it gets protection because there are more than 100 of them, there are so many bullet marks and holes, these are six dogs.  Do you know that in a fighter plane, as you increase the weight of the fighter plane, the capacity of the fighter plane which you throw on the enemy reduces, then if someone throws a bomb of 250 K or 500 K or 1000 K? If there was love plotting then it will be less then it is ok but he will get some clarity on time, he came like me, listen listen listen these are the facts.  These are the facts, listen, this is a factory, wait, listen, listen, these are the facts, brother, this is the ship that came back here, it is not necessary to put it on the engine, put it on the engine, a ship did not come back, on which the engine got stuck and the engine is from Jhajha, it is an astrophy protected wing.  It will go here, it will go here, the plane will keep flying, I am order thinking, order thinking is not facts, facts are not needed, you have to apply your mind in everything, do n't chase data, this is what you are taught.  To make your bawdi moustache, remember whenever every person throws facts at you, whether it is Dhruv Rathi, it is okay to be number one, not all those children of seventh class, it is okay to Google it or any political party or any person or any institution or anyone.  Also remember the facts, he is a cat of yours, he is fooling you, remember this, a very dangerous situation is looming, if ever you have a factory and what is important, I will tell you one more thing of fact. In India, a person in India is worth more than a thousand crores, he has wealth worth more than a thousand crores, he is the most beautiful to look at, many girls have been crazy about him for many years, brother, tell me who he is, he speaks Greek God, he is a top film star, he gives super hit pictures, he is coming soon.  It is going to be on 25th January, you will remove some facts and a great example of this, I just came across a picture, of course he puts a lot of premium on his time, I did not see anything in this, it is okay, last time I was disappointed.  When I say something, by the way, but young but darling, you will get to learn all about the facts and what else, I won't do anything more solar in future, so this is the biggest thing, facts are asked by the middle class, so these are the facts, brother, these are the facts.  This is okay, it is fat when it becomes data and fact, that is the important thing before that, brothers and sisters, trends are trends, what is presentation, there is something more important than this, trends, I have already explained it before.  Money Man Set Series 3 Video Number Three On Me Sangu Live Sutra Channel Iconic Video Jin Jin Ne Dekha Hai Bahut Appreciate Kiya Hai Chupa Chua Heera Hai Channel Pay Jaana Padgae By Subscribing Na Padge Play List Mani Man Set Playlist Dekhne Padgae Video Number  Three is debu tu trends dat isse d number one video I have produced in no this one is probably giving competition to that one this one is giving it to us so this is the best of this channel right now the creator knows who  The best happens, rest of the world, anyone has the power to do it, so now understand carefully, this is going to come here, now I have read this, this is a fact, before the fact becomes a fact, there is a trade, it is late to see the joints, it is late to understand, which is this Seeing the trade is late, understanding it is late, Life is lived according to this trade, It is a happier relief, It is a more successful relief, More money is earned, When it was seen that so many houses have been built, So much has happened, Dwarka Expressway has been built, Karan Arjun came. After coming to Kanar Arjun, what we have seen is that what decision has to be taken next is that he is late on the facts. Many people keep waiting for the facts only. It is very important to catch the trends but there is one more thing that I will focus on today.  I am introducing for the first time because earlier I had made it till the trends, so see that for the trends, today something is coming for you guys before that, brothers and sisters, even before the trade, what is this here, this is the trends, what is this you have.  Sometimes  Have you seen that when there is a fight, is it based on facts? The fact is that you reduce your salary from morning to evening, you earn a lot, you reduce it even for promotion, your husband is good, he also pays the children's school fees, all the seven promises.  Even if you are fulfilling your duty, you are fighting with your wife, it is difficult, even if it is a good fact, but when you start telling that fact, then the wives, even the wives have not brought 50 facts. Your mother had treated her like this, this is what happened at the time of marriage. You know that women have a very good memory and a man always has a surprise test and fails, so the fact is that he is a but what is the real thing, the fillings are divided into trades. What do you feel about the people who are leaders who talk about politics? In the last election, people gave percentage to this party, this party got this much vote, it got this much OBC vote, this one got s's vote, this one got cent's votes.  Put this to the General's put to that, the share of votes here was so much, this Haj has gone, no meaning, it is the facts, it is of no meaning, what is the feeling of the public in 2024? So, I am a grassroots leader who I also consider myself to be and  I do concentration and all this is just a relief on feeling. By feeling on pulse, then trade will be seen and from trade, by the time the result fact comes, juice has been extracted in the song and this which  People of 7th, 8th, and 10th level debate like Dhruv Rathi on the question why am I late again and again, people say, 'Oh brother, why are you wasting the time of dead crores of people?'  You can also make this video. Do you know this article has been written, the soldier has said that this is the soldier, someone has said, the retired soldier has said, the serving has said, who has said, it has nothing to do with it and if he has said it, then this is it.  So everything is true because one person has said it and it cannot be a lie. The farmer has said it, he has said it, if the leader has said it then it will be a lie, everyone else will speak the truth, someone will take someone else's article and paste some of the story, do it like this and say this.  This is his report, this is his report, this is his report, this is based on facts, you have agenda politics, in any of my videos I do not talk on facts, I talk on trade, I am talking to you on feelings and also on feelings. Feelings are seen in yours, when your marriage breaks then it becomes fat that before that the marriage was a trade, what is going on, before that there were feelings which were not addressed and felt and it is important to tell this to the man because women go on these feelings.  Yes, they know what is happening but do you know that their feelings are not there, so they are not involved in decision making in investment? Here I will help you. How did you like this video and how did you understand it? First of all, look at the feelings in your life, what is the feeling of most of the people? Boys should not marry. If there are feelings, then what will happen next? Will there be trade? Why is the feeling because he is bitter with girls? What is the feeling of bitterness with girls? Why is it because girls are not attracted?  If you are not able to attract, then you are not getting sex, you are not getting sex, there is more porn, there is more masturbation, you yourself are indulging in wrong habits, now there is attraction and that is not there, do n't go and teach someone in real life. Now whatever thing is available to do, otherwise it will become sour grapes, it will become sour grapes, then will you say that the conscious conscience will go here because for the purpose of fulfillment in life, something is needed for the purpose, not normal like.  So I did not understand because here you have spoiled your program, you have no job, no money, no girlfriend, no sex, porn, masturbation, fatigue, irritability, low self-esteem, all this.  Feelings is here Raita of Feelings is roaming Feelings is rate here Trade is from trade Then you will understand the facts in 5 years India Youth Note Marrying Children Note Happening Growth Rate Coming If that is a fact then you will wait for the facts in 2035 Dhruv Rathi  Those who are viewers, you have to wait for the facts. Here Guruji is first telling that brother, we will correct these feelings. Brother, no one guides you, your parents do not talk about these things, if no one else is talking about these things, then address this feeling, when there was so much hue and cry in Just See Around Yourself and the tenants of the dhaba were insulted by these de sense.  He was playing mutual fund mutual fund, we have to put a little bit of money in the house, so much money is coming into the house and when he used to come to the house with Kovind on the door.  Malik used to enter the house and if the tenant was not allowed to enter, he would not be allowed to see the tool brush. You are the only one in Oyo's room who is very pale and pale, so the wife has now told him that you are serving my house.  If you are sitting with a package worth 60 lakhs, 70, 80 lakhs, then I don't have a house, suddenly someone will leak from my wife's mutual fund and will keep on breaking it. You must have given me a house and raised your children in it because Govind  Told that anyone can drop at any time, the ship's program was going on for 20 years here, yours ended in 8 years, then they don't even know, these cases also come, I don't know how many demats have been opened, ICC is the one doing trading in Zerodha.  There is a zero and lion story in direct investment, there are 18 types of mutual funds opened in SBI, some are kept on paper, some are kept in demat, some are kept directly, some are kept zero percent.  Some railway commission employees are relieved here, when the person cries later, to understand whose right it is, or the feeling that was coming when the person left, then I knew that the real estate has to do it now because above.  The father-in-law also beat me, the father also beat me, brother, take it from us, 10-10-15 lakhs have become your 30, you burst your mutual fund, take 60 Dr payment, a lesson worth one crore, a real lesson of one crore, a red crore. Till the state, feeling started from feeling, I came feeling, who understood well, what is connected with feeling, with feeling, then trade started to be made and with trade, now facts will start coming, then articles, now people wait here for facts, for facts.  Don't wait, facts about no meaning and facts that I have told you very selectively in three beautiful examples to show you that those facts  They are being told but they should tell, show and explain that something else is going on and there is no relation between these two. It is something like you have seen many nonsense people who say that tu plus tu equal tu five will do it by using some formula.  When one starts, the story is that he is pro, he is late, mother takes it, there is some trick, 2+2 can never be a fee, you know, but people do it many times, they show the mathematics of squaring the two.  Then it was done like this, then it was mined, then it was turned on, then it was proved that they deceive you by telling stories like this and that person did not know how they do the calculations of a person, then this you  People have to understand how you felt about this video. It is okay to share and discuss with everyone and sorry, I did not ask you to share, I am fine not to share this one, it is ok not to share, so don't share because it lets people but facts.  ok i did  I have graduated, normally such videos are made of trees but I am of the opinion that no problem, no problem, the weather and season has been such that things should be explained and understood, but you should understand this thing in detail workshops and how to monetize them. How to follow the trends, which trades are going on where now, which ones are going on in which city, which asset class is going where, these are the facts on Onida Daily Basis, I don't know about the facts. I predict that this will happen first, only then I get the courage to speak with number one clarity, I don't even have tea as my father, it's okay now, I have never drank alcohol or cigarettes, I have never been intoxicated, so I am making a video. Video: There is no ego in my ego, you will not see ego on my face and there is none. Now you write to me in the comment area. Am I clear? If I am not your number then write nonsense, write it. It is okay to write only if you like it.  talk That friend, this is all logic, don't count on facts if you are me subscribers till the facts, the cream has been taken out of the milk, milk has the maximum fat and cream, when the buffalo comes out of there by doing like this, is n't it, in Haryana we took it out.  It happened that they come out like this, most of them come there amidst the dung, the dirt behind them also appears like this and it also looks strange and they have to keep the bucket, they also pour so much water in the bucket, secondly, those who stand there in the beginning. Neither do they look down, they are standing there, they do n't see the doli standing bent down, so much water was poured in it and only her brother Saheb was cutting the wire, everything is fine in front of you, there is a problem, if they had poured milk in it too, then when they were there.  If you are taking it out from the market, then take it out from the same lot, either take it out in this lot or in your vessel, only then complete Azaan When it comes to the market, it comes out slowly, then all its goods keep coming out, so hold yourself from there.  is that fact  When it comes as per what is written on it, it is 5%, but by then its taste has gone, the people of Haryana will understand that it comes due to fear of taste, so understand, catch it, first do anything, only router thinking, what is happening youngster.

    "content": "Hello friends, do you want to retire, how much money should you get according to the Golden Formula, then you should retire. I will tell you the rule of 4%. This means that if your expenditure is Rs 10 lakh per year, then 25  That's 4%, multiplying 100 by 4 is 25 times. If you have 2.5 crores, you can retire. A lot of knowledge is being created like this and this is a mega channel from me.  Subscribe 100 times and 125 times. Those people are distributing this knowledge by cut copy pasting. Read four English books somewhere. People don't have time to read them. They took that knowledge and pasted it and have to subscribe a lot. Many people know that it is not so.  It happens and why it doesn't happen I'm going to tell you Don't follow these stupid rules there is no rule I will tell you the same thing can never be a rule because no one can predict human  Aspirations: You are 25 years old, 30 years old, 35 years old, 40 years old, never war, 955 years old man will ask you to go to Mount Everest base camp, you will be okay with going, your wife and children will all say, hey, what are you doing, sit peacefully, no one will come.  Will spend Mani I go You can never predict water Kind of Mani Do you want to make a T20 match Don't make that many runs You need so many in this over Make this many and this  If runs are scored then it will not go on like this here, this is a lifelong test match, score as many runs as you want and here you will be out once only when your program will be done thank you, this is done at your own expense, what is the reason, why are these videos a hit?  Types of Financial Influences, seeing which you cannot reach anywhere in your life because you are miserable in your life today. You may feel that your life is as if your breath is coming to an end. You may feel that your job is coming to an end. So now.  just u  You see brother, if it becomes so much, then I will be free from the problem, this time problem is not about Mani, it is possible that some body is telling you, this much will happen, this much will happen, you will see that as soon as you progress in life, no one knows about inflation from anywhere. Sometimes it is 4%, sometimes it is not there, sometimes it is 10, sometimes it is six and this is the government's figure. How much is the inflation of aspirations in actual?  Will you tell me brother, should you educate someone's children in your government school, educate them in Kendriya Vidyalaya, Navodaya Vidyalaya and in the government schools or do you want to be among the bigger ones or among the bigger ones, how will you know that even your 6 year old child  When he does 12th, he will come, Papa, my scholarship, now I want this maximum dates, tell me, when I can score 36 runs in one and only you have it in my hands, then make 36, no, I am this. Now he will be educated, what will happen next, see brother, don't people really want you to be well, given them 2.5 crores, 2 crores, 1.5 crores, 1 crores, in the same way there will be no value left, do you know, nothing is left 10 20 years ago  They say, first 30-40 years ago, a millionaire is a millionaire, then a millionaire has become a millionaire, now there is nothing, now only husband and husband are left like this, there is nothing, the value is already inside Uttam Nagar, if your no.  Is there anything even in 100 yards, that also means I am giving the example of Delhi, do you know which locality, what it is like, there is no meaning, sit at home, should I do it sitting at home, then you can enjoy.  Then you go to the beach, it feels so good to go to the beach, it feels so good to go to the mountains, go and stay for 10 days and see, after the fifth day he will run to the mountains and he will run to the sea, there is no taste there for another four-five days.  It feels good and it also feels good because wherever you have come from, you have created so much influence in the life of that place, so wherever you go like this, you will be seen openly, you will like it, address the problems, problem adervise, what is this, is this kind of financial porn?  Video Nothing, it looks like this, if it seems somehow, then find more ways to earn money by earning this passive income. There are many videos, I will also give clarity on that, money income is not so passive.  It sounds like money, the problem is that one does not need 10 hours a day to earn income, but maybe half an hour is needed, maybe half an hour is needed, maybe 15 hours a month, then even money and income are described as if everything is one's own.  It will be possible to take fare in auto, if you manage, it is not so much money, so please, my request is that my audience understands my content, go for actual adding value in yourself. Don't have, I just want to get this, whatever I get is less, you think this and I am not asking you to be greedy, I am asking you to be curious, I am saying here that in yourself Add so much value to the things that you will get well. Like I also tell in the definition that when you go somewhere and buy a shoe, you liked the shoe and you did not even ask the money for it, you deducted the amount and you did not even see how much.  belongs to This is the actual definition of 'will be'. We will settle in becoming rich. If you have to set a goal then set such a goal that you do not even ask the rate of anything. If you want anything, you just take it but that is very difficult for me in the Indian setting.  It feels like this is something like Lets, if a video had been made 25-30 years before Lets, it would have been made in 1993. You would have had a video like this in 30 years. 10 lakh rupees will turn sour. It was a big thing in 1993. 10 lakh rupees was a big thing in 1993. Look, what is 10 lakh rupees today? It sounds very good. In 1940, the expenses of an average house of a middle class whose two children were studying well, were at officer level on The Group.  I am talking about the time before independence, even among the British people, it would have cost an Indian ₹ 10. In 1940, household expenses meant food and school expenses.  If he is not spending the fees which are consumables, then how much can one take the loan, which is a normal expense. The cost of running a house was ₹ 10 in 1940, in 1960 it became ₹ 100 in 20 years. How much has the monthly expense become ₹ 100 whose middle I am telling you the definition of Class Group Pay Officer. I am not talking about a poor man, I am not talking about a very high risk person who is a middle class person. Group Pay Officer for 20 years.  Take the service man, in 1940 his expenses were ₹ 10, which means two children, I am telling you according to the family, in 1960, his expenses increased 10 times to ₹ 100, in 1980 then 10 became ₹ 1000, that is, in 1980.  Food, drink and milk are school fees, the monthly expenses would be thousands of rupees, okay, it has increased 10 times, this is what has increased.  In the year 2000, Rs 10,000 will become 10 times more than a thousand and in 2020 it will again become 10 times more than one lakh, so this trend has been going on for 80 years, no one tells about it, if the same trend is happening now then  It happened in 1940, it happened in 60, it happened in 80, it happened in 2000, it happened in 2020 if it is extrapolated In 2040, brother, this is 10 lakh rupees per month. 2000 in 40, I felt sad to hear that, it means please note, I am not satisfied, it may be 10, it may be less, I don't know, I don't know, but this is because of inflation. I am telling the figures, so don't get excited about numbers, keep working hard, keep sting ahead of all the people with whom you associate. Try because there are a lot of aspirations. As I say to the aspirations, the lady who was born in a family that never swept, mopped, or did the utensils, that is, she will get married and in a family that never swept, mopped, or did the utensils, she will see her old age.  If I go to the position of doing, then it is a matter of aspiration that go down, start doing things which you never did in your life, which has done sometimes, sometimes does not do, sometimes happiness, sometimes sorrow, that.  If the financial influence figures are different, then these financial influence figures are torn, they are not given live from Excel, show Excel by showing Excel, your emotions are not able to be captured in Excel, you are not able to see it because once you get into the habit of being a driver, sitting behind in the car and driving.  And you are giving ₹ 15000 to the driver, who is almost a fan these days. I am telling you that the driver has an average salary, so that habit has become yours, then you have not driven again for 5 years, 10 years.  As for the car, your age was also increasing and then it is not going to run again, so you have to spend money for all these things. Many people will say that now you have no expenses today, tomorrow you will have today's expenses like school fees of different types of children. Tomorrow is up to the children, then the children's children, then your desires, then the man, then he is you, what do you actually do with the money, reverse engineering your desires so that now it has become so much that I have money, so I enough now  If I am talking about planning here, then planning is the planning of default setting, right now, you are doing more than what you will earn, this is not a planning, planning, how much do I wish for it and to what extent can I reduce it?  Don't keep other numbers in this message I hope these videos seem a little contrarian but do you agree with me from inside, your friend does not like to talk like this.  Views are coming, everyone is watching, is there any shortage of people that as long as you get another 2.5 crores, what will be the value of 2.5 crores because the things that are added get shaken, sometimes 12% provident.  You used to add 8090 rupees to the fund and check it now it has become 5% with further fall and it will become 4% with further fall and it is possible that it will be 4% in 4 years, so the planning will be successful. Planning is based on this.  On Same Mathematics This much I will take less This I will do Debt Mathematics Only Can Change This is what I am It can only change When you need money then share market is down Mutual fund is down Now you will read your units What can happen when  They say that share market people say don't time the market, don't time will have to be released, even then there is no time, no market, no brother, it works, sending both is not like that, tell the time of entry. Keep posting at any rate because everybody wants date CIP. Somehow all this is fine. I hope you have got a slightly different perspective from this video. Thank you."

    "title": "How Much Working Wife Should Contribute In Monthly Expenditure？ [Pmr_Sn07K2o].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, there is a sub topic in the topic of marriage where husband and wife both earn money that how much wife should contribute in D monthly expenditure is a very simple thing, there can be some template because many people will complain that wives are doing something.  Can there be any template by which it can be done that they should do this much because wives can also say that if there is 100% less in the house then In that also, how much is the husband doing, then that answer can also be thrown away, but in the matter of money, I always tell what I understand in my consultation, I try to tell people that I take your comment expenditure of 100 rupees.  It is okay, whatever be your ratio of salary, whether it is like this, whether it is heater, food, everything is being shared, then if you assume that your salary ratio is 2:1, then it is 2:1.  The ratio will be 66. If the husband is spending then the wife is spending 33. If the wife's income is only 20% of the husband's income then make the ratio of 1:5, then approximately the rest will be in our ratio, but we do not have to skin it. But yes, women should do it, it is a good thing and the rest is being done through your savings, do that also in the family.  For example, if you want to buy a house, you buy a house in your common name, then the meaning of spending is a very simple idea. There are a lot of fights and quarrels. There should be transparency in money. One more thing is that the money is spent here but the rest of the money also. Many times we will have to answer to each other, what happens is that the husband says, I earn, should I spend it somewhere, what is wrong with you, he will have to tell his wife where I am spending this money, in the same way, wife.  She should also be told that her money is being consumed, where she is giving gifts, how much gift she is giving, she should be making her fat by earning money and checking every month, updating the passbook, spying on Jagga, that is not a good thing for a relationship.  Specially, there should be a joint account of a joint expenditure in which as soon as the salary is received i.e. on the first day of the month or whenever it is received, it should be transferred to him in installments and those big expenses should be given to him accordingly and the same should be shared from there.  The one on the bridge should be given a team and the rest should have a little big heart. Here the men will have to have a big heart. It is right that brother, one should not keep track of fifty-four and eighty-eighths. Now, those wives who say that their mother-  She is giving money to her father, she is giving it later, it becomes very wrong, okay in the family, I probably don't know, I have made a video, if you guys want, I will make it, that you do n't have to give money to your parents, give it to the boy.  what to give to a girl if she  If needed, I will make a video, but today you are a man and a married couple, whether it is a boy or a girl, you should not be given any other gem by your parents because once you start doing this, there is no end and marriage will be rolled drums and  It can never be recovered. There are certain circumstances when you should give it after explaining it, after asking it, it is okay to do it with respect, not vice and definitely not for money in marriage secretly.  The right on knowledge is not on money, saying that the money which is our spouse's is 100% ours, you are married, you cannot say that if I have less money then it is all mine because I am less, where is that money going? In which head is it going, how much mutual fund and provident fund is going on? Life should know it 100% and where all the wife's money is being accounted for, she should know now someone.  Took the lipstick, took the nail polish, took only a little bit, do n't enter into the trouble in her chakkaron, we do n't want to declare that much and it should be done only by making it thick, who is called to make it thick, here also you will also be interviewed, also contributed by and D.  Ratio Me Si Will Contribute In De Household Loss Of You Want Is It Okay Or In The Household Sometimes I Did Sometimes You Did You Did Too Much Your Health Was Well Mine Was Well You Were  I was free, it was okay, don't marry him at once, friend, he is exactly like him, he is like a shop scale, don't think that today it is heavy, you have to calculate it by tomorrow and in the long term, the calculation will be done gradually in 6 months.  Well, do it sometime in 12, it will keep happening, but in general there should be a trend, it should never happen that otherwise, I will not even give ₹ 1 to women and then I will do all my work like this, according to me, it is not right to do so, okay? and then he goes ahead  There is a problem there is no point you know living on the institute and if you do something wrong then it goes like this and then that relationship no longer exists."

    "title": "How The Previous Generation Is Exploiting The Youth ？ ｜ Don't Make This Mistake [n2CJcaTlnhY].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, now the mistake which scenario citizens are doing with youngster next generation is that they are making a lot of mistakes. Elderly people may be your parents, may be your relatives, may be uncles, whoever is the senior of your family, it is very important to watch this video and till  See and reach out to them. If you yourself are a scenic citizen, then you comment and you are a youngster, this happens to you, if you identify, then you tell about the unique features of the society.  Bringing topics which directly impact your life and after listening they open your notes and give you clarity. That's what I have brought, please spread it. Youth is on this traveling channel clarity, but youth is on clarity, so it is okay. I am giving this war in clarity first of all because those who will speak, those who will blame, those who will understand will understand, you have to give this video to them, you have to give this video to every elder in your life and put it on your family channel. And you have to understand it well, what is happening to those who are in their 678, they are called elderly, it is okay after 60, now these people have retired, they had worked at some time, had reduced taxes, had saved money, they were middle class.  There is the audience, I am talking about the rich class who are sitting on money which is not even 0.5% and I am talking about the lower class who are poor people, okay so I am talking about a tabla with them.  If you try to identify then the problem is that this new generation does not value the time they have. If they do not have their own money then they give it to the next generation through sons and daughters. This generation knows how to pass all the money through you and wants to do so.  But what happens in that is that their money is lost, they want their time to reduce this and that, our ₹ 400 goes back. In that, if your child is working for ₹ 2000 an hour, it is worth 4000, he has to take leave. He will have to come from office, he will have to go early, it doesn't matter to you, he is doing his own economy, he is a small businessman, someone is doing his own business, he is definitely doing it and by mistake, one population is very young, above 18 years.  This 27-28 year old girl who has n't done much in the sense of being employed does n't seem to be working but people are being driven by unpaid drivers. Do you have any relative or a child like this? You called him son, take two laddus, take two laddus, drink a cup of tea, do something for him and two-three-four hours of his life, take me there, take me there, take me there, today he is going to come to them.  Take it like this, this is happening blindly and many parents are so stupid that they have given their children to their similar friends and relatives in the circle that they will take ours, I will take my uncle, I will take my ji.  Go  Take uncle ji, take uncle ji, whoever speaks like this in the relationship, aunty ji whoever, take them, yes, I want to show them to the big lions, I bring such things for you people and small towns.  It is also applicable in me that brother, Uber is Ola, if not Uber is Ola, then the taxi driver is if not the taxi driver, and in many cases, when children themselves try to give a driver or someone like this to get rid of their farts.  If there are, then the parents become very distant or the elders become very distant. Well, I want to show you that the value of time was not that much in your time, there was more laser activity or the system itself was such that without standing in the queue, there was no hassle.  Do something without eating, there were no shortage of things, so you think that it will still have to be like this, then it will be lost, how will we go, these days all are assistants, you go to a big hospital, you go to a good hospital, there are people to show you and understand. Online booking will be done on Zoom also tomorrow  Let's go where the doctor does not have such disease that your body has picked up from the story or you have taken OPD earlier with the doctor, how does he know about you, the file knows that brother, he has some issue of lux, okay so his medicine is going on.  So the secretary is asking something, does anyone have any issues, does anyone have shoes like this, as per your report, I have seen that now as if there is a heart, now by putting something like a fund in the heart, I will see that there is something wrong with the eighth, that one of yours. One will see the cholesterol report  You will see something like this, if you look at the results of whatever tests are done, then all these things are happening, but what is happening, many times the elderly do not have time to pass, what is there in the elderly these days, that is, there is no creativity and productivity. Now people will say, why are you against them like this? Hey brother, you cannot pass your time by hanging in the next population generation, you can pass your time in the park, do it, do pranayam, it is okay, if someone catches you, he must have some knowledge of coercion. Pass your time by doing this like this, you go to the bank again and again, print out the HD and how much is it, how much is my bank balance, how much is my bank balance, go to how many banks, which is not an extra, one day when this  The population will be settled in the next 10 years. I am telling you that there will be no physical banks. Not all banks will be there. All of them will go to Java. There will be no physical banks. There will be a place to keep the servers and banks will have bill hanging. 90% of them are engineers, they should be less.  will go  The elders have given less time to see if it can be done in some other way because the fear is that the bill will be out of 10, whatever comes to them, there will be eight which may be like that, it is definitely not from the next generation and two.  I definitely have the power to do so, if you fall into two, schedule it and do it as per the time and tell them that the other vices of the next generation have been set up and I can't even dream of this. I am a social observer and also a social reformer. like this one  Take a few words from the social scientist and say something in English which is telling the society that you are wasting a lot of time of the next ones and making their mother sour. Do you know how ill-mannered he is in addressing the elderly?  I have never eaten as much food as you have in your life. Your child eats in a week. You know how his job is hanging by a thread. Okay, and you are hanging on to him, then you will say, well, this daughter-in-law has a big mall.  it's great to roam  They go to our time, hey, going to the mall is their recreation, those who are mine, they have to breathe or watch a movie or live so that they can rub Jain till the next week, if they reduce it for a whole week, after that then the rest of the time. In all this stuff, you are looking at the swords and money back, if they spend their lives in it, then they will be destroyed. Mental Health of Youngster Security Faster. You are seeing the cases, how many.  The young are facing heart problems and all the other diseases. The elderly do not have such big issues right now because once their body becomes physically weak, they cannot run that much, cannot lift hymns, cannot run and so on.  Everything is just bat, nothing else, what do you have to do the whole day, you have to take a short walk, take a long breath, I am speaking only to those who are living comfortably, those who are getting pension, which is the source of income, it is not for poor people.  video which hd  If you are of interest to everyone and that is all, then brother, please spend a little of the twenty-four eighty-eighth rupees to cover the cost of the child who is providing you, the child who is providing you the solution so that you can proceed in the manner that I have made your appointment.  Have booked there many times and learn that also, you are in your 80s, it is not visible, the button is not pressed, the mind is not reduced, I am not speaking for them because people will go straight to trolling due to old age.  40 years old is a scenic citizen. 60 years to 100 years old. You turned 60 yesterday, it happened the day before yesterday. 40 years old, you will not cry for 40 years. You have raised a child for 5 years and 8 years. You studied for 10 years. He is doing well. You were there again 40 years ago. What child? Now you want to study with him 40 years. You will definitely need him one day. 65 Note it D. Next, you can press your button.  Learn to press, learn from your grandson or from your daughter-in-law or son, whenever you are free, how to do this, how to do this on Paytm Google, once you download it, let me tell you, okay, keep less money in that account so that your  It is okay to be Jamatrana and the whole thing, you teach us slowly like this and also take the war, if you want to see that our parents do not hang on you, then you will have to empower them because every time Dave is greedy and something.  That friend, this is mine, please recharge it, now what is less? Recharging the phone takes less than 5 seconds, it takes less than 10 seconds, but friend, you are doing something less, you are busy in something, elders have no idea, so do it.  Giving it now is just a matter of mental pressure for him and he will remember that you didn't do it, you didn't recharge mom, you didn't recharge dad, you forgot us and that will make him fat, do n't say anything about your head. You poor thing will be broken into pieces, you do n't know what all is going on, you are remembering the bus, you are remembering your wife, you are remembering the children's requests, you have to remember the programs, you have some desires of your own, then the small ones of your parents.  And then you don't speak, friend, that's all I told you, oh that English proverb is sunny, straw witch is a camel with its back, when my straw was the camel's baked camel, am I the only one, friend?  Understand what I have been trying to understand. Whatever I have been trying to understand for the elderly, you try to understand. You have to learn a lot of things in your 67 years so that you can do it for 10-20 years. Recharges have to be done every day and then throughout the year.  This one of mine will not do it in a year, it is not right, I will not give the money in one go, I will not give that much, this one of mine will change, there is plenty of time for you to reduce all this, go to the hospital and check your whole body.  It's fine, it's fine, it's time there too Sitting in the waiting room is considered a pass. It serves the purpose of such a sensor. People standing in line for medicines have made their own routine in old age and in this routine they think that the next generation will support them all the time. Oh brother, the wives are living the life, niece. You are yours, drink whatever coffee you want there, think of hospital as PVR cinema and keep your check silent, if you have so much compassion in it then this disease will be mine only, everyone will suffer, your next generation will be worse than you.  Diseases are real and you probably should give them as much as you can, so how are you doing now, they are diseases right now, they will take time to get cured, how can I give you all the sympathy, this is what is happening to me, I will have to be a little strong, mentally strong.  I am not used to being alone because I need someone's support 24 hours a day and then they say, I don't want to talk, I don't want to talk, if you are interested then I will definitely come. There is no point in your words, why don't the elders think like this? Hey, you also have it.  when baby  When he was young, he used to do M, so he was happy on the bed, baby and he used to go on time, then he used to be late, otherwise it was time, otherwise the city pressure cooker is running in the kitchen, the broom is being asked in the house, the husband who is the father.  If he was on a job, did you give full time to the children? You came unconditionally, he also used to do that. You want to hold the children in your hands, iPhone or any mobile or keyboard, you cannot tell that the time has not been spent with you. Can do four-five things first  Why don't you have time, you can't do that, if you do that, brother, you start getting judged as soon as you sit, why don't you do it like this, why don't you do it like that, why do you wake up late, why do you wake up early, why do you wake up early, on holidays.  Do it, you also do it by paying obeisance and see son, it will definitely get spoiled. Why do you spend 24 hours on knowledge? If this is the only knowledge I have in consultation with very elderly people, if you have this much knowledge then you can park your knowledge.  If you are restless then do consultation and see if anyone is ready to pay money for your knowledge. If so, then your knowledge is strong. When you give the knowledge dog to the world, the world will know your knowledge, will perform your aarti and will give you consultation, then your children will also come in line.  If the child is going to do anything, we tell him that he is going to buy a flat, this money will be wasted, he is starting a business, he will also be wasted here, he is going for a trip, he is buying a car, why are he buying it so expensive, why are he putting it there in the school, why here.

There is pain in my body, it is okay, there is pain in our bones, it is okay, the pain will be bandaged in the body, it is okay, so if your parents are in their sixties, they should take care of them comfortably and peacefully. Okay, but I believe.  60 There is no need to serve the parents of these 70s right now, one thing is definite, in the coming time, those 80s will also become 90s and till 8085, you will have to keep yourself mentally occupied. They have creative productive thinking and do not waste the time of others. Break your notes which are FDM, spend them and whatever is yours, we will leave it for you and go away. Yes, it finally breaks, similarly, there is a message for the elderly, be it money, wealth or property, it is Chhath Jati, it is okay, it is Chhath Jati, but you cannot go to the provision of after life. In after life, all the property here is in a draft or story in Bitcoin.  You can convert it and take it to the next life. He takes it and takes it away and then he is leaving behind saying, ' Son, see, it will be converted into 100 Bitcoins, I am leaving 20 and I am leaving with 80 for you, you also tell me.  Man, great because you have taken 100 Chhath, Chhath goes, Chhath goes, it is not necessary for anyone to become more of a hero. Hey, we have done so much, so you did it for someone, someone did it for someone.  Don't do anything, very first story, my ideal is very big and you will have children, you will become one day, the whole world speaks like this, you will know for whom, I am going to tell everyone, no person uses property and money for his children.  He works for himself, less for his social standing and so he used to work less so that the children don't say, 'Oh Buddha, why don't you do it? You have completed 60-70 years of life, you have done it just to show that this is my kingdom.  Here I am Raja Chholavan, okay, so you do all this for him, okay and the youngster should know this and he also has to do it and gradually you who are listening to me for 20-25-30 years, 35 years, this  You will also do the program at the age of 60-65. Today, your parents are making you big by doing this and showing you that there is nothing, every man is property because if property has to be given, then we will give it, then while we are still alive, both of us will tell later and then we will say friend, would n't we have lived?  Don't give because they live in big WhatsApp, don't give otherwise he won't ask anyway, now without asking anyway, there is no time, every time is the same do you have, you have told me the day before yesterday, he is not asking you because he is asking you.  He doesn't even like, does n't respect or like. Hey brother, he is not even taking care of his health. He is your son, daughter, he is under stress, he is being abused at the job, he is having a lot of issues, he is 8.  He is spending hours in the gym and is not giving you time, and by building such a body, he is not even becoming a model, then you can complain to him, do you spend so much time, you laugh, give us some too, you can journal his time, then look at his profile.  So see what she does, what she does, what is her schedule from Monday to Friday, what is her schedule from Saturday to Sunday, how is her life going on, she has to sleep for 168 days a week, if you spend eight hours a day with six people, then it is 60.  sleeping hours  Out of the 100 hours that are awake, one has to take bath, eat, wash, drink, do all the jobs, jobs, children. Now look at how many hours are actually there and tell them how many changes should be made in the schedule, but in doing that, the parents feel that they are taking care of their child.  We are begging from such a corner, we are not such helpless parents, it doesn't come like this, if I do n't come, if the mirror asks, then don't ask, oh brother, what are you YouTube facilitating? Me, you of some help, you are right, parents create situations in such a way where children stay with them, less work is done, a lot of things happen in communities and families, there is a lot of peace there, this is a big cry within the middle class, where  But your employed child is also doing a job, everyone earns their living there and in the community where there is such a system within it that people go and come back with less pay, it is better there because it looks the same, it is a relief.  There is drama all day long, son and daughter, and because of this, the situation has been created in such a way that it will appear that you are doing business, you are going, and you will have to talk about other vices for business. How much nonsense will you talk about, son and daughter? How are you about food?  Lia son, how are you and which class is Chhotu in and what is happening with Rohit, what happened with Neha, what happened with this, there will be a report, everyone is ok, everyone is ok, you are fine, we are fine, what should we talk about, what should we talk about?

    "title": "How To Deal With Anger  Of People Around You ？ [u6doe7ZGAjM].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, how to deal with the anger of others. Someone else's anger has something to do with the system, how do you deal with it? The other could be your spouse, could be a colleague, could be a friend, could be a parent, could be any person, could be a child.  Is it anyone close to you? It can be anyone. I will give you a practical tip. It will be very beneficial. Try it and see what mistake we make in this. Basically, I am going to tell you how to approach and understand it whenever.  When someone is angry, we are afraid of something and here we have to separate anger and that thing and what is that thing? Anger is an emotion. We should not be afraid of emotion. We are afraid of aggression that that emotion will come. Now that emotion will come. When the form will appear in physical life, when it will show in life, it will be aggression, there will be shouting, there may be scuffle, there may be some physical disturbance, that is aggression, we cannot separate these two things.  Today I told you that let's separate the anger and let it happen. We have to handle this thing. If we have to handle the aggression, then what is the normal reaction. Sometimes when there is anger, then two or three things happen, you see which of these.  C is the one who is being thrown at you. Suppose you are angry and you are his witness. One thing is that there is a counter part, it is a counter attack that he started shouting, why is he shouting, why is he shouting.  By doing like this you are telling her that you too had done the same thing, you too got messed up by doing this, you equalized or in one extreme you surrendered completely, you got scared, you took her nonsense completely and these people are dealing in between these patterns. Can there be a third approach? I am talking about that, so first of all, whenever a person gets angry, tell him this, calm down, calm down, this may not be the correct approach immediately. You have to validate his anger a little bit by saying that yes, this is yours, it is coming out, yes it is fine, I understand that it is coming out, but you have to create boundaries around yourself to stop his aggression, this is over a period of time to settle down in the relationship.  It will be done, whether it is later, three days or two days, sometimes on Saturday Sunday afternoon or sit separately with the boss, wife, spouse, husband, parents, whoever that person is.  That's why your anger was okay but the way you expressed it I'm not able to deal with it like this and in the future I don't want you doing these things with me other wise you have to have that other wise that I will  Not Listen The Conversation Will Not Take Place The Relationship Will Not Go This Is Not Happening  What is it, when you surrender, then the person doing anger gets to know that he has to surrender and then he will do the same things. The problem is, you see this, you tell me, what do you think about the awakening of any emotion inside someone?  The problem should be that some people are getting angry, some are getting love, some are getting hate, some are getting jealousy, they are affecting you physically in some form, which is aggression, only then you have an issue.  Have to deal with aggression, what do people do? The person is getting angry, does the person want to deny his emotions or not, this is nonsense, no, you should not be angry after seeing him, his life is worse, make his life better, it is not like this.  Do let whatever is coming out, do not become angry, do not dismiss its emotions, validate and do it calmly and do not lose yourself. If you lose yourself, on the contrary, you start yelling and screaming. He is angry and will be justified that he has become equal, he has done this, he will never introspect again that he has maintained his dignity, he has done this, now many people say to me, hey, we do this, we will get it done.  They have done this only once but they feel that they have done it 150 times and the next person always keeps climbing, so what to do, you have to create boundaries on his actions so that he does not stop them.  You will not be able to understand the boundaries. First of all, you have to make clear in your mind how much of whose nonsense you are ready to accept and what are those boundaries and those boundaries can be very harsh on someone, you can reduce the boundaries a little on someone who is very dear to you. You can do more for others, that will be your thing, but you have to think for yourself that how much can someone get away by saying what to you and what are your threshold limits?  This is at that moment when there is a fight, there is anger, there is shouting, then you cannot decide, as you heard this video, after listening to this, you took a deep breath, took something from the diary pen and after that you wrote and  Said that yes, this is a take away, I have to do it for the next time and I have to be detached, I have to delve into his situation and see why he is angry, what has happened, how much has happened to him, I do not have to justify it according to myself, if a person  The one who has more fear because anger goes with fear, too much anger spray company diseases, bitter frustration, its release is not bad, why is it getting triggered, why is the situation, it is happening because of stupidity, you can address those things. However, denying that emotion is not a correct thing. It is like saying that it is a natural body urge. You will have  To listen, I speak with a very beautiful example. If you fly a plane, it is okay, there are many warning lights in it. Now let's fly a plane, it will get complicated. If you drive a car only, if your fuel is less then MT is going to stop and it shows red. You can't say, ' Calm down, calm down.' He is showing you that you are not wearing a seat belt and he is saying something like 'You should wear a seat belt' or something like that.  If you are getting an indication then you cannot say this to him, sit quietly, he is telling you that it is good for you, in the same way, anger is coming inside you, this thing is applicable for you too, maybe you can give this knowledge to people.  This is how we deal through the video. If someone is feeling angry from within, then that emotion is an indication, as if it is fuel, as if it is an indication of anything else, that something is wrong with that thing.  If you have to deny someone, you have to address him, you have to tell yourself like if MT is coming for fuel then I will go and fill the oil, if my seat belt is coming then I will wear seat belt, some other issue of mine is coming, that means tires also.  Nowadays, air has also started coming in. If I see the indication of less air inside the vehicles, then I will fill the air. It is as simple as that, do n't be in denial about why the air has reduced, no, the air is not less, no, it is not so much, no.  He has gone to this extent, he just leaves the puncture, you do n't have to react like this, you don't have to react, if you are getting angry then you have to respond, first what is the problem, when your nature becomes like this then you will see relationships around you.  It will be very good Janali, people will come and learn, then he will be angry because an angry man is also an unheard man, a child is paying no attention to his words. You see, we used to separate children so much in childhood.  It is said that we feel heard only when he is very angry and she feels heard only when he is very angry, that he will be heard only when he is angry, no one will listen comfortably, sometimes what happens is that housewives start reacting like this with their husbands. Batmiji, that poor guy came from the office, spent the whole morning and evening earning money, listening to his boss, sitting in the traffic and then started coming, now he has issues, now you can't say that he  Your anger is wrong but the way she is expressing aggression is wrong, so next day on that Sunday and when Shanti's sea darling my darling wife, the way you approach your anger, the way you show aggression is not acceptable, I am like this in the morning and evening.  I have come this way, whatever issues you have are legitimate, we will address them but this is no way to show yourself like this.  It Will Not Be Tolerated For Ever This Is A Red Flag This Is This Has To Be Discussed And You Have To Know That Whenever There Are Issues Please Write Them In Your Diary What Are The Issues How Many Addresses Can There Be Do n't Get Tormented That You  Why am I half an hour late? Tell me, I have no girlfriend. In between, I had gone to have coffee with her. Okay, this body has become so misshapen after working.  I don't do exercise. It's okay that you too don't find me attractive. On the contrary, if you want to tell me this with love, then which other woman will give me that grass. On top of that, it means you are also getting angry from within. Do this and go to the office. Sit at home and take care of the maid and I will take care of this issue. I want to tell you with such love that these are boundaries, tell me it will not work, tell me next time you shout one I come back home that will.  Don't say, I will go, then in two-four-five days, see that you have to tell a consequence. After making your boundaries, you will have to tell the consequence of gradually bringing those boundaries with great love and that is a thrash hold.  It must be that countries also do similar things. At one time, if someone carried out a terrorist attack in India, he was not slapped. On the contrary, he did not know the tolerance level. Toler did not know that boundary, don't cross this, then when the good people started getting slapped, they sat down peacefully, countries also operate like this, relationships also operate like this, everything operates like this, you have to be assertive in it, don't make yourself rude.  It does n't have to be and it is clear that if someone is angry like it is coming in a pee then as soon as he wakes up pour cold water on him. Okay, I have heard, I have heard, yes, is it fair or yes, is it wrong, yes, wrong.  It happened with you, yes yes yes, I guess, let's see, yes, why is this coming to you, you don't have to bow down right away, but the boil is coming out, it could be a miss understanding, it could be a lack of complete clarity, it could be the foolishness of the upbringing.  If there are issues again and again like it is said that someone gets jealous after eating chilli or if someone eats too much chilli then everyone's tolerance level is different. If it is okay in life then I will tell it to every person with a very beautiful example. Come on, that will become a separate video, it will also have its own good topic, I will touch on it later, today I will end it here, tell me how did you guys like the video, take only one thing from it that is anger and aggression. Separate the behavior. The mess should be separate. Concentrate beyond whatever is happening and make a boundary wall around it. Leave the anger people. This behavior also starts only when anger is building and you are afraid of it.  You went and you thought it will result in something and you saw his anger and his feelingless is the same, don't prove it so soon, do n't do it at that time, slowly, discuss and analyze later, say at that time, yes, yes, it's late.  It went like this, it got messed up, okay okay, do it like this, hope this tip is a practical tip, you will be able to implement it and you have to separate this anger and aggression, do not run after anger, this is a  Emotion is a warning light, it will come, let it come inside you too, but do not do it in aggression, sometimes it should happen that you can comfortably make a face like this, I am getting very angry, friend, I am getting very angry, it is not visible anywhere. I am talking like this but it is coming from within, friend, I am very angry on this matter, I feel very bad, I am getting very angry from within but it is not visible to the next person. to the next man  It doesn't seem that the dozen mean that it is not coming, this has to be known to the next person too, then when we become like this, we will not express anger and then we will not need to show aggression again. We cannot be angry on a situation on some.  If someone is very angry with you then the next person will say like this, I am not feeling angry but we can change this definition, let us know that the athlete in our life is this person.  When he gets angry, he talks like this and his retorts can be like this. Ca n't we change ourselves? Is it necessary for us to shout Chillam Chilli and use Hath Vaath?

It is okay, I roam around a lot in Gurgaon, I also go to other cities but it is so corporate and not within that, in other cities Gurgaon is more in daily basis.  I am telling you my observation here, you can make yourself extra polite with whatever you wear, it is okay to change it, now it is said that whatever address you have to wear western dress, now dhoti.  You do n't go to office wearing a kurta, no one is even saying this, here I am going to suggest what time you are going, I will not talk about oil laced people's clothes, I will not talk about inflation, I will not even talk about brands, but I will say that friend means Steve.  Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg and all this, the world gives an example of anything being a pen and for that first you have to become it, you have to reach that level, this thing is there in our India also, now in our India also Guru ji.  Even if you don't wear anything, those people also look at you. They also know the world. If you don't wear any clothes on your body, if you say one piece of cloth, then you are not wearing anything. Actually, you know that the public is sitting in front of them too. They are listening to the toxins [Music] Job because. What is happening is that this is not ho because what happens like not tree you will be diplomatic I will be little beat blood and address rahte kithar ho kya rahte difference address to aap lekar  If you are not walking then when you come out and what you are wearing, it makes a difference. The second thing in this is how you look, the one who looks clean and beautiful has always had an advantage. Remember this in life if you Take the Man in Life Your Parents Are Not Beautiful The In Fact Late Say You Parents Are Next and You Are Next Today on D World Definition You Can Do Anything About It I Understand But You Can and Change D World  Language, when overall personality is seen, then the color discrimination in which we do is basically and all these things have only 40% weightage, 60% are not the things which I have mentioned, maybe you are giving 20 marks out of 40 i.e. you are bringing 50%.  Yes, but here in 60, you are sitting at 55, then overall you have a personality, you are 75, now there will be people who will say short or tall.  Brother, everything makes a difference, one does not say it, but it does make a difference, I do not discriminate, I do not, what happens with my and your opinion and what should be corrected, what happens with that, what to speak, carriage lot of importance and youngsters.  But no, my hair is done like this, I am going to the office because I am saying because I sit on a lot of panels, you are doing interviews all this time because the reason is if you are not very serious.  About Yourself What will you be serious about your work? I am ultra- groomed, whatever you can see, you can become. If you have definitely become such that you have such strong knowledge coming out of your mouth, then everyone will catch hold of it and that.  If you are at the level, then it doesn't matter. Now Ramdev ji, you know the two clothes and his standard, he and the world listens to him and everything else, but Ramdev ji, you are reducing his equipment.  It does n't matter to them, your level has become the same, so there is no problem, you are a politician, he is a non-politician, if he is roaming around wearing a shirt, then he is roaming around in the same shirt, by the way, keep it with you, it doesn't matter, are you above him?  Have got up but if you are a normal person who is working in your company and is doing less then all this is seen that I am that is why many people no on this I say that brother when you earn 60 thousand rupees  rupee phone  You can take the phone, it is visible in your hand, you can also wear some clothes like that, then you can iron the clothes, then you can wear shoes, then you can wear trousers like that, it is a thing of Rs. 60 or Rs. 1000 or so in your pocket.  She also went inside Shobha ji and bought it to show it off to the public. Take it, but take care of the things that appear to be complete. Take care of your little chance also. Take care of the other things too.  there is one  I went to the beauty salon, I also went to the beauty parlor concert, like I also look at other women, if a girl is doing hair for Rs 50,000 and another girl is doing it, there is a lot of difference between the two, there is a difference in personality.  It is very much, there are many jobs where there are personality based jobs, everywhere you find a genius, scientist, it is not based on technology software, brother, there is a lot of talent in this, many  There are too many jobs, 80% of the jobs are infected, it's all about how you look, it decides and in that, it's okay to look good as much as you have in your hands, now someone is smoking a cigarette in the mouth, the bad smell is coming from someone's mouth.  I did not tell you all this right here that brother, this is a mistake for you, it will just be an impression, then you will keep asking, what is happening to me by typing, what is happening to me, you should feel that it is not me in particular.  Stay completely in the brand, but one inch branded thing, people picked up the thing from the set, the same will be the thing picked up, the same will be the behavior with you in the long term, then your victory will be to keep the quantity and keep the variety again and again. Buy three shirts.  Buy one color from us, but brother, whenever it is a bit damaged or old, then give me the ball, quantity wise, now I see that many times people are like buying an object or doing something, sometimes they have to go and see, it is too much.  Closets, clothes, thousands of clothes and no one has come with such a personality. Hey brother, I am the one who has four clothes and keep them like this. Keep four or five clothes, but keep them in such a way that you feel something in them. It is okay for you to say this, it is not a big deal.  If you don't like it then people would have judged you personally, sometimes you wear something, I Guru ji, don't do it, it's okay, I am telling the youngsters, it's okay, once you reached that level also."

    "title": "How To Get Out Of Life's Messes？ Template That Will Take You From Chaos To Clarity [MTco7to6s5U].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, this is a very important topic for the youth. How to come out of mess in your life. Many issues come up in many consultations. Many people have been in some mess in life. Do you understand the English word that means you are stuck in a situation and come out of it?  This method can be whatever your situation may be, but I want to teach you this as a template which you can use in consultation if you want to help someone.  Or you can use it very well in your life, whenever you find yourself in a mess, emotional mess, financial mess, these are the types of mess, if some of the health mess is okay, there are five or six things in which, man, this is a ruinous situation. If you reach there then the first question that every other person asks before getting out is get me out or how do I get out? The first question you have to ask is how did I get stuck here, how did it become very easy.  To blame someone that this is because of this because this is what we do, the previous generation in our country has also done the same and children learn the same from parents, right things, good things and this is a wrong thing learned that brother, think about yourself. Before blaming someone, you have to do that higher order thinking, why did that man hit you, why did that woman hit you, why did that person hit you, why did you get fooled, what was it in you that someone used and misused you and went away saying something.  After listening to this, how do you keep friends, what kind of habit do you have, what food do you eat, why did you land up in that situation, you will have to write that if this is the situation, then what did I do, I used to waste a lot of money, let's say.  In Financial Mains, what did you spend money on? If you used to show off then why did you show off? Was it an emotional issue? To get into every mess, I want to tell you one thing, brothers and sisters, please pay attention.  Listen to all the youngsters who are listening, there is an emotional vacuum, you are getting fat, you are doing emotional eating, why are you doing this, parents fight, there were issues in childhood, there was trauma, analyze, only then you will be able to come out of that thing, just think that  Just like I have seen people in financial mess, I am in a mess, please help me, I mean, suppose someone is down 5 lakh 10 lakh, he is stuck in something.  He thinks that the way out of this is that he will give me 5 lakhs-10 lakhs brother, you will put it again, why are you a jerk, it is necessary to analyze it, we used to trade while playing future options, we used to trade on the job, the job was going well but the stock market.  Was there an emotional vacuum in trading? Was n't getting a promotion in the office? Wasn't getting recognition. Was trying to impress his peer group by making some side income with less knowledge. He wanted to impress his wife. Wanted to impress, wanted to become rich quickly youtube2 If not, then he also has to analyze whether his greed was for that thing or for some food item that took him there, today if he drives out the rat but he  If he is not able to understand the greed that was underlined, then after two hours he will be trapped in another trap again. Do you understand how beautifully I am trying to give you the template of why you are in that mess that you are?  Attract people and partners in relationships who let you down Do you engage in narcissistic behavior Do you have self-esteem issues Do you accept everyone too easily Did you neglect your childhood Are you a people pleaser Do you run away from conferences That everyone makes you feel like they have used you and you can't say anything to them, those are the underline principles.  We have to understand that if we want to ever come out of mess, you will have to do journaling, which means you will have to write down where and in life, what you are hearing from me now, who are listening to me, if you are not present in the mess, it may also happen. Maybe but once upon a time it had entered into life because when a person is in a mess then thinking becomes clouded, it is never very easy to think very rational but now those who are listening to me three three  There can be options in your life that you were ever in a mess in your life or are in a mess now or you will come forward then don't come forward that is one criterion, we will talk about it, this video will benefit you but you just analyze now that whenever in life  Were you in any kind of addiction, were those actions, were they reasoning, like I talk about addiction, why does a cigarette smoker smoke? Ask any cigarette seller, even if you don't smoke, I just smoke like this, no, just feel like it.  It's not like this, it's not like this, I try to leave it, it won't leave like this, there is an emotional vacuum which is filled by smoking cigarettes and it will not go away until something comes to replace it, that is why I tell you to attend the workshops.  What to do Attend webinars Do new learning How you spend your Saturday Sunday is going to be defined in a big way How your life is going to be in the future  This Navratri, if you can see it in the comment section, I am bringing some offers for you guys, discount on my What Ever Workshops and Webinars, which are paid, their price is very low, but beyond that too, you will get good experience.

You will have to put soil from somewhere to stand like this on the other side. We have heard that story of someone that a donkey was trapped, a fox was trapped, who said that put the soil and then come up, then pour the soil and come up.  Go Mitti So You Will Have To Fill Something Remember This Thing There Has To Be Something That Is Of Some Value So You People Around You Are Able To Fill Something In Your Life Fukrey Dost Wrong Habits Of Alcohol Cigarette Pawn Any Masturbation  This girl-boy affair will lead you into all these things.

    "title": "How To Get Rid Of Any Addiction ？ [WBWtgOSc_2k].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, if you understand the meaning of addiction, then how to get read from it, many parents remain worried, parents also think that these children are busy in mobile, someone tells, someone read the story, everyone is relieved of addiction.  If someone has addictions to alcohol, someone to cigarettes, someone to something else, then we will discuss a little about that, higher order thinking will definitely be required, the video will not be made immediately after listening, but you have so many centers and everything is open.  Us  This is to be understood. We have to understand this word. What is addiction? Addiction is a negative word. Adwise, if a son presses on his parents and rings the bell, then this one is addicted. Now see what a beautiful thing I understand. Many times.  Sometimes I write my poetry and I feel happy myself, what an example, understand that here also the second layer has moved to the third layer, the second order is the third order, if the son is disrespectful to his parents after drinking alcohol.  If a man talks to his wife and if the man is on his wife and raises both his hands, then the mother will not feel addicted, the mother will feel addicted, the mother will be addicted. Yes, it is okay, hey, you are not troubling her, he does not do this before marriage, Sari.  Even before it was like this, you are a donkey, but now you are understanding mother. First of all, if we do not understand this game of addiction, then how will we deal with any addiction, what is there in addiction, it is not benefiting the human being.  The one who is addicted or the one who is editing him is saying that he is not getting any benefit because you are taking drugs like Udta Punjab type of movies which are distributed and the chitties in it are reduced by this and that one, so how come there are all the songs in it, so he is  It is very easy to say that by doing edit addiction, no one is benefiting from it, it is okay and to fill the vacuum, something will come, like meaning story too, if some vacuum is created and you open it, then air will come and water will come.  Water is gone, it's okay, you are feeling very hungry from inside, so food will come. Do many people do emotional eating? Emotions are not getting fulfilled. Addiction of eating burgers and pizza is gone, obesity is coming, it is comforting.  Children are doing too much, children are not able to drink alcohol and cigarettes, but parents keep fighting, there is no emotional support, parents are divorced or they do not have emotional comfort, many people  If you do this, then first you have to understand that whoever is an addict in your life, whose predicament you want to remove, then why is he doing this? If you want to get rid of the children's phone, then why are the children calling because they have time, first of all children.  He always had time on the button. Whenever the child does something, the parent does not know. Like I, my relatives, acquaintances often say like this, there is a little girl, there is Neha, Neha don't do this, there is a relative who is saying to me, Neha Juju.  The date is in a little fear or there is a child Golu Mol sa Rohit don't do this tone do this so I am orange a little fear I said wait for 1 minute in different settings but you have been saying this for half an hour that don't do this which does don't  Do this, then he searches for this, then why don't you tell him that he himself does n't know what to do? Brother, you are sitting and chatting, even if you are drinking pakodas, people talk like adults about jobs. Entertainment talks about weddings, relationships, movies, whatever, asking about each other's well-being, asking about investment, talking about the big house, real estate, your level is good, good things are going on, that poor child is getting bored, what should he do after seeing the mobile?  I can pass the time by listening to songs, or he will break things, explore, or if you give him a drawing book, he is of some use, he will do something, he is a human child, how can he sit like this, exactly how can he sit like this?  We want everyone to sit like this and then we say, let's get up, go to school, become active, learn from there and then join us, then whoever is addicted to addiction, your children, who are older, are very addicted, they are addicted.  Look, addiction is there with the eyes, what is it, the source of date radiation and science is telling you that it has no benefit, only then it is addiction if you feel that it is getting any benefit, suppose it is the day after tomorrow.  Do they say that a child has been studying for 16 years yesterday, he has written a date, he is addicted, he feels very good in study, he is preparing for it, he will become one, what hard work he is working on, hey Rohit, take milk for you, son, I have coffee, son, I have sandwich.  So bring some gum laddu, son, he works very hard, take some almonds, he is reading, but you know that reading is going to be beneficial, your eyes are tearing, nothing is too much, but  If you know who is going to get some benefit, then you don't call him an addict. Same thing, if someone is recording a video and does not put it on YouTube and keeps saying 'Namaskar friends' the whole day in someone's house, then everyone will declare him a bawdi boost.  I do n't know if you will declare me crazy, friend, making your own videos is a relief, saying something is a relief, but if you post the same thing on YouTube and earn two paisa from there, and you get subscribed and 100 people like you.  Jan G Jain Then it is not an addiction, it is a file of some worth, books are useless for you to read, people study a lot, I have read this book, I have read that book, I did not earn money from it, but that is not an addiction, first define the addiction.  You may be confused by this video, but you have heard it again, what is there to say to understand it, if today you are not seeing any benefit from the thing, then it may be an addiction, maybe the child is watching the mobile, there is some good thing in the mobile.  I am looking at it, it is correct  What is he seeing, once he is watching TikTok, do Instagram, take out the screen from him, take out this, it is raining outside, what will he do, there is so much good information, he may be learning something good from the middle of YouTube from the middle of the video and  That book is the old knowledge of the old book, that story is not applicable in the market, there is no benefit to those who read it in the market, there is no benefit by getting more marks in the class, you are feeling as if it is addicted to mobile, please check.  parents  Please check yourself, what is it which is not providing any benefit, then you are addicted, there is only one simple rule with addiction, if there is any benefit from it, then you can note that you are ready for it, you can note.  Be Addicted To Yoga Nobody Says I'm Addicted To Yoga Because Yoga Has Benefits You Can Nobody Can Be Addicted To Walking Because Walking Has Health Benefits So Wherever Some  Addiction is there, you have to just replace it with something close to it which gives you any benefit from smoking cigarette. Talk to many people about smoking a cigarette and say, brother, what an addiction it is, you get pleasure from it, then you understand that you drink alcohol.  And it is okay to get intoxicated, although I did not drink that too, but you can ask people, is it okay even in tea there is intoxication, okay, there too, I feel like flying Punjab, I am having pain, if this is coming, then there is something or the other.  So  It gets to the brain, the cigarette people told me that they are reducing it, it is not a smoke, it is a little, a little bit, then the story is filled inside, what is filled, they cannot tell because there is no test for it, nor is there any intoxication in it that a lot.  It is not that they are getting too intoxicated, but just that their vacuum is filled from inside, so if we can fill that vacuum with something else good, it is very good, Ayurvedic tea and makhana khaki is fine or by eating something with figs.  or take a few grams  If it is winter time then Sukh PK and he used to come regularly, we can make it, so we can have Chhath, we will have to replace, what do people do, they try to leave it in isolation and then like this, I am relieved, their Hey you bill, have you replaced.  Whenever there is a craving for cigarette, one will have to do some activity at the time, one has to drink japa, one has to drink gram water, one has to leave the gap, one has to put something else in the mouth, something which does not cause that much harm, in which there are some tests, in which there is benefit to the body, then there is addiction.  To you have you replaced with something which is beneficial and which is not addicted listening tu sambadi if I talk very good things my button gives you relief if you watch a lot of my videos then you not addicted to me aaj long aaj i am adding  Some value in your life, if the conversation is at this level then brother, then you are not learning anything, then it is not an addiction, your relationship does not improve, your body does not improve.  Only the image does not improve, dopamine is felt in the mind every time, it has to keep increasing, first you saw so much, you got something from it, then next time you did not enjoy it anymore, now you need something else, the same alcohol and intoxication because their problem is called addiction.  Every time it will increase by two, so happiness has to be taken in those things, gym is sustainability and fun can be enjoyed only later. Now, in my button, the button gets happiness, there is happiness in the button, plus there is improvement in it, so if only on a daily basis. Also watch the video, people should give even 5 to 10 minutes of their life to the dog. You can give five hours of your month to the dog while walking which anyway was your time, waiting at the airport, going in the bus, waiting in the car.  If you are walking in someone's park, you have multi-tasked in it and you have also taken some knowledge and you have benefited from it, then it is not an addiction, so first of all understand the difference, what is the thing, it is not beneficial.  someone has an addiction  Adwise, just like the example given, the daughter-in-law also has the power of addiction, I am not benefiting your daughter-in-law, a boy lying at the feet of his parents is a relief and suppresses her, and if he does not give time to the daughter-in-law, then the daughter-in-law will suffer if she does not benefit from it.  It is true that the parents are never going to say this, the society is not going to say this, it is a good thing, and sometimes what happens is that the husband maintains a very good relationship with his wife, travels around, is newly married.  Parents say that you are a slave to your wife, you don't know how to speak English, you are so addicted to this wife, they say that you are a slave to your wife, so basically, in a way, addiction is there in the slave as well, because there is a slavery in addiction as well. All the cigarette people are slaves of cigarettes, filter the cigarettes from them and they will run away, whereas there are so many Gandhi photographs written on the cigarettes and everything else is written on them, this will be the condition of you even then, he is the father, the one who smokes is never the last one to drink. No  Other people who drink say that the photo was taken for this, it was taken for us, okay, so whenever you have to get rid of addiction in life, you will have to replace it with very valuable things, if not just one, then you will have to add something to eat, something to listen to.  You will have to put in the good things to watch too, you will have to put in the good ones, only then you will gradually get free and from that you should benefit from those things like Some people are genuinely addicted, you will say satsang, what can be done in satsang is great in satsang.  Many a times, there is no benefit. There is a lady who attends 2 hour satsang from 6 to 8 and her actual reason is that she should keep the daughter-in-law cooking so that she does not have to cook or she complains that I have come and see this fate.  And if I have to cook it and the husband waits for it, then the daughter-in-law is no less, who has taken the daughter's name and my wife has gone to the satsang, she will come only at 8:00 o'clock, only then will I get my bread, then its news value, if the man who has this feeling.  If she is a woman going to a satsang, then she is addicted. There is no benefit to her from just one satsang. If you understand in life, then many people are also addicted in this way. When someone is not getting any benefit, even a simple attack can be an addiction. This is the power.  It is quite late and there is a lot more to learn in it, I will try to teach it, it is okay for the members, you can take membership in the form of different workshops, you can like the channel and share because these are the  Higher order abstract things: Understanding abstract things takes a little effort in life, but when you understand them, then yours is actually yours. I can remove the addiction. There will be many such things for your children and it is you who must be identified. Why today?  What is there and what to replace it with and what is the benefit after replacing, there should be a record table like if this video is being made then there should be visibility in it that how many people will like it, please like me.  If I am speaking then like it and you will know how many comments there are, you will know how many views there are, if you come to know then you will know everything, you will know how much is the view duration, then when you go into tangible things, you will be told, 'Mere Ko, Are you'? Addicted date you make you video every give you go three channel you do so match this are you are addicted you it if I make me video and pat and on me laptop only there pade r Jain and his never ever kuch ho na to that It is not an addiction, it is okay to come and talk to yourself every day, but if it has any purpose, it is adding value to the life of the person doing it, then giving it to someone else's life is a good thing, then they say how hardworking they are.  No one says I am addicted to hard work No one says definition of addiction Will you like it Tell me how did you like it Thank you"

Somehow, take a loan from your family. Let me give you a new idea. Let's say I bought a house worth Rs 1 crore and I invested Rs 20 lakh from my savings. I took a loan of Rs 80 lakh. Now I am telling you a very big thing carefully and there are some technical things in it too. They can recheck with CA.  A  Disclaimer, whatever I am about to say, now I am afraid of losing my job, so I have to live somewhere, I have already paid 20 lakhs, so only the rent of 35000 is left, that is my  Even if I had lost my job, I had to give it. Yes, even if I had remained alive, I would have been okay. Now, can I take a loan of Rs. 20 lakhs from my parents, can I take a loan of Rs. 20 lakhs from my in-laws, brothers and sisters, and give them?  I can pay in the form of EE and get income tax rebate. It is authorized by law. You will have to pay. Okay, if you are paying interest to your father, then the government gives income tax rebate. Please check the disclaimer again, so I will inform the bank now.  My father is getting it at Rs. 6, I am giving it to the bank, so ca n't I do Mandwa at Rs. 7 with my father, my father is getting it at Rs. 6 only, I am supporting him.  From there it got reduced to one and a half, now tell me Nikhil Kamat ji, tell me, I have done the rental at 3, yes, now I say no, father, I am not even addressing the poor people, my audience is middle class, which is the house which is there?  Do n't sit with the FD, it's not theirs, the child's job will work, that child robbed me, this one took me away, he became like Raymond and so on, brother, if you don't have faith in your production factory then  If the bank is ready to give the bill, then what is the game to be played? How does the bank give the property? What does the bank say after getting the property mortgaged? Dad, take this paper to me, brother, get it in the name of mother, you are giving the money, mother.  Get someone's name entered in the registry and in Haryana, UP and other states too, you can chase it. Adding name to family member, removing it and giving it to each other is free of cost. Do n't pay for registry again. Lawyers can chase it. If I take a loan of Rs 20 lakh from my father then I have put the name of my father or mother, now that name has been put, brother, you have become the owner, after that we will say and we are also giving you interest, owner.  Even after this, if you bring your mother-in-law and father-in-law, then what if you have lost your job, what kind of disaster has come, it is in your father's name, but his money is not going anywhere, if you have lost your job, you will also get it.

    "title": "How To Recover Money Lent To Friends Or Relatives ？ [euQxoM9i4Hw].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, how to recover money lent to your friends and relatives, I am telling a very practical topic, many of you must have given money to your friends, youth gives a lot, even elders give to friends, friend, any relative has borrowed money, it is okay.  Those who say loan, have given a loan, some friend has taken it, many people are not able to recover from it, infact they are not able to understand how to recover, in fact they should not give at all.  There was a video of mine earlier also, if you haven't seen it, you can find it in the comment section, you can find it in the description, please give it, it is very important, it is very important, I will not repeat its content much, it is a great video, when the channel was new. That's why maybe you people have not seen it, it is a very good video, after this it is better to watch it because if you have given it now then it is very important not to give it after withdrawing the money, if you don't give it now then it is okay and this is the video.  -Whom you are affected by You should share this with those people, first of all, to withdraw the money, do not share it with only those to whom you have given it, otherwise you will say that you have learned this technique from Guruji and if you have to do it, then do it shamelessly. He will understand, okay, first of all, if you have given a lot of money, then tell him that brother, I have to build my house, I have to buy a house, I need my child to get married, depending on your situation, what is your urgent and How do you have to start that a friend will lend you something? Don't ask for a loan from him. If you have given Rs 100 to someone in letters, any quantity or lakhs of crores of Rs 00, then people will not listen to it, but if you have given it then you have a bigger figure than that.  You have to ask him to give it to me, meaning you not only give me yours but also give me yours and you give me that, you have to say it because what is the matter, many people find it convenient to keep their mutual funds in demat or FD.  They are sitting and playing with your money because they know that you will be ashamed to ask because you know that they know that you need them emotionally, friendship and kinship and they know that they have a good circle which makes them lend more. I have seen them take people's money and spend it. I have seen one common thing among them and you should also see - Never give money. Anyway, don't give it to anyone, but these are the people who have a lot of social circle and emotional support, they don't care.  It doesn't take two minutes  I will make friendship like this. If you are the only friend of your friend, suppose you also know that everyone knows, then the chances of him crying your money is less because he has shame somewhere or the other, only one friendship.  There are two friendships, these killers will make 50 places, first with you, then with that person, then with everyone else, then they rotate it like a credit card and it becomes working capital. Unless someone else lends to them, it will not be yours and such people think of themselves as great by using credit cards, that is the credit limit of 1 lakh 2 lakh 3 lakh, I have also put it here.  I gave it to him, I gave it to him, I gave it like this, Then I earned points, He earned it, He has the mind like Chacha Chaudhary, What is the reason for taking money from you? The very fact: Your money was taken from you, its basic reason.  These  No, your money is too much, no one ever has too much money, remember this, even Mukesh Ambani ji does not have much, why doesn't he have more and why did those who have given it seem to have more because they have  There was no agenda for my money, the money is lying in the bank, there is no agenda, anyone will come and ask for it, anyone will come and cry, within a minute even if you have arranged for an FD properly, you will be forced to break it, if anyone asks, then  Have  An Agenda of Your Own Money First of all if you move otherwise and secondly what is so convenient? Don't keep telling people that I earn so much because Chaudhary people die more and say that itna Chaudhary was getting cooked. Yours is such a great job.  You are doing it so hard, which relative should you ask for a loan, if not behind you, which relative are you? Yes, are you such a big sir, you are a top official, he is asking for two lakhs from you for that simple thing.  The reply is I am fully invested, I have taken shares of Asian Paints, they are going to grow, I am not going to break them, for you, you take a loan, very fact, those who ask for money, their credit is 6 zero, isn't it as per law, a big person should not be asking money.  When banks are flush with money they are ready to give Your CIBIL should be fine Your track record should be fine You should have the ability to return the money The bank is ready in two minutes 50 calls are received, take loan, take loan, then you are not taking it from them, that means the matter is wrong, somewhere they are asking you for it, without processing fee, without pre- payment penalty, higher interest interest rate, then it would be a sin to ask for interest rate and many people are not willing to pay interest.  When we make a promise, there is an attitude that when I am giving it at 8, then at 7, it is better to take it from your bank at 6 than getting it from a relative at 10. Many old people are losing their money in the matter of three-fourths and their next generation does not have so much dominance, go and play the shoes, they will say, he will say, 'Where did my son come from? The father had asked me, am I a government employee or should I go and break his head or not?  It is given by the Father and if something happens in the meantime then God will be spoiled because no one has come after drinking the nectar. You probably give less in your 70s than in 80. Till 70 your brain is functioning fine.  At the age of 60, it is normal that we give something, but if something happens to someone then the one who will go to the next generation, which one have you written and studied, he will say, Bhabhi ji, Namaste, no, no, you gave it in the bank, so it is in the bank.  So I had given consultation, not him, he had lent my money. How do you prove a banking transaction? Which judge means the person has given money to this person through banking.  Where is it written in the channels that the loan has to be returned, the money has been given, thank you, what was the need to give, it was for that thing, for so many years, they used to take money from me and the youngsters who borrow are the worst thing.  Bari, there is no friendship greater than this. No, there should be friendship in friendship. No, your friends are from the bank. Is there a shortage of banks? There is a shortage of credit cards. Give me mine, you give me today. These friends earned by lending are never of use.  I am telling you this  This is how friendship ends in a minute when you make money and what is there in it? Friendship is so called that it ends but a man is a fool in his own eyes and is very self-declared. When you are declared a fool in your own eyes then that is what hurts the most. This is the thing.  If someone puts a gun to your temple and rapes you, then what is your fault? You will go to the police and say, \" Brother, save me.\" Now you do n't blame yourself.  You will say, friend, what happened? A man robbed me, but when you rob me with your stupidity and you had the choice not to rob, then the man gets very upset and if one or two people fool you like this. So self esteem issues happen, after that what happens next? I don't feel like interacting socially, then it seems like every man I meet in life will rob me. As a result, you lose your  You are not able to invest, you are not able to establish social relations because on what basis you know, you know, you know, or you are now in recovery, till you see his life. Every man who has taken loan from many people, when you see his life every day.  You will make a meeting by calling and first tell her that I am not asking publicly right now, otherwise I will ask publicly too, till then you understand that the relationship is gone and she has gone to the nice city. Tell me brother, take my money.  After today, don't give it to me, not to me, and people have a habit of partying on the 1st, you tell them brother, listen, isn't it like this, you can give Rs. Tell him to give a thousand rupees. A man has taken lakhs of rupees from you and you ask him for a thousand rupees and he cannot even withdraw a thousand and give it to you. Tell him to write 99 remaining rupees in his diary. It is not his intention to understand that every man  Will he tell you to take him on a date?  Take five, take 10, take it next year, take it after two months, speak, listen, I have come like this, give 000, you will have to become a recovery brother and you will have to fall in your own eyes, for doing all this, my friend, see where I am with myself.  Stuck after spending Rs 00 on petrol, you will come back to recover Rs 000 but you will have to do this, say paytm2, you will have it, say balance has reduced from Rs 1 lakh, it was Rs 99 lakh.  800, he will understand that his son will have to pay it, then if he borrows from someone else, tell him to borrow from his father and whoever is this relative or friend, his parents or relative or wife to recover the money.  Or the spouse will have to say that the money is yours and give it to me. What is the point? We keep it very private that he will feel bad otherwise it will not come out. This is a man who took it from him. So tell his wife that it is your husband.  Oz it to me this much money and he should give bhaiya Muthoot finance by mortgaging it, these are the ones who wear it around the neck, when the matter comes to that level, I have seen people play this game of working capital of 10, 20, 30 lakhs.  And from this they earn Rs. 2.5 lakh as interest, which comes once every month for Hajj. This is when their intentions are not bad and they keep rotating and where  The intention has gone bad, the intention to kill the money has come, there is another story there and their story will always be that I do some business, some of my working capital is stuck, my money is going to come, this is going to happen to me, this is going to be my story, there will be stories.  Tell me brother, why don't you give me money in many other places, the one with return promise also gets trapped in that, my friend, he will give you at 8, he will give at 10, he will give at 12, he will give at 15, wherever there are banks, there are mutual funds.  There are stocks, put them there, all kinds of returns are available in the market, if you want more then put it in this one, you want less in this one, the rest cannot be given, the person who will give returns at 15, his business is not going to work because no business is earning that much money.  If it is a fact then show your agenda of money and then say return my money please share this message with everybody. If you have taken big money then tell me I don't think you are doing it, you will have to sell the asset, tell me that house or tell that flat or tell that plot or half the plot tell me that will have to be done say no no not like this you will not be able to do it tell me  Assets will have to be taxed in my name, now people will have to spend a lot of money of others in order to save their own. The world is shamelessly selfish, that is what I am trying to tell. The world is shamelessly selfish, I am telling you this. Thank you very much"

    "title": "How To Remove Unhappiness From Life ？ [lu_Lsdz4XzU].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, removing and happiness from life is a very good topic. If you are travelling, then identify these 5 symptoms with happiness. Not for today, but for two-three months. If you are traveling even three out of the 5 symptoms.  So you write in the comment area, you are on his side, I will tell you how to remove it, what to do, identify it, it is going to be a very good topic, see first the feeling, you are getting such a feeling.  The feeling is also coming and it is also true that it is not diminishing, everyone has their moments, some form had to be filled, the story had to be told, something had to be done, the feeling is not diminishing and this is not just today, it is going on for a month, two-three months.  There is a pattern going on, this is a pattern of 500. Do not see isolation on any one day. Whenever you are watching a video, you have to do an interception on that day. Make a two-line note of how your day is. what were my emotions  It doesn't matter what happened to you or what didn't happen, what were your emotions, it will help you, the second thing is that restlessness is coming, why is it coming, what is coming, you don't know, restless restless means like there is relief, shaking hands is relief, mobile bar.  -To remove it again and again, to see the rules again and again, again and again means story, there is no fox, pun, one restlessness, second simtem, third last, in two to three months, do you get insured 2 or 3 times or once or twice or thrice?  There is no such logic that the throat gets sore, there is no reason, the throat gets sore, sometimes there is some fever, sometimes something like this happens, this pattern goes without going to the insurance post, it means a lot, isn't it, it has gone viral in the house, the wife felt.  It is a different matter if the child is brought from outside but suddenly you find yourself insured when no one around you is getting insured. There is a season for studying insurance when the weather changes, around the time of October, sometime in December. A tribal note you know reading your patent insurance  The fourth thing is your gut, your intestine, your stomach being upset, not being clean in the morning, being gas type, having flatulence, having a bloated feeling, this is generally feeling hungry but not digesting the food, not being able to eat food, these are general gut issues, going to the bathroom twice, thrice, and so on. You understand that many people struggle with pet problems on such a constant basis that it seems normal to them that they experience these symptoms.  These are the symptoms and the last fifth one is the feeling of note doing, I am not doing much, I have to do something else, constant flower has not come to women, women have had it a lot, but sometimes even men have had it a lot, you have to make notes.  You have to impress your bus, you also have to watch your IPL, you also have to take your children for a tour, you have made big demanding programs. If five things are happening in your life, then first, how much of these five are happening right now? My request is.  You will create so much from my audience because I am working hard to create, how many out of five are you traveling, write down the genuine, do this pose, write the video in it, 135 which is five, three and four or  Only four and five. If you are traveling with three then the program is bad. There is definitely no presence of five. Out of these five, three patterns are visible. If you are seeing two then it is ok. One is fine.  It is always seen at one time or the other, there is no problem with it, there is no pattern to it, if it is three out of five or one or five, then you are one of those happiness ones and exist in a system, so if it is so, then what do you have to do? Listen from: First of all, what do you have to do? Whatever you do in life, you have to stop and observe. This is what is happening. What job have I got, which relationship am I in, who are the people around me. These are these eyes  Who is this? That [ __ ] comes and gives me exactly the Patta Khatu. Don't even talk about him. He is a negative man. He asks for help 24 hours. The paper owner is relieved. I don't get time to concentrate. Patta Cat.  That forceful party is a bullet relief on puti, similarly Patta Cat is a superficial person, you are observing this, then you will have to break the pattern of 5 to 10 days and go to the story, if this continues for one, two, three months.  I am doing it in some retweet center which has been opened by many people, I will not promote anyone, but where you have to wake up in the morning, where you do not use your mobile phone much, where you eat figs and things like this, it is okay.  It is okay for you to drink juice and eat fruits, take a break from carbohydrates, it is not possible to do all this at home because you will see all those people at home, you just know that you are available here.  The family knows that you are available, friend, by doing this, this is how you are doing, you are trying to remove it from the happiness ecosystem, but do it once, today it is better than relations, this one, you will have to take a break from 5.  Of 7 days, I am not talking of 3 days. There are many breaks of 3 days in which we do such and such on our own. When we meet for five days, you will have to take a minimum break of 3 days in which you can take a break on Saturday.  If you include Sunday then it can be a whole week, if you start from Monday and if you include the previous Saturday Sunday then it can be 9 days also, so going on Sunday before Monday is a relief, so this is your advice, you have to do it.  If you don't do it, then you will enter inside it. After entering, what will come next that then people will hold you and blame you, because of you, because of you, because of you, because of you, save them.  There are many more reasons why you have to observe that when a person falls down too much then he does not have that much energy because sleeping also takes energy and time, note this, no person can think like this, you will see whenever you think.  If you think about an hour, your energy goes out, you feel hungry, you feel like drinking tea or coffee, you may even get a headache, so think about it on effort, when you fall in the house and there is no other person, don't think of it. Have you seen the man next to you?  dude it's okay because  You tell me one thing, this feeling of not diminishing, this feeling will come inside you, it is not going to come in anyone else, can it be like a relative, if you don't sleep and it is on the face even if someone notices it, okay you tears in the eyes  You are crying because someone notices that the bill is less but the help is less and that is a matter of later, that is when the game has become very bad, I don't know what is the feeling right now, just nothing is happening, no one listens to me.  Whatever my jeans  Due to all these things, there is a feeling of constant restlessness, such a feeling that you are driving a car, you are getting irritation, why did it come forward, it must be of red light, it is found everywhere, why are you there?  What is he doing, he is seeing a pattern in you, you have to file a general loan, energy, go to the insurance post, and everything that is going on is very stressful, you know, as soon as a very stressful situation has come, a person's stomach.  Something good starts happening in me, in an extreme way, if you see that extreme from an event, then it becomes very immediate to you, something has happened to you, but it is not of a constant level but a constant stress, so then it is normal functioning at a small level.  If it happens, then it is a very big stomach, whether it is clean or not, it is a direct indicator of whether your life is one, if your program is not being clean and good and you are not getting the feeling that it is a good one today.  Brother, it's a mess, that's just dirty, that job is Gandhi, it's a mess in your relationship or you, give more to your Britain, give more to you, you can shoe, you don't know, you made your desires so big and now they are not being fulfilled, there is a railway line from everywhere. You are not able to do this, you have one reason for no-no, there are many reasons of your own, you give yes to many people, hey, you will come again, tell me for sure, tell me for sure, tell me, nothing is confirmed brother, it is confirmed after 10 days.  is getting it done So my mood will not be of today, but mother, if I have time, I will see you. Tell me like this, brother, that thing is important for you, it is not for me, for me my happiness is peace and quiet. Start saying, many people would like a lot of you, brother. Sir, if you take two minutes, it is also on YouTube and 500 people do it in a day and I cannot give only 2 minutes to each one, I respect you so much, I have seen all your videos, I like them everywhere, I comment, I do this. I can't give 2 minutes. 500 * 2000 is an hour of 60 minutes. But for him that's 2 minutes. For you it's 16 hours. Who has a dog and who doesn't have a dog. Now you can be extreme, how can I not ask for 2 minutes?  But the person who takes only half an hour of yours takes 2 minutes. Even the one who is asking for 2 minutes knows that if his time is precious then I will ask for only two, but those whose time is precious.  I don't think their people would take half an hour to a full hour because they don't count. Yes, I am coming, friend, I am coming there, let's go there, we have to see, you also come with me, never with anyone, if we  If you don't go with anyone then no one will come with us. If yes then don't call anyone. Why is it necessary to call someone because you don't have that much power, lack of knowledge, you can't take any decision without it. Confirmation is an important thing for slave people.  Life  To be happy in life and every time, you can say yes to your children also, you do n't know what will reduce you on Friday, I had promised my children Saturday Sunday, I had promised, then once I made a commitment, then his  After all, I don't listen to myself, it feels good to hear Salman Khan in the movie, Jab bolna hai ki yes, Pushpa tai, Salman Khan type in real life, it is not good, I am not of the opinion that my commitment should not be fulfilled.  I am of the opinion that you should not overcommit, by giving overcommitment you have brought a lot of sugar in life because if the wife says give me this much, the parents will say brother, sometimes you can do it tomorrow and it will be enough, sometimes you can do it for the weekend.  Some day, parents and children will say that by reducing the tax, by doing this, you can also have one or two programs of your own, he gets class A in all, then this whole feeling is a class because it  There is a simple solution to what is there in feeling, Fox on One and other things are not more than that, I do n't know how many videos of multi-tasking have been made by Englishmen, you also copy our very creative ones on YouTube, increase productivity, increase productivity and do your work like this. What is saying time in excel and I do date and I do date Do you have to do some journaling? Do you have to write something in your life? Write the price, when, what did you do, date, note it, how much is important. What did 9 to 11 do? It was productive. Ankur Barishen ji also has to learn it and he has got so many subscribers, he has devotion, so I follow him, but I want to ask only one thing from him, I have only one claim, I have subscribers who are connected to six. Brother, write since last eight months, have you been happy, have you become happy or less happy? I don't want to say whether the production has been more or not. It is clean and simple to make you happy and rich. If it is productive then it is for some other donkey. You have remained one, you are an ass and become a protective ass, which means there could have been so much society, now why are there more societies, why brother, if you have to write something in life before sleeping or during the day, then just write in three lines of emotions you.  Head per D de first mein or first June first July whatever is the date your date feeling low angry or feeling stomach feeling will tell your state when you are watching me video first you smile and now see the state of stomach  What is yours, that is your status, told that the status of the stomach becomes your status, they say that where does English come from, they are such that they are more and more productive, they do not get time to do all these programs, they are busy in increasing the productivity.  Time is being written, what did you do from 11 to 12, what did you do from 12, did this, did that, I did it like this, I did it like that, which book's seven habits are there by stealing the content of an Englishman's book and what are the seven habits of successful people, it also happens with alcohol.  If it is good then there is truth in it and after reading the book, you are reading the book, here also note the time, that is the time, let me read some names to out tomorrow, I am not criticizing them, but I am of whom, you are spreading the wrong disease.  There are so many followers spread and you take them in quantity that we have so many, he must be talking right, it is not so brother, many people can also talk very useless things, they lose followers because those followers are desperate, if they get some story then that.  The knowledge which will be discounted today is logical immediately if the video is my one challenge speaking, watch me other videos to judge yourself and after watching that video you will get so much immediate sense of clarity on the topic or immediate happiness or lightness three. Tell me the thing, if there is no flower then I have to comment area, she is immediately honey, I will tell you the traits of consultant and many more things in future, I will make different videos but this is a judgement.  Any video can confuse you 24 Head, you do this 22 Today, 17 Haj, you do this, 5s, you improve productivity, 21 Base, that makes you overweight, friend, which one should I do, which one should I do, get up on time in the morning, respect your parents too.  I should do it on time, even on Mondays, my stomach should be absolutely fine, it should also be like this, I should also do pranayama, I should also do exercise. Looking at the lives of these people, it seems like this, it is not so.  It is possible that all these programs cannot be done in one day, that day I have done this, I have done this, I have done this, I have done this and then this cannot happen, Monday will be like that, Saturday will be like that, the fitness test will be fine.  And if this was a priority today and you are enjoying doing this thing, then do the thing in which you are enjoying today, which is giving immediate happiness, which is not practical, very disciplined people would not have achieved anything in their life.  I will make that also and tell you that creativity is waking up at 10:00, if the mother of writing is doing it, then she is waking up at 10:00, the discipline for that is said, our worship for Sony at 9:00 is 4.  :Get up at 30 o'clock, there are many people, mother says, Son, you should wake up in the morning and study, do n't send it in the morning, I don't send anything, everyone who has to study, do whatever you want to do, you should sleep for 6 hours and 5 hours. Don't stick to the minimum directions, I make videos only about what not to be done, rest of me is about what has to be done, people will feel like this on this day, you tell me what to do because hey, what do you have to do in life, tell someone else what and what not.  What should be done is to tell that there is a mattress here, there is a mattress here, this road is fine, where should I go, where should I go, as far as your car goes, as far as your mother, no, but you do not know at what speed should I go, then who cares about me?  A dhaba will come, then tell me how should I go, then these people have taken control of your life, all the influencers, the book writers, i.e. Babo's have come and done like this, then we should do it like this and then we should do it like this.  Hey, how to respect mom and dad every day, friend, it's mom and dad, how should we talk daily, friend, what to do, I love you, what should I show now, I respect you a lot, I love you a lot, I haven't told my mom, it's necessary to tell.  Honey, what should I show through my actions? I hope you are the one understanding the thing and it is not as if I am talking about something bad, I am talking about giving happiness to the people, two pat yourself inside, you match pressure, tell me this, I am in every consultation.  Like I normally ask, which of these five is yours? Whoever comes to take the concentration, what three are the fifth? Yes Bharat is there among all five, Yes Bharat is there among all five, so today I am telling you for free that.  For its treatment, you will have to wait for 5 to 7 days and analyze who is doing it and how, and you will have to stop thinking about it, only then you will get the feeling that I have to [ __ ] only once, then I just have to do it.  You have to do only one thing, just do that, then you will not get such feeling, it is not decreasing, if it is not decreasing, then I will write 25 less people, then people will write that in the diary and then you will tick that, otherwise it will not be remembered otherwise someone else will remind you. never mind  Which even I could not remember, if no one else even reminded me, then it was of no value. Look, I am laughing because in actual life, I have released this knowledge, I have given real work to the world. You tell me yourself, friend, this is 25 years old.  Is it necessary to make a list? Will there be any bill late payment? ₹ 20 ₹ 50 ₹ 100 Fine. Dal has gone, Dal has gone. What is the need to leave life? It must be so efficient that it will remember or make a process.  That brother, son, daughter, these are just a few boxes of boxes, you outsource all the bills on time, isn't there a need to write everything yourself, outsource everything to the family, I have to tell the man who lives under so much stress, all the bills are you.  You only pay, you earn money and you also pay the bills, that wife sitting at home, the housewife, she can't even pay the bills. Women, some are less, some are not complicated these days, they do everything. Woman, money, I am working, account, my password is with you, OTP is generated here, you will be happy with your landline, brother, you will keep managing this whole day, no matter how many lists you make, it will never end as long as you keep making lists, computer.  Although perhaps its story was different, but the name of the girl reminded me of that list which is never going to be completed. You have written 50 less cats, then after writing 50, they get cut and then they get cut and then that community will not remain. No no, you don't give me a hack pack for everyone, all are useless things which are less, do your responsibilities, talk, you will band the doors of the night, you will do the doors of the morning, you will do this, you will do this, you will do everyone's responsibilities, put one person in the house.  I have seen many times that the husband is like a plate of gold, it becomes his head and everyone is proud of him, everyone else takes care of something else, otherwise these are children, so Sir, if you study, then what will you do after studying?  A job of Rs 3000 seems to be more than that.  Reduce it, Rakhi is of 18 years to 17 years to 22 years, she has to sit at home, no, she doesn't have children, I don't want there is any stress on her, stress comes in reducing the taxes of the house, this is Paytm on mobile.  There is minimal stress in doing this, outsourced fat will go away, otherwise you are doing it to earn money, you are trying hard to earn money, you also earn, then you will have to do it, whose wife does less, according to this, someone's red when is red when.  If the person coming to the house can reduce a little more, then keep all these things, otherwise coming happiness is a disease, first of all you should think that drinking them is a disease and it spreads and like every disease spreads, the insurance man has in it.  You will definitely not have to cling too much, you should stay with happy people. Now the problem is that there are happy people and if you are happy then those happy people will not call you near, then for that you will have to be happy first of all because what is the knowledge of a person, this happy man. She will call you when you are happy, then first be happy, whatever be the default setting, whatever it is, I am happy, now stay with it, positive happy, well, now your food and drink will continue, do not give entry to man and all those with unhappiness will spread disease to each other. Keep applying it, he will not cry, brother, the pain increases with the run of sorrow, it does not increase, it increases, so he took your sorrow, now he went to my India, I became light, then you made him lie down, what does he have?  If you are capable of sharing your sorrow, then you will read the money to the one who took it. Consultant and ditch. Okay, so we don't take sorrow, we take it in our hands. I have to learn that too. It is very important for him and brother, there is no need for his certificate if I have made you happy.  Under the given video, you opened your notes, which certificate is mine from my video, why is it necessary to give a certificate, when you are putting some medicine in someone's body, you are opening his body, you are giving it.  You are talking like a friend, you are just saying this, so if you understand the message, please share this video with people, it will increase happiness, share the video which increases happiness, you are happy in sharing the video.  There is trouble in this video. There is trouble in this video. No matter how true it is, keep that trouble to yourself and be a mosquito. I would have come to know after watching the video. Now Rakshabandhan is there in this."

    "title": "How To Solve Life Ka Question Paper ？ [jauUKK3rHuY].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, how to solve question paper of life is a very interesting topic, a little higher order thinking is going to happen and you will get to learn something, it may seem a little abstract but stay connected with what the poet wants to say. We have given many exams in childhood. You must have been given this in schools, there used to be some copying also, do you know what is Ya Tu Ka Tu Ka, Tu Ka is False, True, many people must have done it, if not Kari, then you must have done it or not.  If you had not got it done, you might have seen it happening. There are only three categories, so in everybody's consultation life, everyone has got a different question paper. It is not the same. My question of fourth is different, its true and false. If you have asked, yours is different, my false.  Mine is false, yours is true, it may be so and it may also be so that where the question is the same, the answer may be different, I am going to tell you this in a very beautiful way, people question me. Asking the same question, the answers may be different for two people. This is what I want to tell you. So stop trying to copy each other's paper. Stop trying to do that. This is what cheating is all about. This is what is not comparison. So, I am giving you my consultation.  I want to tell you an example, just like we do about a person's horoscope etc., although I will not elaborate on it, but I am telling it as an example, it is fine for him.  Sango is a simple astrology channel, if you have not subscribed to my channel and you enjoy learning everything, then go and subscribe, but I am just here from what I am trying to do. There is a communication through which a person came and was told that my friend is yours.  There will be little in marital life, you need to work and marital life is not there, so now this guy says, Hey Sir, leave it Guruji, I will handle the marriage problems, I am fine as it is.  If you have a job, tell me how will it be? Promotion in the job, job, talk about the job, this was one person, same work, another man was sitting with me, some other day he came, she will tell him the same thing because it was something like this that your marriage will remain but your job will remain.  Will he be good in a job? If he is good at a job, then what is the use of a bad job? Yes, Guruji, he is better off coming to the house, if marriage is not right, then what is the taste in life? If this man is not told that marriage is right, then he is not good for the job.  Behind him he is saying, check me and tell me about his job. It is being told that it is fine, I will fix it in your profession, but if you want to fix it in marriage, then now is marriage more important in life or is job more important? You tell me, your answer will be again.  Depend on what you give prominence to ts Why I am saying that everyone has come with their own question paper, now no one comes and speaks, marriage is everything Everyone should leave everything, this should be done or family life is everything, no one should say no, work is everything, so this is what I try to say and tell you people with a simple example that in life  All the question papers are carried separately, you can also see it like this, I will tell you under the second example, like you are driving a car, you are driving on the highway, which car are you driving, your Alto is the Bugle.  A big Land Rover passed you fast. When that Land Rover passed fast, do you look like this? Oh Land Rover passed me, it left me behind. I will make you leave it behind. If you feel like it or if any of your children say so.  Or your wife or girlfriend says or you get some such feeling, you will realize that this is my Alto, this is a car of around 800 cc, I do n't know, this is 3000 cc, it is so big, it is like this, my car is open here.  Even if I press the accelerator completely, there is no safety, I have one star, two, how many star ratings, then you don't get into trouble because you realize what you are, but over a period of time, you realize that this is not fun.  Coming to this, after working hard, you graduate to Desire, I am telling you the example of the car, then gradually you move to Creta, if life supports you, you can also reach here.  Then at any given point of time you are aware what car you are driving and what is its capacity. We have to think about our soul and body in our life and think about the capabilities. Here too, someone is walking on foot, in life someone is going on a scooter, someone is going on a motorcycle, you have a car, you are between summers, so this is your life, you cannot be sad about these things that  How will he get it in the car? Why am I not getting it? When will I get it? I never get it. My luck is bad. This is how you can't approach everyone like that. Then again the talk will go on to astrology and horoscope. Every buddy has a little. Bit destiny also, not everything is free will, you have your own scope. By working hard, even the child of the poorest of the poor can become the child of a tea seller. You know what else can be made, that is the potential, but what about all the tea sellers?  Whether you will become a child or not is also a probability, so it is very important to realize that the genuine game of life runs according to probability only and be alive to the situation. Yes you can be extremely positive but we cannot do that.  Last time, if a tea seller had become a child, then a bud seller can also become one. Yes, there is democracy in the country, there is freedom for all, anyone can become something, but just because of one, one has become one.  So you also belong to the same category and it will become yours too. It is not necessary that this is the message. How did you like the video? Please tell me, share it. There are some things about my courses which I would like to tell you - Happiness Course One and Happiness Course Two, you can take them in the comment section.  You will get it through the link or you can also take membership of the channel. I am getting a lot of clarity. People are getting very good feedback, so now I have started speaking a little, first that.  It was going on like Ayushmann Khurrana's movie, no one was making it famous but now I am slowly telling about it because it is very important to have clarity in these things of life and so that in our life like I am making a video if you want.  If comparison is your belief system as to whether comparison should be done then first write yes and no, yes comparison should be done or no no comparison should not be done then beyond that I will tell you all very well on this thing also.  I am going to give clarity that comparison should not be done and whatever is associated with it. Inside the comment section, you will find a Subscriber Info Webinar Group, where further details of the workshops are available, you can also join. Thank you very much."

I am telling you that I have started a job, you saw that I told about being a doctor, before that I told about UPSC, okay, you must have seen that many people have come and do not agree with me, I will have subscribers, many people have said that the doctor is a doctor, the doctor is so much.  I liked it, I liked it very much, Doctor Sir, if you tell me anything about any profession, whether it is for the youth or the person training them, what is demotivation and motivation? I have never said that I am motivation. I am going to demotivate, I am going to give clarity by telling you that the cook did not prepare the food by washing his hands and this is the proof, so I am demotivating you that the food should not be eaten, you see what to do, you understand this thing, what I have done in UPSC.  Have you demotivated in it or have I motivated you in the doctor? I said this could be possible, now why did people write something in it, hey so what, what did you do next, I am going to tell you, listen to 1 crore in 6 months.

    "title": "How You Can Live A Fulfilling Life Despite Being Mediocre ？ [vYBTJBh2HNE].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, I want to give a very good clarity and stay connected with some of my video titles and it can be said that it is a little contrary but practical, people are loving the content, they are identifying it, today's topic will be ho you can one  How can you achieve big success in life by doing big videos? By doing big videos, now here I am talking about success: Mark Zuckerber, your Elon Musk is beautiful behind and all this, don't talk about their level.  As for your own camp, friends circle of relatives, love, parents, talking at their level, people are very much after excellence because excellence is promoted and if I tell you this then people will think, oh what is this, then I will tell you.  I am trying to tell you that the meaning of doing this video is that you should understand that if there are a hundred things in life then if you are below 60 then you have become a very blue average and if you are above 90 then you are  We are going towards excellence and people want to go towards 100, so I am telling you that you have to be closer to 75. If the level of video tax is put then the talk of 75 will not give you glory. Because excellence gives glory but 75 if you are among the 7 8 things in life which lead to a fulfilling life and happy life and which one shoots in your life then give you the wing big you are waiting for people happened  Working at 100 and 95, I will explain this a little. In your life, you have education, job, marriage, children, relationship, bus, investment, money, your own health, you have your own desires, now call that aspiration in English and by adding your own values, I will tell you.  There are eight to ten things which are called hobby joining and if you go towards this 7580 in everything, then your life will become very prosperous.  People will be feeling that most of the people who are going above 90 in their career, their merit is travelling, family life is travelling, then if you are going towards divorce, then divorce is when I do n't always like to say divorce, I like divorce because. Divorce is equivalent to doing it, it has been studied extensively, it has health effects and if you have got the feeling of doing it, then if you do such situations in life and here  If you have climbed to the highest peak then it means nothing. I am not talking about anything extreme here. Here I am not talking about Virat Kohli and your Shahrukh Khan and those people whom I mentioned earlier because what is the point of a youngster in debating.  They will enter and go there. If it is not so, then who knows whether APJ Kalam would have been able to become there, brother. This channel is not for them, it is not for them, it is for those who are the reality, Musaddilal is the middle class of ours, who lives like the world's.  doing  Today I am telling you about her, she was a family mother, like a common mother, RK Laxman, who is a famous cartoonist, okay, I want to create a family mother image like her, I want to show that she is not a loser, that is how this country is run.  You will find different experts, scientists who have awakened consciousness, discretion, intelligence, rockets, ministers of this and that, you will get different rods and you will also find different people from above, you know how that is fine, that is all but  This is the society where the average man is running with his family mother, for whom there is a head system, because if the net of the same family is not the same, then how can he move forward, he should reduce his mental health, keep moral low and do not burn the story of himself.  This very very important thing, many people hold on to one thing and burn it. Some boys, at the age of 22, 23, 24, become crazy about the girl and give 100% in the relationship.  I have made it to zero. Hey brother, 75 80% is two. In 75 80%, mother is giving me respect. If it is fine, then brother is fine. Don't be above her. It is not directly related to us. If you want to take care of your health, then just give your body 8 hours.  You are spending 4 hours in the gym, you are walking for 2 hours, you are doing something and on the contrary, you are taking supplements and they are taking protein, you are drinking sheikh, do this tent, health is this.  Very important, don't give 100, health should also remain till 80. Which car will run for 4 hours of maintenance and maintenance will be for 6 hours? Do n't give even that much time to health because if you give so much time here, then it will go to other places too.  You should know that time and energy in your life is limited and it is necessary to give everywhere and if you are not giving everywhere then what will happen is that people will suck you. I am on life balance which is a concept.  I will make an excellent video on the concept of fraud which is taught. If you want a video on people's lives, then write 'Like' in between because I remember the same content and I have it, so I will make it, but I will talk about it now.  I will do it, it will cause confusion, okay, don't think of it as life balance, what I am telling you is something different, it is deliberate which you can do but you are rocking yourself till 80 only, you can do it. 1995 Yes you can but you are not going because you have to do that every day in the job, today you have done very well in the quarter then what will happen in the next quarter because the cotton quarter performance will be good, the year has been good, the pressure is on, the agreement felt good then  That has become your base, next year you will have to give more blood, only then you will get freedom, no more blood is given because everything has a limit, make 100 in one match, make 150, then if you do not make it in the next one, you will be out.  Don't do it, those who are bun out then they sit on their eyes, now investment is in investment, 24 hour lion market moneycontrol scanner skinner.in Veriku ji's excel Akshay beginning all the videos of sir ji and that sher and ro sher ro sher  Arabi, how much money are you sitting with, how many buttons are you going to press every day? Have you bought it? Now it is flooding, have you shipped it? What will happen after seeing it again and again? You will see your weight every day, so much less on Wings game.  Weight will be lost either by exercising or by eating less, so we have to pay attention to it, but do not go above that 75 80 75 80 because the one who is addicted to investment is the one who is addicted to exercise.  You are doing exercise, which has been flattered by the bus because story or story, you get a comfort level in doing something, story gives you comfort level.  You have to rock yourself, you don't let your body and soul die beyond 80. You have to see that if it is something good happening then it is happening at someone's cost, which I am not releasing today. Hey, achieve that position.  What will you do if not only your wife doesn't give any time, you do n't even give time to your children, and the same person who was getting so much success and was getting so much fruit from it, is not his own, but now you are taking him for this success.  You will get dry fruits, hey brother  Not only this, what are the many other things that happen in life? Times are specific. It must have been done on time, otherwise it has no meaning further. Later, it has no meaning. We do not live life in such a way that it will happen.  This will happen, I will reach there, I will become like this, I will do that, by then those people would have become left and right on their own, so you have to live very consciously, first of all, yourself because the journey is yours, your part is here, life is a marathon, it is a sprint.  I am not going to do this, this is a constant and you should also see the story, in any field of life, be it your career, be it your relationship, be it investment, be it any other wish of yours, you are good today, recent performance, you have just fought with your wife.  If I am talking to my husband in a gender neutral manner or if my wife talks to her husband in a gender neutral manner, then if he is not going to remember what good he did 5 years ago or what he did good 3 years ago, then your future means your health is fine.  What have you done recently? You used to go to the gym in general, but in the last 10 days you did not take care of your health, did not walk or take any rest, did not get enough sleep or did not eat properly and those 10  Just spend one minute of the day and he will thank you. What were you doing? Never cross date, 80% line and make it date. Red flag and red line on that meaning, go like that talk-nine like.  If you ever fly that plane, then the stall warning light is a caste, if it is not there then it tells you that it is okay on the approach. The planes you fly sometimes will know it, okay, that warning should come late, any of your systems are getting damaged, complete flash like this.  What should I do, what happened, how did I reduce so much fear, the bus did not even give me the last Saturday Sunday, this Saturday Sunday, tell me, I am insured, I am Monday Tuesday, you are packed right there, that is, the settings which are there.  So, do not walk on the one with full total, no ship, no vehicle, nor any human being, sometimes you definitely have to step on it, but to get it out of the situation to save your life, when you have to do Mr. Approach procedure or  If a plane has to be taken up some height, then you have to apply force to take it up, but that is not the full time, it can fly in the setting, no ship can fly without any power to move a car, no horse can run, and no donkey can ride.  If possible, rely on settings Do it and what is this 80 of yours? It is up to you to judge from your hits and trials that what is your 100 which is the breakdown level of relief. At 90 the fuse of the brain starts blowing and it hurts. At 85 you are the world. You are comfortable in a team.  If it is 75 then it will make you discover yourself. Every man will be very careful about defending on what is his capacity. What are the thresholds in many things? Take the mother from home, you have to bring vegetables. Market smuggler I don't like to start here U bill hits thresholdly it is possible 95 is taking I want to stay at 75 Discuss this video with your wife and with your wife identify your 75 John they call the ship manual envelope  If the speed is less than that then it will stall. Cannot fly above this height. Above this load e.g.  Not every one has a manual envelope which has a moving power inside it and if you cross it then that thing will fail. Any system has a threshold so identify and be added once you can 75 80  75 80 7580 Bill One Big Your Money Bill Be Good You're Relationship Your Mood Bill Be Good Your Health Bill Be Good You Would Be Living N Fool Feeling Life will have to be worked on  This video may sound a little abstract because yours has been brought from Khan, which 80 is 80, which is 100, so my channel is higher order thinkers on this, only then 10 lakh subscribers, 20 lakh are not 4 crores like Kariman, crores of people cannot understand.  It's not my channel, I want to understand, I want as many of you intelligent people as possible to understand who are not able to understand the whole thing.

    "title": "How Young Indian Men Should Select Their Wives ？ [AuRM_FP8DZ0].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, this is a very, very relevant topic for the youth, no one can make it better than me, I am the number one clarity on this marriage thing, I am a marital consultant, I see problems in many marriages and remove the problems, I have a lot of experience and I am very fond of this. I am a big topper Guruji, I am a student, I will not say, okay, so I am telling you, listen today, you must have seen the topic of whom to marry, so here I will tell you as per some boys.  I will make it according to girls too. But more and less according to girls. This advice is applicable for them also, so it is a bit general neutral but I will focus more on boys. Why was there a need to make this video because because these are bachelors.  Na, he is sharing the most knowledge on marriage today. He himself has not married, she is a storyteller girl, her videos are going very viral, think big before getting married, see 50-60 years before you get married to that person.  If you want to live in the same room with someone, then by doing like this, it will give you such confusion, child, whoever is listening, listen to me, India's number one Guruji on the subject is going to tell you what is happening and is going to tell you genuine. And no one will tell you better than me. If you enjoy it then listen to it and I will also tell you the practical tip and I will also tell you a little less practical tip. It is Acharya Prashant ji who says that marry the one who will give you somewhere higher. Takes you to some position, means you have strength, just give it like this, don't do it for the sake of happiness, take you a little like this, there is a hole in it too that this one is here, this one is here, this one will take this one here because someone will take someone else.  If he goes, he should be on top then half of the story will be true, he married her and he took her here, then that situation will be true but then he should marry again because he came here, now he is not her.  can take  Because it was brother himself who was here or madam was here, so now where does this complete knowledge go? So when the theory is shared then it should be completely practical, it cannot be left in half. You are good to hear because this is the problem of those who get married. No, now like us, he has been a bachelor as well as married. We have seen things from both sides. The one who has seen one side will tell the story of what to do to get married. I want to tell you two things, I will not tell much more.  They will tell you the first thing, if this happens, first thing, if this happens, then stick with this and if it doesn't, then go for the second one. Here comes the best advice for all the boys out there who are already big and unhappy.  Live or many people like these have created that this is how it happens, this is how it happens, look, if you are a boy to get married, then DDLJ's song was Shahrukh ji ne this wala ki tujhe dekha to yeh jaana sanam this wala.  there is a song  No, love is crazy, now where does it go from here, I don't know how to sing, nor do I know the lyrics, but the emotions are complete, it's okay and only emotions work in life, it's okay, so this is the kind of feeling that the world has to have a personality of its own.  If you see this thing with someone, then go to him and tell him that you have seen it and then you will have to show yourself, I have something or the other, that love alone is not enough, you can also feed me bread.  I will have a roof and this too, that work will have to be done, but marry on the basis of love, you don't know anything and you do n't know yourself, how come you are there after 5 years, whose guarantee will you take for 60 years, are you looking for an idol to meet?  The world itself changes in 15-20 years, it changes in 5 years, it changes in 10 years, the outside world is changing, you yourself are changing, your parents are changing, the person you marry will change, so on whose basis should you marry here?  So the target is also moving, the shooter is also moving and that is the platform, he is moving everything, it is okay to do it like this, this is such a thing is going on which is like that fighter plane is like a dog fight.  Don't do it like this, shoot each other on the ground, or look at what is happening in the air, it is being played in three dimensions, this is even more difficult than that, so on whose basis should you marry, you will not know yours after a year.  How come you don't know how much of a beast you are from within or whether you are good or bad, you are 25-27 years old, you have not seen life yourself, you do not know how your mother is because till now you have considered her as a mother. You see, as a mother-in-law, you have not even seen how your wife's mother-in-law will be. You don't know anything, so first of all there should be love for the leap of faith. If this love happens, then love is also blind and love can bear a lot, a lot.  There is great power in love, it can withstand. Marriages are based on love. If the first thing, as I am telling you, turns out to be lovely, then it is very good. Even if it doesn't happen, I have the second one as well. Okay, so, it is on the basis of love. If you get married then take a leap of faith. Take a leap of faith. There is no right thing in marriage. Marriage has to be proved right every day. After getting married, you have to work at it like breakfast, lunch, dinner. No one can help you.  A 60 year old cannot arrange for food. No matter how much money you have for that food, you will have to fit the jugaad, who will make it, I will make it, where will it come from, there must be some system in Mukesh Ambani ji's house also, no, who will make it, where will it come from? What will be the menu, what will be there today, what do you feel like eating today, who will prepare it, then you will have to make that effort. You may become whatever you want and even if you belong to a normal family, you have to make efforts for everything, then marriage is the case.  I will have to make efforts. These people think that it will be done automatically, that I just bring something to the girl, that my job, mom, everyone becomes happy, I get promoted, she takes care of everything, it is not like that, you have to give something, you have to take something.  Should be focusing more on what you will bring in to the marriage table What will you put then that was one The second thing is both can be followed If both are done then it is very good and put the second one first  After filtering, apply the first one or has it passed the filter, now that I have seen you, I have to do it, it is not necessary that I see you first, because it is possible that I have seen you first and if it gets messed up in the filter, then it is a mess.  It becomes the main thing that boys have to look for in a girl, it should not be problematic, what is problematic is that if you are in a family which travels in buses, trains, metro, then do not buy a girl who has problem in walking because  You  So just when I saw you, I went away. Now she is from a rich family, she saw the potential in you. Okay, now that thinking or love has happened. Even if love is blind, she will still have problems. If you don't know how to cook, she also doesn't know how.  Then how will it work, you should see that there are roughly five-six things, food, sex and outings, not how much socializing you will do, you will not be happy meeting a lot of relatives because you also have a job, a lot.  friend not friend  If you are a little introverted or a little extremely extrovert girl, that means she will be problematic, so first of all you have to look at yourself and you have to see what are the issues that can be there in your life which can create problems or vice versa.  It is also possible that you are very extroverted, if you meet friends then you will come across as extremely introverted, then if there is a problem, then problematic is you anyway. That girl will be very good. Who are we to call someone's daughter problematic? Brothers and sisters, no human being is problematic. Every human being has an individuality, a personality, a way of living and a thinking. Okay, so here is a girl like me. Do an excellent workshop on marital consultation. You can purchase it in the comment section. There are 30 questions you should ask before marriage. The fee is as much as a pizza, brother. 60 70.  It costs 80 lakhs for a wedding. It's okay. If you make it very cheap and durable, it will cost you 203 lakhs. Someone please give me a set of 10 tola. These days, the middle class keeps it in big pairs. Okay brother of gold, look at that. 89 10 lakhs.  When it comes to marriage, then add up all the expenses. I am not talking about the food expenses of the wedding. From A to Z cards to sweets and clothes, all the functions that happen are spending so much.  I am talking about the middle class which is my audience. Okay, there are a lot of expenses being incurred even in poor families. Okay, so you will get complete clarity on this thing. You must buy it 100% from that workshop. It is highly recommended.  So if you buy 100%, you will become a consultant, it is not necessary that if it is not yours, then you have to see, the one who has it will do reverse engineering or had he asked this question earlier, it would have happened to you.  As a boy, two things have to be seen, okay, first of all, there should be some bell ringing from within, friend, all these relationships cannot be done like this, that I have so much package of his, by doing this in such a package, the hearts have relationships, at least some bell should be ringing somewhere.  I am telling a little bit to the boys that the girls do it at a different level, so I cannot do the same, meaning girls can also follow this if they want, but brother, they have to see something else too, so for them separately, if the girls are listening to me.  Are  Because of the audience, how much of it is boy and girl, I don't know exactly yet. If girls want me to make a specific one for you too, then a little bit will be different for you, a little bit will be different, love will still be there, at least once you see it, you should feel that  Friend, from somewhere it should seem that something is good, if something is fine, then boys should not marry problematic girls who can create problems for them and they are seeing red flags with their eyes closed. Even then they do it out of greed, either they feel very beautiful and sexy or they feel that they belong to a very rich family and they feel that if the family is so rich then father-in-law will take care of them in future.  They do n't take care because after the registration of the plot, someone comes and does something, that is, the old one who has settled down or not, no, now I will get the four walls done, oh, the plot will be registered, now after that no one will bear any expense.  This is the truth of life, it will not happen after that, then you have already assumed that I am not promoting any dowry system here, but I am telling you for the sake of greed, do not do it out of greed, father-in-law's money will never give you happiness. I am telling all the boys that I will never give the position of father-in-law that he has called for you and helped, this can definitely happen, here it is enough that he has helped, provided support in any form, okay.  so but think like this  Take it, no, no, no, it's not okay, she is the only girl, even among the only ones, no one does it so quickly these days, by the time you get it, I had made a video earlier, it is happening again too, iron of inheritance, any time, a little more of the next generation on the money of the previous generation.  It is not happening in India. According to me, it should happen but it is not happening. So how did you like this video? Share it, like it, share it with your friends and listen to the words of your heart and this is the bachelor, isn't it? Brother, you are the bachelor, you are me.  Are you listening, but the bachelors who are giving knowledge, don't look for it, they are not so knowledgeable, no one does such a thing, no one does such a thing, you will have to just settle, how to give it to a high value man, high value woman, what women want.  How Men Have to Compromise How the Marriage Goes About This is a two-hour workshop in itself that I will probably do sometime now.  Election time is going on, so I am very busy in making my own videos, but after that, if I get time, then maybe in the month of June, I will bring it in the workshop and explain it to you so that you people can understand once how it is.  And it will come, the knowledge will come from a person, whatever these troubles are, I see them ahead, I can see them in the future, they are here now, they can be seen in the future also, so this is a very very important aspect in love.  Do it to fall in love and when you fall in love, please don't shy away from approaching the girl in a very decent manner that friend, I am liking you very much and I am like this and so and so, this is, will you marry me and she will  Get lost to say ok thank you very much you could have been nicer I came and spoke to you so nicely I should not have said loss you should have said no no not  Yes, I don't want to buy a flat right now, the type is fine, sorry, don't buy an insurance policy, just refuse someone just like you refuse them, no, I don't want to buy it right now, no, mine is already set up somewhere.  So say it like this, but don't shy away from reaching out to good girls who look good in your eyes, reach reach them, this is also a different phenomenon that men have stopped doing this, don't say to read back. Like some pictures, I don't mean forcefully asking someone to do stalking, once you can go to a decent human being in a decent manner, you can say that you are feeling good like this and he should go there, don't talk like this friendship.  If you do that means the girl will run away, don't talk like this, you do n't want friendship, don't do friendship, this is the problem directly, I want to talk to you, I intend to get married for some time, straight marriage is not like living in or  Friendship or Let's Know Each Other Let's Go Out Hang Out See If It Works Ye Nahi Karna Say I'm Coming and Approaching You with the Intention of Marriage May Be One or Two Days Three Days We Can Meet We Can Talk and See If It Works What's the problem? There are many girls who are waiting a lot to talk to such clear cut men but those men give them feelings only.  She doesn't understand why the friend is coming and what he is doing, so she also becomes the other wise and says with a straight face that she intends to get married, let's talk for two-four days. If you understand, then the parents will talk.  Then get married and do this regularly only then you will meet the right partner. If you are not getting married, if you want to get married then people are busy in real life. All of them are not getting married to these dot coms. in the big city  Or are you living somewhere in the city? Physically, look like this, that girl is going to my office next to this one. I am feeling good. Well, when you say what are you feeling, brother, only the body is visible, nature is visible, but in the body only the body. It's not about how I look, what is mine, it's about the vibrations, the feeling that I am.  Iking is also a personality trait, look a little, see a little, understand a little, know a little more closely and then just say hi hello and one more thing I want to tell you, I want to tell you one more thing, I want to tell the boys that your female  If your colleagues are married, some may not be married. Those who are not married or are of the opposite gender, then make some friendship with them in the sense that through them you may meet some other girl.  You are thinking that it is one of her friends, relatives and acquaintances because I am telling you that I am giving a big tip to the people because many people are coming, my friend is not getting married, I am not feeling like it, you talk to that girl politely.  Let's talk about that girl will have a good impression on you, he is a good boy, he does good work, he seems to have good manners, he is talking well, even at home, let's get to know him, is there such a girl in this life?  Which five in 10  She may not know other girls in her relational friend circle or in that, so she can do this to you, yes friend, she is there, she can tell him, now the girl who is her friend, she should at least look at the recommendation of that good friend. Will she agree to go and have tea, water and coffee with him? Why not? This is how the marriage will happen. Now I am telling this through paid consultation, I am telling the stories through paid webinar and I am telling it for free.  So You have to make this video a little bit so that people can benefit because I have a lot of paid content, so I have to release it, so even if I keep releasing it every day, I still keep getting a lot of new content, so that's my  I am not very worried that my shop will not be closed because I have given away so much free stuff. There is a lot of stuff in my shop and there will be plenty to sell. I am telling you from a practical point of view. How did you like this idea? Instead of doing it like this, boys should get it.  it's not happening, it's not happening In this.com, there are big deceptions in the co. It is not known that there is not so much clarity in the physical plane to interact with the opposite gender, he may be 10 years older than her, she is 25 years older than aunty ji, are you 25 years old, 50 Hello from Sal's aunty, aunty ji will also be related, friend sir will be there tomorrow and tell him directly aunty ji, call him a girl, speak directly for the boy. Clearly, people will like it, there is no problem or shame in it, interact with anyone, friend, you start interacting in the real world, people are not interacting at all, Sharma is living in shyness, this way a little will appear on top of the girl or  Boys, the same advice that I was giving, these girls can also follow, you do not have to marry that boy or if he is married or anyone then he is not the same, then people do not get the same in him. Why does this problem go wrong? That's why the advice which works for the boys may not work exactly for the girls because if those girls also do bad things then the man will get misunderstood. Girls do not get misunderstood. Girls have more brains and men have less brains.  If men think that if she is coming like this then she is not me only then they become like this, okay so this is a bit of an issue, it is okay. This is also an issue but still there is a friend circle, there are acquaintances, there are colleagues, there are batchmates of yours, when did you do college, you did this, then expand that circle a little, you do that, do that.  There are many weddings, they are good and I will tell the parents, hey, I will tell the parents too, keep your circle, talk a bit straightforwardly, don't put pressure on anyone else to tell the girl, for my boy, the girl, then people don't tell.  Fear comes but in a way we have our own circle, stay in a good place, only then I say, stay in a good condo and condo, stay in a good place, what have you got, but real estate has come to me. When I say this, many people troll me.  I say that you should buy separate houses and live separately, many people come to you and say like this, brother, you are real estate, brother, real estate is one work, marital consultation is another work, you all live in the same house, there will be conflict.  Even if you come to me, even if you live separately, if you come to me, then everyone will have to come to me. If you do something as per your wish, then do not look for the agenda behind my advice, there is no use, the chit is ours, the tail is also ours, it is okay.  So don't do that, this was genuinely free advice to help people, have a lot of desperation for practice, do n't be so bitter for the cool percentage, do n't be a tough boy.  Acharya Prashant and all this, don't confuse consciousness, intellect and discretion. Friend, you will come back very bitter. You will come back after losing 10 122 years. You will come only to people like us. Most of the people who are coming to my consultations are the ones whose trains have been canceled. Guruji, what to do now?  So brother, first don't go to that place, I am saying that nowadays these pictures will stop being made, this excessive talk has come even in the city political space and is everywhere outside.  Get out, litter, parking, car, traffic pollution, all this, where to find romance in this, but we will have to go a little towards romance, India needs to be romantic and listen to some songs, sing some songs and also talk about love and love in this.  Such poets have also gone, okay Sahari Ludhianvi was a bachelor, look how wonderful she has written about love and affection, okay what wonderful songs she has written and poems and all this.  He has written poetry, but he has never spread the bitter words that all this 498 is going to become 86 A in the new code which is coming. Okay, so this 498 will probably end anyway, its number is going to change in my opinion.  Lot Many Good Things Will Happen There Are Really Good Girls Out There Who Are Good By Nature Good By Understanding Just Seek Them Out You Got The Complete Opposite  I have not accepted the contract of gender, you only want one good girl, if you look for it, you will find it. I call many people, friend, I call women or I call women as men, so I have taken the contract that all men are bad, all women are bad, this is  Gender is like this and everyone is like this. Suppose such a system comes that all the girls in the world become the best but the one you marry is the worst, then will you be happy or not, all are the best and yours is the worst.  Or reverse it that yours is best for you, rest you have taken the contract. Yes, what is happening, then take this approach, remove this negativity from this society that men are dirty, boys are cheaters, girls are cheaters, all are like this Guruji, cheating.  Gives, gives, Brother, one cheated, two cheated you, you cheated, there was something wrong in you, you cheated, you are attracting people, you are attracting people, see this.  You are many things, flies attract you, flies come, why are the flies coming, brother, is there something wrong with what is coming, introspect within yourself that why am I attracting deceitful girls, why not attracting a good girl, if you ever think about this I teach all the things, now I will not teach all this for free, it will take effort, you want to learn for two and a half hours, brothers and sisters, you want to change your life because life is not just one thing. So let it out by crying or let it out by being happy and happiness will come only when you get clarity or not. Friend, one can be happy and I tell people again and again that being sad is the default setting, being sad is easy, hard work is done to be happy.  It doesn't take hard work, we go to the things which are easy, many people have spread wrong notions, I do n't know which motivational people, which books, oh, being happy is not that difficult, being happy is easy, no, being happy is not easy, being happy is  If it were easy, more people  It is easier to remain sad than happy, that is why more people are unhappy, but being happy is not very difficult but it is not easy either, it is a work in between, you have to work a little hard, you have to learn a little, this is our shop of happiness, okay yes  We teach to be happy We teach to spread happiness Like all value things which are valuable This knowledge This skill is also a value Small value 400 500 00 00 Lack of pizza  They also keep pizzas as per their choice, people come as per their taste, many don't know from which city, I tell them the rates of pizza of Gurgaon, brother, maybe there is variation in small cities, okay, so please come and join, there is a lot more on the page.

    "title": "How Young Men 18 to 25 Years Should Deal With Break Up ？ [7zJrGV1-DhI].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, in this video I will tell you about the children who are youth in the year 1825. Breakups happen a lot and the heart gets broken. Okay, so I will give a little practical idea on it. I will address mostly the boys. Boys are getting more heartbroken though. Girls also happen but I find girls are I think more mature and smarter or I really want you so I should be addressing more of d boys Why is your heart breaking Basically, there should not be any more breakups and what is happening, then what is the meaning of heartbreak at the age of 18 to 20 years, at the age of 22, the meaning of heartbreak is that the one whom you were loving, who was interested in you, the one with whom you were dating, broke up.  If you get sad about us then you are late, the boy is Rohit, the girl is Neha, okay, I have the note date, that's why I am telling you, a lot of boys come, so my resume is more with the boys and the girls are painted in bed light.  I am not trying but I am explaining that he is from See what happens when you are in college, now you are sincere 182021 This role is there, boys and girls will come there, so love has to happen there, now that college guy will go and meet a 28 year old woman from a corporate company.  How will you love him, there is no setting, if there is no setting, then he will do the same, the girl also has the same choice that this boy is very decent, she likes him, no, what happens after some time on this date in you.  You have some achievements, you are just a boy, you may be a rich boy, you may have a good body, you may have strength, you may be beautiful, you may be cute, you may have good morals or whatever, late girls like something new, so what about boys?  The thought is continuous from 30 to 35 also, they see the same thing as girls and forced intelligent in date desi friend, now I have this choice, divide the girls three-four.  Let's look ahead a year, look ahead even 5 years. All the girls know that if mom is an average sex college, you are an average girl, that's why the boy is also average in an average college, that's why he is in this college, now he is an average college.  The girl from SRCC can't be rounded off by the boy from SRCC because as you understand her average quality, I am telling you on the basis of example, whatever their time pass system is going on there, but defending is more time fed to you.  Made us drink a party, went to watch a movie, I have given you a gift, I gave you this, you are so emotionally involved, this is that, now the girl has cheated you, all the girls talk about it, you are having fun, boys are having fun, meaning are you a blanket, do n't you know what?  This is happening, don't you know uproot it and you know the status of other boys, who is busy doing such and such in IIT, then before 12th, he started doing such and such. Now he is doing something day and night to get the exam done. Those with ITI will take the bride. Those of heart will not take her. Hard fact of life is that a lioness marries the one who can catch the prey well and has no mate. So now when humans have what it takes to roam around on motorcycles, do partying, that's different. Those with packages, your package of 6 lakhs will lose to the package of 18 lakhs, then how many songs will one sing?  The rich man's daughter broke love India's heart, did not break the silver wall, gave up the oppression of the poor, gave up the bread, only girls do this in movies, never did it in real life, it did not happen even in 1950 sir, the movie fooled us.  Because Desi was poor, so the movie had to be shown according to the poor, because if the poor showed good to the rich, then only 5% of the rich would be able to get the movie, how could all those heroes and heroines who were poor were acting.  And the hero used to act poor, he was actually rich in real life, so how much poverty can he pretend there, in actual life he was rich, so no one ever told this thing openly, Sir, if 18 to 24 25  In the year you will concentrate on becoming something, now why worry about it, we have concentrated and she is a girl, so what do you want, I will tell you in advance that I  I am in IT at the age of 18, my first life is like this, only brother, you have accepted America, what happens in America, our color, what is the problem, today's voice, God's saying, if I am good in body, gym, home, strong, good, bad colleges too. Hai Par Style Bhai Hain To I Have A Girl Know What Happened This Girl Leaves Me After Some Time By This I Dated Her Mukesh Academy Now this has become a compromise formula for me, this is the reason on the angst of the boys so first of all who understands the reason no date is also fat sweet appears date is a sizeable percentage of girls are like this but there is no details survey  Tu calculate dear percentage but I am being what lot of stuff I put me uncle's friend kitna hai whatever data I have are rice packs All the food is not necessarily raw, you check it, you get to know that in this way, when the vote bank takes the exit poll and it is quite accurate, okay, the exact poll means the question which is asked after the vote, before that.  It's okay, so his idea becomes brother, this winner is the one who is going to lose, so whatever I do from the middle of that, I fear reasonable number of girls in big city which are like 22 25% like this swan but it is not so.  That they are more than 75, you are 80% girls, they are very normal girls, okay, they are normal, hello, they are human beings, but 80% girls are good girls, there is no spice, so just concentrate on making your personality, making your life starting.  Earning your basic is fine, having this personality, give only this will come, don't do it before that and second thing is the biggest thing to save from heart break. If you are 22-30 years old, 24 years old, then this friend, I have seen the others too in 27-28 years, just going around with this girl date for 5 years, then Bill has a heart break, this is my today.  I did not even understand that friend, I have been saying this for five years, I have been roaming around for years, what is this that I will become something, we and you will marry, why ca n't we marry without becoming, a girl is nothing, a boy is also nothing, if there is love then  Do n't get married when we become one, how many years will you wait and in order to become something small, you will have to go to HD Harvard and from there I will become you, I do n't know which paper will come out, whatever you do, maybe your selfishness is too much.  For 55 years we keep checking, if you don't get butter from me, then you will be fancy. If I don't get butter from you, then you are there, while the rest is me, I am watching. It's okay, as if one side is locked on, like a ship.  is not one  It is already locked on, the second radar is working like this, it has become very advanced these days, like okay, which is the version ahead of F-16, 35, what is there in it, you are doing like this, I am also checking the rest here.  It was found that there should be power on this also, there should be power on all things, then this big technology has not just come there, this technology is also running in the human brain, you are there with this feeling, when you go there, there will be a heartbeat, this and this will happen in relationships with cleverness.  Don't  Do n't put it among your friends with greed. If a person is good and big, one month is enough. You are not a bundle of friends and the rest, what is the biggest thing? Even a human being is just a cloud. It is a relief when you get married to the person with whom you got married.  If you are still a husband, is he the same as he was 20 years ago, is it not like that, is it right, then he also has to change, then you should come from within that friend, there is nothing in me, I am an innocent girl who has not seen life.  he has  Katni know he likes this today he likes it today he left you got some more toys let's see let's go I mean we order like this there cyber we have a place in Gurgaon we will order a mocktail worth 600 rupees everything fancy his name Ok, we will drink less, then we will stop drinking, then his father would be drinking Iranian tea, he would be drinking something like a soda water bottle opener, so I don't want to drink it, in our place, the old tea you got, you know, it had more sugar in it, oh man, sugar is more but okay.  It means caste doesn't even throw tea, there was a generation like this, now this generation is like this, within an hour he told me something like this, ok-ok heart break, why do we break up because you feel that break up will happen, find someone better. Gone or will meet him and he seems to like her because he looks like so many people, so don't take breakups too seriously in your life, here I will say, raise yourself so much that the person in front of you comes again and again and says that to me  My friend, it's okay, so here you have to raise yourself, along with clarity, you also need some motivation. It's okay, normally I would have given motivation, but here a little bit is needed. Okay, brother, here you make yourself good so that you don't fall in line.  How will it work and the money earning capacity will be as much as it is, now girls have a choice, boys have been cheated, their salary is Rs 40 thousand, they have gone to someone with Rs 70,000. Yes, you are like this.  If it does n't work, then set it. What's the matter? 70800 is running on thousands who are now in that category. Those who were born in 2000 have sex problems. Money is brother, it is a package. Now it looks big. Whose hair is it?  It is good that you have gone to the gym and brother, what is the big deal in building a body by going to the gym, the big thing is in earning money and now what is the problem, if the money is late then many people also build the body for the sake of money. Tell me, now she will desire more and people will go higher in the merit list and then you will leave me friend, what all will have to be done for these girls, first pass the exam, then pass the college, then get a job, then get a package, then also build a body. Yes, this will have to be done because of that.  There is no choice, the girl does not live after that, the boy has a lot of choice even after that, if the caste is there, then she is putting her mind to exercise her choice, she is making the choice, just like there were Swayamvars even thousands of years ago.  In this country, there used to be members in this color, you have seen it in Ramayana, you have heard it, you have seen Sambar in Mahabharata, you have seen D Girl, you select her and so many kings' princes used to come, they were rejected, no one picked up the bow. What to do now, starts crying, what to do, it happens that you find out that he/ she has rejected you, so don't put yourself in these circles, the one who is rejecting you on Chhichori button is someone anyway.  The girl is not well, if you take mother, you are a very good boy, everything is good for you and if some girl has accepted you, then after getting married, she starts rejecting you, then where do you keep running, these programs are also happening, so I am my people, are you no stable?  And ISP, I will make a very good video, if you want, about the horoscope, those people are doing very wrong, I will tell that too, you people will get clarity, but I will make a lot of love for it, that too is okay, so don't break your heart in this, okay  It's very good isn't it  So, if not that, then not that, then someone else, someone else, if there is no shortage of population, then if there was famine left for me, then leave aside the caste, either there was no famine in that, isn't it? Brother, money is everything, Himani, everything, Manish Note.  Everything but everything requirement is impressing opposite sex and you are failing in merit list it is like saying all the colleges now your ATM admission is not there so what do you say IIT is bad  I am not selected, I am bad, I am not selected, UPSC is bad, I am not selected, you don't say like this, you say, my marks were less, brother, not only I am not selected, the SIM is also here, why are you getting separated here?  Why are you feeling like this that till now you were talking to me, why are you not talking to me now because there is nothing wrong in my eyes, right now we have not become anything, when we have not become anything, then don't do the same thing, first some bangla, then one less.  Make me your wife as much as I love you.  My father 's age has come to do so, hair turns gray then man reaches him in that where you can make a virtual situation out of other situation i 20 you 25 not date this nobody can do date you bill have  You choose the pick and suck the hope, apply a little ointment to those people who are in this group, those who are in this group, with whom such incidents keep happening, are roaming around with broken hearts, give them a little video.  Laugh like it, don't get stressed, it's okay Rondo Mal's opinion, I too, you are crying because your heart is broken, this is your Rondo, but she had realized it, that's why maybe she has left, this can also be a reason.  It's okay, so your self is because of you, you only think about yourself and others, if you like me, I will remain like this, I will not remain like this, thank you."

    "title": "How Your Retirement Planning Is Affected After This Budget ？ [9gmbAmRP__4].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, how is your retirement planning affected after this budget? I am giving clarity to the youth. Long term capital gains tax has increased from 10 to 12. The question on the 125th half is not about that. The question on the 2nd half is about the tragedy. It is just a matter.  My guess is that the way the politics is going on in the country this time, Earning money from stock market is always considered the work of the rich and that this is earning money without any hard work, so if Tragedy has come at 12:30 pm, it was introduced in 2018, in 2017 the capital gain was zero, so just imagine if you have any  Had advised 10 years ago that brother, mutual fund is right, SIP is right, so much will happen, if it has been so much in the last so many years, then there were two mistakes.  There one is to file that return further and second is not to charge tax on that return. If you just imagine 123 is already done then it has gone further to 15 20 25 30 in future because government will run out of ideas.  To collect tax, now tax is on your income, you earn money, after deducting tax you get the money you spend, beyond that you have to pay GST anywhere. End  Even if there is a gain beyond what you invest, you will be taxed, so in a way this huge middle class is getting trapped in the trap. The poor are not in this trap and the rich are already rich, they have come out of all this.  Because of things, his income remains at a very different level, so what you can do and what will happen now, which was a one trick pony system of financial influences, Ankur Warku ji, Akshay Srivastava  Yes he is finance with Sharan hai and rest of them I am forgetting another name who lives in Raipur what is his name Finn I am just forgetting he used to talk sometimes he himself invests in real estate now you will find lot of  People talking about real estate I have always been talking about real estate I have always said that equity is very good we should always say that people of Haryana say that  Is it just one bowl or not two bowls? We will also eat kheer and rasgulla too. So the time has come to mix and match. Now you will see a lot of financial influence also taking towards residential real estate. But now I am the clarity giver when I say that.  At that time, he used to say that when everyone used to say that no no no, this is how it is in real estate, you will have to give so much loan, what is the benefit and he used to tell the calculations.  Then I used to say, it's great, go out, I used to explain, Rental Heald and all that, now I am telling, now as there has been a change here, now I am telling that in residential real estate, now you have to be picky, choose is not blind, there was  At a time, three to four years ago, did you purchase anything anywhere in India, whether residential in any city, whether you purchased a plot, booked a flat, or purchased a ready-to-move or under-construction property.  Every person has made a lot of money. Look at the top 100 cities of India. Rates have also increased even in small cities. It is okay now that finding value in the market is not extremely easy. Here too guidance will be needed. Read with logic towards this I am real.  I conduct estate info webinars. Opportunity to see you in the comment section regarding the same which would give you better hand holding.  The market will no longer be about giving general advice that real estate is good or bad there by anything, it is very very specific, it is extremely specific and in the coming time, we all have to plan like this, which I am telling you youth, whatever.  Suppose he is listening to me now, even at the age of 25, 30, 35, 40. Even at the age of 45, he is listening to me, even in the next 10, 15, 20 years. Your retirement time will come in 30 years. For 45 year old, it will take 15 years. For 30 year old, it will take 30 years. You can expect atleast in next 15 years even if you are 45 year old. Okay, so that the tax rates will be 30 but you will be from the same.  Do planning, now you are at 125. Whatever planning you have to do for your retirement portfolio, you should assume that  It is at 30 when it comes to long term You will be surprised to know how far the taxes can go in Canada It is at 50 I am not comparing India and Canada but by the way I am telling you how far the taxes can go in Canada We are not  Very close to that development status but anything can happen because now my channel is more political and I talk about politics more openly, my channel is Guruji from Gurugram there.  Know what I am saying is try to understand Ishara This government has done it The alternatives which we have without making it too political Is khatkhat khatkhat That khatkhat khatkhat People will also put tax only And will they bring money from their home through air Who will be taxed  If you pay it from here then how much tax will come knocking knocking 20 But the government can come as per its wish, once the tax is done, brother, now look at that slab, later there will be so much inflation, salaries will increase, everything will happen, but the minimum issue is stuck at 3 lakhs, not 5 lakhs, not 78 lakhs. Look at the slabs, how concentrated they are there, no matter how tax comes, no one will leave the dispensation that is being given, it is like reservation in this.  Country can be from 50 to 90, it cannot be reduced, similarly taxes are there, taxes can be increased at some places, cannot be reduced, if it is reduced at one place, if done from 20 to 125, then indexation cost will be removed. Very good video to understand the indexation cost. I have put it on my Sango Real Estate channel and have tried to tell you about it as an example, so you can go to that channel also and watch it, but youth should not get disappointed in this way, what is happening? All this will happen, you have to see what is controllable, the paper is becoming difficult, you will have to study the paper of life, you will have to study the paper of investments, you will have to learn, you will have to be dynamic, there was no one like that, I used to say earlier also that life is not so simple, do a job, do SIP.  Mutual fund is correct, my video about mutual fund is still due, there are some reasons for that that I am not posting it so soon. If I get support from your side then please let me know and in that too I will tell as much as I see fit. I am very much.  Whether there is any advice in it or not, not too much knowledge is to be given, especially for free, this is also a fact, you have to see that it is a very dynamic world, the influencers come and make videos like us, they also have to check whether the game is what.  There is a video on this and there will be a follow up video of mine if you want. If you want, basically what the government wants is that by doing this they have increased the long term capital gains tax in the share market.  So it has been done from 10 to 125 and the indexation cost of real estate has been removed, so what is the purpose, what is the region, is there something else also or every time we say this, these people are taking taxi because many times there is opposition to it and this kind of thing.  If things are also done then that too, if you want then write in the comment section that brother, if we direct the government, the government will not tell these things openly but only for the good of the country.  It is only for our good, what happens sometimes is that parents do some things and are not able to tell much, then sometimes my father and government are also like this. It is not right to blame every time and do that too. You have to understand the larger. Picture: Although in Guruji from Gurugram, I do this very politically, it is okay that I do it by talking like this to the government and this to the ruling party, but sometimes you have clarity on other things also, so if there is clarity on that thing.  If you want, please write on the comment section, follow the video, you will get it immediately, thank you very much."

    "title": "How Youth Can Earn Through UPSC Preparation ？ [umQ6uW83ZyE].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, this is a very interesting video on how we can earn through UPSC preparation. Now I have put only one thing UPSC in the title but the same thing is applicable if you are preparing for bank PO exam, do you want to go to bank or state.  Do you want to join Civil Services or Judicial Services? Do you know that exams are important for you? So, through this video, I am trying to give you the idea that  How can one earn money through preparation? Because India is what is youth, what is youth, a lot of people are preparing for the exam, so now in this I say many times to my subscribers who follow my people, if everyone will do this then it will be the best.  The big problem is that as a creator, if you give any advice, the listener will be the first to say that if everyone does it like this, not everyone can do it, not everyone can wake up in an illusion, not everyone wakes up even at 6:00.  Everyone doesn't wake up even at 7:00. Everyone ca n't sleep at 9:00. Everyone can say whatever they want to say. It should be like this, it should be like that. Everyone cannot do everything. Only those who can understand it should do it. You should prepare for the exam. You are the only one, so what idea am I trying to give to the youth and you people who are not youth, if those children are doing this work through you because earning money is very important, whenever you are preparing for something, here I am just  of UPSC  I will take an example, you can apply this thing in other things also, then any subject, any topic, any sub-topic will be of your interest, it will be your strength, master that thing so much that you master it so much that you become one of the top 102 people of India. As a subset example, our dear Golu Molu ji is Awadh Ojha ji, the one who makes kings, the question number three comes, the remaining part of the history of those who teach, we have completed them.  You saw his words, become a king, become like this, he is on youtube0, he is very highly paid, so I am not saying that all of you will become there, but even if you become 100 of him, you will also come out, that is why I am telling you this. When you prepare, keep this thing in the back of your mind that if I am not selected because brother, there are not 99 people, if you go by statistics then the percentage is higher than if 10 lakh people are appearing.  On 1 it is 10000 only and % is 1000 so if % is not to be made and in that if you are reserved category and he is not there then the percentage is if there is reserved category then it is % and if even he is not there then it can be even less then where the case is  If you have this much, then the chances are that you are not going to be selected but you are brave, you are fighting, so you should achieve mastery in this thing, then your target should be this first.  Target: The second target should be that if you crack that exam then crack the athlete prelims and become a specialist in prelims. If you become a specialist in some subject in prelims itself then you can get a job in a coaching academy. If you do youtube3 then I watch the children here. That this time I took Psychology, next time I changed that subject and did Abli Ba because the focus is all on the job, at least I can get a job when you people Start sharing knowledge and start earning money. Even if you prepare for the exam, keep giving exams. I have talked to many children, yes, I have been consulting. Exams are very addictive. If you remove a number from a level, then  If you are above one level, below that then the matter is messed up but if you go above that then you get attracted to yourself. I have given many IM and CAT papers in my life. I got a shock from his [ __ ] paper. Logic paper.  It used to be a lot of fun and when my gray hair started growing too much, I became a little conscious because the children used to sit there and used to look at me like who is here and someone used to look with suspicion that he is from the coaching academy here.  I am giving the exam myself, it is okay and I used to give it as a hobby to see how many percentile I got in the exam. Call letters used to come but we did not go there. It is okay there because I feel that the students there.  It is better if I teach you than it is taught, okay but that is a different matter, but in the exam, it was a pleasure to see that you do not know much in Maths, some comprehension in English is so lovely of CAT and it is so good in it that  If you have figured out a pattern, then you can figure out everything, so like I told you about the CAT exam, if you know the answers of comprehension, then brother, you should know one small thing, very small. Technical understanding comes in a big way, below that questions are asked. There is a small technique that friend, first of all do not read the paragraph, first read the questions, first read the questions quickly i.e. read them in such a way that what is being asked, if you have not asked the question till now then when  If you read Pahar then you will know what is happening and what is the pattern because all of them are higher order thinking people, so a small technique of what people do, first read this.  After that, you will read the below one, after reading the below one, then you will have to read this one, brother, now from where to find me, after that you will have to go here again, you will have to come only once for the answer, if you read this one first, then these two or three  You have to do it four times, it will work in two times, this is a small technique, there are many techniques of such exams, but if you have mastered it yourself and have taken the exam yourself, then only you can earn money, first tell me.  These  How is the idea looking, if you speak in Bank PO and you have proof and can show it in the exams, then you will be selected or not, do you go somewhere in coaching Adm. This is my qualification, this is my appearance, intelligence, this is thrice in Prelims. I have appeared once in Mains, I got these marks and I know how to teach this part of the subject very well. You will get 100% job in this coaching academy.  The industries are very huge, worth 40,50,60,800 thousand crores, but there is no entrance exam in them. The entrance exam is only that which you have mastered and give it every time, give it every time, show your numbers every time and keep making it and then rest.  After that, we have done it so many times that we have the confidence, now as if I have learned this technique, I do not tell you all here for free, but as if this is a technique, this is a technique.  Only insiders can tell who have appeared for exams or attempted a lot, if you have never passed anything then it will be difficult, then you cannot talk about knowledge, right? You are saying that I have got very good marks at my graduation level. More posts  At graduation level, if you try such an intelligent paper once or twice, if you get it all then you will become an IS, that too I am saying, keep trying, whoever has refused, keep trying too. Stay engaged with the students, who said that Guruji is also giving exam, Guruji is not able to solve it because he is the same master, talk to Avaja ji, he also says that we could not solve the game, the loser understands better how to play the gambling game.  Shouldn't it or how should one play because he has lost many times because if you ask him who gets success in the first and second time, he will tell you some random things but the loser is more of an expert.  If something or the other is made then how did you guys get this idea and the same thing you can follow in Bank PO. If there are any logical questions or those questions which you master it, your pattern is like this.  This is like this, then it happened like this, how will it happen next time, there are very simple techniques in which many times a technique is like this for those questions in which there are names of six people, this is bigger than that, this is smaller than this, this is here, this is here, then this is this  Age  She is very good at giving four or five things like this and then a statement is written below them as to what is true and by doing this, her very simple technique is to write everyone's name like this and then write whatever characters they have and so on.  By ticking means once you start passing the exam, look, everyone who has taken the exam knows what I am talking about, there are shortcuts for every thing, there are questions, once you master that.  This thing can be monetized, they are busy, they are busy, there is apathy, they are not passing, they are not passing, they are putting pressure on them because they are not able to earn money, you should prepare for the exam and help others. All people should also prepare for this, not all people can do it, all such people do not watch my channel, not all people will do it even after listening and many people will not be able to be successful even after doing it, so everything is not easy in that too, otherwise it is not easy.  So come and get ready, everything will be done.  Everyone will become officers, don't become government officers, don't study, okay, if everyone studies then this is a very good technique and monitor it very well because this competition is not going to disappear anywhere in India in the next 20, 30, 40 years, just like us.  Come and try to break the illusion of government job, it is not going to happen because our social discrimination is so much that a class which is below one level can only get a government job out of it because a startup cannot be done by someone who has money for food. No, he has money only for food and no money for clothes or only for clothes and he is struggling, he is poor in the family, how will he start a business and start up, if no one in his family has done so, then that will always be his route.  If this continues for 20-30 years then it seems like a good business and after that you can slowly do something else. I have seen many people like this in the coaching industry and they also take consultation from me and so on.  also do and i  I also give them the idea that once again you will become that Jeetu Bhaiya, then you can also become a consultant for those children, you can also become a mental concert, in every way, people will reach out to you, that I have such emotions because you  You yourself have failed the exam seven, eight, 10 times. When you used to prepare, you went through two emotions which are now like I have not gone through failing in the exam.  I can imagine a little by asking that there is pain, there is suffering, but what is the story of failure, I cannot tell it because it has not come in my experience, no matter how much I ask others, like this is something like a woman.  The delivery has taken place, the child has been born, only he knows how the child grows in the stomach, how it happens, men will never know in their life, the man will become a gynecologist, he will give birth to 10000 children but he will not realize that.  I do n't know if you are preparing for the exam then you are not the pregnant lady but you are the person who is going through these emotions.  It is known in the ecosystem how money can be earned from here and there is an industry in it and no one is asking to do wrong practice in it. Good people tell people that everyone should do this. Not everyone does this Baba, I am telling you myself, they break down, go to do some other work, they just don't have it, they don't feel like it, they are not academically inclined at all, it is something like this, I will tell you more under the example. Listen Tell me the name of the actor I think Shukla is Saurabh Shukla I think if I'm not Rang Sauram's name is Shabda For Sure His character is Bobby Dale in the animal movie.  The one who comes along with her is her brother who translates her, that is Bobby Dol, Gunga Hai, that actor and that of yours, that was a picture of Kareena Kapoor, which one was the one with Jaideep Balawat in which her husband is made? Have n't seen the movies yet, yes, these days.  I will also start coming here, there have been teaching actors, they teach acting very well, they teach us very well, all of them are your top actors, all of them have taken training from them as much as all the actors.  There are children, I will start telling the exact name of everyone, one half will be up and down, then that fact does not make videos like Rathi, I want to tell the big thing, I do not enjoy doing too much fact, the big thing I want to convey is  You see, in the same way, you will see that in our cricket team also, if you see, our batting coaches, they were like Vikram Rathore ji, he himself had not uprooted anything but in his career, he knew something and he used to teach it.  Perhaps  Now Sachin Tendulkar ji has never become a coach, batting coach and something sometimes happens that if bati tarna becomes good then you don't do it, that too is one thing but what I am trying to say is that you can easily you know do average in life.  And still make decent money if you are a little bit like me, you are taking this kind of advice, you can apply it in everything, this topic of life is my topic, if you  You will watch and listen carefully and understand that these are actually templates and in these templates, if you remove things and add something else of your own, then that can be followed by everyone everywhere and then you can become a true resting person at the time of your studies. Whenever you tell people, children are saying that son, you have a lot of experience, you have failed in IS five times, you are fine in UPSC, son, you have appeared in Prelims once. Suppose once you passed that paper in Mains but you failed to get overall rank, still you know that after preparing for something four times and for four years, you failed four times in some subject.  So you become an expert, friend, just catch him, now tell him more that he will do only this, it will work from here, just like when I talk about cooking, people say that he is a cook, you will catch every cook also with one of his dishes.  I know many men, men are not normally told that they know cooking, they do not know generality, but there are many people who know how to make one thing very well, some may know how to make good tea, some may know something else.  If you know how to cook a particular dish well then you can eat roti with it. These are the positive videos. In my beginning it seems like how I am always a solution oriented person, I am practical, I will never come to the government, this knowledge.  Can't distribute, no one else can come and distribute, then how can the coaching people distribute? If the coaching people say that they can't, then join us and we will get catch more people and this is an ever going process and ever growing industry because if  20 years ago, in the preparation for these exams, these seats that came to you are 180, you can go away anytime, it is fine for the last 25 years, but the children who appear  They are increasing, so the children who are appearing, they have to prepare somewhere, they need prepared people somewhere, no matter how well you teach, the competition is increasing, but people will want every person.  It's like there will be five star coaching people, there will be four star three star dhaba people, some dhaba people also have selection, five star people also have selection, you tell me that only 180 IAS.  If they are built then read that these coaching institutes will be Rs 15000. Out of 15000, 180 are being built and out of that they say, Vikas Devak, Riti ji has become so much, add so many of them, everyone's claim is I think 6 to 7000 IS.  They get selected out of 180 because everyone claims that someone had written their name at some point, someone had gone for a mock interview, someone had gone for a little  If we have done anything and do the rest anyway, then what I am trying to do is that by living within this system, we should not shy away from earning money from whatever opportunities the system throws at us, nor should we be afraid, nor should we feel shy. What kind of idea is this?  I thought it was a practical idea, if you like it then I have many different solutions to many different things which I can give to the society and they have been followed, are being followed people.  I am enjoying because money is very very important in life, you spend 10 years on something like this and you will not be able to do anything with it because brother, that Haldi Ghati took place on 20th June 1576 and Hakim Khan was their leader, Maharana Pratap.  This knowledge is how to earn money. Okay, so I am telling you how to earn money. Once you have acquired this knowledge, what to do, there are many ways to do it. Further method and  It is like if you have achieved mastery in a history or any interesting aspect, you [music], this is also a fact, then do not come and talk about it here, everyone will do it, not everyone can do it because it sounds simple, it is also simple but not easy.  It is like losing weight is not easy but very simple, eat less, stop eating more calories, do exercise, it is a very simple thing, there will be calorie deficit, weight will be reduced but what happens?  If it is not easy then like the channel and share. Thank you very much."

    "title": "How Youth Should Deal With Failure In Life ？ [ZcL2oduH09I].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today's topic is youth exams and failure and you basically deal with this failure. The results of exams are coming, UPSC has declared, NEET has declared or etc. Now it is the month of June, so the off course results are coming. You people whose jobs are in trouble.  There is a video for those who have already got a job or are looking for a job. There can be a video for parents too. If you are watching, please share it in your friend circle in the best way in five points.  I will tell you in a practical way, no one is explaining because everything is going on motivational, inspirational and things like that, I will have 5 points in which we will understand this situation well, understand such a subject, even if the video seems a little long, watch the whole thing because of so much time.  If you go for preparation and if something does not happen, then you can spend some time to deal with the pain it causes, then my first point in 5 points. What is the problem? If you say failure then all this means what is the basic problem? The problem is that if I take an example and tell you, we make popular YouTube, there is no trolley, there is no competition, I am telling the example because sir, everyone's thought process. That's it, parents are also behaving like this, Ankur Badi is giving such kind of knowledge and that is wrong, I am absolutely wrong.  Let me bring a fresh perspective, as they say, I am serving some very fresh items, I am listening to you because I am telling you on their basis, if you have not seen the video then it is okay, even if you have not seen their recent video, it is basically that.  They are saying that I too had failed in my IT exam, I looked at the first page, looked at the second page, my result did not come and then this happened, then after that we have to introspect why it happened, then we have to write it.  Reason one is that why do they say so much I don't know so much because it is because it is because it is not it is artificial and they start throwing war by explaining it as an artificial thing and saying that caste is the biggest problem 1998 Those who impart the knowledge to you Most of them are from a different generation like us. I wo n't put myself in it because I am taking a different content, but most of your parents are Ankur Barik Uchi. In the normal society, motivation comes on, there was not so much competition at the time of those who did SSC, they are just saying that something will happen, there will be no failure, it is not like this, it has happened to us in the future, there was no competition, if we keep this misconception then we will not do it.  Whoever can do it will get it because I will explain it to you very well in the next 45 points. The problem is that I am tweeting it as a failure. So many people in the exam.  Gave the paper and only so many people clear it and call it pass and the rest say failed, so where they say failed, it is not a failure, I am telling you this, be it UPSC exam, be it for NEET, or something like this, they should have to teach their children again. Give the same paper which came to everyone, the result fair will be different for everyone, this is a big game because the child who has 76 50% is not in the competition, he has to be first.  I only know about myself, he is just sitting there after cleaning the dust before the axle matic. Apart from this, my brother is doing some other small business. He has got clarity in his life very soon but these days he is running above 90%.  Yes, getting marks above 90% has become very easy these days. This is the biggest example of misunderstanding. What used to happen in earlier times, the marks used to come 25-30 years ago were a bit realistic and it was found out that caste was  That we are also mine, these days I don't even realize that everyone is getting good marks, everyone is getting good marks, how do you have to see this, how do you have to see this, there is a lot of crowd standing at the Delhi's story bus stop, the bus has come. Not everyone is able to climb it. Now, those who climb it are successful and those who climb but fail are not like this. Brother, this is no success, no failure. If you follow Ankur ji's teachings or his equivalent teachings, then you should introspect if you fail. Why is this so, then you will fail again because that dynamic ecosystem is changing, you have to understand it like there are settings, do experiments, chemistry students would also know this or whatever is temperature, there are different elements in it.  There are some reactions to do, compounding, there is a quantity and there is a setting in it, if that setting does not work out in practice then you go and revisit what I did wrong. Corrected, it can be corrected, if this entire setting is dynamic, the temperature itself is changing, the moisture itself is changing, all its inherent elements, its tweets are changing, everything is changing, then you can ever You are somewhere, you are thinking that you are not in your control, UPSC has changed the pattern of C set, the same one got clean bowled, the one who was supposed to get 33% by scoring 36 marks, that too is not coming because of the people.  Earlier, there was no qualifying exam number account in it, take more, take less to pass, now many people have got clean bowled, especially all your Hindi English literature and these eight parts, what will you do with the public?  The topper girl of UPSC has cleared the prelims twice, brother-in-law, everything is random, I am telling this, then let her go to the examination bus, if your bus is Chhath Jati, you are not able to board it.  There is no time for interesting. A dynamic situation has to be conveyed to you. You do not have time. You have to see when the next bus is coming. If the bus is not coming, can I do an overview? Can I call Papa? There is no such rule here.  Papa ji Papa ji is a very big thing, I am not talking about the children of the poor, the child of the extreme poor in the street is very good but he is not stressed at all. What are you talking about the child of the poor.  So, I am talking about the mental stress of the poor person, you are poor, his child may become anything because of this success, you are the child of a Group A officer, if you become a clerk, then the society will clap, will the father clap, will the relatives clap, will you directly stress, neither will your father.  If Amitabh Bachchan is in isolation, is there anything missing in the life of Abhishek Bachchan ji? Is he married to Aishwarya ji? Rakhi is there, he lives in a good house, the child is a good daughter and Rakhi is a good lux, everything is good, a good picture of her has been made.  Whatever has achieved is good in this life time but when you just put it Amitabh seventh time it was not like earlier nowadays everyone is open 32 40 Agar Lena Kahani Ghus Gaye Kahani Long Line Gay Rahi To Failure A Bit  If you are not trying to get out of the car, then you will try some other method or not, I have seen people doing something like this that they were in a taxi, go to the story, got stuck in the traffic jam, then got down and took a walk.  Caught a taxi from 500 meters ahead and turned from there and left. You have to have this mindset that you don't want to get stuck in life, don't introspect, why did I fail at the age of 16, if I had done this now, I will do this, till then uncle you will do that.  Someone was batting in cricket. Earlier the rules were different in 1984. Then in 1984, the play could stand so much outside, then one could stand so much inside, the ball would be changed. Earlier, there was no ball change. Earlier, there was no spinner. Earlier the role used to be 25, it was different, you cannot know the runs Gavaskar has scored, the 1975 World Cup on Dhyan Chand's time is a live astro, but if the scheme is changed after practicing, then that thing will happen, then success in it is not based on failure. You have to stay alive, situation awareness is called Instagram, which de pilots, it should have situation awareness because the thing is not visible to the story, you should be on the article.  Hey, he has given the height and flight level of the plane, that ETC controller can also make a mistake, give wrong flat level, then cross, give it, move the chair forward, move it back, give it take off when it is about to take off.  When the pilot goes, I have to look ahead, the take off part has to remain open, if it gets into my engine then you ca n't go on auto like this, everything is done once the plane has taken off, flight level has gone to A, then if you want to go on auto, then it's fine.  Let's move the curtain smoothly.  He descends, his eyes are alert, there is relief, what is coming now, what is coming now, then he goes to the approach lesson, the same life is the situation of you, you have extremely high situation, now the ever changing definition of failure, it will not be possible, Munna, Tera Munni Nahi Ho.  Will you be able to get yours now? Those who have liked the college, those who have passed the competition, after that there is another competition for the job or the story and if they did not get the job, then they are fit. Got a job, money in life is good, set is also right, but will you marry such a person, like a church wife, or tomorrow, such a husband whose Kashi has forgotten the pain in life, now you have become successful, it is such a dynamic thing, there is so much stress, do well in exams also.  Personality was also good, hard work was also good, exams were also cleared, sometimes luck also supported me, father was also good, if you do n't just play the game of life then it is a very dynamic situation. You catch a 75 year old man, but in the story also there is a definition of success in his life. Stomach should be clean in the morning, then one should feel hungry. To pass the time, one should bump into someone for 2 hours so that one can get good knowledge about it, then it is okay.  They will be able to sleep at night, this is the definition of their success and there should not be any severe pain in the body, that means a little bit will do, there is pain in the thighs, this is the story, we are walking with some helplessness, it should not be too much that even while taking it, there is pain.  It should not happen  Pain while walking should not be an acceptable pain. In the stomach, in the head, in the hands. If you are a very successful person then your definition of success is changing all the time. Fourth point where people are making mistakes is that they want to become something in the circle of success and failure.  That I have become successful in this thing, I have passed it, it is about becoming the psychology of people, what is the set of middle class, if not set, then I will be set now, then between set and upset.  Let's roam, once this happens, the story will be set. This is the D message. There is no setting of the story in today's time. Neither is it set in family life nor is it a constant dynamic thing. I will take you towards its solution only.  I am not going to leave you without hope and I am going to tell you very little about it. Those who have not cleared the exam, give it again, give this, give that. First of all, what do you want to do in life, do you want money, this is what you want, whatever.  If you want to become one, then for money then yes, to earn something we have to become one, it is not necessary, this is the catch, only then you should not commit failure because there are many buses here, there are many Ubers, there are many trains, there are many trains, there are many metros.  If you are not going to come in one, then you are not going to board the other one, if you don't have your own taxi, if you don't have your own car, then father is very smart, there is no need to panic so soon, why is the poor child not getting nervous, why is the poor child not getting nervous, why is he not stressed, because  Whose  If the father has beaten the rickshaw puller, then no matter what his child does, if he is successful then he is not stressed, it is not necessary that if the rickshaw puller's child does not make it, it does not mean that something will go wrong in his life, but  If it goes below that then it will remain the same son, if it is a failure then you middle class science has reached here, so there is a lot of stress because your next generation is not being taken up from here, the manasabdari system and all that, I made the video first.  paid off  You don't have to be set. To get set, if you go to the government, your salary is fixed. Your salary for 20 years should also be told. There is 3% increment every year. Donkey, horse and lame horse are set. Now I had to do this, but here I am, MBBS.  I am doing BAMS, there were six in MBBS, now I have gone to BA, now he is from Ayurveda, no one is asking him further, mother, the situation in life should be very clear, what you  Should do it immediately, as many as you are listening to me, the fifth and last point, play games are very fond, no, what did he say, yes, play games where you are close, I always give you an example in life, you are going from Delhi to Hisar, your work is to reach Hisar.  So you Rohtak city comes in the middle and you will go through it whose geography you will be fast in worshiping, you will make me like this, the government has made the best bypass of your Hisar Jaan. Make bypasses in your life. It is not necessary to struggle in life. Someone has told this to me. A small example like Blue Ocean Operation Games. 18 year old is making his bed in the morning. 19 year old, 20 year old is making his bed. 25 year old is making his bed.  Let's make this game, you can beat it. Is there any competition? You have to make your bed after waking up in the morning. Do n't waste your time on social media. Don't waste your time with bad friends. You have to open your demat account.  Before that, you have to have soft skills like driving a car, English speaking communication skills, some personality, ultimately when you come to the market, no one asks if you have got the degree, tell me if you want, then only Rakhi is made like this, after that you feel.  There was no doubt that there was so much noise about it, all these engineers are busy on the phone, that is, they are busy in sales, what did someone read and get to know the answer from it, then someone is in a collection college, has gone, nothing matches you.  On ho match gan nothing you do with your happiness levels what kid of people you clash with you just because you are mine IIT M K should not speak big issues are seen in marital life such percentages are because their thought process is winner's only there winners are found Otherwise, parents also want to remove some of these, wife also wants to remove, in-laws also want to remove, brothers and sisters also want to remove.  They want to expel me, they all want to hang me, it hurts a lot, they have always been successful, they are very VP level guys, they are 40 years old, they have a very strong physique, they have the pedigree of IIT, but they have been suffering for the last 15-16 years in life.  It's sister's wedding, money is her issue, then wife 's problem, gave car to parents, why did n't you give it to us, didn't you take our house, didn't take ours, took it on loan, took it, took it because you did something with it.  Neither his parents nor his wife are happy and they are pulling him like this, meaning he will basically remain like an ATM machine whose cards need two-three to be put in. Everyone says, ' My card, my card, my card.' So, I am motivating to motivate.  Rah hoon ki dewar ise no appsAbsolute success dewar is no absolute failure dewar ise dynamic world be happy when you fool date you achieve something dewar bill be days when you fool like user but if  You play some games like I told, keep your house clean, keep the room clean, take it from your parents, mother, you do the thing, even after that you are getting 40-50 ₹ 8000 worth of things, start it as per your wish, start once.  Tax people will automatically think that they push the money further, they don't even start the car, they say they just put petrol inside the car, they say we have to board the plane straight away, we don't want to make any use of the car and because all the discrimination is going on.  There  The rest of the middle class is busy worrying about the rest of the money. I will destroy this thing in detail to the people because from the date the 2-hour workshops will remain dead. A system of two and a half hours is such a system where you cannot beat it. No, what should I do?  It doesn't matter if you have to sell mutual funds or insurance policies, you have to sell something, you don't need a great college for that, even less than a college is fine, there are very few things you can do. You need personality, you do n't need the stamp of the story, don't run after it and do n't keep waiting here, people, these 18 years, it takes me 12 classes from the age of 6 to 18, that's 12 years and in that, every time it happens to the parents as well as the child.  It also seems that I am progressing. Six seven went from 7 to 8, went from 10 to 11th, now it will be from 11 to 12th and after that 18 17  Even after 18 years, children are taking 11-12 more years to settle down. Is this 24 years of education necessary? Preparation for competition, studies, coaching and everything. If everything in life was to be achieved through intelligence, then the child of 12th class  If he is getting good marks then he should be set up, if he does not have any coaching then it means that his game is not in intelligence because the intelligent person of 12th class is better than him.  The one who is getting the job from the one who is getting the college due to competition is not getting the job then it is not necessary because his performance level there is fluctuating, I don't know how the one who is going there is not getting settled in life, the one who has money.  Many people are asking him what to do with investing the money or telling no to which relative or making his wife bear the expenses or robbing his money. He was not able to understand. When the money came, it was a package of ₹ 40508 lakhs.  But I have been working for 10 years now, there is no money, there is no money, no money, option in mutual fund share, gave it to future option, took some there, gave some to dad, gave some to mom, built some house, gave some in sister's wedding, will I get anything from me?  Paas Tandon Bhopal Tere Se No Failure And You Can Not Actually Know Another People Are Very Stupid You Learn From Enemies No You Don't Have You Learn Nothing Learning is just a success. What should a man tell to a very foolish person who fails? There is only one thing to be told, which is a so-called fool. In my view, there is no failure in anything. In my view, there is probability. If you do something,  If there is some probability of him getting well then the only way you can do well in life is do you do me anything Fox will not work Hey very much I am just like that brother there is not much Fox when the opportunity comes to you  It's like a meeting, you get set to do something on the story, what do I have to do, then you want Fox, you don't want Fox in the beginning, if you want to become an actor, then you go to two producers and give photos, take yours and mine. Take it and I am also giving you Fox, then no less, you are going to 10,000 places, then when two people called and then you got less there and then less started, then Fox is necessary in the beginning, Fox is not necessary in the beginning.  Brother, I want to do everything Do anything in 20, 22, 25, just like they do in foreign countries, listen to anyone's story, do good to anyone, you will see it, Warren Buffett, do it at the age of 12. Was in the middle of the newspaper at the age of 10.  Here in India, people are ashamed of doing all this. Hey, do anything, do anything. There should be dignity of labour. Once you start desiring money, it will suck you and then you will realize that you are earning.  Money give do teach you daily school and college because they want tu vikam some think because only you will come for coaching I will tell you whatever you are miss interested in detail workshop and the name of the workshop will be ho tu play games which you can not lose like this  There are some things that you can start right away and I will not ask you to open a tea stall, I will not ask you to talk about things from Italy, okay brother, many times people who are not my subscribers.  The old ones are not there and the new ones are new. Brother, if you tell me a plane, then make two below you and it is like this. Are you like me? How many people have been associated with me for how many days? How many babies and workshops, you all must have attended IT bill.  B. In practical India, tell the story as per your wish. If there is a good hit movie, tickets are not available there. In the beginning of the story, you go to a good restaurant, there is a line. You go to the airport, there is a line. Go to check-in, there is a line.  ok you summer now  Holidays are going on, you go to Kullu, Manali, Nainital, Shimla, which is also there, then brother, is there such a thing that makes you feel relaxed by avoiding this crowd, have you reached any such place where there is no crowd, there are very few such places where there is crowd.  No, people do n't know, people don't know, and why do n't they know, because I am giving you an idea of ​​252 things which you can do in India 7:15 and what happens in that too.  That is, if he goes to this lesson, then this path gets blocked here, mother, if I have taken biology, then I cannot become an engineer, if I have taken engineering, then I cannot do this, if I have taken commerce, then I cannot become this.  If he could, he could do it, then it becomes like this that a commerce person will not become a doctor, now he cannot do engineering, but what can a pharmacy person do, what can a pharmacy person do? Let's do other vices besides these.  25 300 to do for less and what they do for less, you will not be able to tell, there is no tag on it for less because if you would have been able to tag it for less and tell, then by now she would have sung the line, in India, give a hint once. First of all, I will tell you that my series will come for you, you will see a lot of videos coming in this owner, I will also take out something from the popular profession and tell you that here you have to do it and you can get set. Don't play this game where you lose where your  Lock you realize that I'm lost when there is no one It's just coming you If you do n't get a seat in the restaurant Do you fool date you're a failure No I should have woken up sooner Booking me like this Do you interest me like this or  Just did it, let's take it, let's take it, don't eat it, take it, what failure are you if you don't get a movie ticket? Hey India, there are crowds everywhere, man, it's the song, nothing you do about you, this is what you  If someone is in a foreign country and has money, education has been made so cheap. In India, in higher education in schools, people sacrifice their lives in education, but this is what education has been made so easy, no one can apply and do something.  And the quality is so much that if it works then it is good. If it doesn't work then it is good. I will give you complete clarity on those things also. Please like the video. Sher."

    "title": "How Youth Should Manage Their Investments ？ ｜ Avoid This Mistake [kt7qWHny3yQ].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today there is a video to give clarity to the war about investment portfolio management and money related things in life. It is okay about this, there are many social media influencers on YouTube because I feel that they are going wrong because they Practically no hai my channel and my and my USB today old by you dear subscribe just one through comment section this date wherever I say you find it working in real life and  Your identify weather is fine so under that I am going to tell you the hard truth about portfolio investment and everything. You cannot put anything on auto pilot so it will be told to you like this [Music] Change First of all a basic  The thing is, you have a portfolio, I am tired, tell me, you have to put it, okay, there is no one who can come and tell me, this is what I collect, this is good and this will be good, you yourself must have felt this because my  The audience, I know which other channel also watches it, goes to YouTube. Well, these days, you must have noticed that even those people whom you have been following for many days, they too have started appearing as listed.  If we buy real estate, then brother, first of all, I am talking about one thing, why don't you tell me first that I always consider us to be the same dialogue, I am from Haryana, you will ask me, will you eat Gulab Jamun, brother, or will you eat Kheer?  So I will ask only one question, in your house the bowl will say investment, the second thing is one more thing, it is always told that the one who takes risk earns more money, it is absolutely wrong in life, if you cross the road with your eyes closed and bandaged, then there is maximum risk.  If it is there then will it become Zen then that thing is very important, there is a request of mine, you will get a playlist of mine with green thumbnail, you will get the playlist with mental model, I will also add English subtitles in it, ok please see that, decision. You will see very good in making. In 18-19 videos, I am talking about these things, decision making hochenge and secondly in red type, you will get the stock market type in that too, 11-12 basic videos, basic, why am I telling some reasons in them because now  It is our time to rise from the right side of mutual funds because if you look at this, a lot of money is being lost in mutual funds, there is no clarity, little is shown about the expensive, where is the rest.  I am asking a simple question. So many people have been investing in mutual funds for so many years. By holding the shares of the company in the mutual fund, they get their dividends. For example, if you buy shares directly, there is a dividend in your demat. What is done with the dividend there?  Do you have any idea, if you have bought shares worth Rs 10,000 crore, in those cities the company gives some dividends, where is the clarity, on what things, the fees of the Clarity Fund Manager.  It is Rs. 45 crores. The same fund manager is the manager of 12 funds and the same team under him is 15 boys and girls, they do research, they do a little bit here and there, they do it here and there, and those who have grown up get ₹ 10,000.  Those who have become rich in crores, they cannot even sell because if they sell some stocks, their rates will fall, then they open a new one, then they open a new one, then they open a new one, 4 thousand meters of shares are moving in the equity, so much in the total stock market. Investment and the given 500 are not the same 500 400 shares, mutual funds sitting with shares of 80 to 100 in different combos, it is high time D Investor has started doing now, I am running on auto, see your returns today, that index.  The fund is also getting the same returns, Nifty has higher returns, I will check myself, you bought a house on auto, you paid rent on auto.  Rent A will go, this doesn't happen, this is foolishness, passive investment, passive company, no, these books are beaten, videos are played, two are expected, it becomes less, everything becomes inside it, oh less in money, don't reduce me. There is no such thing that we will have to do, the only thing is that we will have to reduce it a little, it can be like paying rent to the tenant, taking rent from the tenant, paying the electricity bill, paying the society bill, managing it, if it becomes vacant then re-boarding it, painting it, hiring a plumber.  Shoes Electricity This is what I want to tell you that it is not going to be so easy because of what the investment people have done, we are great, we will tell you, you do your job, you give your money, please give us your blood and soul, suck it on the job and get your promotion.

    "title": "HRA, Income Tax  And Common Mistake Which People Make [5vVodSsnGYs].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today's topic is Acharya, you all know it is okay, it is okay to announce your rent, government people also get it, even in private jobs, it is okay and on top of this let's discuss about income tax, okay if you are defeated.  If you are getting it and you are not paying the rent, then the entire amount will be taxable at the rate of 30% in your normal rate, but if you pay the rent, then you get rebate on it, so what is wrong in it? Normally, this is a very common mistake. I will teach it very easily through examples. I will tell you by taking the example of a government employee. Rest of the corporates should also do like this because the numbers will be very different in percentage but the formula will remain. Currently, government officials get 27% green. Because it was 24 and as soon as it crossed 25%, it increased to 27% and then 50%. When Ba will cross, it will increase to 30%. Now on 27th pay, if the basic salary of any government officer is Rs 1 lakh then how much does he get. 27000 will be a very simple thing. Now if this person thinks that I am Sir, I am  I am getting Rs 27000 and I will live in a house with a rent of Rs 27000 and I will give my slip and my net income will be zero on tax because I  I got Rs 27 and I lived in a house of Rs 27, so the net is zero, so now I will not have to pay any income tax, so this is a wrong calculation. The right calculation given is that the rent which is more than 10% of the salary is tax free.  If it is considered, then if I want to see the total, I want to make the total tax free, then how many thousand rupees will I have to live on rent in a house? The answer will be ₹ 37000, ₹ 1 lakh is mine.  Salary is basic salary, you understand it is okay, I don't tell much by doing this or that, I sit under the tree on the old side and Master ji tells me, I am telling that one, listen carefully, there is no such complication, how much is 10%?  If it is Rs 10000, then how much rent are you paying above Rs 10000, i.e. 10% of your basic salary. If you are paying Rs 27000, then your  Only Pink 17000, now D 10000, so your HRMS is 27000, only 17000 will not be taxed, the remaining ₹ 10000 will be taxed to you, ₹ 3000 and three-four percent of the balance will be charged on it, 3100 is yours but if you have taken a rent of 37000,  So now how much rent are you paying more than your 10% salary? 37000  - 10000 because 10000 is 10% of the basic, so you are giving 27000 together, it is 27, so it is yours - it is done, you have to understand this way, if you come into this again, even if brother was not giving 30000, you are still giving 30000.  If you were getting 27 then you are getting 30 only, 20 thousand will be charged on 7000. 27000 I hope I have made it clear to you very easily, a little more about this and let me tell you what green money you are getting and you are living at your parents' house, at your parents' house, so is this your income?  You can claim tax and all this, Han ji, you can do it. If your spouse has a house of your mother or father, then whoever has a house, you have to pay rent to them in actual, through check in the bank and so online.  Date you can give record and after that their PAN is also taken so if they are not in taxable income it makes a lot of difference I am of the same if they are taxable you make difference because of 27000 if they have taken rent so suppose it is ok man  Whatever rent you expect, you paid late rent of Rs. 40000 to your parents and their income is Rs. 28000 [Music].  If she gives it to you, then if it is ₹ 100 rent then it is considered to be only 70 rupees. Now it will be said that it is in the name of the wife, it is very expensive, many people have given it to her but there are cases also, observation A.  It goes many times and you will give it to the wife, that wife actually becomes house old, okay, so yes, there are technicalities on it, it is quite ruling, it is something which is till in  D Gaiya but parents make it very clear your sibling parents related in law anybody is ok if there is any zero in it you do your transaction well and ok and yours will give you the receipt they will declare their income if their salary is less then if their income is less then You know that senior citizens do not come anyway, there is no tax till Rs 5 lakh, ₹ 500000 means Rs 7 lakh if ​​that rent is ours. If your property is Rs 490000, then you can take a rent of Rs 7 lakh or you can take a rent of around Rs 58000. There can be a combination that you are taking both and you can also take rebate of your home loan on income tax. Your house is provided in some other city. And many times there have been cases on this issue, since it will be necessary to tell about the city also that the city is big, I cannot live there or the house is small and it is not suitable for me, then that is technical.  I go to another city but you bring blinds. You work in Bengaluru, you are taking green, you work in Pune, you have a house in Gurgaon in Hyderabad, which you have put on rent. Yes, you can also show self occupied.  Showing the house is also allowed. Okay, whatever it is, you can continue your income tax rebate on the home loan and there will be no delay in it, no issues, no questions as it.  If someone does not get House Rent Allowance, then is there any provision for taking it? It will come in a separate section. If you want to know that too, yes, we do not take Acharya, but will we get it, then that.

    "title": "Hypocrisy Of Middle Class Parents Discussed [_Z5IluMjoII].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, my middle class videos are quite a hit, you guys know that today's topic will be middle class parents and hypocrisy, hypocrisy with respect to your brother on kids, there will be two-three pointers in them, I will tell you what is hypocrisy, you guys can tell whether it is so or not.  You guys also have to tell me brothers, should it stay or be removed? First of all, which stream to go to after 12th class, then this child will decide twelfth.  Where is the class near, son, you decide, son, you decide, if we are with you, then it sounds very very nice, yes, a child who has no exposure in life, who has no idea where and what is what, till now he has stayed at home, he decides.  Tax is imposed, let's become intelligent, 18 years, 17 years old decide, tax is imposed, but when the girl turns 25, 26, 27 years old, no matter the caste, then the parents decide but who to marry.  When an 18 year old can decide his career, Sarita can decide, then isn't it hypocrisy that you go to her at the age of 25 or 26 and tell her whom she will marry? The reason is hypocrisy, because it is in your syllabus that you think what job you have to do, Sarita. Nowadays you don't have any idea which one to join, where to go, artificial intelligence, no further knowledge, computer, B.Tech, engineering, art from the waist, digital technology, marketing, digital marketing.  10000 new professionals do n't know some alum balm, parents raise their hands here because you can see where they are getting it, but when they come, they will say, 'Bil Tel U', so according to me, even at that stage, you will get  It should be left out, it should be told from the beginning that if the child becomes successful, IIT results are out, NET results are out, first of all, UPSC results were out, it is the season and the new season is starting, then everyone would have taken ownership.  Parents take ownership by saying that yes, it was our child, they will be photographed everywhere, it is so and so's child and this happens that a maximum of 1% is taken from the parents, it is okay, mostly when the child was not there, we had educated you.  Had given Bajju also, had done coaching there, had sent him there, had done it everywhere, brother, this detachment is in your control, isn't this the failure of the parents?  Very bad and it's taking a lot on the emotional health of the new generation. I have been having a lot of consultation that means we get ditched, parents get ditched and bring the child, although we earn our livelihood from consultants. I tell them that first of all you need to consult before having a child. If a father comes saying that this is my son or daughter, what should he do with this, has he done this in 12th or this?  What should he do at the graduation level? What should he do now? Father is asking. Father should know everything about his child, not just what is his ability, what is his worth, what is his problem, what is his settlement of child, where is his child's wants.  And had and among them A didn't happen then B did B didn't happen C didn't happen then the id together and they are lodging together and brother-in-law is no lodging If one thing is not going to happen then  We will go to the second one, we will go to the third one, we will go to the fourth one and in this you do not have to worry, we are with you, whatever is your level of hunger, it is coming from the genes of your father and mother and hard work is only limited, it is the power that the parents have.  Nowadays, the housewife is at the forefront in ranking and runs, we have not done the job, I have not done the job, she makes sacrifices, she made the sacrifice for you, she gave the highest five, so madam, your daughter too is not a story.  She will also make sacrifices like you. What problem are you having by becoming a housewife? She will also give birth to children and will make sacrifices like you. Why are you crying for her? Why do no women make sacrifices? Brother, you were not like anyone, this too.  There may be a big reason, no, their father did not allow them to do it, you will get all the videos related to who allowed them to do what, but this is hypocrisy, housewife, it is her hypocrisy, please do something and show it. You will be 40-45 years old, when the child is 18 years old, the housewife is also around 45 years old, so what did you do, what are you doing now, what did you do in 40-45, when the children grow up, whatever happens, 20000 Whatever the job, the increase for them is not for the middle class, so there is a request from the parents of the middle class, please come out of this hypocrisy, but I am doing it here in the library.  Due to this hypocrisy, the children who do not take the responsibility of wherever they are reaching, they do not take it, their discipline is not good, so why is it like this now, the goods are taken out of your production factory, you will have to take responsibility, they say, right?  Motherboard Mothership Both the things that came out of your production factory are your children, you cannot write them off like this, you are not in their hands, they can do that, they would have removed all the exams.  Those times are gone, your middle class, whose children were born after 1996 and are sitting in jobs before middle class, if your one truth and water here and there, one's and your's also go a little wrong, then you are here to share this much knowledge. For his parents, he would have probably been a B from the group officer. If instead of B, he was doing story and chakki grinding, then he would not have had so much time competition. If you have more competition, then have a little mercy on yourself. Kids have a little more understanding about your kids and milk decisions. It is important to take timely decisions. It is important to take timely decisions. Never put everything on them, nor do all people care about them. It is said, and if you do not understand,  If you top it with those who are involved in the field, please comment on them, the one who is the real father of failure will become the father of failure and the father of success.  Is Bane ready to be successful? No matter the caste, yes, everyone will take the credit. School was set up, teachers were set up, coaching center was set up, mother was set up, father was also set up and relatives were also there. We knew this since childhood. We knew about this. Oh, this was bound to happen.  Hey, it was bound to happen to Rohit, it was not to happen to Neha, how does it happen like this, we already knew this, you did not know this much, yes, these things are being told later, so you are not like three or four.  Neither then you change caste, it's 1 second  I belong to this caste brother, we have done it, studied, written, done everything, made sacrifices, we are crying so much about this sacrifice, especially housewives make sacrifices, you made so much sacrifice for us, so we don't get married at all.  After sacrificing their conscious conscience, they go to awaken their intellect and those drivers are ready to come to many places, those who have failed in all their exams, your parents have left you, if you do n't like someone, then there is something great.  We will reduce this job, wife and children, this is great for the common man, then they are saying that we will come again for second consultation, our children have gone there, gone there, gone there, now that thing is gone, the second one is wisdom and intelligence.  Our child is fine as soon as he wakes up, so now what were you doing before that, playing the bin in such a way that the rats will come and take them with you, then you see, don't be this hypocritical, don't blame them.  Too many programs in the system  There is a blue ocean opportunity, there is a lot more to do, you people do not even know, if anyone has the wisdom of Vivek Chetan Jain, then the retirement of middle class parents is the wisdom of Vivek Chetan, of waking up, the place where you have been with that Baba Ji. Acharya Prashant ji, so much wisdom is going away, parents need to have children, parents need to come to their senses so that maybe when their rational wisdom awakens, then maybe they will help their children. Children waste 15 years.  Hope you guys will share this message. Thank you very much."

Write ID means identifying your identifying with this phenophena and I would like it not like I come and make such videos, there is a problem in the society, write not genuine, this is a matter of pain with you.  If this is happening to you, then first of all you have to take action on your interest, what is it in your personality that when someone can come and get away with doing these things, you are showing or telling you this.  Have to analyze because he is doing it with everyone, is he doing it with you, is it also a personality trait, has he seen your relative, has he seen your love, has he seen his colleague, has he seen his so called friend.  Have seen and he exploits this thing, where does it come from within you, take interest in what you are displaying, why don't you have that power inside you, why does n't anyone come and think twice and talk to you like this?  If he has to think twice for this, then first you rely on the fact that there is something in him because he has to change within himself, you cannot change him, his toxicity is narcissistic.  Is it okay or are people having psychological issues? You ca n't fix that, only you can fix this, Don't mess around with me, you can do something like this here, sign board, have this kind of attitude, so next time when something like this happens to you.  If yes, then ask him in person, okay and you make fun of me, this is not friendship, this is guru element, this is family channel, I can't do it in words, then I will do it here in body, if explanatory explanatory is in English, then speak in Hindi. Even if I am alone in Gandhi's street, I would have seen him speak clearly because he would have been shot because of a lot of people with good bye image, good girl image by girl, whatever this journey is from this, what would this Gandhi woman say who has never even imagined?  By prefixing that and that street, whatever you understand, guru and matter, and this note is something very nice that if anyone comes and goes after you, it's like a bell and you will not notice any difference like this.  Country also makes a difference, earlier the neighboring country used to do anything to its elder brother and said, 'Brother, you will get a slap, if you hit me with a little pinch, the cat will penetrate you and the teeth will come out. Next time you will pinch me, you will understand. If you understand then.  He told him straight to the person, what is your problem, what is bothering you, no, you are my friend, tell him, I do n't want such friends and said, next time you don't know what you are going to do.  Get back you bill note and no I am just joking and this is your scenario and just go alone and tell him what is called, explain it well in Hindi or whatever is your local language and if you want to understand that local language then explain it well. Bill Safar So Me Issues and Bitterness And You Left So Me Self Doubt It Was Your Fault You're Deficient This Joke Can Be About I Tell You It Can Be These Jokes Happen About Your Body It  What can happen about your dialect, the way you speak, the way you take decisions, your indecisiveness and others think it has to be about some trait about you, in which they make fun of you, if it is like this, Rohit is like this, Neha is like this.  Hey, hey, hey, do you know that he had gone there by doing this and by doing that personal thing of yours which you had told him in Goodwill, if he had made fun of him publicly?  If it is or is being used then you will have to be ruthless. You just write down how many times it happened to you and you start being like this. Now what is the brother in this? The brother in this is that hey, I have lost my bill, friend. Hey, to hell, I want such a friend.  There is no use in saying anything in life. Learn to spend time with yourself. This nonsense attitude will come automatically. It is the week of wife's parents, brother-sister's children and when it is X, it is that.  It's already week, I have earned money outside, so you think that if I don't tolerate the news hunt even for a little bit, then they will also go away. You are a wife, can do jokes, right, can do anything with you, can also do because of your techniques, we can make fun of each other like this.  Can be extremely close in which you can also make a joke there, then the same thing should be asked to the person making fun, Are you in my inner circle, are you in my group, are you  Close the date, you tell me, who gave you the right to joke with me? Do we have a brother-in-law and sister-in-law relationship? Tell me directly, I am yours and he, although according to me, even in a brother-in-law and sister-in-law relationship, people give jokes. According to me, one should not joke there.  We should also decorate and maintain, he is also one of our society, he is one of our society, I will make a video on him on a big channel, okay, so here I came, I told you, only those people, what is yours, did you feel that you can do this, not me.  friend i came  Don't Need Polo If You Don't Why do things come out of your mouth? Remember in life, nothing is ever a joke. That inner adversary, jailer, passive aggressive behavior, anger, hatred, witness frustration, only what has been kept in your mind comes out and when that  So and so unguarded many times like it's something like na i bill tell you an example will sound a bit ridiculous but bear with me like someone's su nikal  There must be some reason, there is some filter, the small child does not have that much control because he does not have awareness, so he is a small child, he also tells the story, but as we grow up, we do not do it, but like  -When extreme old age comes, people travel from this because of bladder control, there is no relief, it is embarrassing, there are many people like this, when there is a lot of toxicity in your name, then there is a movement or  On the situation he enjoys doing things and this happens sometimes when you have a date the day before yesterday he has drunk alcohol phenophena has been seen more in party functions get together Osho Hawass on the people steel guide someone put one or two and his  He brought out a little bit like this from within and then how will he speak there and from within, no, he is not after drinking alcohol, he does not know what he is doing, he knows very well what he is doing, he enjoys it a lot.  He is having a lot of fun in it, but he is having a little bit of that garden which is a respite in the normal day, so he has to make things difficult for him by not making him time-confident and making him spend time alone in Venice.  Alone and one only, he and other people will know and will say 13 There is no sense of us, he said, there is a sense of us, what is the meaning of this talk that there is some Sardar ji, it is okay that our Sardar is brother, but you Sardar, whatever you do is ridiculous.  And then tell them your sense of emergence, why don't you put your sense of emergence on yourself, why don't you put your sense of emergence on yourself, why don't you put it on your community, I guess I am, I guess I am a Jat, okay, then let me talk to some Sardar ji friend.  If I am a Jat then why don't I joke about my hair, about my face, about my wings, about my body, about my dialect, how many cracks should I make, what is the problem with myself?  How much should I body shame you, what is the problem, but you are doing it to someone else, making fun of someone else and telling him that you don't have information about him, your sense of member is great, it is very great when I do it on men and women.  The furnaces are big and I should tell the women that hey, you don't have any sense of humanity. Hey, you are a man, so whatever you do to men, you do it to your own stupidity, do it to others, this is the biggest catch, because.  People bill come in oil if you say this then joke on your father, joke on your mother, your kids, your wife, don't joke on me, environment will get tense, if that happens then you will deal with your self estimation in your life, you will be alone. If you are fat, someone is saying that being fat is the way to do it. If your weight has increased and you are not feeling well, then your parents, friends who are generally concerned.  He will generally come and say something genuinely good to you and will not make you look big, his feeling will be that you should lose weight and look a little better and your health will deteriorate and there is concern, but the one who is body shaming you has no concern.  You, that, tell him, have you eaten your father's food or have you eaten yours? Yes, I am fat, you have to bear my weight, do you have to kill him? You have to kill him. Dialogue, other voice, people bill, less, your appearance, dialect.  Knowledge Decision Making Your Social Status Your Background On many things, A people will go for some things and you will always be in self doubt, which in the beginning it seems like no no, many people will ignore it and come when you do it like this once more.  Ask the soil, soil, pavuji, nothing, soil, no water, soil, drink on everything, you will go inside the soil, no water, soil, me, not soil, water, do n't let me mess with you, no one will talk to me, don't, do n't, don't you, Ukraine.  If you want to talk about Putin, talk about the economy, talk about the Indian Stock Market, it's okay, talk about Shahrukh Khan, Preity Zinta, then it will be old, talk about Congress, talk about Karnataka elections, don't make fun of me by coming to my personal space, if you make fun of me publicly.  So B Ready on D Night Hempire Bill Strike Back Then you will be told where you can be made fun of Then we will be told Observe Very clearly He doesn't make fun of his self Doesn't make fun of his own Jo-Jo  Those who can tighten him can destroy him, he does not make fun of him, that is, he knows whom to make fun of, it is not that he is an inquisitive child, everyone is very happy, he is lucky, we have done this in one society, trolling.  Have done this type of thing like Kapil Sharma's show comes or any other show comes, comedy shows come, daily ones come, so we brother, they get paid, they are less professional, they get paid for being jealous, if you are also jealous. Getting paid for being a Jalil is a different matter. Well, he comes on a news channel and says something like this and the anchor shouts, he gets paid for being a Jalil, that is different, you are getting a little money for being a Jalil.  Even if you get paid for being and being insulting, tell me, just ignore me, after that tell me brother, you have torn a page from my book, you can do whatever you want, Chaudhary Saheb, the story too has nothing to do with me, but next time don't say anything.  You're Not That Close To Me And You're Never Close To Me I Hope This Strong Message Is That's Why I Wicked Little Beat Passion 18 Sach Video Because Of The Society And People Of Dem Just Because Of Them Stand Up On Themselves Not Only Themselves  You can do the same thing, teach it to your children, teach it to your wife, teach it to your siblings, teach it around you and as a social responsibility, send this video on social media.  Responsibility ki yaar, there is a social responsibility that because of this, Everybody Bill, listen to this and those of you who will be making fun, look at those of you, you can be on both sides, you can be the person who is doing this.  Hain b very sir dat if it com back tu u it is very baad do do it just si ki me kisi ki ka maa karta to kya uske bade mein me kya inedi goc ye mere  The one in my life who is making fun of me publicly, because of what is this in India, this hosting has started in the West also, it is being made a call like social media, a call cannot be made because of what is our country.  There is a lot of insecurity in me, we have not yet reached that level where we are not comfortable, till now we did not have the freedom, that is, now we were voting, the whites were ruling, yesterday we were fine, now it is 75 years, this is how our DNA is. Brother, I too have not removed that. After 100 years, we can joke about things but we cannot do so now and our country is so diversified, everyone is struggling with their own different things. Okay, you who came from the North East are ours. Brothers and sisters and they are citizens of our country. You pick them up and call them Chinki. If someone compares something with Chinese, then our children have to study with someone who comes from there. They give live scenes of their delivery etc.  Drama means that to you, someone's face, story, meeting someone, you know, you and North Indians do a lot with you, I have seen this, I am also a North Indian, so I am not making fun of you, I am directly condemning you.  If you attack someone then go straight to him, condemn him, fight, do whatever you want, why are you making fun of him, why are you making fun of him, why are you wearing a mask, God is you, you want people, you want racial discrimination.  Casteism is sitting inside our blood, okay class consciousness, I don't know how much of it there are, all these diseases are running inside us and then we are wearing a mask, I was just kidding, I don't have the courage to try, now the country is social and democratic. Right is done, all are equal, Constitution is all good, you can't actually do yours, if you do then you will get a struggling position as per Dr., this joke has been read at many places, it's good, do anything, make fun.  If you ever enter Bangalore, if this ridiculous joke is happening to you, then do not sign it. The people who make fun are very close to us. Okay, it is late Raju Srivastava ji and he is the one who used to make fun of anyone.  He didn't use to do it, but these days, is there a way in stand up comedy that you can do this, so it is acceptable, okay, in that you capture the crowd, then what does it do, does this, does that, so People are so confused, youth is confused, then because of that confusion they are immediately told that you are not on call, that means I am making fun of you and if you are not able to bear it then you are not on call, now there is no pressure on you to remain on call.  If you have peer pressure, then I can give you any trauma because of it, so understand that what is being done to you in the name of coolness can also be taken back and you can never get over it with someone.  Don't do it directly, tell him I don't want to play this game, he says no, you say something in my bad, many people would like such a prism, you also say something in my bad, I do n't want to play dirty games, you say something in my bad, I am reducing the period.

    "title": "IKIGAI Concept ： Big Clarity On It Given [Mtgr4k2Fljo].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, many of you have come across this concept, they say that do such work in life, which is the second thing the world needs, what you can be paid for what you love and what you are good at, so in English they call it passion mission.  Profession Vocation, it feels good to hear all this in English, the presentation comes round, it becomes round that which I like very much, which the world also needs, which gets money and which the world also needs and by doing that in such a way that If it becomes possible, brother, this work has to be done. The youth gets very impressed by this. Someone has written a practical matter about how America runs after the Japanese lose their context. Then we go crazy like this. This happens how many times in our country of India, we do not see that one is coming from ahead and one is coming from here and then you are coming from here and there is jam there and that one is coming, then how can we do this?  Let's take this American can die  If he goes there, he will not be able to survive there, okay, so now I want to tell you that friend, you are youth, 22 2 24 25 years old, what are you good at, you have never done anything, so what are you good at, then it is wrong.  You must be good at something. Hey, a man becomes good only when he does something on a sustainable basis. Then it will be called passion. Hey, passion will also come only when you do something. There is a problem here.  It is said that you are not getting a job, your business is not going well, when you start getting money, you become passionate about that thing. If I tell you to pick up this junk item and this newspaper and take these 10 hawkers and collect them here.  You will get money there, this much is the margin, this is this much of plastic, this is this much of this, is there any sexiest job, is it a scrap dealer, but brother, money is there, then when a lot of money comes, then the man becomes passionate about it, example. If I am telling you then even this passion is nothing, I am very passionate about singing, I want to become a singer, there is no strength in your voice, you cannot go anywhere, you cannot reach, the one who tells me is like this brother, demotivate.  Don't do this to our children, I have left this consultation for the children, now I am in 12th, 12th and college, I say, I do it for the employed people, I don't have to do it for those below that. Push and start whatever you want, yes brother, we don't know what to do brother, just fold your hands like this, you did school for 12 years, you did college for 4 years, if after studying for 16 years, even after studying for 18 years, you do n't know what to do in life.  What else are you asking by giving money to someone then you are a fool yes you are doing something and then you have to change something and you tried to do something yes then we can talk that atleast if you did something then this  Passion is nothing because passion is I was very passionate. This is English. Good at nothing is because when you have not done anything. What the world needs is that it is changing itself. Half of what the world needs is a need created by force. It was never there.  Do n't even do this work, this has to be done Eat breakfast like a king Eat breakfast like a king Why brother, there is no need to eat like a king comfortably even at 11-12 o'clock  You could eat food like bars, but they were to sell you those serials, if you tell any story then needs are created, then what the world needs and if that need is not actual but can be created, then you will never figure out and  That it itself can change what you can be paid for is a very you can be paid for anything question is how much you can be paid for that  Only you can be paid, so everything can be done, you can do any work, but the question is how much payment can be made for it. For example, I will tell you that you become a badminton player, which game you play becomes important. And if you are a cricketer then in cricket you have played Na Na Na India, it is okay that you play Ranji regularly but if a team takes you in IPL then you can earn two to four five crores and in badminton you can earn world cup.  Even if India is number one, you cannot earn that much. It depends on which game you are playing. The lowest person in a game means the lowest person in IPL, who has not played country, has not played West Zone, has never been in the regular team of Ranji.  But he earns a decent amount there, he has also created a social media account, he also got a D-pad and he came to Mumbai Indian and a D-bud came there too and they marketed him in different places.  she would have done it  He earned money even though he doesn't even play all the matches of IPL. Okay, and here we have no money in badminton. There is more money in tennis. The number 50 in tennis earns more money than the number 1, so this thing is very important for us.  Which game do you want to play? You are very good at badminton. We are talking about money. No, you have self-satisfaction. Why are people so busy with English? I don't understand.  If so, will some people who don't play badminton still come? What is the point? They will not understand that this guy concept is very faulty and not practical. Yes this is what you may like to do at the age of 42 and beyond which I am. Golden age of 42 tells me yes your should be to reach this place but you can't start wit at this place youngsters don't have such luxury everybody  The Stage You Can't Start At This So Come Like Me And Share The Knowledge Because I Am Living This Also Living This Akshay Srivastava Also Living This Those Who Tell Stories By Cut Copy Paste Are Also Living This Sandeep Mahesh Ji Also Living This Everyone  Buddy I am living this they are reaching this zone that where the world needs all this, we like it, we are helping, we must be getting some money from somewhere, by doing something like this, we can reach this stage, so we  You can tell, ok but it is not applicable for you brother, you are 22 years old, you do not know anything, you have to learn, you do not have the luxury of any passion, you are 24 years, 28 years, 30 years, yes 152 years, when you work your M.  Should be to reach here so understand this iga concept that this exists this is an ideal situation yes this can be our goal yes we should try  To reach here if you're a 48 year old 45 year old 42 year old 42 is the cut off age 42 has crossed you and you're not close to it You're doing what you don't like You're doing what you're not  Good At You're Doing What May Be The World Dozen Needs Than You're Not Riching Anywhere And You 17 18  Made 20 years worth but when you will start you will start from a place when you are not good at that may be you don't even like it world needs it not needs it so time will tell how much is needed and how much payment is being received  That too will be known with time, so I hope that I have given you this clarity, you have understood this thing well, please share, like and  If you want to become a member of the channel then you can also become a member of Paisa Sukoon Membership and be a part of the webinars and workshops which I do thank you very much."

    "title": "India As A Stock And Foreign Settlement Decision [pJNJUgrHIbQ].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, India as a stock and foreign settlement, going abroad, recently I did a video in which I told the youth to go abroad, two-three years before that I had a different opinion, so many people commented on it in the comment section. Hey, your view has become 180 degrees, so beyond that I will try to give you a little explanation and one more thing to teach you that Keynes was a very famous economist in his life.  There is a famous dialogue that one fact changes I change my opinion what do you do sir, this saying is very famous, if India is a stock then let's say if there is one stock in the stock market then there is a buy on every stock. Hold Sell No Stock Is Forever a Buy and Forever a Sell and Forever a Hold It Depends on Lot of Things Whenever we buy any share in a company what do we check What kind of company is it, what is the potential, what is the growth rate, what is the corporate governance, what is the share holding of the promoter, what are the cash flows, what is the reputation of the product in the market, how is the general environment, what kind of investors are there, is the product selling well or selling less? You form an opinion on the basis of how the future prospects will be and this opinion becomes a reputation over a period of years and then changes over a period of time.  It may also depend on the circumstances, was Kodak always a buy or was it always a sell? If someone did not change himself then the Kodak company would be closed. Do you know what happened to India Nakia and Kodak?  But in that, if someone was saying that brother, stay extremely bullish here, then if you had removed extremely from extremely bullish, then now you have come to bullish, from bullish, then you go down some more.  You can depend on the situation, now one thing is being seen that people in India are struggling for jobs, they are preparing for the exam, so I made a video from the practical in which I said, look outside also, brother, which one should do what? Many people wrote to me in the comment section, Guruji, now we are starting consultation on this. Till then I had no idea but you people gave me the idea.  So I do not have any expertise in consultation, but you can use anyone who has expertise and through this video, if you are an NRI and are listening to this video and are in any country, then you can touch the number given by me.  I can stay, I can have a one on one discussion with you if you want for 15-20 minutes and what are the opportunities in your country, how did you go, how is it there now, that country can be Norway, can be Denmark. Maybe Spain, maybe Greece, maybe US etc. I want to avoid it because it is difficult to go there. I actually want to do whatever is practical, so I will do it for free. We will talk for free because I have done a lot of things.  Seeing the interest, many people wrote in it, Guru Guru ji, you are absolutely right, we emerged like this, this is the advantage, this is the advantage, then people are asking each other, hey brother, where are you, what to do, how to reach, so there is definitely a lot of confusion.  because the market  Either someone will charge a hefty fee and tell me something, is it okay? Or else, I will help you as much as I can through my channel. Find all your relatives, brother, friend's relative, relative 's friend, whoever is from your mother's side.  It may be from mom's side or dad's side, maybe someone you know knows someone, so you have to find him out and the one who is an NRI, I want to tell you now without hanging anyone because this NRI is the most  this is the big fear  I fear that this relative will come to my house, which is a very justified fear because we are mostly Indians. I can say that, look, this is one reason for me not to go abroad right now because I live in India and am exposed to the dust, bumps and potholes here. I have a moral right to say something boldly, so I have the moral right to go to Germany and then speak to India after having fun. Now, I live at home, so someone should say something to his father in his own house. Said father, who can speak to the government, I am not enjoying living here, it doesn't seem right to me if I go out, this is my thinking because now my work is my business, so if I go out, only a few things will stop.  It will have to be done, the air will be good, now I am saying this, people like us i.e. people like me will make the country smooth in five to seven years. Travel around for five to seven years, bring exposure and tell us how things are happening outside.  and the country itself  We have to improve. I am talking about patriotism. What happens many times? Friend, go out and see what happens outside. You will not get exposure. It is not necessary to struggle unnecessarily here and there. It is not necessary to live in the garbage. What kind of people should go?  What should not be known, what is there beyond that, follow videos will come further, this can also become a beautiful series, if you people want, but we are blind, we cannot say no, I will buy only this stock, I will not buy any other, even then your returns.  Optimum will not be found many times. You should look here and there too. There are many countries, what is happening in Malta, what is happening in Morocco, what is happening in Spain, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, there are many people, people have crossed these five or six countries of the normal circuit. No one tells me that I have done it to the people of Latin America. One person wrote to me, Guruji, don't say anything, the competition will increase. Do n't live like this, friend, will the competition increase? Blue Ocean.  There is an opportunity, every man does not go after hearing this. Now I tell you, whoever you are, eat less food and do more exercise. Guruji, I have taken the paper now, everyone will become fair after having a six pack and all the girls will marry him.  You will tremble. Hey brother, it does n't happen like this, it is not possible to become fat and thin, it is easy to say, try it, study more, all the exams will be passed, yes, study is not possible and study more yourself.  So if someone else is doing more than you, then no, read a lot of books, get the stock market learned, you will become rich, if you do n't read books, if you do n't understand, then don't get it so quickly, it is not that easy, I am giving knowledge to the world.  Go here or go there, I am not going myself, I am trapped emotionally, mentally and physically, it is okay, emotions are also a game, maybe I too would have gone 20 years ago, now I am not going, that is why I am telling others. That if you are in your 20s, many people have said, no, no, it becomes difficult to leave the job, if you have children, wife, it becomes even more difficult, yes, then it also becomes difficult if the parents become extremely old, so that is why I  He said, I can go in 20, if I don't get married in 20 then no, a video will be made on who will I get married to, no one said that I will get married, how will I get married, take me if you do n't get married, but why would a girl do this, so the girl who wants to bet on you.  not ready for that  Don't marry 24 24 year olds, go get married, there are companies with you, you will also get into bad habits there, check each other, no, but will any girl marry, can try, come on, you also go for a walk, who is yours?  What's going on, you are preparing for the exam, let your family members do this to you, do that, do this, we both will go, we will not spend on marriage, I am telling you practical things, get me married, then put dollars in our bank. going  Don't spend any money, come on, live your Simran, go with Raj, what Simran does is nothing great, what Raj does is no great, both of them are going abroad, they are married, we will do it, but those Simrans who want ready-made secrets,  Absolutely, brother, then the story gets different, that is your arranged marriage, it can be in love marriage, so there are many options, in India right now such jobs are not seen increasing as you want, there are a lot of possibilities outside, now someone is very skilled.  If you go there, you will earn more money. If you go there, you will earn less skill. But at least you will know what to do there. Go there, get skill and come back. Many people wrote about me in that, get endoscopy done there, colonoscopy, so much medical, so many old people.  Why would you have to go through colonoscopy and endoscopy and get all these things done? When you become so old, why don't you go brother? Then what kind of medical issues do you get at the age of 20? What kind of hell are you living a life like this?  You and it may be possible that if you are living like this, then it is possible that you will get fine after getting good air there and anyway, if there is any medical emergency, if anything happens, then get treatment in India, I know a lot about getting root canal treatment in India.  They come and meet their relatives, they also get a root canal done and their money is also saved, in this the traveling expenses are covered, one has to spend so much, look at the practicality, the one who does not want to go and cry, that is a different thing.  is my channel  This is for people who want possibilities, who are curious, my channel is not for any reason, to whom I can spoon feed you, tell me, I like the idea very much, now tell me why should I tell you, I have told you the idea, I have shown you the path, this is what you have to tell me, the agent.  This thing does not exist in your mind. Capital of Bulgaria Sofia. If you did not know before I told you, then that thing does not exist in your mind. That thing was like India always. Vasco Deri Gama used to come and see India for a while. Vasco Deri Gama was escorted by an Indian big ship which had gone to Africa to sell goods and they claimed that we discovered that you were a crazy child at that time.  Now the story has become twisted, now India is not that India which people come and discover, it is now the West, there are some things to discover, some countries, let's discuss and discover.  And learn, go as a tourist and go as per the learning. I am saying that this is youth, do not waste 21 to 30 years in exam preparation, understand the basic underlying principle, gain experience, people get a lot of opportunities as they age.  If the population is working, there are no working hands. If you learn Japanese then go to Japan and see it. Learn Spanish. Go to Spain and see Germany. Learn German. Learn German. Come to Germany. Anyway, the people are taught French.  French is also spoken in many countries. French is not spoken only in France. I see many children learning French in the same way. They have also taken Sanskrit. Otherwise, think of monetizing these languages ​​which you learn in schools. Now you have learned Spanish. Lee means because you had to learn a language in class. If you have learned it then go to Spain once or visit Spain. Spanish is spoken in Latin America. Explore Spain. Go to Mexico also where the language is spoken. So I am encouraging this.

    "title": "Indian Men Need To Accept This Hard Truth [x7YL6Vacy3w].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, the topic is hard truth about Indian mother, you need to know and digest and to escape its escape source, many YouTubers have made videos, there are many books, it is discussed in many mainstream also, but this truth is that you will get respect for your money.  According to earning capacity, weather you like it or you don't like it and I will tell it factually and this is not here, this world war is like this, thousands of years ago how many animals were killed and brought back.  You would feed your family, then when agriculture came, how much work would you do in agriculture? Then those other medical times came where everyone used to come under attack and fighting was the test of life. Then you will get a child for your family, you will be able to know and do what you want with him.  We used to get respect, it is okay only then and all the children used to say that this father will die to save us, now the time has come, the role of the father is the nurturer in the form of astrology.  Those who know, it is seen from the new house, religion is also the same house, Guru is also the same house and father is also the same house and the father is Palanpur Hare, the father is considered to be the Guru, the father is considered to be the nurturer, the mother is considered to give birth.  There are many recorded but the lifetime of the whole life is that which is the role of the father. The role of the mother ends after five, six and eight, 10 years of the child's life. He added yellow lamps, made him bigger, made the body fine, just more food, one.  Gave me my whole life after that Till the death of the father, till the death of the father, there is a rule, if it is possible, every man cannot work for 80 thousand, but the best of now is the best of being, licking it. Noted it, if you earn lakhs of rupees, then you are a butter father who  80 thousand work is not done. No, if you can do 20 lakh work or 2 crore work and by passing the time wasting time as a drunkard, a cigarette smoker, you somehow manage to run a 10 lakh shop, then the work is 10 lakh but.  You are an irresponsible person, compared to the one who has killed ₹ 80000, but his method is fine, I hope you are giving the essence, you are understanding, otherwise it is very easy to spoil this video, it is very easy for the man, many say, I will use the money. So why would I marry because women are like this, they are like that, there is a big narrative going on that I will always be judged by my brother-in-law, income earning capacity, income earning capacity, this is directly. Proportional To Ability Of De Person Debt Maa You Create Value What Value Website Be Match Money You Bill Make Many People Come To Me For Consultation Brother Saheb In Company No Company Is Useless Doesn't Pay Money Doesn't Pay Much Salary I Said Again Freshen The Company  Don't say this is bad, the company doesn't pay me much, do n't say this, the company had no money, one thing is not the same thing, it pays you less money, but the same company is paying more money to someone else. Hai tere bus ko bus ko bus ko bus ko bus ko bus ko or that direct ko kahani se kuch hai ki yes to then their capability you on and add value in de company more so they get more simply you increase your capability cry why is this man today  On this day, no one is taking out his sword, no swayamvar is taking place, no fights are taking place, no horse fighting is taking place, no anything is happening, so how many tangible things are there today, which is money, which is the money in the account, which is the car?  How is it, how much will it provide and it is like the kingdom of Narmada, what is the item in it, let us see who will provide me the best, where will my children get protection and what will happen for me and on this basis IT will be selected.  It's so fair and simple, you are crying, you are taking a salary of ₹ 40,000, we come, the one with lakh rupees will attract a butter girl, so why are you crying with the one with salary of ₹ 2 lakhs? Butter will attract, this is the law of a method, the topic of pain and suffering is bothering you, you can not expect that my salary is above Rs 40,000, a girl earning Rs 2.5 lakh, a very beautiful dimple, the one who performs the aarti of my mother, I will not get it.  Not getting accepted Increase your value adding capacity if you should know how to do and reduce your desire because of the difference between  Reality and Aspiration: This one is sad, the one who is like this is happy and it has become more different that he should have this status, so brother, then be sad, this is his status, then this should be what he wants, or take this, maybe you will get this, that's all or  Then make yours a little bigger, brother, I want it, this is my status only, so I made my status a little bigger and reduce my desires a little, talk about your mother, you can cry a little, oh my God, things, it is very difficult, it is this  Very difficult, you too mother in today's man, it is very difficult to be a man these days, it is difficult for us, this is praise for women, how are they enjoying, please like those on the video at this very moment, man, these things are very true and cool, these women tell us. Men can also like and can lionize each other too. Men, look at the Indian content. Maximum, there has been no progress in the last 25 years. Women have learned to drive where they can drive. Learned to fight, learned to drive, Learned to reduce the bank's expenses, Learned to reduce money, Learned to wish, Learned to do all the things that men used to do, Learned to do more butcher and also know how to reduce their living expenses, They have nothing in a man. Shikha is not an upgrade, even at first she asks stupidly, if he is a week student then he will travel, how to press the shirt, put it on and press it in such a way that those who don't know, don't make some children happy by upgrading themselves. This student who has never studied, if he fails, he will definitely fail. Brother, if you can't earn much money, then help a little in the household, he will also become a hit. You are a woman but I am a man and I do n't have much of a system, so this is an inheritance given to you by your father, that time was different, your mother was a housewife, that time was different, the attraction of men was different, she was very good.  saw the time  Dad is coming home, all YouTube. If father's question is not asked these days, then this is the Iranian situation. You will have to reduce it, you will not have that much because now is not the time to ask, earlier there were slow pace of life, so there was a question in that, there were five ho caste.  Okay, not now, now your wife is also engaged in grinding, she does n't have time to perform your aarti, you do n't have time for hers, both of you trust each other and love each other and decide how long you want to stay with each other.  Of  Keep doing that, do it, but the amount of money you earn is a tangible thing and there is no other thing. Money is less useful but if you are intelligent, then what to do with intelligence. You may be very intelligent, you have a good heart, your child's school is good.  Fees should not be given, power is there but respect is there. When you have insurance at home, you cannot go to the hospital and give a little respect, friend, take 10 grams of respect and put it in your heart, if you don't want too much.  If it is useful then you have to do something in the house, you have to do something with your wife by helping in the house so that she can get the money, that too is your indirect way of earning money. If you take mother's suggestion, is there any husband, I am again some husband and he. Suppose he has lost ₹ 80000 and his wife is no longer available, so now he is not going from 80 to 2 lakhs. This is happening with many people, so can he take out some time from his time and set his ego a little?  by doing  By contributing something in the house and giving a little free time to the wife, she can do 40 thousand rupees of work so that the income of the house becomes ₹ 20000. This tax has been done by this because many husbands call their egos as their Chaudhary in their Chaughat. His potential is also not being realized and he is guilty. If now 1 lakh 20 thousand families will earn then it will also be said that yes, your direct contribution is 80.40.  Your individual contribution is not that you stop at 80. Yes, capacity in the market is available to everyone. If you are in a job, it is not that in a job at 80, you will be worth three and it is also not that you can do three.  He is a good father, a good father, who is living with the feeling that this is my duty, this is my religion, this is my duty, this is my religion, this is the note de ve which is running on Equator and this is on Facebook, this is on YouTube and this.  The religion that is shown in the movies, this religion is less, but no one wants that, everyone wants this one of theirs, religion is in danger, religion is in danger because everyone does not reduce theirs, how much time will it take if no one is in danger?  Do you waste at home, make a cup of tea, make two cups of tea, make half a cup of tea on a Saturday, take you out for a walk once in a while, fix some shoes and slippers in your house, fix your bedsheet and bed seat.  Monitor your children, why not?  Please tell everyone, explain how you liked the video, tell me how you liked the video, I come in a practical way, I encourage you, there is relief in every video, there is a need to take out veterinary medicine to do something and to do something else because Vikram wants to sit after cooling down, mother and still he is reducing his glasses.  Look, those who are meant to be public figures and do n't know what people are talking about and yet they keep on doing less, some people praise, some people don't, they did n't want to sit sad, my respect will be less. Elections are lost for the state, now I do n't reduce it and will reduce it. If it is gone then learn from one state. Elections are lost for the state and we will do less with more passion. Now another statement also comes, now we will reduce it with more force in husband and real life.  Why don't you understand that my respect is getting less than mine, I will just catch more, I will be more Mullah, you are the original, is it right, which V is this, what do you want? Hey brother, it is like this, you will have to do it and you don't have much clipping. Not alone, it is not happening for anyone else, and for how many people are you doing it? Tell me, please write in the comment area. If you have not subscribed to the channel, please do so. Thank you."

    "title": "Interest Rate And Real Estate ｜ A New Perspective In Current Times [mB1nxJsQnLU].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today I want to give clarity, the topic is on interest rates and home home and home loan and how people are not able to understand. First it has increased from 7% to 7:30 then it has become 8:30 what people are not able to understand about home loan.  Releasing in they are not comparing it with inflation If you check now, inflation is running close to 7 7.1 but in North Indian state  Separately, 9% has come out, there is a data from the government, you can Google it, so if my home loan is between 8.25 or 8.5 and my inflation is at 9, then I am getting -5-75. You can get this.  The thing to be understood is that if you ever look at the interest rates then look at it like this if inflation is 4% and interest rate is 7% because the value of money is decreasing if you have invested 20 years before late.  If you had taken a loan of Rs 10 lakh, then the burden of Rs 10 lakh that was sitting on your head 20 years ago is not visible today because the value of money would have reduced. I am trying to explain to you in the form of some data, you should understand carefully. When demonetization happened, India was  There was 17-18 lakh crore cash in 18 lakh crore 17.96 this is the exact figure I think, guess around 18 lakh, you are ok, now 30 lakh crore cash. 12 lakh crore cash has been added in the last 6 years, cash with an average of 2 lakh crore cash is being added every year, that money is coming in and at this rate as it is now it is 30 lakh crore, so it can happen in a year.  For example, if the economy grows then it will cross 50 lakh crores in 6 years and even cross 50 lakh crores in this time. Due to inflation in the share market, which company has the pricing power?  We do n't have pricing power, we don't have any idea about it, will there be any margin road for that, should we invest money in share market but now is the time, it is real estate development. When you are taking loan, that money is not yours but it is percentage and I have 8:  I am getting 30, I am getting 8.1 but I am getting 8.25 depending on how much is mine, so this can never be a bad thing for me, the only thing is, friends, if my job is fine, I am a professional, my wife has an editing job.  So you can easily plan your leverage in the times to come. This state is going to do very well. You are on an optic path. Lot of family going times will go for smaller houses. Smaller units and will not stage a larger unit. Ok.  Hajj is one of my campaigns, anyway, I have another channel called Sangolife Sutra, you can watch the videos on it and many good comments also come and there is a campaign that Son and daughter-in-law should not live with periods. They should live in the adjacent house so that all the benefits are already playing out. I can clearly see the train but it will accelerate in the coming times. So right now these real assets are fine. Yes do invest.  In equity also but in HD in cash and keeping money in the form of money is of no use in the times to come. Keep an eye on inflation. Inflation is not going to disappear anywhere very soon. It may reduce now because of  Higher base rate is ok but it is not going to disappear anywhere so if you have you be smart it is like running on treadmill you stay at the same place if you keep running then incoming times it will become challenge really very fast this date is middle class Go on Ishwar history and middle class can avail it because they can get loans, I have not yet got formal income, take more class today and they are not able to give results.  You should leverage the earning and science to make it comfortable and give Kant Catapult now. The earnings of the middle class are rising so greatly but please it is everything is in informal way you can get loans here. Loan rates are very high these classes are catching up.  Today if the middle class dajunt has good leverage and dajunt get into real assets which will become very difficult for this people too Acquire this they will merge with d lower class lower class will become lower middle class and middle middle and middle class everywhere will collapse you are middle class and there will be a big lower middle class in d country this is what time is saying you have  Protect So What Happens There Are Time Spent Me Salary Is Not Increasing Cre Times In My Income Is Not Increasing  I am stuck with 1.5 lakh income and 1.4 lakh but it is coming in un formal way. I have bank account there history date is un civil score I can leverage it because if you just put 5000 20000 in SIP you are not becoming rich.  In 3 years you are boy 20 In this people give a figure 20 years you know what  Inflation is so ufafalation is 789% and another thing is going to get 10 11 12% + 1 2 3% only it is not something great if you understand and the informal sector which is this one is going to get it then your advantage is the most  What is the date you can tell me to leverage it for the middle class, I am giving clarity to the lower class and the audience which is  It's like please start putting your money in the bank take start having a financial history ok adervise you will never be able you will keep roaming around with money in hand you will keep putting it under the bed somewhere this will create a lot of development this money which I you guys  The demon of inflation is on the move, it is destroying them like termites, so the advice to them too is to reduce the distance, brother, use your leverage, take things real. Stay in assets and tell papa and mom also to reduce the game of FT HD because you are getting full HD on 665, it will turn into dust at 775, you will not get anything in 80s for that ₹ 20 lakhs.  That HD is giving you ₹ 10000 per month, 6% is fine and many people get less than that, the interest rates in banks will also reduce in the future due to inflation.  Already is reducing money to -3% because nine percent I told in North India is already -3 for sir shot so it will make sense for this people also you get in assets giantly Vidya next generation because without 2030 lakhs actually  On a big asset date is also not so you can combine your resources and money with the next generation and  Make assets which are giving cash flows in terms of rent because you are not only capital appreciation happens but also rental comes in a cash flow and matter when it is rent is it good to invest in mutual fund or it has to be done  Be never you and among you, I will follow me please type this device, if 1020 people will follow it then it will be full. Happy you understood it well and you will follow it ok so please type thank you very much"

    "title": "Investing In Sovereign Gold Bonds [w7wVQp6cMFk].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today's topic will be that investment in gold can be done through these methods, we will discuss this a little, I will also tell you my favorite method, you can put a repeat in the comment section, so we should use gold in our portfolio.  According to this, 510% should be bold. There are ways to buy it. One is to go to the shop and buy physical gold. It has its limitations - storage, security, and purity. These are the three things. On top of this, there are making charges, plus it tastes tasty and requires a lot of investment.  If you are looking at it then it is not necessarily a good thing plus he gives something to his wife in his own way, you give something in his neck, give something in his ears, after a limit it is okay, on the back of no tuition he goes to the locker and from locker to locker  It keeps getting transferred and even give anything much and as they say it is free, earlier it was considered as Stridhan (stridhan) also for safety ladies did not have anything of their own, earlier Vaishno bank accounting and no demand nothing to sort see  There is some physical gold in our families which is 10000 times more. I will not deny it. But if you also want to buy gold coins, then you will see that the current rate of gold is 5104. Then you will get 6112. Check today's rate. Do it by Google, okay, so in that if I have already given 20%, then keep the return, then it is with the idol, okay, so according to that, it is not a good investment, for peace, letters should be given and taken a little, okay, this trailer of G  People also believe that it is good according to the calculation, they believe that the thing is right and it should be so, but this does not mean that if I want to fold my 3% portfolio in physical gold, then you do not have to keep it in the way I have invested.  There were problems, I have listed them to you. The second method is ETF, exchange traded fund, demat of exchange traded fund. If you go there, there are big fund houses, you will get their gold of different houses. You can get HDFC's gold if you google it. There are five of their gold houses.  let's give it okay and you can take it it is patient backdrop  Of physical activity is very much in it, if you buy it anytime on daily basis, then this management this story incurs a little loss because it is done in its name, gold investment has to be shown by keeping physical gold, then take your money, appoint subscribe button more returns So this festival z30 go to your house, see how dangerous it is, if you buy pills worth 1 lakh then go again next year for ₹2000, whatever its value will increase or decrease every year, 2% of it will keep going, which is the third and last  Which is my favorite, Sober and Gold Bond, this is the shoot of Government of India, whenever the video is being shot, it is open till 24th August, you can buy it, I will make a separate video on the side for the method of buying it, if you guys  If you are interested then what is this sobering gold bond Sharda Bhawan suit karda government what is the biggest benefit in this that unlike physical gold and tiffin every Muslim this blinker income tax and service loop okay you will have to pay income tax but in this you will get income  Tax  It is best that you do not have to pay any amount, so if I buy sovereign gold bonds of Rs. 1 crore, it is fine and it becomes gold, sometimes I had to give Rs. 2 crore as an example, so it makes you a professional, it is a big deal and secondly, it is a big deal  By adding you can find the path of looking for a gas but ATS can test it, the government also gives you interest in it, situated at high, now if you want to understand this with equity, I will tell you two best pimples, okay, so this battery will go long  Anytime in the term, look at the returns of good in eight years, write a story, fuel in ATS, look at the TRP blast funds, it gives a new sentence, do not compare tweets, you get ten percent return in equity, do it at the same time, okay, so one on that  10 per cent becomes taxable, so you will get 9 percent of the activity and if you want 9 percent return in this and from gold bond, then 2.5 percent, so government interest is 1.5 percent, so if I deduct that 9 percent, then 6.5 percent will be saved.  If gold gives me a return of six and a half percent, then I reach nine percent, then if it gives you a return of ten percent, then sixty five percent returns from the board's returns Aftab Activity Liter Your Touching Mackay Equity Returns I don't like all this but  I'll tell you how much percent of subscription should be there in Sara that any physical situation comes, anything should be there on the screen, like anything should be there in your portfolio, subscribe to subscribe our, but I can tell you guys that if you buy it electronically, then the outline and discount  You can get it at the rate of Rs. 70 which has been issued by the Gram Government. If you buy it from Electronic Leadership Readymade, you will get it for Rs. 50 less, it will be available for Rs. 5147 and you can easily buy it in demat form. You will keep getting interest, so it's something which investors need to look at, not that it means that physical gold has a limit, I think you should learn to keep it at home and also in the locker Not only this, there is a limit on the number of things to be kept and from making charges, breaking charges and GST on them and GST on that, by getting the tax done, it is written in a lot to me, if it is too childish then the end user can be used as collateral also in  Times of need is okay, because of this there is something which Ajay due to the investors but it's something that those people who are knowing this are not nibbling the back a little bit in their mind, so I request you people to see how this thing is, the Government of India is the best  And it is a good instrument and investments in other acid classes, if you are liking this type of video, please request to like it and write something good in the comment section, okay, different gas stomach small investment spaces, those who  You know that there is no revision, I had heard this lightly, I listened to it carefully that it must be completely new for the people, so for those for whom it was new write that and for those who knew it but it was not new write that, yes we also came to know that  type like with voice  It is to take, many times I think that if someone has a daughter or someone has a son etc. then we can open it or want to take it, then the second group is to collect gold because if you want to open 20 poles on the marriage of your friends  You will buy it on the same day and keep it at the gold rate or at any price because your daughter will like the design after so many years, both of these start on this the lady said goodbye to you, it is your daughter's birthday or it is your daughter's one day  So you put something around it and what happens many times is that grandfather gave the money, mother gave the money, grandmother gave the money, maternal grandparents gave the money, somehow some money came in the name of the child or you put something from your side, masculine friend  And for 5 grams how much gold can you buy with it, listen, from one gram you can buy up to 4G, so desi means there is no need to pay this much, in the family, okay family means in this way the charges are very high but Dussehra  20 grams third whenever it comes you can easily buy me one gram so nothing is ok so that means  As you buy it, he will really become a don and that 8 year, 9 year, 16 year old, so if the eight year old child turns 24, then you have to buy 200 grams of gold in his name, you are doing it in his name So directions where you can mentally dietitian goal returns confusing returns having different that stock market quality suits John, he catches it he says there are returns from opening otherwise in last 20 from 2000 you can see my subscriber telegram group or  Which can be done in my description or in the comment section, so it does n't matter much to me if you are growing taller, then in this golden 102 years, if you went to 1948 in 2019, then the habit of voting is that of going to one of them again  If you do it solid for two-three years then right now it is running between 28 and 5000 rupees fine and in 338 it was just done in one year above 35000 when you do it  So it used to be 35 per cent, then if you measure it like this and in a pro time, then you will get FD returns of hundred percent because the government is paying the dry person, there is no tax on it today if you have a period of five or six percent.  So tax is levied on that as well, you know that days are cut and then the person becomes unemployed, this is gold investment and please share the video with your friends, those who want to share it with women, share it with teachers, I do a lot of consultation in gold and my friend is well into the actual gold digger, true or not, create space for teachers, I mean it's not that I am feeling like this, so I request you guys to also demand from the teachers to open their hands of their digital gold Play this beneficial physical gold, according to me it is not right to keep it more than a limit, thank you are a"

    "title": "Investment Planning Now ： Where Are We Headed After This Budget ？ [bfYgVnpQTEU].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, there is a lot of discussion on the budget. There is a lot of discussion on two things, why did this happen and what will happen next? What does the government want? These two things are, Yes, long term capital gains tax on financial assets should be banned.  If financial assets are at 12.5, then long term capital gains tax is at 10. For equity held more than one year in share market, which has been at 10. Increased to 12.5 by the government Short term capital gains tax has also been increased from 15 to 20 and indexation cost has been removed from the capital gains calculation of real estate and it has been reduced from 20 to 12.5 so this has happened as will  Very Bad Some Will Say, Don't Know Some Bad Will Say  Sano Ki But You Have To Realize As Smart Investors As Youth As People Who Have To Live A Life And Live Here Earn Invest And Make Life Worth It Is Okay Money Wise Have Security Of Life Why This Happened So You Have To Understand Like I  In the first video, I had explained that in the bank and you people must have seen my videos, the first one was on a different channel, Sango Real Estate, then in the live, I had told about the issues of bank deposits.  What was happening was that people had stopped depositing money in banks, everyone was depositing money in mutual funds, so it is necessary to give a little shock to the government. The government cannot come in control exactly but it has to be disincentivized because now if the tax keeps increasing then many  People will say let's do FD, we will not get into the good and bad of it, what is happening is that the valuation of the market gets stretched out.  The capital of the stock market is 1.3 times the GDP i.e. at 130 and if people keep investing money in the market then will the profits of the companies be increasing so much? If there is a bubble in the market and there is a crash, then  People will suffer even more. Right now you are suffering only by 100%, so a little correction in the market, a little steam coming out, putting four drops of water on a little hot pan like this is the job of the government from time to time. Yes and maybe in future it will not stop at 12:30, it will slowly go in the direction of 15 173 20 25 30. What else is there in real estate? In real estate, the government is saying that you have bought a house, buy a good house, buy a good place. What is the need to trade again and again? Every time I bought it and sold it. Under construction for two years, one year, 3 years, 4 years. Bought it and sold it again and again. What is the profit? No, there is no gain. So if you sell it, then the gain is with you only, eat all the rental income, eat it on cash flow and in that also on rent, the government has added a new thing that the common man who used to work can consider rent as his income.  He had to show only end tax, the businessmen used to show it separately and take the expenses from him, by showing the business income in such a way that now that too has level playing field for the common man. Many a times, what good has the government done for us? Look, we are going to cry. What is the middle class? What is the middle class? Mostly salaried class. For you, level flying peed has also been given. Other wise, we don't know the good that it could have done. Comparatively, if your  If there is rent from property, then the rental income will be calculated from the house only, it will be a different calculation, which was happening anyway, it is not making any difference to the salaried people but that of the business people.  If there used to be a separate shana panti, then many things have been good. Look at the direction of the government. Brother, even if the government does not have indexation, if we invest up to Rs 2 crore then the capital gain is adjusted. Now people will say no, this used to happen earlier too.  Yes, this used to happen earlier also, it happens even now, so there is no difference, if you want to own a property, if I do n't want to buy a property, then there are REC bonds, yes, up to Rs 50 lakh, if you have two.  People can have property in their name worth up to Rs 1 crore, but if I don't want to do it there, then I will have to pay tax. If I bought a plot worth Rs 10 lakh, it becomes worth Rs 1.5 crore, so I will have to pay something too.  If the government wants to stay in the country, then all of them should be like this, no profit, no giving to me, brother, this is the rule, this country will run like this, it will keep expanding beyond this, then what will you do, I am saying that you will show displeasure with one party and the next.  They will take the tax, then what will you do and will you increase it, won't you? I will go somewhere outside, then there is no tax, is n't it? I have heard that there is no tax in Dubai, so there is no tax on income, so there is no tax on income. Do you want to go to Dubai like this?  You will start earning money, if you are so smart, then who is stopping you? Go away, you will go out later, you will go out, it is not so easy, I also say that you should go out, do your job, get exposure, earn money in India.  Invest in anger, what is there to show, it is like something happened at home, father and mother have done it, I will go out, it is not easy, it is not easy to go this far, every child feels like this, even 23-24 year olds feel that they are interrupting me so much.  Yes, I should just go out, go again and laugh, after that we can't go. What we have to understand is that we can go, everyone can't go and only we can't go. You have to.  Understand that this is how it is, it is not that it is only for you, see, there may be crying in reservation, it is for everything, it is not for someone, he is crying, which is justified and whoever is getting it, then come on me.  I am getting it because I have been oppressed for 5000 years, my caste is a different story but here the tax is equal and where there is no arbitrage.  It happens there that the government also imposes taxes so that it does not happen that only these people get benefited and only these people suffer losses, gradually all the plug gaps have to be plugged, it keeps happening, so now we will have to cut these things in retirement planning. Syllabus One  The times have changed, just like every time someone's syllabus changes, the pattern of any exam changes, multiple choice used to cost four, now it will cost five, now with the addition of five, the difficulty increases.  Because you have increased the choice too much, the paper becomes difficult. The paper was A B C D, now it is A B C D E, but has it happened for you alone, has it happened for all of you, then enjoying wealth creation and taking happiness in life is also quite relative if  The system is equal for everyone and if it is from tax, then brother, it is okay, everyone will have to pay, in this, Mukesh Ambani will not have to pay, everyone will have to pay, no, he is rich, he has the benefit of corporate, that is a subject of separate discussion. How much struggle do you have to go through in it, at some stage you have to do business after putting on your wife's jewellery, and that too is your own struggle and journey and no one has stopped you for that too. Many people say that after the budget,  If there is fun for the poor, then the message for them is that what qualification is required to become poor? Become poor, you yourself, come out of yourself, if you are a gangster, you do not earn money, speak for yourself, I am poor, I have nothing because I do n't have anything.  your card  Make a ward, make your ration card etc. and take all the rations, take Ayushman Bharat, whatever facilities are there, take all the facilities in PM's residence, become poor, middle class, it seems difficult to become rich but to become poor, just stop earning, so tax will not go, but if you say this then  Beda is an example, Beda is an example, so are you crying with that Beda or not, are they having fun, have fun too, it feels bad but this is how.  It is that whenever the child does not know how to ride a bicycle, it is the father who is supposed to do so. Here in this case, we put the government. If the father is the father, then if the child does not know how to ride a bicycle, then they hold the handle behind him and run away. But the moment he knows how to ride a bicycle,  If you had left the ride, he is riding a bicycle. Now if you run after him, he is the one who needs the support. If not your father, do you remember when you used to ride a bicycle in your childhood? You would have fitted one or two tires in such a way that they looked like two supporting ones.  Then gradually one would move away and then the other one would also move away. Call him a crutch, it is okay in a way, then he would move away. Learn your bicycle, if no one ran behind you, then when you got the idea to ride in the middle.  And if that sound was not heard then means you could balance it then slowly someone would remove it. This is the government. Government will only support the lower ones and will not support the upper ones. The upper ones have to provide for them. Sells yes it.  Feels a little bit bad It's something like there are three children in a family, you are the middle child, you are not being taken care of as much but you have to contribute, it is a matter of pain and there is one child who you feel is not doing enough.  But this is how it is, this is not why people used to separate, many times you know nuclear families and they used to be that we are earning, everything is being divided for us, why should mine be given to him? Earlier, there used to be socialism in the families and everything used to work, now here it is done in the form of tax, so it is a matter of pain but what do you do, do you have a choice of becoming poor or is it one brother of the elder brother who  He is very rich, he doesn't care, take some of his, take a little more, take it, his income is only this much, his life is going on differently from him, even his father is happy with him, everyone is happy, he has no tension in his life.  i you  There is tension, you feel that you too may become poor. The poor who have come out of poverty do not want to go back into poverty by any means, but they see the poor having fun. The poor are not worried about what their child will become, because whatever their child will become.  If he does better then he has no tension in life but the middle class has tension that his child should not become poor because his child is also not doing anything. Internet has given a level playing feed. What used to happen earlier?  30 years ago, you took brilliant tutorial for your child, even a poor child could not take brilliant tutorial, even at that time the price of that course was Rs 5000, 6000, 7000, which many people could not afford. I am talking about 30 years back.  So you had an advantage becoming a middle class kid you could get access to certain coaching and certain stuff and you could  Excel in life but over a period of time. Now this level playing field has come. That is Khan Sir. Some get courses cheaply for 7 or 100 thousand or some get knowledge from mobile and not all of them can take it.  That population itself is so huge that even if one out of 10,000 is selected, then brother, those people are 10 crores, so only their children will take away all the things, so being middle class, the advantage is not much, it is not relative. Advantage because every body has got an access, so those were the inherent advantages of middle class, people of lower class used to call people of middle class as Sahib, if you remember or used to talk politely, used to give some respect, that thing also. You must have seen that it is going away in the society and it used to be like an entitlement nowadays, the people of that time were in their 30s and 40s, 30 years ago and now they are  Even in their 60s and 70s, that sense of entitlement has not gone. They do n't know that the country is changing outside. How do you talk to a Swiggy Zomato guy. How do you talk to people. You know that the state of society has changed completely.  It's a change for the good. There was always such equality in the outside countries, now we are facing a lot of problem in digesting it. We are richer than money.  We are not getting respect, we are not even getting it and another problem of the middle class is that we are educated. There is no such education, it seems like we are educated, then what is the big thing if we are educated, it seems like this. You have done a lot of education, you have done a lot of rum, so you have done it, you have studied, it is okay that someone is earning more money than you by studying less, this was again that old entitlement somewhere that which Will do degrees. In 1960, in 1970, if only one could get a job then education was a big thing. Today education is not a big thing. Everyone gets access to all degrees and such education is not great. If it was great then you would have earned money.  Hi Rahe Hote So What I Wanted To Bring Through This Video Was Stop Crying Corona Is Not A Choice See What The  Government is doing and which direction we are heading apply brace if lot of houses will come in PM Awas 10 lakh crore has been given then brother look at the price of cement look at the share price look at the prices of steel look at other things which are associated you money  Can Earn Lower Class Still Don't Have A Clue To Invest In Stock Market How To Study A Balance Sheets How To Study  Charts how to invest or they don't have that much knowledge so middle class you stop crying and start studying start learning things just by making money from job and the same IP will not work is the message this is what government is trying to tell that too  It Will Become Difficult to Earn Money and Invest It and Earn More and Then Become Rich That Hurdle Feed Will Keep Coming That You Extra Pollet  If you can't, then that's it, this paper is out, you have to prepare accordingly, now those who want to join webinar groups, want to join directly and are not yet connected, then they can take membership of the channel for clarity and many videos are included in it.  Mental models are included, basic things about stock market are explained, there are many more webinars and recordings which you can learn and monetize that knowledge in a short time.  If you can become a walking consultant then that is also an option. If you have to do exercise then please share this video. Like this video. You will get membership of the channel by pressing the join button. You will get to learn mental models. The world will get a way to learn. We cannot change the world. That much, but in the world it is, it is something like who is distributing the cards and it is not in your hands, the government distributes them, but you have to know how to play whatever hand you get.  You need to know how to play good cards, you need to know bad ones, you must know how to play if you want to be a good player, that is the only thing in your hand, you can't decide what cards you will get, will keep changing, changing things will keep on giving surprises, so understand.  That this will happen in the future also, Governments will run out of ideas, they will keep taxing, keep taxing and poverty and inequality will continue, give me today I don't feel ashamed at all while saying this, I always say that this channel is not for the poor, many people think that my channel is for the middle class, but they talk a lot about income equality. There is equality in the mind also, it is thought.  There is equality, why don't we talk about it? Some people are poor, they also have a choice to come up, habits also make them poor, sometimes you are poor, but your habits make you poor.  There are many people who have come from poor to middle class. We always listen to the stories of poor people because they are rare rags to riches and we celebrate that too but we do not celebrate the rags in it, we only celebrate the rags to riches.  No one celebrates what is going on in the streets but there are a lot of stories where people have become middle class from lower class and there are many people who are listening to me.  And you are from the middle class, your previous generation may have been lower class or before that, definitely the whole of India was lower class, the whole of India was poor, so this journey has been a lot but what is the problem in this journey, reverse gear.  It seems that in many houses you are in reverse gear, you are thinking that it is not going ahead, the matter has reached the father's middle class and now the child is feeling that he will not survive even in the middle class, so this is a matter of pain, I am acknowledging this. Yes, but I will definitely give this clarity through my videos that I like what you get and get what you like. If you can't get what you like, you will have to like what you get, so whatever you get in it, see what in it.  What is the Maximum You Can Make Out of It and Where You Can Still Have the Middle Class Advantages You Middle Class Still Has a Financial History What is  What is financial history? What does money come from? Where does it come from? How much does it come? Is it in the organized sector? If you have a history of money then you can take a loan. You can create assets and use leverage. That access is still not too late for the lower class to use that advantage.  And a lot of people are not using that advantage Even an auto rickshaw driver can open a SIP of Rs 5000 What's so great in it  5 SIP of 100 Haj can even open your maid who is working in six rooms What is so great in it What will distinguish between you and them Which is the lower class and I am addressing the middle classes You are able to sum  How to Buy a Housing Unit and I'm Talking to the Youngsters Somehow, if they are unable to buy a housing unit in their big city, they may be able to buy one in a small town.  If you are not able to get 1.5 BH of BH in some outside city then brother, increase the source of rental income from somewhere. Whatever happens, do not spend money on marriage, people say no, we marry only once, no one.  It is not necessary, the first thing is to do it once and the second thing is that if you take it home then the marriage will last. Do not go to the wedding function. Marriage is not wedding. She has got married in Haryana. Marriage is marriage. Wedding is fine.  This is a function, do not concentrate too much on the function, that is a four-hour function, nowadays no one has time to attend because all the weddings can't be done, like Anant Amani's Na sabko nya diya, sab aaye, that much money is spent.  People Are Not Very Interested in Reaching Out If those who are from far and wide then this is the message. Understand where the government wants to take you and it.  It is very clear where they are heading they will keep taxing the middle class you will have to accept it and work and rework your goals and there is no choice but to keep earning I am not using the word working no how will you earn without working c  One Work Which We Associate Is the Job One But There Are Other Things Also Which You Can Do  Which you are only doing, videos will be made on that too if you want and a very good data has come out on the Economic Survey on that, it will also give clarity. Which is not about jobs but some other word, which is will be the future.  Now I hope that you people would like to see and hear that thing too, so please write in the comment section that we want to know the nature of jobs, what is going to happen.  Because as a youth you will know if you are engaged, that too will change. The nature of job is going to change, so if you want a video on that then you must write in the comment section, like, share. Thank you very much."

Don't do anything like that, he will break the bank it's a piggy bank basically they are saying that this There is a piggy bank, keep adding to it, this much will be enough.

The economy will go up and the age will go long.

Some two, some two and a half expense ratio game If yes, then this is the work of financial influence. Because they also talk about them Now you were saying this, tell me the disclaimer. My disclaimer is not because This doesn't start with any video Video spawned by no this video spawned by me Only someone from outside bye this is bye now I Not taking the name exactly of those products pit ap this p this spawn serd by this to The thing that is their underline is the thing. will come forward and promote it if you go to a Barbaric and Ask Him for a Hair Cut Do you ever want to say no, brother? You will ask your wife, you will ask your friend, I don't want to cut my hair or cut it again and again.

Long age subs come into mutual funds No one is stopping the equity market Market economy money will go to mutual Why don't you say this poll about the fund? What is the expense ratio in 20 years? Someone please tell me this simple thing If someone bought one lakh from lets in 2003 put into a mutual fund a mutual fund and its value is 10 lakhs today Okay, so out of that 10 lakhs, that mutual Just how much money did the fund take? After doing calculations, they show it on Excel. Just show me this and what else? Didn't take it, we managed you, you What do you mean by management? 6000 total shares. Buy from those listed only. Their definition of buying is 500 The market cap of the stocks should be that much The promoter holding should be this much There should be corporate governance and If we filter out 500 stocks There are three to four to 5000 mutual funds running. He is buying only a commission of 500 stocks. How much are you buying 70 80 90 100 If you buy stock then you will be very arrogant. Even after doing that, if someone buys it, it will still be the same. Return If you get this this this this was these things also Brother, you should also come along and tell me this thing: Apart from mutual funds, you can also buy You can also learn your own portfolio You can also make a small addition to this It is important to mention that mutual funds Not wrong but in the name of mutual fund The dreams that are being shown, the dreams that are being sold Crores are going away, that's wrong C if you talk practically na if a lot Go for technical only, that's what I would say. Even dreams are not wrong for example Should I tell you Vishal ji you can do 150 setups daily Beat your six pack pup in a year and a half Will go and eat, it's okay now in isolation Gave advice but did not tell here that food I have to eat well, I don't even drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes I don't even drink or eat fat, I am not healthy either You have to be careful that you have time from your job too. All work needs to be done in isolation So you told me that absolutely correct thing. Do you do pushups every day or do you go to gym for one and a half hour? Go, there will be some improvement, right? Who said no? Of course I will. I tell you to run every day, walk every day, do this, that. Do it but the question is what can you do? What will you be able to do? If you can do it, then you can do it with math. I am not saying that the formula is wrong. Because you are showing it on Excel only. If there is any figure then you are not saying anything wrong when you Will you put something in excel and plus 1 p 08 to The power is this and that answer is a little wrong. If it is wrong then they are saying it is right SIP The calculator is correct the question is whether there Are So Many Other Factors Playing Out Salt nighs in life such as your actual Can't make requirements like someone Tell the woman that you will remain beautiful like this And your body will never be shapeless So that means you are saying that Will not get pregnant or marry This means either you do it like this or do it now People are feeling confused about it let's start, told, told It's better than not doing it, but everything Make people aware about things like I did Told one small thing that bha mutual fund If you put the stock in the market then the stock You can put it in the market anyway.

If I leave, I don't mind that too. Don't put at least my expense ratio. So it's F and it's better if I do the same thing Should I buy Rept in ETF form?

Fund Nifty 50 Mid Cap 100 Whatever I want to enter small cap market Nifty sus in mid cap in large cap in I should buy more ETFs there. My expense ratio is below 05. will go and I sat down with my Don't spend the year unnecessarily To trade or to do nothing but to pay tax The rule is the same beyond that and the same above that. if yes then this is not telling this product Because no one benefits from this no one benefits from the system Because the brokerage house where you Will buy it in the form of stocks I bought it once and now it is being sold.

Funds will be required to calculate this The trend is that after 20 years from now, 25 After a year or after 30 years I will get retirement This calculation will require so many crores what practical calculations It is foolish to do this calculation in the first place. It's because you say this, I will definitely retire. No, now I tell you not to retire. It won't happen, how can it happen because the whole game is that you In mid bill job you are saying that you Calculate how to get out of this mess. I am saying this as a housewife who You have to give your husband a cold divorce. That friend in the blood, he doesn't have to live with this. He should also calculate how much is mine. What should be the cost? How much should I demand? By now he doesn't have that much money, otherwise Divorce is postponed, work harder and Shop around the house and work overtime, yes now this Well it has reached, so two mills on four crores. Will divorce put it is actually Something Like This Problem Is a Bad Marriage The problem is not calculation calculation kiss How can you say that What do people say about your expenses today? How much is it, then you calculate it and then multiply it by 4. But you can keep the type 100 times more if your If the expenditure is 1 lakh per month then it should be 400 times Gone are 4 crores if you have 4 crores Then you can retire like this, friend!

Should give 80 per lateral for 20 per If he gives more then it means the bank also Believes that the financial system also believes that friend this is not foam, we are complete We have fun anytime, whatever the program may be. It is possible only because the risk factor is high. Has anyone tried this near banks? I say, Amit ji, you do it personally.

You must have seen that if it is a girl then try another one. I will do the second one and I will do the third one too. There are many people in many such houses and This is happening even today in China, so the policy is one Now there are girls and there are girls too The ratio is less like that of India. Especially North India, now those girls It is said that where there is home, there is marriage for the children. Will do now in India what was done in 1990 girls are born Their ratio is said to be around 800 compared to the government ratio. It is said to be 750 but in Haryana it is 700. And you know what is said? In reality, there are other bad programs too. Now we will not go into that, Government rs. There are very few girls on pay and even among them Many girls should awaken their wisdom and consciousness. Because they also have rights, only boys If you don't wake me up then I am not doing even that 500. Not Getting a Good Boy I Don't Want Mango The final will be 500, now give it to every girl. Almost all boys have a choice, so if Will say that in this uncertain world Vishal ji doesn't know about the job at home. I know for sure that there is a house so you are saying that the age If we have a long life then our daughter I don't know if the job is secure, son-in-law If you leave home, you can't leave home. It's okay and you won't lose your job or your house. If we leave then the house has become a very very Important thing in terms of marriage Criteria This is a bit stuck in my opinion If you add your car to this then The car concept has been around for many years. This car concept is being explained What is it again suits? That if it is done because if you If you buy it, you will buy something worth Rs. 6-8 lakhs. You are Sudden, you are other financial products.

After doing this you should buy car also Okay so I also agree that you should buy Car is ok but not before doing certain The first thing that should not happen is that You took the car in the first tank on the very first day First of all take your life insurance policy Take insurance, share your little one Open demat account after that two four six eight Take the car after a month and who is talking about the car? That's 25 lakh 20 lakh kilos of a sweet. Get a car worth three to four lakhs these days. It is also available in second hand It's cheap so I don't think it's so big The thing is okay, it is such a big thing, it is just there's a topic and people who don't buy Those who want to buy just get attracted. Who buys this by asking them otherwise? The one who wants to take it has to take it, right? Tell me girlfriend doesn't ride a motorcycle If she sits in the car then I should not take the car. Take a motorcycle, now your girlfriend won't sit. Because it will fall, okay, that car She is flowing with the person, now she has said this Youth comes only once, now it is saying so He is saying don't take the car, if you don't take the car then then that girl So you are roaming with the car driver, you take the car It's not good to talk like a girl. let's take Girl going to DTC metro Someone is hitting the body from behind in the buses. Someone is touching, this is disturbing. All the work gets done even today, it's been 20 years Earlier too, she would sit in the car. Now at least someone keeps the windows up in his car. Don't touch her, it's safe, drive yourself. If it is relatively then why not take a car brother? Why should he get pushed by the dirty public? Poverty is the compulsion of the transport system. Look, poverty is poverty but If you have four paisa you can buy mine Believe that the first thing the parent should Do if I have my thoughts for a girl wrong is right with you The first thing the girl's parents will tell The athlete should do his job as if he go out and buy him a car and give him whatever 4 lakh 5 lakh according to your status Buy whichever car is cheapest or Even if you can't give, give your house. Brother, every house has a car. Son, if you go in the car then the driver of the car will The system is in the vehicle of I'm not against it. I am against that the car should be mine Consider a lot of investment and There are saving items which are now fixed Deposits should be considered at the lowest level Seems like a lot of financial insiders say this That you have to do anything but fix Do not have to deposit, you will agree to this Bank to deposit cash from Baat Financial illus does not pay commission Look at whatever advice is given. The public doesn't have to be that innocent. Something has to happen and it will be banks, won't it? Specially you should see that you are not in India Because what banks in India themselves They have made so many products that they don't talk. You follow America, banks are different there Financial ones are very different there. That means it is very advanced. In financial products, there their Any bank's system will be that Will say that this is a market crash Will do because everyone wants it The bank will always want to have money in the bank. The money remains with me and I give the loan because That's his model that brother, I will teach you at 9. I will give you a loan and give you six rupees in FD at Rs. 3. My profit is called net interest. Margin of some banks is 4 to 5 It is one and a half, many have two and a half It's okay, this is how the bank makes money. took money from you and gave you less interest And if you took the money, someone else took it. If that money is in my favor I also have some money to keep at 15 20 I can loan the remaining amount in actual By leveraging so if I have 00 I Maybe 15 I can give a loan of 800 0000 I am giving people ₹1 if you ask me for it. Withdraw this money into financial assets Okay, put mutual funds somewhere. If you put it in then I will give less loan as a bank. I will get money from Sara India Bank if I propose. Take it out and invest it in a mutual fund. So tell me Vishal whether I will get the loan Yes, tell me, there is no money in the bank. I have FD in the bank No, everyone is awake, everyone's wisdom is there. Chetna woke up, everyone took shares, everyone took houses. It's okay if you take it without a loan, then it's okay.

Teach the knowledge that we are teaching here. And told him that you like it brother. The advantage was not technology but knowledge If not then we will eat more bread Because we cooked right at the right time You are sitting with what happened, you understand? Now we tell someone to follow us Come on brother you can't because now this Many people came to know about the question paper. If many people do it then the return will not be that much. That's why I call it my life. that the story should never be told nor Someone's life story should be followed Because the world is so dynamic, AI After this you will see that in the last three years How many changes are taking place in something like Corona? If someone had seen it or thought about it, then nobody You should not tell your personal example. Everyone should be told that life is like this today Trends are happening like this and every person is different Its advantage is sitting in the sweet spot 22 year old can't take Take advantage of many things, do something He will have to have patience for 22 years. Not by jumping but then he starts again. Let's talk about one half outlier or the other. Which one is Jakab or Oyo from India? Ritesh Agarwal or some of them You twist the whole story by giving examples. You give it to India, see all of it. Baiju is crying because of startups. Look at the rest. what was the listing rate ok That's why I don't think of personal examples. Work because of that whole story in life don't tell No one will tell you about the disadvantages of credit cards. Let us tell you some benefits and some Go ahead and say with credit card How can you earn money this credit It is important to clear the concept of card. Because there are many different claims in this Take it if I tell you tomorrow To subscribers please like me ok And like me on 100 videos.

They were free nice lunches, like waiting rooms It's starting to feel good and it feels a little better outside sit because everyone has credit cards I have reached, do you understand what I am saying? There is no difference in anything and then said I ate that tasty food, now that The tasty food has also become less. First there was the test because all these people All these people are coming with cards worth Rs. If you are eating from the plate then it would be better. If I have to go by plane two or four times, If I eat or drink something somewhere else then this They are saying that if anyone can earn this money There is no mistake in the statement but The question is whether you can earn this money You can quit your job and become a tycoon There may be marriage, there may be happily ever after. can you not if not then i will tell you Friend, fill this survey, it is 100 points. It is genuine that we will meet like this too. Is it worth it? The question is if my If I am getting 00 for filling out the survey then It's a good thing but it's getting worse for me So the statement is that today's youth His poor level has made him this People gave Rs 100 50 and this is what they got in this. I will not blame only the youth I will blame you because listen you are a rapist If something happens to you, you From your phone network service provider You are number porting somewhere? You can get this scheme a little cheaper. When you leave and go there, you If you can fool like this then you can do it Will go and you will feel from inside Your time will come when you become rich How much energy is being wasted You have no feeling any man who He will be rich who will not do such things or who Who would like to become rich? The one from the Fukrey picture is sitting idle I have to start some work, it is very important This work should not be done by taking names like this with Antakshari. This is nothing but this and these videos It will be good if you make big influencers. Isn't it that if you take a subscriber I am sitting today and I am telling you clearly. Look at their price, what is it? 40 lakhs. If you are a subscriber then you have spent 38 lakhs. They don't have anything except 10 20 Even they come to know about our rap If the subscriber has the capacity, then the same things will happen. Doing and doing the same things is liked simply. It's a matter if their intellectual things If you like, then talk intellectually. Intellectual type intelligent listening If there are less then it's all about the subscriber. There are more subscribers today Who is testing their intelligence level? If there is an IIT exam then there is an IIM exam. It's not happening there, that's why it's like A True Thing That We Should Not Be Discussing These are the benefits of credit card It's Too Low a Thing to Discuss Infact According to me, there is no need to have a credit card. I don't want it, in case you are in Keep your two lakh one lakh in case of emergency. If you earn it and don't tease people then people will keep it. Maximizing no no no no 10 There were five cards, I rotate, I I am very proud that you gave yourself two four five I have become a man worth Rs 100 thousand this year. Let me say this and then make a payment on time. If you forget to do it, you will be penalized. That's where all your arrogance went away There Whatever smartness you do had a lot of savings and investments New instruments also keep on coming which Youth often have many questions regarding And there are one or two instruments like this NFT and crypto currency you also read this What a view we have seen in the last few years. Look, we have stopped talking about NFT. people have [music] No one is talking about NFT. B ok crypto's crypto's i the technology that underlies it itself blockchain technology i want that Atlast Root Understand That Blockchain There are many benefits of technology. I am not talking about crypto right now. There is technology behind it, ok that's it Blockchain Technology, that's how youth can go there. He doesn't want it, he just wants it FINANCIAL ILLUSION There was a world before This was his fiasco, what happened to them Don't say anything and make a mistake and it will come again. What is their only excuse? We also bought it, brother, if you are earning. 20 crores and you buy it for 50 lakhs Who will come after you? Something has happened. so ok and yours is coming every year 20 crores and you are here like this You are showing that the youngster 500 rupees are sitting, he started with crypto only Wants to do this means that the first The ball that was faced in a test match because Life is a test match, 2020 is not that Wants to hit a six on the first ball I will buy crypto only because it's ok Crypto rate has increased and then crashed Without Understanding a Product of Mine Believe and say that you should not be buying This product is good or bad in my opinion We will talk about this question only when You must understand the answer completely. This is the people who are teaching and telling give them Understand It's Not Such a Thing First Of course to understand especially the technology Bund Because Ultimately People Will Come In Question man, is she there in reality? Can you touch it know what the wind is If it's bad, it's good for the government. reason because that control is not there then this It is a matter of great discussion on its own that this ok or not and this one youtube0 who eats good and bad now Brother who has never eaten potato parotta He only eats, he will say what did you feed him? And many palettes are sophisticated, would we? antique furniture antique paintings You should invest, I would say do it If you want a portfolio worth Rs 50 crores Is First Life Investment MF Hussain's painting should be the one that appeals to you. I don't even know if you have it or not. No clue how to value art Now one of the things I do is art Valuation also me you painting If you show me, I have done something so that I can I can say that the price of this painting approximately this much I may be wrong but atleast I have a mechanism to check it Friend, how much can it be but whose price is it? Can he buy a painting if he doesn't have it? Then he can't buy but fancy term It feels great I am buying art Buy it and keep it in your drawing room. It will continue to be appreciated and you will see it every day. There are many fancy products like this There are also those who have not come to our market like explain through consultation but what you've reached that stage this is There is one last question and that is about West. It is very nice to have such a book which is available there very much. It has already started, now it has started moving, even if it thunks. And grow, there is psychology of money and such Many more books by Rich and Poor Dead What concepts are being explained here? cheese work in india I have read all these books many times. keep the name you took and something like this is good I have made notes of many, many I tweaked it for the Indian audience I have also made many videos for them. I also use it in webinars to explain But What I Want to Tell People Is Which you're hearing it through you that it's like Don't act like rich dude pur dude Buying a house in India and India tells you all this Taxation lodges are not like this anywhere else You buy a house worth Rs 2 crore and sell it for Rs 5. He can avoid tax on those crores Here you have to pay capital gains in India Black property in India and White's separate tribulation goes on there, he is there. No, you cannot take 100% loan here. Can now buy a plot of property here? Now that registry is worth two crores. If you get a loan of only Rs 70 lakh then who will? You will apply such a formula, do you understand the benefit? So that's that since the country's taxation same. No, the thought process of the country is not the same. If so, that knowledge is there because of the need to filter and like i tell you which Chinese food which is noodles and all that It is not like what is made there in India. Made in India, according to India ok we have made tandoori momos Our agar agar agar ocean is making ok If you go to Ratna and eat dosa as per your taste. Will it be available in Udupi or South India? You won't get the same hard dosa here You will get it so hard that it breaks like this and The dosa there is like galgali, ok So with in India we also change Our Taste on Things Things to Eat Too Okay, there is some cousin, there is something in it, we Without seasoning because the stomach Will not be able to digest, why do it? This thing won't taste good, it's ok then momos. We turn noodles into tandoori momos I don't know what they will make of it, it's okay. According to the dish, here we We also know that he will do this According to us, we need someone and he is the one. No because people are giving simplistic explanation Yes, they are simplistic when they explain. Please explain this thing simplistically. this thing is going on People cannot get total knowledge from it. People get confused just yes I did Read Think and Grow Rich Now Today's 2023 It's a little difficult to make people think and Grow Rich When It Was Written I Think Napoleon is written by Napoleon If I Am Not Rang, life was different at that time. You could actually think and grow rich Because The Number Of People Thinking At That Time One That Book Was Written and Less People Were Doing Manual Work More Physical Agriculture Vas more vehicles were being made by labor It was industrial, now brother 24 has come. AI has arrived, now everyone is thinking So when everyone is thinking, think and grow Rich Becomes Difficult was the right book at that time To think that this will also happen Look at what time it was written. The book of relevance of things which is now always heavy It is ours just as the Gita is its relevance Will remain timeless for thousands of years That knowledge is timeless at all times It is applicable and every year as our intelligence improves If our conscience is awakening then what we He has the capacity to take knowledge from that book. Gita is growing, probably read it 100 years ago The knowledge that could have been taken today was taken more can go because they are human beings and Have matured but can't be the same Said About Those Western Books There Relevance over a period of time is going down ok another book is intelligent Become an investor in the village, he, he, he The way value investing is scuttlebutt and Which cigar cigarette but investing something? Some of its chapters are quite famous in the past. the they are no longer applicable today but that Who will tell further, I am such a thick book. Tell me, have you read it? Yes, I have read it. Both of them became intelligent while half of him Much gun is not relevant now I will tell This nobody telling book has already sold people It's okay to kill your style but somewhere If something is not working then one last question is this. If we want to surprise this whole conversation And four five big things which our viewer The take away from this conversation is that many Concepts have been rejected but some Things that you should know about your investment Must follow in the journey so that you How to do Samra to get some better results this conversation I will deal with it in such a way that life Memorize one word and use it The name is Efflection Point Efflection Point What is that Chinese bamboo like? It is said that he lives underground for many years Is there and can't be seen, keeps giving water And the sapling then grows 90 feet in 90 days But who knows what happened under the ground all those years? If it doesn't work then whatever our arrangement is, it will be nothing. Thinking that something should happen quickly car quickly marry quickly get rich quickly Dad and mom are happy soon from foreign country. And every field is victorious on the entire front and which one? The song of the picture was Ranveer Kapoor's Ya Sanju Maybe by doing every field, every field is victorious. Every youth who is going to win It is good to conquer the field but that There is no salt in the job that you get Gave away the investment and tore the marriage Great relationship looks beautiful too Insta is also good, not everything happens brother so much someone so much catch someone so much No one cares about you. Keep going slowly. You will have to absorb knowledge I will have to become a sponge and read one thing. There is no formula now that Someone told me that in 20222 I told you it's not his fault either, it's 2024 is not valid now it is very difficult for that person to come and say like real I keep making videos of the estate Someone saw my 2022 video at that time You were saying this my brother at that time Rate this was going on at that time the story was this now If this is so, now again and again who can tell the man? Disclaimer: That's why it's called someone's property. convinces I took this on convincing someone of yours because that It takes hard work to develop convictions Anything takes time if you learn it. You are acting as if I am a normal person in the stock market I am just telling you what P-B ratio is. what is book value return on What is return on capital employed? What is Equity? How to Cash Balance Sheet? Let's see how the market moves down. Message came sir tell me the stock, tell me the stock friend Just tell me one stock, what is this? If you tell me straight, then this is the question. If you don't want to learn then I can't do that Financial influencers should also be completely I will not do it if you see I believe it If item number in a stage in movies People liked watching and producers liked it. The director used to put Munni Badnaam item The number has to come, okay then it's someone else's Babli ka kaun kaun ko song was gundo mein fas Okay, so they come with songs like this now. Don't come because I don't want to see people anymore People want to watch action movies. They are coming when they don't want to see anything. If something else happens then ultimately this Why am I including myself? I should portray myself so great that The public would like to see something that they would enjoy If you want then you will have to give that now Tell me whether this is a movie or not, if someone comes now, this Said man, what movies were made in 1980 If you watch the movie Mithun da and its Most of Jitendra's movies are being watched right now. Brother VCP VCR came at that time The middle class audience sat down with a cassette The audience there was paying and middle class. Your middle class audience doesn't come to theatre. When it was there, rickshaw pullers used to come to the theater. That crowd of rickshaw pullers is that crowd. That picture was made according to that poor The man is a chawl seller and he is sitting like this, brother. She used to make the same thing, now you will say that brother. The time was such that this financial These people also need influencer urgently Need a quick fix, need a bad solution. A lot of knowledge is required for surgery. If anyone puts it up then it is okay for the youth. I have to tell you that there is no easy way out, no one else understands. Nothing is happening quickly and another mistake What the youth is doing without much money He is involved in a lot of investments More on your high income generating skills Focus and earn more money Will do more good to you 100% I got a return on something and I got it at 10 If you got the money then tell me who earned more. Can because everyone will go to 100% I invested one lakh and one became two. I invested. If one crore becomes 10 of one crore then The one who earns money is the one who earns crores Do not talk about returns imposed and whose Money keeps increasing, take more and more. Satisfied with the returns because his How much is 10 crores, 20 lakhs and yours 100% on 2 lakhs 2 lakhs is also 2 lakhs. is still earning 10 times more than you because They should focus their income on that Only if the saving rate is increased, the savings rate will be higher. When your saving rate is high then your Dip in savings tax requirement reduced Will happen when the requirement to dip is less Because other programs are still to go on, brother. The car has to come, the marriage has to happen, the child has to be born. All the work has to be done but if I increase my income If I increase my savings too much, I Won't dive in when I I won't dip into my savings no matter what. Any wish, mutual fund stock market Whatever she will grow, but focus on this. No, there is no focus on increasing income because You say that you have studied and done writing. What to learn now that you are 25 years old So what was your education till now in the last 25 years? And it took you only to 5 Hajj, so if you If you want to go up to one lakh, two lakh and three lakh then brother something More has to be done, that's why people do it, right? MBA in between do MBA or something else learn or do some short course or If we take knowledge then people will learn from that thing. Don't run away, this is the message. Total summary That's exactly what I'm telling you Thank you very much Amit ji and our aim is That's what financial illusion is not wrong But the concepts that are being put before you Do they suit you or not? The journey of savings and investment Should the concept be followed or not? There should be clarity regarding this and that clarity is I have met a lot through conversation Thank you Amji for joining us Thank you thank you thank you"

    "title": "Investors Can Take Advantage Of Consolidation In This Sector Of Economy [IuSRFhuWZ2g].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, investors should pay a little attention to this sector. This is a video for education. I will talk about the stock market sector. The sector I will talk about today is the cement sector. There is something interesting happening in this sector. Check out the investors now need to watch out.  And what is that a great and big consolidation is happening brothers and sisters, two big giant players are acquiring smaller ones. Earlier it seemed that it was a normal acquisition but now a trend has started appearing. Which players are both? One is Aditya Birla Group and the other is Adani Aditya Birla ji's flag ship company which is UltraTech Cement. You may have known him recently in India. They have bought more stake in cements, they had also bought many more acquisitions in the last one year, currently their cement capacity is 140 metric tons.  I am talking about UltraTech Cement and they want to increase it to 200 metric tons in next three to four years. So watch out this sector. Watch out these stocks. Watch out Adani's stocks also. Adani also has Amuja and ECC Cements. Follow both of them here What I see is that when there is consolidation then Dio Poly will merge and you know when in any sector Dio  If poly emerges then like j and any kind of cement is required, build houses, build any infrastructure, build bridges, build flyovers, anything we know, cement is required and there are a lot of green field plants of cement to be built right now.  It has become difficult for cement itself to be a product which cannot be carried very far otherwise its logistics cost is very high, so if any cement is to be used in the South then it will be used only there.  If it is used then the advantage is that the plant has consumed cement within a radius of 100, 150, 200 kilometers. Since they have just acquired some companies in the South, their footprint is becoming pan India and watch out for Adani Group also because of them.  The target is also to go to 140 10 million tonnes and their target is at 200 and very fast a consolidation.  Happening: All the players that you had heard about earlier like Kesho Ram Cements and Jaypee which have a lot of assets are being bought. Call it a competition between these two groups which is taking place in acquiring these then do this space with other wise listed firms.  If you see, there are 100 in the country, cement is close to 100, but they are slowly getting acquired and follow this sector and whenever you  If the investment valuations seem right as per your intelligence then you can take a call but this is something which I thought I would bring for you guys. Thank you very much."

Better than to be with the other person So it seems a very right thing that man yes you are right it is better to be alone than to be with the other person but I am Decides who is wrong not we decide ok so if you can if you know what is wrong then you find the right person but I am not able to find the right person ok is it possible that actually this formula is being applied on you also and you  Are you the wrong person for the other person? This can also happen, there are some deep things, see, I always Contra reverse engineering, I do higher order thinking. It is very easy to speak English because you are not able to find anyone, you are not getting married, so how can you say because rude people are also relatives. Son, everything is fine with you, sexual orientation is fine, girl.  When those people come like this, then you have to tell some theory, then you have to tell that I am not marrying for global warning, otherwise I am the right person, otherwise this English five-six is ​​made up of our bachelors.  Not for the sake of saying anything, but I am here genuinely, I want to say this to those who have this problem, it is okay in this changing world, in this dynamic world, you are the right person for this person, okay and this person is the right person for you.  If this is what you wanted then yes there will be marriage, now there will be marriage, now this person who was right has become a color for you because every 5 years the person is changing, the exposures are changing, his echoes are changing.  The system is changing, those songs are also made like this, hun tu hi badal gaya duniya badalti dekhi main song, that punjabi song is good like this, this badalta dekha main wo dekha yeh dekha na hun tu hi badal gaya bhaiya badalna is very good do.  You Really Want to Be the Same Person Yes There Are Boys Who Never Marry and They Remain the Same At 24 they used to do the same thing and at 48 they used to do the same thing Come on and they are now  If you do n't change anything, nothing will change. I will not be a nice thing, you should change, you will change when you get married, you will change when you are a child, you will change when you grow up, you will change when you are old, you will change. Change is inevitable change. So the question is whether  You are changing for the worse and changing for the better, so I have given you a new perspective to think like this, what are the times that a very  There are only abstract topics from where we have to get hold of them, belief systems have to be crushed because Acharya Prashant ji also told us there, marrying a wrong person, they kill their English, if you marry the wrong person, brother, I am that wrong person.  So what else can two wrong people get married, I am also wrong, many times people come for Kundli matching, what qualities do Guruji sow for matching, Guru ji, mix the qualities, it is okay, so I said, to match the qualities, there should also be qualities, nowadays.  Only the demerits have to be added. What time do you wake up brother? Chhora Chhori? 9 o'clock Chhora Chhori? 8:30 It is a good quality, it means whether it is a virtue or a demerit. By holding it like this, don't hold it like this, how many are holding not one but two in the party, so now make it so that it is two.  One catches, one catches, where is the quality, then what is the color of the ts, right person, just mary, certain things, just mary, how can you get married with your mouth raised, then it is okay, if you do not marry with your mouth raised, then how will you do it? Get to know each other Hey get to know each other I do you know yourself well yes I know myself well do you not know what you will be after yes yes I do n't know 10 years who are listening to those who are a little older than me those who are this age  There are some elders who are late, in their 30s, in their 40s etc., those who have been married for 10, 15, 20 years are late, you guys write in the comment section, have you not changed?  Did you do the same thing which you used to do at 20, you have to do the same thing at 40 brother, I have not changed, people take big compliments, friend, you have not changed at all, why brother, if you gain knowledge then your hair will definitely turn white and Devanand's hair will not change that much. Not only do you have to change, brother, you have to change many times. Good boredom also happens, what about average people, some right, some color, some right, some color, meeting each other, accepting each other for what ever.  They are with no red flakes ok and then starting on journey together and becoming a better person just better person and each other has to pull and walk a little and in that too if your core values ​​are not very out then you are right for each other and  There will be no colors because of what is happening, let me tell you with one classical example, girls grow up, the boy should fit in the body, I will end with one example and in this there will be no  It is not a matter of showing girls up and down, boys, but understand that girls, I am a relationship expert, yes, I am very strong, okay, so girls always think that the boy is handsome, wow, personality, good sense of humor, everything is good.  Girls are looking like this, I am also looking at him, he is the most popular guy, now he has caught my eye, he is the right guy, now he has found the right guy, what was wrong with the right guy?  She had good manners, good looks, good smell, hair was good, intelligent, had good networking, was popular, had all these qualities, only she is the right person, today I am insulting the youth, so if you are youth, then be insulted and  If you are feeling insulted then please write so that I feel I have done it and whoever gets pleasure after being insulted then write J+AG. It's okay, so now this girl has got married, now let's get married. Now what happens to the right person when she goes away, does the marriage go ahead? Now this same girl does not let him go to the gym because he says that you don't even take out time for me. She used to go to the gym with a good body and she says that I am getting pregnant, so I am worried about her.  It is happening that you are going to the gym, so he does not go to the gym, he used to meet his friends, he used to look handsome, so now he feels that he does not look beautiful to me alone, he looks beautiful to other girls too and I am a little shapeless. women getting married  After the bedal pregnancy, she can become fit again but many of them become permanent, then insecurities come, then now she does n't even let him go, then he used to go to parties, I felt like not letting her go there too, the pain is severe.  Okay, then he used to play some of his hobbies, he used to stay bent over, the best thing about him was that Bullet which he used to drive with a jacket, when he wore glasses and his hair went like this, now that car has come.  The bullet will remain somewhere like this, it is okay, milk comes on that bullet, with such a tongue, it is okay, sometimes only onions and tomatoes come and when we go to the market next door, after going like this for many years, it takes seven- eight years. Now this same girl says this same boy.  The one who believes in saying all the things, You're not the same person, I married, I do n't love you anymore and the guy says, Lord God, you changed everything, you married the right person, you made that person the wrong person as you end up  Now tell you that now I am not the same person, I am married, this is the right color, this train of yours will go out in the pursuit of the right color, get married on your own time, you will get safe sex, children will become mature, you will get purpose in life, everyone's body will be a mess.  The soul is everyone's sucker, the employers will suck you otherwise you are available, neither you have a wife to take care of you, nor your family members, nor your children, come, why would you ask for leave, leave for what?  If you ask for it, if you are 27 years old, then your parents will be 80 years old. If it is okay for a 27 year old, then you cannot ask for your parents' marriage, otherwise they will come and suck your blood, so this was a slightly hilarious take, take this thing practically.  Late is this nonsense thing, this color person is the right person, try to be the right person yourself for someone else and that too keeps changing.  This is what you did, look at one thing, you have taken mango, it is very right, mango is not eaten on time, that too got spoiled after ripening, things will get spoiled with time, they will get better, it is work in progress, marriages are always great in breakfast, spoiled till lunch.  You will have it fixed by tea time, it is like this, it is very simple and in a very fun way, I will tell you many things in my relationship course, it will be very good, brother, if it is like this for free, then pay money and see how it will be, the course is fine.  There will be seven to eight classes, there will be two two-hour recordings. Brother, it is amazing. Okay, please enroll me because it is my iconic because after this you will never get to see it live. If there is a recording of it, then the world will see mother.  Any picture of India level or any other Sholay level picture or DDLJ This is my DDLJ It will be washed for years but you will have a chance to see it live and  Of course discount recording will become more expensive and will keep up with inflation and discounts will also be removed so just you will get a chance to ask questions, maybe there will be recording like if you want then it will be yours, if you don't want then don't turn on your camera, it's okay Maybe you say, see, I asked that question because it will become immortal, this course will be history, so this is because the way I understand, brothers and sisters, no one in India understands, I am the number one, the way I understand all this.  Because There's Nobody Who Gets a 360 Degree Perspective Someone is doing one thing in isolation Someone is doing this Someone is doing this I'm doing all of them And all of them are joined by relationships Relationships Affect Our Life Like Anything You Know  Job Is One Aspect That Can't Run Away From Relationships Even If You Don't Have One Still It's a Relationship  Problem And If You Have Than Then It Is Okay So If You Have More And Less It You Will Have To Know How To Deal With Them You Can't Run Away From That So Relax Come Join Then You Will Know Are You The Wrong Person You  Wanted the right person but you are the wrong person. Sometimes it's a joke, that wife comes and says, most of the jokes are made on women.  I feel bad but now I tell you then a wife comes and says darling today so no everybody buddy is driving in the rain if you feel like this then you are on the wrong side everybody or not finding the right girl  So brother, you are the color person, everything is right, the right person gets married to the right person, okay, you are the color person, you have to see something in yourself too, then it will be fun, you will laugh, you will talk, you will connect, it is okay.  How did you feel about sharing it among your youth? Okay, send it. You are sitting here with wrong things. Okay, hey, how do you speak well about girls? Then half a time you spoke a little less well and by suppressing it, he got views.  Okay, then it's okay, next time we will say worse things, then your intelligence and conscience will awaken, you are married, you have found a good girl, there are good boys, there are good girls, there are bad boys, there are bad girls, what does gender have to do with it? And how can you generalize about someone being good or bad? Any gender, community or religion is a very easy thing, isn't it? Okay, it is a very easy thing, but there are issues, it is okay and there are issues, you bring them like us, tell them, you explain them.  People like it and it is visible in the likes and comments, so brother, write amazingly in the comment section, have fun, the time of festivals is coming, it's time to have fun, good things should be learned.  We should enjoy and now it's time for marriage, so whoever is scared, he is the right person, she is the right girl, she is the right girl, I don't want to marry the color person, then join our relationship course, it is so expensive.  It is not expensive but it is as expensive as the amount of money spent in relationships and weddings. Brothers and sisters, how many people come. He takes us like a flower seller. He takes us like a bad boy. So the story will start from our course. So, find out the one who is having trouble in the relationship. Join the one who is not in the relationship. Join the one who is going well. Join the one who is going well so that you can know why it is going well. It seems that things are going well due to luck, there is no delay, certain things are happening right, relationship with luck is the only thing which does not get bad or good due to luck, rest of the things are happening due to luck.  But this relationship is yours to do, so even if it is going well then join, everyone joins, it is ok, thank you very much, you have to register on the given number, you have to register on that number, thank you very much."

    "title": "Is Joint Family System Better Than Nuclear Family In 2023 ？ [GWB5gF6x0CQ].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today's topic is Joint Family System in India. Nuclear families used to exist. Joint Family System will be discussed in detail. It can disturb you a bit. It can destroy your belief system. If there is pain, there is strength in pain. May your belief system be there.  It may break and if you understand it, it will be good for you, then write thank you in the comment area and it may happen that your belief system tree, if it is not shaken, does not break.  Be happy that you found out, it was very strong, it is very true, so here they are, you are billed out of it, it is too much, it is not worth asking, in 2023, the old times were very good, nowadays divorces happen, because of the nuclear family, this happens nowadays. Due to nuclear family, nowadays children are not able to be raised well. Due to nuclear family, earlier it used to be very good. Today I am giving you the number one clarity governor of the country. Excellent content in my channel people.  I am going to appreciate it, I am making it clear, if you are not going to do this, then this is the thing, we hold on to old things, we all have old Vedanta, our sanskars before that, color them with alum balm, and even our parents read them.  Isn't this the whole thing, so I have been trying to tell you that this is such a different aspect of it which no one has told you till date because no one has told this about the war in Sharma Sharmi, otherwise there is a youth channel on Clarity, this is very  I am giving great clarity to the youth, understand carefully what I am saying, people do not want to understand, they get distracted, this shyness inside, listen carefully to this joint family system and this is what they say, living with which parent and those people Living with sister-in-law, living with brother-in-law and this is what they call, the system was a very bad system, it was not told to the father, it was a matter of compulsion and it is a very dark thing. Even before, any society within this system was above a drop.  apart  They used to live in setups, they used to live close to each other, thinking that this is my house and entered inside, next to my brother, next to my father, next to his child's uncle, this system was among the rich people who used to do all this like this, according to the animals.  They lived there and did not tell anything about it. Coming to our country, it was not right. If you saw this system, earlier they used to say that you should go there after 50 years. So the child became a 25 year old boy. If his 50 year old father got married. If parents give  You used to go away when you wanted to live together, who came forward to live with you, you had no permanent partner and earlier there was no life expectancy, you used to get married in reality, no one told you like today, like parents for 9095 years.  They are living and from the age of 60 to 95 years they are called Raita, they are in their next generation, people say that you become very negative towards your parents, you become friends of the parents only, the children are there for the parents only.  There is a philosophy, if you ask for a bigger one, it is the responsibility of the bigger one. On the road, it is not always the fault of the smaller one, he has given the BMW, he has kept the control, why is it not broken, you have understood the essence of this family man.  The old system is a very bad system, but it still runs within the village. Earlier, it used to run to some extent. In this, his wife, his wife, brother's cousin's wife, uncle, you, this is that family channel, I will not tell it very openly, but you understand.  What was the condition in close proximity? What was the condition of the animals? There was a lot of harassment of women. They kept them rotating from morning to evening, taming the animals, doing this, doing that, there was no privacy of life, there was nothing to protest if it was so much.  If only this is celebrated, then the family of 10 living in one room in Mumbai's Choice, where the mother and father are living together, you know, celebrate that too, no let's live, no one is so invested in this video. Will make it because it's big Hey, what are you saying? What am I saying right? What am I saying wrong? We should live together. Who will serve them? If you want to serve them, then open the back, take them down to the house, we will serve them. No boy gives tea to his mother.  Nowadays, they have to serve what they have brought for years and we have done so much for us, yes, we have done so much, then it is okay, you do it for your children, this is the most bogus system, this nuclear family system, but you can be a close noise sutra.  and this one thing  For many years, ever since the channel was created, they have been saying that the family should stay close, should not live together, should stay close, it is not necessary for the father-in-law to see his daughter-in-law early in the morning, time is not necessary, it is not a good thing and wearing a saree.  No, so Shakti, everyone wakes up in the same way in the morning, because there is only one kitchen, so we will have to drink tea and water. This one of yours, Tulsi Virani, is no less. Ekta Kapoor released all the serials in the whole of 2000 and made the story a household name because all  Once there was a daughter-in-law, she spoiled the mind of a society, it can happen like this, it can happen only in serials, in order to be practical, the woman will have to be woken up at 2:30 so that she can come at 8:00 in the morning, this program is for you Babuji, Devra ji.  This food for my husband, this and this for my husband, she has sung a song in the morning wearing a saree, she has also given water to Tulsi ji and all of them have reduced, okay, this cannot be practical, there are slaves in the house at eleven o'clock.  The woman keeps roaming around like this without coming, there are so few maids, the children are coming at this time, the children have gone to school at this time, the husband's ticket is short, his tiffin is there, breakfast is served at the same place, lunch is served at the same time, no one can cook anything different.  So much has become of it in the morning, we just get combos of it or in the name of breakfast, we put two pieces of bread in our mouth, which then turns into a meal. There is never any benefit in living together and if this is forcefully told then it will not be explained, but alone.  Mother  And she is a single mother, she was also a single mother, she also had a daughter-in-law, there was someone in the family, now there is no husband, people will have to learn to live alone, everyone in every society will have to learn, if being a single mother, she wants to control everything of her son and daughter-in-law and on  If you want to do it, then not with her, then keep her next to him or live next to him, don't kill, well, I am alone and my wife and mother are with their children, no, no, how can you do this?  It is telling different things, I had already told that there are less people who get distracted, they think differently today, Indians have made a virtual of this system, this Varchi, this system, head, lot of secrets, lot of skeleton, lot of taboos, lot of bad things witch.  Power politics happened in two families, who brought the money, who did the work, who ran whose business, many women were tortured, there is no problem in this in the joint family system.  If you want to do this, then if you are a youth and your grandfather, your father, you hear something like this, then please show the video and explain, very okay, big scandals have happened in the houses which only the elders know, this is also a fact.  You understand because my audience is very intelligent, I definitely don't have much to say openly, you people can understand because speaking too much in this space can distract, love, respect has its own place, just like we live together first, great love.  We live here with only curtains in between. This privacy is very much ours in our family, we know it is nonsense, when you become rich, when you progress in life, you people have become middle class from class, if you have become middle class, then there is space.  It's a basic thing to think about when you give bills to two family members. If you are the head of the household and are 60 years old, then you should keep your daughter-in-law in the room next to you. It will disturb people a bit, but the fact is, no, we are for us.  So there is a daughter, even a daughter should not be kept, a daughter should also be kept separate, everyone should be kept separate, no one has a daughter, this is also a fact, a daughter-in-law is a daughter-in-law, a daughter is a daughter and a son-in-law is a son-in-law, everyone should live separately, me too.  They will say, this is a different matter, someone should take everything for himself and they are called big, there should not be space, you are living on three floors separately, it is a very good thing, kitchen is separate, bathroom is separate, coming and going is separate, sleep is separate, meet you on anniversaries. birthday is  Meet on Diwali, Holi, meet on Monday, meet for Sunday lunch, meet for Wednesday dinner, do everything, do service, come, take whatever money, give phone, give treatment, salute, do everything, but what is the need to remain like this?  Do you have 2bhk 3 bhk tight? No, it is not like this, then where can we buy a house from? Brother, it is not necessary to keep them to live in 11 bhk. It is not necessary for you, we are Jains from our house and this one can buy ours.  So now this is happening, so now yes, then do not marry such boys who cannot give you a separate house. I am not saying to buy, do not rent if you are a buyer and if you can't provide a house.  The house of Independence of your parents, you and your wife are being told to them as a lesson land, earlier it used to be like this, it was very good, it used to be very tight in such a society, why can't children be taken care of, this society flows from this.  Owners live, you live as tenants, then why can't grandparents see them? Keep the grandchildren in their house, tell them, grandchildren, you are the only one, this Baba Rao, live in their taxes for the year, you have your own separate privacy minute.  Do this, who said these people are not on everything, how will the mother stay alone, how will she stay next to her, the wall should not be 5 meters away, the power is alone, the intelligence, the mother should not be 5 meters 10 meters away, if there is no power, then put her to sleep.  Make me sleep in the bedroom, be very close to me like this, how am I saying this in a deliberately sarcastic manner that brother, how loud are I, stay away, if I do one thing, then mother, this is this and this is your room, so there is some distance, so this is  Shakti should not shift to a different house after increasing the distance. If the distance here is 5 m, then here there is a gate, then this one is the second flat, so this one is only 5 m away, so what is the difference, what will happen in this, there is no phone, no bell, no.  There is no intercom, so if anything happens, you will go, no, it is different, the girl's mother has to come, if the boy has to come to you, then the girl will be beaten, the boy will be beaten, the girl will be beaten, so what should the boy do now?  This is also not being done, is it insurance or is it necessary, if not it is the girl's, then remove it because only the boy's mother was shown in the Indian movie, Nirupa Rai Jeetu, what is there because after reducing him to a tailor, Niruparan made him a hero.  She 's a girl, she's such a drop  The caste is the market of the girl wearing a blouse with cut sleeves, so this is the image of the Indian movie which gives her the cut list of 678 of the time, some smart type is going on to poison today and the girl's mother is doing cricket cricket cricket.  So that society today has given that respect to her free bread, today she is the mother of the boys because the society told her that yes she also made a sacrifice, a girl is born like this, this is the caste, she does not have to keep it for 9 months, nothing else would have happened to the society.  It is very important to show the mirror  Hai Sambdi needs tu comment of like this and aate de cost of being just aate de cost of being there are some things in the role in which you people are being fooled don't fool please I am saying family should be 4 meters away which is not  So take the hall, cry in the same room in the rice, remove the B of a forest dweller, take the hall, the kitchen is a big hall, increase the mattresses there, okay, this is the father-in-law's son, this is the son of S.  Keep your daughter-in-law's grandson's granddaughter and this also your sister or sister-in- law, many people keep a young sister-in-law, daughter-in-law, father-in-law, say comfortably in one hall, we are all one, we are all together, now this is this example.  It is also possible, so now let us convert this situation into taxes. Now a child has been born in the room. If you are going to be the father of two children, then here you have to see the girl's parents and daughter-in-law also, brother, the family you are looking for. There is such a thing as a grinding mill or a daughter-in-law, nowadays, there is no ghat which can be used to remotely control the child by pressing a button from there. From 8900 km away, if it is in your SIM house, then son.  You will never pass the paper, you will feed him bread, you will feed him food, your soul will yearn, then you will become sick, then you will tell it to your husband, when your husband will tell your son to grow old, then manly man will accept it, then why doesn't he tighten it? A lot.  Why don't you reduce it? Hey, take both of them out, we will also take what we want to eat. Right now you all have become so good, when you are 80-90 years old, then you all do what I am telling you these things. Then sit together and see, now you are a new father-in-law at 56, because relax, I hope you get the message, it's okay and it's okay to share, it's a little disturbing, but I think do you like this  Video  Because I can tell many more practical things, but I want to see that the story in the society should not be such that the audience gets completely shocked. What is the society, many messages, this is already a phenomenon going on, all this is being discussed by you people. Only when you are relating, you like my topic. You people are understanding everything, you are relating, you are liking it but are not able to speak, so to give you courage, I have made it for you, please share, like, thank you."

    "title": "Is Journey More Important Or Destination ？ [7etJVeRiTnM].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, is the destination more important or is the journey more important? If it is said in English, the journey is more important and the destination is more important, then I would like you to pause and write whatever quickly comes to your mind.  Please write everything quickly, it is going to be a very interesting topic and it will be fun. The youth will definitely get some clarity. All of you will definitely get it, so please write.  Recently a dialogue came to my ears and I got a very good answer to it, they say that both are not important, who is more important, who is our friend, who is we traveling, who is important, then who is important, who is we traveling, then why the youth and why?  The people are not focusing on that, everyone is focusing on what will be the journey or where will I reach my destination, if you have seen through my videos then this is the same thing. I have been saying for so many years that we have to focus on the marriage and the partner. Shaadi to ro dho ke sabne karni hai let hoke fomo mein, whether it is okay to do it at 47 years like Randeep Hooda ji or do it at 40 or 36.  If you do it till then or if you don't do it now then why I want to ask is why proactively the youth is not seeking their life partner proactively middleman system of  Indian Society and the Marriage Market has Kolappan What was an aunt, an aunt, an aunt, a relative, someone in the friend circle used to suggest as soon as the boy and girl were of the same age, tell me, Daso ji.  Koi Munda Daso ji, achcha ji, people used to tell after doing it for the sake of kudi, nowadays no one tells because no one has any guarantee about themselves, leave alone your child, there is no guarantee about how we will look and behave, the head is bursting.  Have you seen what happens in weddings, nobody wants to take this risk because they know that meeting in this is not something, if something good happens, then they will say that we were so great, they were so great, so we were going to have a good relationship, if something goes wrong then that is what is going to happen.  And there are a lot of issues in the marriages taking place on dot com, because there are no choices, the profile list is all turning out to be false, I have it practically in marital consultation.  A lot of issues are coming up regarding love marriages, still we know a little about it. Other wise, all the boys mostly speak 'A', not all can speak, it's okay, if I can't speak all, then I speak a lot of figures, because of course, who can survey these things?  He has been agitating his salary and says that it is not a little, 19 20, so everyone knows that it means a lot, if he gets Rs 15 lakh, then he will be shown a package of Rs 28 lakh, even if the package is Rs 28 lakh,  If you show it then even the viewer thinks that if he is saying 28 packages then maybe it would be 21,22,23 lakhs, that means everyone is aware, the girl's parents are also aware, no one is checking openly but does not ask openly, this is my pre-marital consultation.  If you want to take a course which is wonderful my recording then I have PMC on my number so you can start the consultation yourself or you can ask this question yourself, I am asking that you were bursting, no now.  If it turns out to be worth 15 lakhs then that means you yourself also tell some things which are exaggerated, why do you think that I will ask him 10 questions, if I ask, he will ask the same thing, then everyone is aggravating themselves, so there is something wrong with the dot com people also.  Many people do not want to get married. Delayed marriage is fine. So, if we want to live a traveling life and want to live a long life, then we need to travel. Now we can travel only till one level of our parents, after that it is difficult to even talk to them. This is what is happening these days, siblings are busy with their lives, friends keep coming and going, colleagues keep coming and going, so with whose support do you spend your life, you definitely need someone, so I am saying that why not you actively and proactively live your life at the age of 222 years.  Learn that do not fall in love so quickly in college because there is no clarity on the definition of high value woman and high value man.  I am giving in happiness course, if you guys have not joined yet then you can board the climbing bus there h2 I have whatsapp2 three classes are done, two four five are left if you are here and you are 24 and I am speaking like me  If you are actively seeking a partner, then why are you not actively seeking a partner because you are here? You want a partner somewhere along the way, as our Acharya Ji, the one with wisdom and knowledge, says, do it with someone bigger than yourself who will lift you up.  So you need someone to lift you up, okay, here you need butt brother, this one, then do you have the duty of lifting this one, then this one will go out of the screen, the hand there is watching, everyone is thinking in this matter, okay then?  You think that this one will come when I am here, now it will take four-five years to get from here to here. In your thought process, to get from here to here, it is possible that this one will go here and if this  You can do this with this one, this one with this one here  But it may be that some other time you are here, this one also happens here. If this is happening to my mind, then I think I have achieved my aim because my aim is to make my head order to think that you have understood this thing, brother, you are here within 24 years. Grab the one here, no one else, then rest is your luck and hard work because this is a very big purpose, every buddy in life is waiting for that ultimate partner, very beautiful, very tall, very polite, very good boy, I want a very good boy whose  Maa Na Ho Hum Aapke Hain Koun Jaisi Hum Aapke Koun Mein Saas Nahi Hoti, Do you know that picture was such a super hit, the songs were Renuka Shahane ji, Mohnish Bell was the star, Salman and Madhuri were there, I am sure many people must have seen the movies.  No one observed in that entire movie that Aloknath was also there in it. You will remember Anupam. Well, there was no mother-in-law in it. There was no delay, no mother-in-law in that. Okay, so the girl wants such a thing that she can get such a thing and she is not getting it.  The boy's mother is alive everywhere. I am not finding such a boy. Okay, the boy's father is seeing that I am not able to find such a girl to complete the programs I am looking for. I am making myself proud by doing so much while doing so. Till then brother, then you do n't want to reach the age of Randeep Hooda ji. Randeep Hooda ji is a star, if he wants to do it, he will do it, he will definitely find someone, but are you a star, is it in that profile that you have been there for so many years? weight your  In the journey of life, because if the journey is not important, the destination is not important, because there is no destination in life, that is, when the program is done at a time, it is final, the final destination, rest of the stops come like stations.  Come and the journey is also such that it is in your hands to turn the train or ship of your life as per your wish, the main thing is who is sitting with you and who is sitting next to you.  There is no focus, half of them are sitting scared, the one sitting next to me is this girl who was born 498. To put it on our family, it means that half of the women are born that oh, she is a girl, but all of us are boys only for training.  It takes 12 years of school and college and those who study for 18 years say 498, do good training, we have to complete 498, half of us boys are in fear of this, girls have their own things going on.  I don't know whether she is a beauty queen or what she would be like, a girl earning 30 35 400 thousand rupees, a boy earning less than 1.5 lakh rupees, she doesn't care about the program and then she has to leave that 3035 job because that 1.5 lakh person will say leave it.  Meaning, I will not compromise on my two because of your 30s, even though we do n't meet much and all this is going on, she is sitting at home and not doing anything.  They also want that if brother earns one lakh and a half lakh then why do we want a boy with one lakh and a half lakh because my father is so rich, oh father is rich, what are you, this is true of the new generation and the old generation is not giving clarity in this. You all get married, suggest something good, suggest a good girl, suggest a good boy, there are no good girls, there are no good boys, like there are no great parents, there are no good parents, there is no good child, everyone is in their life.  You are good, you want the best, you are not the best, yes, you are not good at all, you are average, average will get average, marriages are the best, where there is no expectation, I am average, this is also average, we both are worthless, Chal Baithe, which song?  Do Hum Do Lover song and put it in its tuning. Yes, your number is less, my number is also yours too, I have got a rubbish job after crying, I have also got a rubbish job after crying, your parents too.  They do n't pay much money to you, even my family doesn't even weed, let's go, I love you Lami and let's settle down and play from house to house, it's not like this, it's not like this, it's thoughts and programs, it's wants, it's desires, it means something more, every big ego is writing checks which.  The body cannot cash is the dialogue of Top Gun, it is everyone's ego and she is saying that brother, bring this check and cash it, the body does not have the strength to cash it, I also want to say the same. I really liked the dialogue of the movie I saw recently. It's about some ladies riding a motorcycle. I don't even remember the name of the movie. I heard it while walking. I have n't seen the movie. But the dialogue is good. Humrahi Hum.  The journey is more important because your journey is not possible, it is the final destination. When your program ends, then who is your companion, your quality of life is decided along with him. The journey is not spent with friends, but with parents. Not all of them can be cut off because they are not the ones who can live beyond the limits. Those who have children, children also go to their own place, friends go, siblings go, parents go, then there is definitely a need for a companion, there is no active learning for that.  They are doing a lot of soliciting programs, a lot of dreams are being made but they are not going to attract in real life, more are going to dot com, more profiles are being checked, a lot of theta is being invested, these are the relationships of the heart.  Leap of trust is done in Leap of Trust. It should not be done by telling too many lies. It should be done by asking directly. What are the 30 questions that I have taught in the Pre Marital Consultation Course? Ask clearly, talk and actively seek.  A good spouse, you are a 24 year old boy, you are looking at a 22 year old girl, go and tell me brother, you are looking very good, you get married, she will also ask questions, what will you become, how will you do, what is it, then yes, it is good.  Money is also placed on horses. It is not all about the fact that only if the race will win, I will bet money on the horse and in the same way boys also have to see, there should be a leap of faith, he is not there, who will help me, I am nothing right now, hey.  Ask, I have n't even got a job yet. Even people have said that there is a girl and her father is raising her. There is a boy and his father is raising him. They are raising him. If both of them get married, then both of them will be raised by their fathers. Will contribute individually  At least the expenses will be less and since now it is the responsibility of both of them, they will do something or the other. This is a very conservative advice. Yes, this generation will not agree. Hey, in olden times too, it used to be very timely that one should get married before going to college.  She would go to college, then the boy would go to college, then he would go to study abroad, then he would become a lawyer, then he would fight for the India Freedom Movement, then he would become a great man, and they would also have six-seven children and he  Life  Was it well lidded or are they still taught in the books that it happened like this? So I am not saying that you should get married in 1819, I am saying that no husband is going to tear your books if I tell the girls.  You still have some grades left to study and no wife is going to come and do that. You have got more than a girlfriend in a legal framework. Every aspect of yours is of hormones in youth and she is looking at mobile all the time.  You are passing your time, you are doing that too, things will go away from your mind because your program has been done properly, you enjoy yourself for four, five, six years. Who is saying that the girl gets married at 22 and the boy gets married at 24?  If it happens, now start having children in six months, one year or two years, have two children after two, four, five or six years, but your girl's parents are not worried about you and she has a husband, so he is roaming around and enjoying and so on.  had to be raised too  Where is that 22 year old girl going? She must be 27, she must be 28, she must be 30, she is sitting at home, what is she doing, she is doing a job worth 400 Haj, what are you doing right now, we will find a boy, we will find something, we will find the same thing in 30.  Daughter-in-law's name is not like this, why will you get any great daughter-in-law? Brother, Kant is a girl earning Rs. 300, Mary is a boy earning Rs. 50000, only Rs. 800 Haj.  The boy who earns 700 thousand rupees does not settle for some big, I like 15 20 25 30 40 thousand, then someone's increase or decrease, his future luck will be seen. Why is so much theta being imposed because the marriage is taking place after applying the thet.  Then it is not working because it goes for two to two and a half lakhs, then its advertising programs increase that we are a big price catch, then somehow someone buys you from that price catch. After giving something big in the marriage market, you do not understand that control later because you have been sold once but then again that is like someone who is sold in IPL says that you had taken it for the cricket match but he says  That now you will have to give advertisement there and you will have to dance there too because that is the contract itself, if you buy it then there is problem in those things also, so why are you bidding yourself? These days are it boys or girls or not, we will go to the highest bidder, we will do this to ourselves, why are we not learning proactively on time, because our journey is very important, many people are saying that if we do not get a good partner, then we do not need a partner, oh brother.  The journey of life is going on, it will not go on without our companion and if we accept this principle, which I had this theory of mine earlier, then someone first put poet type words that brother, the journey is not. Important is your destiny, the company is important, your partner is important, we are together and our partner is important and we are saying no, I will survive without him, I need someone else, yes, I love myself, I am good at singing.  It seems but there is a need to love yourself, if the work does not last long then I hope, these things seem to be abstract things, there are no such searchable topics, okay I hope  I hope you guys enjoy, I come from this thought process, so I am not pushing that it has to be done, I am saying that there is a large section of people who are tired and ripe and are not going to do all this.  But are you happy? Ask anyone who has not taken the decision of marriage. If you are 50 years old then ask someone who is 45. Every buddy regrets there is not a single. Look, you will have friendship for 3035 years. Friendship will end, time will pass, testosterone is high, dopamine is high, there is a system of hormones, people meet, time comes, a stage comes, then no one asks you, no one in your family even asks, you become that aunt, you become that uncle.  You become someone who is not married and you are seen in a different way. Otherwise, should we force you to catch the train which you have missed? Learn actively by saying that this is what and I am seeking this.  This is my partner dot co According to me, real people work wherever you work, whatever is your sphere, learn actively there, these are the marriages that are taking place, I used to live in Ambala, I will marry someone from Indore, these are the marriages I  As a marital consultant, I am speaking responsibly. Not much is going on. I don't know whether it is in Indore, what was it in Ambala, what was the story, what was the back story, what is the thought process here. At 100-1 km, language and food and everything else changes, be careful, everything gets married inside Ajman, because how are those marriages happening, like those houses are bought on 99 Ikar magic brick, not in one CR of BH.  I have done so much like this, I have put something like that, I am getting married, the package is 18 to 28 lakhs, I want this much, I want a boy, I want this much, you are not buying a house, you like this, it is some times, right?  Like I sit in screener.in many times and when I was doing research, in such a company you put RE more than 15, RO at 20, profits in last this thing and market cap, so much so that you call it filters, it is fine.  So you put filters, if you put five or six filters then 15-20 companies come up and the dividend payout should be so much that there should not be any loss in 10 years. Promoter Holding  You should be above 60, you put 10-12 filters like this, as an investor, you have to research so many companies, then you got 12 companies, now you will see those 12 companies. Out of these, you have seen, now you are doing research in those 12.  Okay, and then you are selecting like this, marriage does not happen like this, marriage does not happen like this, you just do it like a tailor, because what is the point in that, because of the SEBI, the disclosures are made by the company, so the company is very strict.  The market cap you have entered is Rs 10000 crore and it is of some company, its dividend is Rs 10000 crore, it has no losses, its promoter role is in its actual, so the data is correct, the only problem is that when you are entering it here, you will get the result.  But to check it like that, there is no guarantee that everything is being told correctly. There is a mismatch in the photo you have posted. This photo has been posted.  If a boy or a girl meets anywhere and in real life, the program is up to this point, then from there the red flag should be raised that this photo is fake, it is a year old, it is 4 years old, it is fake, when is it more sexy?  You were looking young, it seemed that now this is it, this should be a red flag, I hope this is a little abstract things, you people like such topics, Tilly should learn, you don't get it, mom, aunt, there is nothing to tell about the relationship, you You go and learn, you say, mother, aunt, aunt, maternal uncle, daughter-in- law, friend, uncle, tell me, I am the boy, I am willing to get married, tell me a good girl, when the man himself will go, not without, then I will take care of the rest.  If you tell me then they will definitely say that it is my child and his, he is a very good and decent boy, he is very nice, now is the time to get married, this is the best time to find a life partner, boys will get girls, boys will get girls, historic like this.  It's okay, which song is it, is it the bride's friend, sisters, I have forgotten the food, okay, Hare Dupatta wali, which song is it? Hum aapke kaun's song, okay, if it goes, it goes, it is brother-in-law's sister-in-law, not brother-in-law's.  Sisters, sorry, okay, I am missing the one with green dupatta, okay, so she will be like this, brother, have you seen this in real life, first of all, I am liking it, oh yes, it is looking very good, what else is it, okay?  The scope is not much, no problem, there is no money, there is not much, I feel something is there, there are relationships of the heart, look a little at the chemistry, all of them are after math, okay then find a partner, talk, see, be proactive yourself, whatever is your criteria.  Tell me, see, they are not seeing that romance, romance, I am not saying that, the society has become like this, inflation will be so much, inflation is a witch, it is okay, she has eaten a lot of desires, it is okay, but still.  Also, find real boys in the real world, find real girls who are naturally smart and intelligent and have that kind of people around you and they do n't wait for mom and dad and do this actively. Parents should also say that son, you too.  I am also searching, father is also searching and everyone is searching and this is the biggest task of our house and you start searching at the age of 23-24 and if you find somewhere right then get it done.  Do n't wait on 28th we will start searching or when this house will be built, when will the house be built, when will we buy the plot, when will we buy the plot, when we will get our share of the first floor of Greater Kailash in Delhi, when we will get that share, when your  Grandmother will go, he doesn't know when Grandmother will go, so it means right now his whole system is working like this, he is sitting like oh, first my grandmother will go, then the greater class will be sold and then uncle.  It will be divided among the uncles, then our share will come, then we will take a plot, then we will build this house, then we will go in search of this, you will be 35, dear grandmother, this is a rob, God bless grandmother, live a long life, okay, your planning can't be like this, this planning is prevalent in many houses. Parents do not speak exactly like this, but what is going on in their mind is like this and then they are saying that in real life now you become something and stand on your own feet.  Stand up a lot, he said, don't become Elon Musk, he is fine, he is not going to do anything great, his work is as good as he is, get it done, no, our status is this.  Your status was grandfather's contribution in this and you took advantage of inflation. If you had assets, then your status is not this. You are the cash flow, it is yours and your son 's is this, so your status is this. You think. Yes, girls, you will get these, but you are not getting these because those girls are saying that this house will be run by the mother-in-law, what will our son get in the name of father, so it is a demanding program, so you leave it, you are this one.  You bow friend, you do this by doing that I hope you have got insight from this, you will learn something from this, please watch these videos on your WhatsApp 2, the people of 1960 whose children are getting married right now are sitting there, okay early.  People of 70's, 1970's and 1960's are afraid of this, you should correct your thoughts, your child will not get married, he will miss his train, if the age of 2829 is called a boy, the age of 25 to 26 is called a girl, if the age is more than this then you should not call it boy or girl, you will say this. Don't say that there is a 32 year old girl, there is a boy, tell me no, there is a boy, a girl, a boy, a girl, they say that there is a Vaad in our Haryana, is that Kacha Pan okay, is it his? Meaning, I really don't know that vulgar meaning, there is none, I hope I don't think it is so, but there is that naivety, there is an innocence, there is no such thing, marriages are happening in such a hurry, the wedding season is going on.  Nowadays, that's my analysis, even after marriage, people show me photos and do face readings, I feel like there should be some innocent excitement in marriage, some excitement at least.  It 's not so late, where is the excitement of getting married, where is the excitement sitting in this way, well, this tune is this washed up tune, you are supposed to be the happiest person in that wedding album. They know what is ahead, at least you should be happy but it is not so, it is getting delayed a lot, life partner is very important, marriage is very important on time, life is very important.  Is it like that question paper is not given to you in a timely manner and the paper will be given in three hours, if you have not given the paper then you are not going to go ahead, then that bus is a very great thing, it is being made and  It is said by some donkey that age is just a number, no age is not a number, not just a number, age is a very important thing, ask any four year old, he will tell you how old are you, you are four  He doesn't say every year, I am four years, three months is very clear, it has been four years and three months, if you ask a 70 year old, he has nothing of 70, 72, 75, because he has enough, but he is more like a child than a teenager.  Ask how it feels in one and a half years, two years, two and a half years. In three, three and six months, age has a huge scope. Many things seem right only on time. People go to hell by giving birth to children in old age.  They are making the lives of their children. At the age of 42, the child is learning to ride a bicycle at the age of 4. It takes life for the 6 year old to run behind. 28 30 32 34 year old father runs away. Now how fit will he become at 47 years.  You should build muscles now and have children otherwise by the time the child is born he will ride a bicycle at the age of 54. The big athlete type who are superstars also find it difficult to run. Do not give birth to children in old age.  When they say that they suffer a lot in America, they are called parents and grandparents and when they are children of 182 years, the father is 65-68 years old, so now he is undergoing treatment, now you are never happy.  Mila, you are just serving him, then you yourself are getting married late because this is the program in your family, this is the story of many homes, do some things on time, many things have value only on time, delay.  After doing it, that taste is no longer there, then that right partner is great, there is no point in getting it so late, I tell you in astrology, if the Mahadasha of Venus is not coming, then why wo n't you go? If the Mahadasha of Venus is written in someone's 90 years, what will he do where? Wait till you taste it. Hey, have fun in Shani's. Okay, take the one whose 20's are going. If Shani's is going, then what happened? Shani's is going, no problem, we will enjoy this one.  Okay, so I hope I will not make astrology out of it but it should be done on time and sometimes what happens is that decisions should be taken in life and then you should work very hard to make them right some times what happens is your decision is not wrong.  It is not right, you can always work to make them right, this is also a good approach, you have taken it as per your wish, this is the right partner through marriage, if it is not right, then it is right for us, you can do it like this also. Don't delay it Humsafar is important but if you have traveled for 50 years without a Humsafar then how much travel is left. Ok then the choice is between traveling and having no Hum Safar so I think Hum Safar is better I think this is my Approach and in the future you will also see the society going in this direction. I hope you understood this thing well. Please share, like, thank you.  you very much"

    "title": "Is Pre-Nuptial Agreement Possible In India ？ What Law Says On It [a3VtvQqPXnU].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, a very simple small topic in India, Pari Mapal Agreement, you must have heard that in foreign countries it is written before marriage, if this marriage breaks, you will give this to me, I will give this to you, it will happen like this, it will happen like this, so that Brother, if there is no further trouble, then is this in India, so there is power, it is necessary, okay, first let's talk, is this possible, then the answer is this country, this is en pro marriage country of this, first country of this.  If there is no word of divorce or divorce in World G Color, if there is no Hindi word or Sanskrit word, then that thing does not exist there. Mother, it can happen in you too, separation of relations can happen. Both the husband and wife got separated and it is called divorce in English, Hindi and Sanskrit, you people do it many times, I have given that information earlier, there is no such thing, it is not there, but despite this not happening, come on this page.  People ask such questions which I ask, which they cannot ask to each other but both are sitting and from my questions it becomes clear to them what is their opinion. People cannot even ask their future wife whether she will have children.  Will she give birth or not? Will she not be in the mood to leave? Yes, maybe she might be in the mood to start a startup. So what time you are interested in India, but at least have some discussions, power is not necessary to make it legal because it is a trust relationship.  But would you like the video?  The other thing that I have to tell people through my pet consultation is that they should definitely talk about this before marriage, so if you guys write 77, write it, it is a very hit video, it has got 3 lakh views, I do n't know how much it will be such a hit, how will it happen?  What is meant by the comment is the video, when I read the energy capacity because of the emotions, I do n't speak like this further, something happens and that's what strikes, okay, then seventh things, if you want before marriage, the boy, the girl, and the boy. Girls ask each other once, if you take five, please give 70 pulses, it would be Priya, in India, it is not possible or legal, so you should know that in this country, it is very very pro marriage, that is why divorces keep going on here, nowadays, by doing some mutual concerts etc.  It is butter but still you mean kiss Sanoj, if one partner does not want then it is not possible. If you can take a minute then yes, but he says no, otherwise without me, then it is okay by doing tax with someone else.  It will be a very good video, I can tell you this much, please, I myself, the creator, say, brother, I want to recite the poem, you speak, you speak, it is fine, and I have a stomach consultation, I told that, so I again mean my fairy medical counseling business band.  Because that's what I tell, take money and don't tell anything else, okay, so I have so much passion that if I tell you that thing, then you can also become a primer, which is what I want, because it has to be said that after one stage, it's not reducing the date type.  Am  I am a very busy person, I do very little, so if there are some less bands of mine, then it is ok, they are not mine, but the Avengers are opened, okay, then the date, I am not, the hair is fine, so I think it may be good for someone.  There is a promise of that video, if you watch that video and write a wish, after watching that video, you can become a fairy medical counselor who charges ₹ 500 ₹ 1000 ₹ 2000 and this is my  The fee is very high, well, okay, I am the one who is charging such a high fee, he is also paying the same fee, so of course, you can easily charge him 110 128 13th fee, people are also the story, I am also making consultants in my street, I am next I want you.  Oil because you will have to tell me the story of the channel, no, what is my name, make me consultants out of me, subscribers type, start wishing money, this is the person sitting in front of you, making money by talking like this.  It has been made by the public, it has been made by you and brother-in- laws are not idiots, but okay, let's see because it is definitely there and it is definitely there because the one who shows the mirror to the people also definitely has a mirror. Nothing can be seen. If the dust gets on the face then it is saying this.  This mirror is clean, you can see dust in it, I give you a face, you get paid for it, brother, you have started getting it, we too have become America, now think of this, you are busy in, you don't know what things, you are not kicking your stomach.  small ones  I am doing consultants, you need content, the content has been posted for platinum members, spend it, I am not a looter, you will automatically press the join button, you will know how much and you will also know from the content, there is money at thousand x value, go and see.  If not, then tell me how many other platinum members are there, keep it up, you guys, sorry, okay then write Mussoorie, write for me also, yes brother, we are very good.  Chain Bhature is available, that means Mussoorie is also available, friends, it is good brother, I am enjoying a lot today, write, friend, write because wherever I will kick my stomach with consultation, I will also ask you to do something else, okay but this video.  So 7 will be put for free, this is free for everyone, so you should understand that brother, when this is being given for free from which we can make money, then I would end by telling a small joke behind the scenes.  I am revealing the secret of all the YouTubers, okay and I am telling it very simply, don't judge too much, only those who are in the mail will understand, the boys will understand who are not our Sardar Bhai and the girls who go to get their hair cut. Basically, when you get a hair cut, it does not happen again and again, nor is it calculated, we press it a little like this, here we do a little like this, he and Bhai Saheb do something else and that is 45 seconds.  You massage for 1 minute, press and do this, you also know that the rate of massage is ₹ 100 and whatever it was or 200 or 300 in which you have gone, now its purpose is to give you a little relaxation and a little to take you to the john.  Say yes to him, but he has to be on time, his wife has told him that he can't bring vegetables, poor guy, keep a list for him, do n't be late, it makes sense to someone that he won't come brother, but what are many people?  Sometimes they don't even know what the massage was, they just thank him and go away. Now you understand that they do n't know that there will be 15-20 minutes more massage, the highest money will be given for it, but it will be 15-20 times more fun.  All the people coming on YouTube are just giving a little massage, it doesn't mean that no, they are from us, they have their own model, it is not necessary to tell everyone, today I have told you, so understand, it is okay.  A hint is enough for a sensible person. Many of my subscribers are geniuses, so a hint is enough for a sensible person. You all understand that I am talking to people. You also have to understand that if you are having fun in 45 seconds, then have fun. Here, 45 seconds will do, have fun.  Have to tell that yes 15 minutes is also something ok so date it I bill make people consultants ok in real life you don't required so why would anyone come to us you are rational logical good sweet  You will talk about peace, the world will come to you, even if you do not have any certificate, someone has gone to Ramdev ji and asked for the yoga certificate. Brother, show me the yoga certificate."

    "content": "Hello friends, today's topic is about war, give something more important this time, happiness is something bigger than happiness, should we chase after happiness, should we chase after happiness or is there any word above this which will bring more joy and happiness, happiness is fine.  So in Hindi, our thought process is very comprehensive, we have to accept that like in English we only speak of mind, we speak of intellect, consciousness also, soul also speak, different men also speak.  It is okay, you should be happy and joyful all the time, so what is there in happiness for happiness, consumption is more, boy will be happy in watching movies, girl will be lover, girlfriend will come, feeling will come, I am happy, if I get something good to eat then sustainability in it is very limited. Whenever something has to be done and it has to be done, then happiness is found and happiness is there as long as it is there. Went to visit a foreign country. Photo khinchali.

Well, the honeymoon went for four days and five days, good photos were taken, Mila, then someone did the clipping, the clothes looked nice, the photos were taken, that Mila got happiness, then the word which I want you is, and in that, you will get a date in happiness, the word I want you, you write down.  In your subconscious and somewhere, if many children also believe my notes, I have only requested the video and many people are making it, I know because after watching the video,  Went, remembered, enjoyed, went like a satsang and then forgot. If you keep a small copy then you will write 'World World' and in it you will write two or four lines on every video, if not more than that, then the youth's knowledge will stick with you and then it will become your habit.  Then you can share that knowledge among others, monetize it and live that knowledge. You like to drink alcohol with your friends on Fridays and beat up your boss. It gives you happiness. I am not of the opinion that you should not take happiness, but is it like that?  It is sustainable, then you will have to meet Friday, then you will have to give happiness again, in this a lovely world, I add 99 more to criticize us, it gives happiness, there is no doubt in it, it is okay, people say that one should not criticize, it is okay to criticize, it is okay to criticize.  Brother, if she does something then she enjoys it, then she does it, she must be happy otherwise why do we all criticize her, someone must be criticizing us too, okay then why is she criticized, we say that it is not good but there is a reason.  Don't tell, okay reason, I am telling today that there is definitely happiness in criticism, there is no doubt, but criticism does not reach us. There is no fulfillment in criticism. You may criticize me a lot but you got nothing. You say that this  He is a creator, he makes useless videos and he is useless, he is useless, he is useless, he will still find people who understand me, likes and likes, my views will keep going, maybe you will criticize me, subscribe and subscribe and then go away, one of my  Even if your subscribers decrease, don't you increase your YouTube channel. If you don't run your YouTube channel, you won't get any benefit, so what's the fun in criticizing. There is no benefit. There is no accomplishment. If there is no fulfillment, then fulfillment comes from less. It comes from doing something.  Fulfillment does not come by enjoying something, you understand this is a big difference for the youth because parents say that I see children these days saying things like don't do this, don't do that, but they are sitting and fighting in this. Our children are very smart, they are smart 20-25-30 years, I tell them something logical, I will take them, they are open and those parents, I am just saying, I am just saying, hey, I am just saying, this generation is not kabomony.  Coming, he is saying that friend, you also seem to be mistaken for me, I am not going anywhere, so he keeps fighting with his mother, keeps crying for us, keeps crying for his parents.  He keeps crying about his own brother, please do something like this in a job, I am not getting success, that means he is an average father these days because not everyone has reached here, everyone is in normal jail, look at the one who is 45, 50, 55 years old today.  If you are a youth, look at your father or you are 45, 50, 55. Look, neither are you older than your parents, nor is your wife performing Aarti, nor are your children listening to you, nor is your boss, so how about you?  Listen, because if nothing great is happening in your life, then at least if you start talking logically, there will be no judgments and if you tell things in a proper manner, people will listen, that is why I am telling these things. Note down the knowledge to your children.  Put this one, it is fine and if the children are getting it directly, then it is very good. Tell your parents that this is the way to understand. If you understand like this then we will understand, but you will say like I am saying, I am saying. not him  If it works then we will say fulfillment, we have taught that there is also a word after fulfilling, Google it and understand it in death, okay, what is full feeling, full feeling is that I spent 2 years for something and I achieved it or I Grow in life like if you go to the gym one day, you will not find happiness in it, you will get some muscles, your face will become a little like this, Golu Polu will look a little less, double chin will reduce a little. Sexiness will come, it will feel full and happiness will come, there is no fulfillment in happiness, but in fulfillment, always remember happiness, happiness is very important, my happiness course is going on, now join it also, you will be able to teach many things well, okay, that will get my platinum membership.  If you find it in sangolaj sutra then happiness is very important but not sustainable happiness. If every  For happiness one has to spend a lot, one has to spend every time and if it is sustainable then it will not be visible but if I am feeling something full in life then I am doing this in my actions and not that, I am doing this in this video.  I made a video again, some got views, some did not get subscriptions, then the losses increased again, but if he is a man on a journey, then it becomes fulfilling that in the video I make, I said, marriage is day and night. People told me about marriage, people said, now we absolutely understand that we should do it for the day, I made the idea of ​​body school that children should not be sent to body school, people said, I understand, I will not send myself, okay, when he grows up.  Happiness is full feeling. If I am telling you one thing that friend, understand this happiness and fulfillment, then will I get happiness in this? You understand that people mean directly, there is no happiness, not that I have told you some good thing, I have learned a good thing, I have learned a good thing. Absorb my consultation. I am telling you after extracting the pain and suffering of people from my experience. It is the essence of the years, it is the essence of the experience of thousands of people, it is the essence of pain and suffering of thousands of people. I am telling you just like that.  I am telling you, but if it changes his life, then I get fulfillment. I am telling him by my example that by getting fulfillment, he gets a lasting happiness.  Now he will not run away because he has achieved less, he has already achieved so much, no one can take him from you and then you are on his path, he is on the path of less, he is always doing something, now like our big politicians who are in power.  Leader is a leader, look at him carefully, he is engaged, engaged, engaged at a big level, he is getting only fulfillment from it and he is getting happiness only from fulfillment, so less is very important, this is what is youth.  In this shining one way, from doing, they are preparing or they are directly doing something above and below this, they are trying to run away, they are trying to bypass, they are not taking fulfillment from less, they will have to do less in fulfillment, they will get it immediately.  No, you will reduce the result, you will not get imijetli, you will not get nature itself, you will not get well done, you will not get it, it is not very easy, ask housewife, the duodenum of the house keeps reducing from morning to evening, never clipping. Today's man gets a job, gets married, then has children, there seems to be some other fulfillment when the child becomes something or the child becomes bigger than your height or you feel something from within, there is happiness in hard work, there is happiness in hard work. Full Film What Are If you do gardening, you planted a tree, you saw the plant becoming a big plant, you saw the plant becoming a tree, you saw the Taurus giving you fruits, then this whole process takes time, it takes hard work, it takes presence, it takes something special to come again.  This is a full feeling experience, then happiness comes from here, but it is in anything, in relationships, in job, in money and investment, today people need it. Dalia brother, how much will it be in 1 year, how much will it be in 6 months, take a plot.  I am wondering how many yards will be increased because I have taken 80000 yards, now this amount of 95000 has become 15000, I will get it, I do not get it like this in investment.  If you don't get it anywhere then go on a sustainable basis in life. Go for long life. It is said that life is not very big but it is also not so small that I get happiness every 15 seconds or 15 minutes or 15 days. Keep having some patience.  Will you have to keep me, will you keep patience, will you remember this word fulfillment? Will you now reduce your life to those who give you fulfillment instead of saying to Shobha ji that I am happy, I have bought a car. Photo  khinchali It gives you a famous happiness rate Is this car very expensive or I am looking very sexy And nobody and interested Nobody is interested of Eiffel Tower and smiling and all nobody it max respect people full miserable and give you date you get a kick in that  If it is so then it is not happiness, it is not fulfillment and going clicking photos from where cannot be a full feeling experience because  Next time, I will have to go somewhere else to feel it again, then I am not able to say that now don't roam around, don't enjoy, eat and drink but that's for him, find happiness in it, you should be full field in life, be happy, be happy and have a full field.  Happy man is doing different activities, jumping from top, climbing mountains, doing anything. Happy man can do anything. There are activities and here he is doing anything and showing it to anyone.  I am not doing this just to show what is going on in our life, we do not have a full field in life, there is emptiness, brother, you also know that for how long I have been showing this to show what is actually happening to me.  If you don't have a full feeling, then reduce the things in which you fill the full field. Now if someone is getting impressed by it, then it is his by- product. If not, then it is his problem. It is okay, you will get your happiness in it, but you will give it to others.  keep trying to show I'm happy, I'm happy, I'm happy. People who are really happy never speak. There is no need to speak. You will know on their faces, in their speech, in their lifestyle, in their pauses, in their vibes. Man, this guy is happy. There is no need to speak.  If not only then I had tried to make it a little deeper. If you understood, how many understood, how many would implement it and how many would write big words, write the word, write the full film, write the English word.  Write it down, okay, write it down somewhere that friend, I will go after this and to go after this, what are the activities that I need to do that fill me, grow from within, remove my emptiness, the problem is not there today.  It seems that if you get clarity for action then give date this is good but just provision listening and leslies I see elderly people listening these channels are open they are saying Baba constantly this is how it happens this is good  It happens, we should do it like this, we should do it like that, uncle, do something, then it happens only by apologizing, Ramdev ji also says, without doing it, it doesn't happen, now keep looking at Ramdev ji, tomorrow we will do Bharti, will it be yours? Does Anulom Vilom feel very good?  Don't keep listening, don't you will full movie and doing this thing will only full you and full movie, you do n't have to go again and again for the feeling that it is like petrol has been put in the car, you have to go and drink alcohol, friend Singh.  You need people who clap, if you don't find people who do that, then you will get the slogan, how can you get a chair somewhere, chair means position, now position is needed so that these people get these people, so that I can make you happy, then you are going on the wrong circuit now. Do less that fulfills you and in that there is no scope of failure in Dependency Book Learning Something New Earning Mani Investing Well Growing Plants Gardening Whatever is less in fulfillment there is no scope of failure  Polishing your shoes, keeping your clothes in good condition, keeping your house clean, changing your bedsheet, there can be no failure in this, you understand, keeping your books organized, keeping documents organized, keeping your mind clear, do not get into trouble with people, a little, all this is complete.  There is a feeling and there is no failure in it that I want promotion, I want it now, I want it so quickly, you can do something on your own, computer can do better, then people are in pursuit of those things. I have a big hope on this.  Discussion can be done through video shot and you have given WhatsApp group below me, but I will do webinars sometime. If you enjoy joining such webinars, then please join because I am creating a community, I am creating an info group. Those who have taste in all these things enjoy it and in the end there will be action, it will not be like satsang, they come and just mean some call, you will have action, you will have to do it, if you do it in life, then you will enjoy, thank you very much."

    "title": "Jaldi Ka Kaam Shaitan Ka ｜ An Old Belief System Tweaked For Youth For Present Times [WpvGBOpKBhw].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, quick work, this has been a belief system of Satan in our country for many years, we will question it, we will try to change it a bit, if you guys enjoy then tell me, first of all, how many of you agree, most of you will agree.  Because this has been said, today we will ask him because look, 2024 is going on if we do not regularly question the old belief systems and do not crush them or do not tweak them a little.  Due to the present time, there is a hindrance in the progress of the country, there is a hindrance in the thinking process because of the belief system, this is what is going on because all the elders have said it but now it is not being implemented in practical life. What is the reason trying to say?  I believe that life throws opportunity and the window is very small and the decision making is not happening because somewhere it is the devil's work. Take, this is a true thing, but what to do, whenever I tell you about opportunities in two or four places in life, five or six things happen in a person's life, decision making, job, then marriage with a boy or girl, third, you find the status of investments in the stock market.  Fourth, take up real estate. Any opportunity comes, should I do it or not? I need time to think because the work of haste is of the devil, the work of haste is of the devil, I also agree, but what to do now when time itself is short for us.  If you are getting it and the one who is taking the decision is going ahead in life, the one who is not taking it is taking a turn while doing the king, then the solution is this, first of all look at it that haste is the work of the devil but when in the exam you have to  If you get time, you have to answer quickly, haven't you already prepared for it? Similarly, whatever major decisions you take in life or whatever opportunity comes your way, carry templates of them.  People for example, I will try to explain two or four things that I do with their examples. Marriage: You have to marry a girl, you have to marry a boy, please make a pen picture and keep it on time, write down your desires.  Keep in mind that it does n't mean that now I will think about it because when some good decent proposal comes, I say decent, it is never the ultimate, so now you get lost in the process of thinking because right now it is not happening that a  When a girl goes to a marriage or a boy goes to a proposal, he is constantly moving, as they say, he is always a radar, he is moving in such a way that if I get a lock on anywhere, I will find a target.  So he is not acting only on you, he is acting like this on everyone, it is okay for everyone, here and there there are some judge- related things, if you have some knowledge of him, then I am telling you with his example, so he is locked on, anywhere, anytime.  It is possible  If it is on any, then you have to see that if you feel the matter is right then you can lock it on there, but that will happen only when you have made a template in your mind. Same thing in real estate, if you have to purchase something, then first you have to do these things.  The market has to remain and the template has to be maintained. The same thing is, if you are not investing in the share market or you feel that the valuation is high, then you should always have to be in the market. 203 Stocks in Watch List In which you are following the companies, reading their annual reports, reading their quarterly reports, looking at their data. If you want to buy an automotive company, then you are monitoring its monthly sales. And steel prices, you are monitoring everything else, interest rates, you are monitoring everything, only then you will take the right decision when you will feel that now there is a correction in the market. Look, when there is a correction in the market. Shares fall but shares can fall even more, correction can come even more, so choose which one, that window will get shortfall, then they will do the devil's job of haste, then keep thinking, then do it with a bang, it will bounce again and again.  That once the bottom is out, it is always known in hindsight. There is a real estate market in Gurgaon by Dwarka Expressway. You would know that its prices were at the rock bottom in January 2019. Even before that, they fell.  After falling due to demonetization, it started rising again from 19, it is going on rising but this is known only later, at that point of time you will have to take decision in what ever information is available to you, success in that only. Money is made only in that and quick decisions are often what happens when a person is taking a decision, he is a wise person then others feel that the decision is being taken very quickly.  The one who is taking the decision very quickly, the one who is a student, he has spent hours of time, beyond that he knows all the templates about it, he just fits four things in that template at that moment like there is a formula and from that he gets  I get to know whether I should do this or not, that is why it is a little deeper through this video. I am not able to bring many examples. I am not able to bring many examples but you have to see who will wear the clothes in the morning.  What to wear is also a decision making, this is how you wake up in the morning, so can you choose according to the day, brother, on Thursday, I will wear yellow, on Monday, I will wear white, on Tuesday, red, on Wednesday, green, Thursday, yellow, Friday, gray, blue, Saturday blue.  Make Sunday orange and keep it as your wall. It is important for you to wear gray every day like Mark Zucker Bug because you cannot wear it every day, we are the country of India. We need brightness, we cannot go wearing gray everyday, so wo n't it be good for you to be quick in decision making? Now it will not be the devil's job to hurry in this because time has to be limited because time is limited and many decisions will have to be taken.  Okay, and sometimes it is the devil's work, so you have to become a devil too, because life is not giving you opportunities, as soon as something comes, you have to decide because whoever is on that side of the system, as I say, I am also on this side.  I am you  I am not on the side of the people that you are listening to me, so here we all are people who tell stories, be it politicians, YouTube, actors, be it marketing people, whenever we bring something for you people.  Brothers and sisters, it will always be like this that brother do something quickly and do that quickly, it does not mean that anything is wrong but only the one who is prepared can take advantage of it, otherwise wise people will foam it, okay. fear off  Missing out: This fear of missing out is being created. Sometimes the fear of missing out is real. It happens in reality. When my mother used to say in my childhood, the bus has come, the school bus has come, get ready quickly.  She was not creating fear of missing out that you will miss out on the school bus, it is coming comfortably, it is lying, no, the bus was really coming, it was really missing, this is the truth of life.  Same truth is true in relationships, you have to get married, there is a template for it, life will take question paper from you, no, you will not get attempt, no, first let me settle, let me become like this, more videos beyond this, if you want, then I will come because of decision making, marriage  The one is doing very poorly in jobs, still people are able to see and nowadays youngsters have become a little smart and have started thinking beyond just a little money. That's how the work life will be, how is the growth, how is the respect, how is the work environment, people are becoming a little smarter these days, which is a good thing, okay but how to run relationships and marriage is getting killed here. Towards this, a great workshop on relationships.  I am doing it on 30th March, I am doing it on Saturday, from 11:30 to 1:30 pm, whatever you want is paid, it is okay, whatever you want to attend.  If you want, you can write R for Relationship in the below given whatsapp 2 hours your queries and in it case studies and live a solutions, all that will be a lot of fun, I can say that it is ok, you will enjoy a lot for two hours, recording will also be given to you, you will also get notes.  Banana And you can also become a small consultant after attending a workshop so hope to see maximum of you in that thank you very much"

    "title": "Jawan Movie Review ｜ Should You Watch It ？ [KaIVty1n9I8].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, I have just come to the review of Jawan movie after watching the picture and I have not checked it on social media that people are saying good, bad, saying great. By doing this, my review is completely independent, ok, independent review.  Whenever you see that I make videos, my energy levels and smile remain the same, I am getting a headache if I tell the result in the beginning of the movie, I get angry, which is called Haryana and Disruptor, okay and meaning.  I am so  I wanted to do a good one. If it was a good one, I was thinking that they will tell me something good but it is not like that. Others may sing praises, do something. Without much spoilers, I will just be telling. If you see, if you have not booked the ticket then you can avoid it.  It is okay that the ticket can be cancelled, normally no one should say this, but brother, this ticket of Rs. 900 is in Omus Mall, this is from Oxwali and many others, you know, a person normally does not go alone.  They are known, then take that popcorn and do so much, brother, not worth the effort and time at all, meaning at least at lease, it seemed that some meaning, I don't know what would be a great thing, there is no greatness like this and I am so disappointed.  That means such a good star cast, money and they waste it like this, the army doesn't know what has been shown, how it has been shown, I am disappointed that for a person like Shahrukh, I started with Fauji serial if you remember and that means  Actually I don't know what was happening in the middle of the judge, he did good roles, there was fuzzy etc. There was no one to teach him about uniform dress. Gauri ji, I am the producer of the movie. Gauri Khan ji, she is a daughter of Colonel Saheb and what is that uniform?  And what kind of dress is he wearing and who is he by doing the acting that he is doing in it? He has made a commando team and has included those who are called side actors. Call it a supporting actor and it seems like he was frying just now from a halwai shop, meaning the person he was frying doesn't have a big stomach and told him to come quickly and he doesn't know what made him wear such a shoddy shooting, so shabby late.  Let me tell you this is cheating with customers, if we are customers then it means the picture has been made very cheap. Anybody who has any sense of sets, budgeting and all that, I do n't know who said that the budget is very expensive, this is a very cheap picture.  I have made it, I have saved a lot of money and now whatever money it earns, the picture is bound to be a hit because by the time it will be word of mouth and by the time the world comes to know, it will be 400 300, I don't know how many crores these openings will have. This congratulation this that congratulation that all this will happen I am telling my subscribers with great responsibility I am telling this with so much responsibility  I am also telling you that effort and time can be saved because for a person like me, I watch two-four movies in a year, I watch maximum two-three movies in that too, and I go into my life with the big thought that man.  This one will be fine after typing, that way it is a disruptor, it is fine, big disruptor means you guys had seen Pathan, I had reviewed it and it also had big issues but Pathan was still the athletic one.  Wisely, the feel of the movie was better, at least it was rich, if nothing else, the foreign shooting where it was done, it was nice to see the sea, doing one thing or the other, here the reef is also like this, nothing else, they don't know anywhere here.  Where have you shot, in Chennai? Have you done that here? Have you captured that jail scene? What fake jail has you made like that? There is no jail like this, meaning the premise of the basic movie is that Indians, if any outsider watches it. take a movie  By mistake, I mean even as an Indian, looking at the Indian bo these days, it seems that we are so stupid, is it that in 1980s movies were made like this, the way they used to show politicians and businessmen, businessmen, thieves, politicians, everything and some messaging, for one, I feel sad.  It is also sad for Shahrukh ji that I do n't know about Hindu-Muslim, you people know how much the boycott has gone on, now it has gone to the other extreme in the sense that I do n't know who.  For C content, first of all you are saying there, Vaishnav Devi is going to Tirupati, he is going here, witch is okay, who has to go to everyone, but everyone understands that sense, I am a person with Guru element, I am open.  I am going to talk about, you guys know why we are afraid of doing so much, it is needed, and here is the ridiculous stupidity of force, nationalism, which nationalism does it mean, if our army and soldiers become brothers like this, then the country will  Aise Thodna means things have been shown in such a stupid way Ek Koi Arms means comedy Comedy Vijay Sethupathi is a very fine actor I most of us have seen him in Farzi and Shahid Kapoor's series Very likable person and good actor but do n't know him  What has been made here, I am not able to understand that he is a villain, he is a comedian, that means I am not able to understand that thing, Deepika Padukone has applied some of her own logic, look anywhere, people, I also know.  People say it is a movie, why are you using so much brain, not so much, not a little, not at all, if you come with so much brain out, there is no sense and this Tom Cruise makes the movie Top Gun, leave it, he is of a very high level which he  Mission is impossible, anything can happen, some make sense, some get excitement, so much, we tell you that one, it means, if you do n't even know how to fly a car, learn it from Rohit Shetty, outsource it. He is an expert in those things, cars are flying, something is happening, action is happening, he was taking the dialogue from a movie, which was sounding a bit okay, when he does the movement, there is no whistle on that too. End  I was feeling so much in the hall. For a person like me, I am also a little excited. If I was even a little good at things, I would have done this but then they were not the only ones doing these movements and everybody.  But it's like wanting the movie to be good and there should be a whistling scene or excitement, it should be good, it should be so long, so long, if they talk about a show of 1240 in the cinema hall, it will start at 11155. Watch the very 35 minute ad first.  So I have a request to Shahrukh ji, my friend, you have earned a lot of money in Pathan, Jawan will also earn, Dinky is also coming in the future and you will be a hit in one year.  Billion dollars in net worth, I may be the first entertainer in India to achieve that net worth, at least this, this is this Gutka wala, which one comes, man, stop doing that Jama Kesari, okay, add Juba Kesari, that second one, that Nowadays one more ad is coming in it, you will say while reviewing the movie, I am telling you about Garam Garam Khoon, Kajaria's ad is coming in that too, nationalism comes first, Akshay Kumar comes in it. Now Ranveer Singh has started coming in it, he is also firing bullets, there is some talk of patriotism, man, who will tell this, man, they think that patriotism is the latest thing, you will de-sensitize it to Indians and Indians towards this.  The patriotic thing is creeping into everything so much that it just feels too much, it is like a complete waste of time and effort music.  The song is not good, Other Than, that old song which one tries to sing a little in the train in the beginning, Other Then, that 15 second song is fine, nothing, any song is not right, it is fine, that heroine's eyes, Tara ji le rakhi hai, meaning absolutely perfect Dum Dum means what Dum goes to show to women that whenever a female cop comes, it will be shown that he cannot do anything, his background is very strong but when he comes from this, he out smarts.  It is very very very very sad that as our time is increasing, film making should be better, stories should be better, so no one knows, some people have written the story in such a way that brother, such scenes will happen, something like this will happen, one should be from here.  It will be like this, Atlee is coming, the song is coming and that role will be like this, I am not giving any spoilers, it is not that I am in the mood, I am saying that go park the car, go up in the lift and get out, brother, very very disheartening less.  Tell it somewhere now [Praise] brothers, that too, it was a thing to come fool, here also fool come, some age-n-dian audience will not get anything right, we will not get anything good to understand, we will not get to see anything with good brains, that is, it is exactly what has happened. I mean, look at how low your IQ is, that means you are eating popcorn with a ticket worth Rs. 1200, Rs. 1200, 900, popcorn worth Rs. 400,500 and the world is sitting like this.  Then you are showing such poverty and something like this, this is happening in India, this is happening a lot, I can't relate, brother, who will watch the ticket in Chennai which is ₹ 663, in Gurga it is ₹ 900, which is a hit after the movies in South India.  It is 300, 400, 500 crores, they earn a lot of foot falls, they have a lot of foot falls, neither in fifth nor in sixth foot fall, they will earn more money than that, meaning if it is 100  People are watching and they are watching 500, so the collection is getting equal. Just think about it, not even 500, it means 63 and 900, I am telling the research from my side, so the final will be that if you have not gone till now.  So don't go and those who have seen it, okay, my subscribers are so angry with this because I am absolutely right, many times what happens is that you have heard people, maybe someone else has made a negative review.  Or are all of them out of 10 coming back positive? I really don't know. I just came and went in this shirt. I came here and am sitting like this. I mean, I haven't even drunk water like you. I said, once from inside I felt very sad that  Friend, let me tell you why should it be someone else's, I have so many subscribers, okay why should it be wasted and I am telling this with great responsibility, I have to kick someone's stomach, brother, that.  The picture has been made on a very low budget. Earn a lot of money. Do n't waste your time. This is a low level picture with a very low budget. This is not a big budget picture at all and whatever money it earns will be 100% profit.  And beyond the theme and system that has been put in place, it has been made such that all the politicians are fools, all the businessmen are fools, the army has no idea how they have shown the system that bullets do not know how to fire or do not work.  There are no weapons, weapons have come from outside, there are arms dealers, till date no weapon has come from outside, no one is talking about money in India, those are the issues, weapons are working well, everywhere, somewhere in Kargil, somewhere, you can use it as per your wish, it is okay.  There are so many issues in Weapon like how many imaginary stories will you show that things have never happened like this, meaning no one is in a relationship and none of the actors are suiting their roles, whatever small actors you have shown like Sunil.  Grover is a fine actor, okay, very under-utilized, very under-utilized, now it is like there are so many good actors, instead of a big budget, a big budget has been shown, no, I do n't think so, you guys, whatever you watch a little carefully, you and I.  Do you know where the notes are being spent? Some of the producer's money was not spent. According to me, this is a lot. According to me, now I do n't have that accounting anymore. The picture is not worth more than Rs. 60-70 crores. Can you tell me the budget? I don't know, it's okay, but it can't be higher than this, it can't be higher than this, it's Shahrukh's picture, it's a homemade picture, but he won't have any money, but friend, don't do this, friend, I am very upset with Shahrukh. Feel is a good businessman, good person, good mind, but this is not the same, it is a bit scary, they also feel that this is not me, it is all about nationalism, you are the son-in-law of an Indian Army Colonel, you are without a cap.  You are saluting me like this, I mean there was no one to tell you in the movie and you are court martialing the arms dealer, you are right about his directness, you guys at least have some sense and I have seen one thing and I can tell very this  There may be some Jingo Jam etc. in South India movies, although our people from South India are in the armed forces, but in the movies, they are not able to dress and get up and get it right, that is, they put people like confectioners.  give north  Indian Movie Still Do A Better Job Let Me Tell You Look at the movie, it is all South Indian, Shahrukh is fine in it, but he is from somewhere, if he feels like this, that feeling, the feeling did not come from somewhere, the fun did not come from anywhere, it does not mean like this.  I felt that I was thinking and I had made this a little earlier also that it is very good that the South has been included and brother, don't do better than this, separate yourself, let them separate theirs, this is half garbage and there is nothing in it.  then there is that  Cameos have been inserted in I Believe in Hindi movies, it is Sanjay Dutt's, among the rest it is Allu Arjun and who is Vijay, now they have come up with all the ways to loot the money from the public, it is so much that it will not work.  The script has to be right, then the acting and then the stars, direction, everything else falls into place, music etc. but the script is so loose, everything means and that car is like that.  What is the word in English? Car creatures, carry creatures, those carry creatures, everything is made like this, no one, nothing, it seems like it is forced, as if children do not do it in school, as if someone has caught something by typing a stage show, his beard looks fake.  This is what Sardar ji is doing as if no one is coming from anywhere, everything seems to be fake, it seems that man, what is this, I am feeling that man, Shahrukh Khan is really an experienced actor.  When he saw this shooting or movie, he must have seen it on the monitor, how the scenes are looking etc., then he just approved that Gauri Khan ji is a producer, she did it at all, it means anything, it means I must have it, I believe him. Got a good track record in South India but here it is not worked sorry to say that is ok please share review because why to waste time and money let's call out  Things because they will be painted forcefully. Best hero, best fast, best action. Very good messaging is very good. First messaging is nonsense messaging. Whoever will forcefully say no no no no, that feeling is coming in it. Brother, there is no better feeling than that. Guruji, I am giving it to you on the channel from Gurugram, you all subscribe to it, I do better with it and right now it is a little hot, like hot blood, details will be given sometime in two-four-five days.  Depending on the movie, it does well in terms of collections. What is the rush in the collections? Nowadays, you can see that you can collect it completely, but it seems to me that the movie will tank on Monday. There are a lot of advance bookings now, people are leaving now.  I will go there, I don't have any work over the weekend but on Monday the movie will tank that is my gut feeling and if it doesn't then I will become sad again because I will think that my countrymen do n't understand the meaning of this, it's okay.  How can we mean that the word of death is used a lot, normally in the family, like you will know me, in the friend circle, I am brother, straight or straight, otherwise every buddy wants to have an outing for a person like me, I go very rarely, okay  The person who goes two to three times a year goes to be happy, that is, not to waste time, it will be good fun, if you do something then depot dispatcher, we also know that brain has to be used not much, look at the picture, but  Brother, getting a headache means sitting and wondering when will it end, like that picture gets very slow before the interval and then the next one comes, it is a bit exciting that you think that somehow something good will happen after the interval.  When she did not come till the end, she was looking at the public like this and left and right that there must be someone somewhere. People had taken out their phones. Normally, what happens when people take out their phones, the moba is cutting the mobile etc. in half, then the one in front and behind is  He gets irritated and tells her that even though the movie is playing, turn it off on the phone. I saw a lot of people coming out and people didn't tell there that the person behind should turn it off because they are also knowing. Friend, I am having to bear this.  Is that another indication of a movie which is not doing well? Disruptor is ok and Shahrukh needs to. I will tell you one more if that.  Only if you understand and listen, there is a need to change the roles. Doing is fine. Action is not action. Let's do it and say it. Action is nothing, thing and logic should suit it, it just happens that nothing hangs anywhere.  So whatever you do I am not being harsh at all let me tell you I am not saying that I am a fan of Shahrukh but I have been following him and liking  Him for the personality and the business sense and the family man is because you know I also come across as you know a family oriented person so accordingly there is a soft corner there is that soft corner only then when you went to see the picture but that depressor is also the same.  Which gives you hope that no man, he will still pull it off money wise, he will still pull it off, okay, I don't think  So there will be any loss because in the picture I don't see any money being spent. Okay, so we will earn money, but man, that is one thing, this is not a movie, we will be proud of, okay, it is like a picture, isn't it?  Ram Jaane Kari Thi Kabhi Ya Woh Guddu Every actress has got a list of movies only because of this The meaning is the wife is the producer so the movie of the house is so you will not be able to say it by Tata because so I think this experiment of getting this South and North together and all that I think it just failed and it failed I think quite ridiculous. Something of theirs has been taken, theirs has been taken, because when the southerners do everything alone, they are still able to pull it off, they watch movies, Indian Hindi  The audience also sees that the pictures are also hit, you see the jailer, see this, do that in that, just do n't be able to do this thing in this because the messaging is trying to do something, there is a lot of confusion and nationalism and all that feelingless, that was that.  Earlier there used to be our national anthem before movies, now it doesn't happen nowadays because it didn't happen today, was it in Gurgaon only or please write it down Because actually I am asking you guys, okay, I don't mean, other places were also closed, when was it closed, what happened to its region, did something come up, you know, it doesn't happen in your city right now, it doesn't happen, or I felt somewhere here that  It doesn't happen because I was like abhi khada hona hai abhi khada hona hai abhi khada hona hai there they like the movie has started ok so that I was like that nowadays if you don't stand then it means I go so rarely ok then please write in the comment section jin jin  Have you given Do you agree with me or say no to me, I don't think so friend, I am having a headache so much, I am fine, so please share this review, people's time and money will be saved, thank you.  mech"

    "content": "Hello friends, today I will tell you a great concept of war like this Mahagribal and this great Agreeable and there is a scale in the middle, it is a concept, it will be a little high order thinking, please watch the whole thing and try to learn from it, Agreeable means English, Agreeable means one who takes the matter seriously, yes sir.  Yes people please type in this also yes ji ok ji nongle wala in extreme cases people who make most of the success and bitterness reduces in nonaggressive now from here it becomes second order thinking simply take the stick meaning because it is a scale  And this is an extreme, so in our ancient knowledge you know that excess of anything is bad, so no one is saying go here, go here, but if you want to understand then there is a small child, two children, one  Just like everyone has it, a big child, a small child or a child is an agreeable child, he wants to take it, father or mother, no, it is not good, it is useless, no let it be, he is agreeable, the mother goes to him on every matter, so he does not get the toy, who gets the toy  If he lies down, I will write it down so this thing happened in childhood  When kids do it, then our philosophy and mind does not work that much, but when we grow up, then I would like to tell you that women, ladies, girls, jobs, not much money, committees are also exploited, even if there is less, you get more money.  They do not even get it and they are very agreeable, this can be reduced by giving less money to the women, give them a little respect, give them some value, improve the environment a bit, make Monday in and give them some security that they have to come at this time and then  Go in and then keep doing it and you are more agreeable further, there is no condemnation or anything about gender in this, there is no need to tell or understand such gender, there will be exceptions in it and there will be exceptions among men as well, these are always exceptions in anything  But I am agreeable and now what happens is that any man or any woman who is agreeable, people will not like her and the parents also have two children, one is the mother who lies quietly and the other one doesn't agree much, he doesn't  I don't like it, friend  He does n't ask for anything, he is a big man and he likes the people who agree, this is also a fact, it is just a fact and in the relationship of the employee, there are the ones who give money and the ones who take money, so agreeable people like this, so many people  When they go for their linking, they do not get it again in life and the chances of bitterness coming are very high because then these mostly become people pleasers, how do I say this, so we have to see that there is some way in between this as well  If I am happening everywhere, it is wrong, if I am crying everywhere, people don't know, keeping it on their forehead, everybody will run away from me, okay, I mean anybody has date, non-negotiable bosses, relations, friends, anything, friend, you do n't listen to anything  But one thing is that go at 7:00 pm, we all will meet there, go then the program is cancelled, you made the program, now you don't even say anything to him, many people don't even stand there, when you don't standard good bad, your linking is not there  Liking and you're already just not thinking  I don't want to fight and you remained quiet because friend, if I say that then what is the use of it to me in my work, it is said that we should concentrate on our work and every single person should keep it in mind that if someone genuinely you  You can ignore one, I am giving you this advice, it is only agreeable and negative, genuinely you can ignore it, it is a good thing, but if it is not possible to ignore it then brother, whatever is his program there, you should tell it out loud and then  After that, there is no need to remember it from your mind again, do not give rent free or competition for anything here, if something is troubling you here then first think about leaving it, but sometimes it is not possible to leave it, then leave it  And in forgetting, greatness has been shown and told in saying but it cannot be practical and this customer care is going on in your mind, you will decide yourself, the other person giving knowledge will come very easily, hey leave it, Mattipa Matti ka is said no you automatically say in punjabi it is mitti paji  Matti Pav ji, sometimes the mud is not found, sometimes the mud is found on his face and not on him, so do whatever you want to do with whoever you want, don't be too agreeable, this D message does not mean that you pick fights with everyone, talk rudely to everyone Degree mummy told everyone to get up otherwise I am not able to agree and I am getting benefit from that date this is too extreme don't take it to any extent but not this concept date this concept is there when something is wrong with you in your job  So the boss misbehaved with him, if you feel that it is wrong then don't do it in a hurry because you will give your wife this way and then other people will exploit you that this is a very powerful man who can say anything.  Two, he will do this and we will also do something for him, we will talk to him with great love, he is a very straight forward agreeable person, he is a very good brother, he is a very good man, he never refuses, he never refuses, he is very good, very good,  I am listening to good boy, I am going through good girl syndrome  That person goes because he feels that now my image has become good, if I refuse now then that image will not remain, so this system is such that of exploiting, put in a concept and say that brother this is yours  Girlfriend can exploit if you are a boy and by the way why would Varsha say to girls, go today, don't go to office, don't do this, agree to everything, otherwise you will not go to see this movie, you will not go to this restaurant, you will not go to this restaurant, you will not go to this,  We will not do it this way, we will do it that way and you are going to agree, you are going to agree and why are you agreeing because you feel that okay friend, okay friend, now you have to see this as your homework, this is for the youth because  Only a seasoned person can tell you the complete template of living life, you need to apply your formula where you are ready to become accessible because it is makes a difference like you are not a foodie, so I will feed you chana bhatura, dosa, chowmein  If it does n't matter to you then let's go and make an agreement there.  There is no problem if anybody comes there then you know what is you doing, situation google comment, you don't get much in real life, real time reaction time because you have to strain to eat directly and once you do not go anywhere,  He does it within the first three seconds, through his face, through his mouth, through his body language, then you are agreeable and there are many people who do not train themselves in this, this is the work of a mental and guru, to train you, not to live your life, but to make you hang on to himself.  It is not that I tell you every day that now it is not enough, I have given you the formula, I have told you once, write it down, the one who did his homework, the one who put in half an hour, understood the concept and went to see in his life where is my compulsion  I am agreeable, yes, I should not be, so I am supporting these hundred things like this in life, from morning till sleeping, so in every 100, you should not be agreeable, this is D message, and in 9990 only, it should be you can't be disagreeable  These 100 also have respect for the society and are relationships  There are friends, seniors, juniors, parents, wife, children, they will say then leave it, this has become an ad, so you don't want to become much of an ad at all, but you don't want to become a Peda also, the ad pain has to be in the middle of the Peda, okay, in the middle, otherwise you will become a Peda  All of them will be eaten up, so stay in the middle and somehow all of you have to find your comfort, first start with five things, brother, at this time, I know, go for a walk or do some religious activity or I have a book, some personal one  The space is yours, nobody will disturb me here, I will be the person who does things, I will not do it if I have to leave the office on time or do something because gradually everybody takes a little bit of it That is the Chinese policy of doing little by little, if people do too much then they will get attacked but if someone steals two rupees from you, asks for ₹5, do something slowly, you don't realize it, if someone takes away a big thing at once then  The man will say no in 1 minute, everyone knows me  I will say 10 lakh rupees, it is not accepted in ₹10, I am asking for 10 only, friend, give it to me, give me the money for the tea, give me this, I am giving you examples, it is people's gate because it is done little by little  This is a little bit, there are many people who have learnt these eight things to take advantage of people's agreeableness, many people are master artists who have learnt these eight things, how to exploit you, today I have told you about the phenomenon, from now on you will know about this phenomenon  If you want to show that when this happens to you, then write about this incident. All those with whom this happens, please write in the comment section so that other readers also feel that friend I am not able to understand it, but if you see 10, 20, 30 comments, then you will feel yes.

    "content": "Hello friends, very interesting topic, is it okay to displease one's parents, the question is very simple, understand it well, I am giving guidance to the youth, you and the parents should also listen and tell whether I am guiding them right or not.  I am not spoiling the story for the children. Genuinely, I want you all to understand this thing carefully. What is displeasing the parents? Dissatisfying the parents means that the parents want something to be done or expect something from you. Keep and you do not complete that thing, this is the reason for resentment, it is called disappointment in English. You can think about selecting a subject starting from eleventh class, the thing is power, from subject to college, from college to job to spouse, this is what  There is talk of a child being angry at the age of 40. I am angry at the age of 45 and today's system reduces it a bit, although there is a relief in homes that basically it is about  D control and many times many situations have come up with many children. Look at the elders, the scoundrel children are there, the parents are more scoundrels, they don't just get angry, they get angry with the good children, it is okay where there are expectations, where there are no expectations.  There is no resentment but it does not mean that I am putting you in such a situation which I am addressing those children who have this question because they ask, Sir, should the father be angry with the mother by getting married?  I am dating a girl, her parents are not her mother, her parents are no, she is not good, okay, then the decision making is going on, I do pet consultation, it is different, if you concentrate on her, then you can take one more, if you are capable, okay and that is your issue.  The more the other vice, the less this video will work for many people. Okay, whenever the situation comes such that even one person has to get angry, if you do not make father or mother angry, then you will automatically  If you get angry with someone, you yourself will get sad, then take the angry one or take the sad one. If the situation is that I have to make myself sad or make my parents sad, this is the question, is it okay for the angry person to have a sadness in him or a resentment bill?  Read, you have something called sadness, this is called sadness, so brother, don't make yourself sad, I am giving reason to the parents, I am telling you not to do bullying like this, there is no reason to make the parents sad.  You did not want to do much, your heart beats for them, you gave them what they wanted and made yourself sad. One sadness will come with you lifelong but it is not a guarantee that your parents can live a happy life again because of your mother. Permanent indifference has entered into the life of through your father's behavior and after 40 years in the husband's life, there are many daughter-in-law issues and no mother sauce. Note it and brother-in-law and give. Can never be correct, so his mother told him that he should never be happy, this is how father's own 1.5 crore programs of bitterness are going on, that too is nothing, he will get angry with you at time, he will become sad, but in his life,  It is sad and in the future, they will again push for five things because they have got the idea that you value their displeasure, so next time when they get married to the girl of their choice, it will happen so easily. Can  Don't let me live, then he said, you do many things like this, make your daughter-in-law do this, do this with us, then do this demanding program, then that, then you will agree on some stage, brother, he will not agree, it has to happen, if it happens, it doesn't happen, then don't happen. How do you turn back when parents become selfish? Mother, you can be selfish wherever you are, but if you are selfish then at night, when the mother is worried about the small child, she gives him medicine again and again, then listen carefully.  Forest Clarity Give of India is telling you, listen very carefully, mother, if the child is safe at night and has the power to think, then he is asleep, he did not sleep, that is why he woke up, because his selfish motive was to take care of his child, because he  Chhotu Baby was so important to him at the time, he gave so much value to his identity that he did not sleep, mother, you are worthy of gold and there are some like that, even he is selfish, always because if your  In happiness, you remain so sad that you lose your mental balance and go into depression. Then you will be able to give happiness. Whatever I am saying, I am saying it for the welfare of the parents. If you are their child and you are in depression.  Can parents remain happy because of Karan? Any parent whose child is in depression cannot remain happy. Can a child who is very sad himself make his/her parents happy? If you tell your parents today, Puri didn't make me happy but made me angry Lifetime, you still have the opportunity to make them happy. You have chosen your career as per your wish, it is not about them, you are doing well in your career, your money is working, you give them a car, you give them a Bangla, you give them a tour ticket.  Take it, give them clothes, give them anything, give them happiness. Look ahead, many film actors say that you used to say to me, become a doctor, become an engineer, then I went there, it happened like this, it happened for me, it swallowed me.  I will be there now  If parents are very proud then this is how it is for parents. If parents come after you, if parents think then they may have their own agenda and they may say you do like this. You may not listen to them and take it out.  Yes, it may also be possible that it was literature and you were wrong, it may also be possible but in this also it is the failure of the parents if they cannot explain to an intelligent child who is their child because sir, the game is of Tarak, Tarak should go on.  you guys a  The thing to be seen is that when you tell your parents, I want to marry this girl and she is not ready to accept it, then when she is not ready to accept it, then what precepts do they have, and which community does that girl come from?  What status has she come from, what family background has she come from, maybe her father's experience may not be suitable for her, then you have to address these questions - Father, why are you saying this is not right, I just told you. Why didn't I say, what happens with the bus, it would not have happened like this, I just said that it means that Baahubali movie is going to be made, that Shivgami is saying that my word is the rule, that if you do this kind of thing inside the houses.  We have such a big democracy. Unfortunately, there is no democracy in our homes. India is a country that is a vibrant democracy, but there is no democracy in our homes. This is also a truth and this is the reason for our happiness.  There is a reason, otherwise in a democratic country, there is no need to be so unhappy in a democratic country, there is freedom to do everything, there is freedom to do anything, there are many such ridiculous countries in the happiness index, it is okay where the meaning of non is not known.  This is a ruined country and they are above us because perhaps their family would be of such a type that when it is ruined outside, we used to relax the family, this is also a factor, this is also a fact where everything  If there is freedom to do things outside, the family catches hold of them, no, no, how did you manage to do everything, if everything doesn't go well, then this life is complicated, there are no answers in me, video is there, do you like it, do you like it, do you guys know, please write to the parents.  You also have to understand that you have to influence your child, you have to tell him everything is right and wrong in your eyes, what is right and wrong in your eyes, see if things can be so matched, it is a situation, what is right in your eyes is in the eyes of others.  This is correct in the eyes of the child. In reality, it may be correct. Which size does the child know? Do you know it? It is also possible that it is okay. I have also called him an expert. Any consultant can tell him what is the right thing.  I am quite an expert or someone who has the experience to remain wire you are getting are going in these things you leave this stand you leave this time try this give it to both of you hey man this thing  So Guruji told very well the true possibilities and other vices, it's like life but the kids always like that you give something else of yours to the angel investors that yes, my business plan is like this, it will happen like this, it will happen, you will invest your money, that guy doesn't ask questions.  How do you do a supply chain like this? What is plastic? What is your market? What is your profit margin? What is investment? What is return on capital? What is investment? Those 10 piece questions.  Will ask, if he feels right, he will invest his money in this thing. With these life periods, if you are worried about having a child in the future because he is no longer a mother, then give him a presentation. Prepare your attempt genuinely. Make your attempt like this.  Don't make them angry, write genuine type, put it in proper presentation form and start with S. I am standing there saying that I am starting my own, you tell me how to start and this is me. That's why I want to do a presentation, that's why I want to do it, I've thought about its benefits, I've also thought about that, now you have a star above that, so I'm ready to listen to you, but you won't say this, listen to us.  That just because of you, now I am a parent, so this does not make sense anymore, we live in a free country, parents, please tell me, that is why we worship IT when the situation becomes such that now there is no cure. No, you have done all the logical things, now it is a simple situation, either dad will get angry or you, do n't make yourself angry, don't make yourself sad, make dad sad because now he is his problem.  And father does n't know anything. It is possible that she is a pregnant woman. Her stomach is not clean. Next day her stomach is not clean. Father is still not happy. You have made a big sacrifice, but father, the stomach is not clean whose stomach is clean.  That person is never like that, if they say relief concept then it does not mean right, I am freeing the happiness of parents, I am freeing the war, there is a lot of war and fight, there is no clarity on clarity, so give only this clarity.  You are enjoying, you are getting clarity, you are not getting it, I have understood whom to offend, now I am interested in the channel, I can't take my subscription, I just say this  I can say that this is for a little loyal audience, this is a channel with 100 million subscribers, not Ban Shakti, there is not so much clarity, okay, everyone will get it, then no one got it, okay, a little bit, he has to understand different things, there is no dog on such a thing. Isn't it like the one who has got chilli, to make angry, to make angry, don't say hello, don't respect, don't listen to anything, don't listen like this, listen, give full presentation, keep your points, understand, listen to theirs too, when more like this is happening in both of them.  So Guruji has my consultation there which can be uploaded please, it is not that father's friends are his friends here because I told you that the third point of view can be told that doing this can be done, the third thing has to be done and  If it is the best thing, then why are you getting paid for the concentration? You got to do the butter thing too and this fight will also be a band because now you are doing the third thing, neither his nor hers, so this session should also be like this, those who have the power.  If you want to take consultation, you can connect directly on WhatsApp and give can just tell how and if you have not subscribed to the tech consultation channel then subscribe and there is money and peace of mind, I will definitely discuss it in the big and small of 30 seconds there is money and peace of mind.  This means that there will be minimum one or two to three workshops in a month. Some videos have been uploaded earlier. Taking this membership will bring peace in your life. Clarity will come and money will come from it or maybe money will come first and due to money coming, clarity and peace will come, both of those things are power, but in 5 to 6 months you will realize that yes, this is happening, so much clarity.  I am getting you bill be able to join me workshops which I conduct on youth and on clarity when the relationship will be on many things, okay so please and already content is given in this.  There are videos on decision making, there are videos on stock market basis, there are videos on mental model, so you will be able, you are straightforward and you will be able, you have a lot of clarity because we do not need tools to get clarity in life, like an electrician is. Or a plumber has his tools, a carpenter has tools, without him we cannot do anything, so in this way we need tools for our mind, you are the arrival decision, so that is the thing, I give it to him.  By going to the level, I understand the thing about membership, I will tell you already. Video delivery after you take membership. Thank you very much."

    "title": "Log Kya Kahenge ？ ｜ Interesting Fresh Perspective Given [g2wjk1belzs].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, what will people say, this is a very good topic, this dialogue is spoken a lot, apart from this, many people have made books and motivation videos, but till date no one has tested whether it has given success or not, such clarity of truth, clarity of heart.  If it remains then write K and if it fails then write F. This is a sentence of three words on this word. What will people say? Today you will know the truth, the youth will also know and the parents will also know.  And the parents have to give this to the children because the parents are also accused a lot on this, so according to the parents also the thing is right, what will people say, it is the biggest disease, what will people say, by doing this, some dialogues have been created. All is well, I am telling you the truth of 2023, which I will tell by giving examples from today's time in actual. You know, practically nobody is bad in actual. What will people say about this dialogue? Many housewives, many youths do not want to do sex, oh father is not allowing me to do it, mother is not allowing me to do it, what would the society say if I was not allowed to do it, if I was told, if I was given encouragement, but they told me like this, people.  What will you say, I am not able to do anything, I am able to do it, I am giving you the truth, you know those who are motivational YouTubers, they are sitting with huge crores of rupees, they will not say like this, what does Badarda do to you?  There is badness in the morning and evening. There is no border in the morning and evening. In today's time, everybody is living. Boys and girls are living without marriage. So they should be badness. Society will eat it. But what if they are not living and if they are not living then what is their life?  I am also telling its colloquial just because what will you people say, you are not a stranger, meaning you become successful also. A boy and a girl live in anonymity in a big city, inside a society.  They are living in a room or a small flat. Their parents may or may not know. Their colleagues may or may not know. The landlord may or may not know. They are not bad that we are our life, our body is this thing.  If they are fine, then it has nothing to do with what people will say, so will they get success in life, this is the example I want to tell, one has to do a little higher order thinking. In the videos you understand what I am saying every time Next time when you listen to someone what people will say You are under confident in your craft and your skill so you don't want to do that thing It is as simple as that which big people  Celebrities are big people are trolled Don't you think they are also little bit badarda they feel they are good at it they know there is money in it  No, that is their livelihood and their focus remains beyond that, tell me one such person, from the Prime Minister to the top leader of the opposition to the Chief Minister to any film star to cricket star to whom there are no people who say it is just the opposite.  Just look at YouTube, those who are not going to listen, even themselves say it, I also say it about many people, many people would be saying it about me too, if someone is going to write in the comment section, then what will people say? Hey, what will people say then?  We even turn that into a comment and turn it into content, saying, okay, come next time, you have destroyed all the trolls, because the one who is sitting with the platform can only do this, people can write small things.  Will go away, some will tweet, some will forward, some will want to start this, if I want then do it, why are you taking permission, from whom are you taking permission, no, but what will such people say, then hey, what will people say?  You are not a bad person, no one is bad, people, keep your heart on your heart, you are really a bad person, it does not come from me, it will happen or it will not happen, try it, if you enjoy it, then do it, if you don't like it then leave something in your life.  You also have to fill it, start it, don't do it, what will people say, many people are hiding in what will these people say, so next time when you see your wife not wanting to do anything and  Saying I don't know what people will say in the society, what will they say in your friend circle, in my relatives, I will do this, I will start cooking, I will start making cakes, I will start doing bakery, no one says anything, no one has time, and you will earn four paisa.  So you will be told that you are very good and you will not earn, okay then you will be told, Well tried, people are not that bad, are you bad? If you see Sambalpuri, not that hey man, she is trying well, she is doing well, she should do good and  People do it too and one half of the people found in it, what would they say, if you are not doing anything then at any point of time, still some people are saying something and if not, then someone like me is saying that.  You are not doing anything. You are a loser. If you are a woman above 40 years of age and both your children are above 10 122 years of age and have passed sixth and seventh class and are doing everything in life yourself and you are asking for them.  something to hold on to  I am not thinking that if I do, then what kind of mother will I be? What will people say? So you, you have enjoyed being useless, your husband has earned money, you will sit at home, you will enjoy and then you will say, I teach a lot at home and worry a lot. I am talking about my core audience, which is the middle class, where a woman does not have to sweep, wash and wash utensils inside her house, if someone comes from outside, then this is the next time whenever you see someone like this.  If the man says then you should make his impression, Munna, no, Munna, no, you could not do it, you could not do it, you have to say it like this, Munna, even if Munni, Munni, you could not do it, leave it Munni, what will people say, this is not the issue.  The issue with you is that you are not confident, you are lethargic, you don't want to do and you are just like that, what will people say to anyone I told you that whether you are a top leader, an actor or an entrepreneur, if you are leaving someone then tell me that in our country people are stopping from working, they are not worried unless you are doing any illegal immoral work.  Due to which you should feel ashamed or have done wrong thing, in fact, many of those who do this wrong thing do not feel ashamed, so why do you have to worry? Please share this message with friends and what will people say next time?  This is not an issue, this is the only thing I wanted to tell you, this is the truth, it is no anchor, no issue, no motivation is needed on this, you have been given clarity today, there is no need of any motivation because actually you are not bad when I am.  This thing comes in your mind that what will people say you are under prepared you are not sure work on that moment you will be very sure  That's how this business model will work, this is how mine will work, if you want consultation on this, if you want mentorship, then that is also what I provide, it comes at a cost in case you are interested, you can get in touch wherever if you are facing problems.  Isn't it what these people will say that in reality it is not the people's problem but the problem is related to you and your problem should also be solved in the consultation.  If you go then you can take that service also thank you very much"

It will be very beneficial to listen carefully to the videos and this.  Keep a note in your subconscious or somewhere that how is it possible, it is correct to accept 250 dates and not after taxes.

Once a good enough price plus, you will stay close. So the time of competition will not be a problem and your child's energy will be saved, so I will make separate videos on this, what are the benefits of each, but today I do history on lunch and whenever there is a possibility of such a situation happening.  Work and give your work or boss comes, this or that person comes, in many offices there is a canteen, there is a separate arrangement for eating, which is very good, but if it is not like that, then you have to get out of that pest and go somewhere.

When the people who have entered are 45-50 years old, those whose children are grown up, their 30s, their problem, their biggest pain point, the address under this video will be in these terms, date, why, you will like the video and till  Let's see what happened to the concept of Mansabdar - you could recruit one of your own soldiers, connect your own taxes and an auto could be of mass autonomous type in a particular area but its elegance would remain.  The biggest catch with the king was that he could not give anything in inheritance, meaning after that everything would belong to the state, whatever he earned, whatever properties or whatever accounts were maintained, how many years would he live for how long would he remain a Mansabdar.  So the same concept is there in government jobs when in government, if you become like this, you have worked very well for 30 years, then your child cannot become like this because of this, you are a mansabdar in government, when all  These entire bureaucracy are following only Mansabdari system, these days they are like that, you are going to any government job, there is no benefit in it, now you will say how am I getting benefit, my job is lost, my salary is mine and I am  I will have a wife, I will get married and how many permanent jobs do I have? Brother, it's a fun holiday. Listen carefully. You are going to bring in Ram Jeth. You are a very good lawyer. You have earned so much name for yourself, so Mahesh ji should get the seat.  It is an automatic benefit, you have given them a platform, this is in nepotism, yes, this is the problem, you cannot do nepotism, this is the biggest disadvantage in government job, if I am sitting on the neck, my shop is doing very well, Garg and  Sun Aggarwal and I am taking these surnames because they belong to our business community, so you can see that shop and whatever pomp and show I have established in that shop. 1180 Old Shop 100 years, 60 years, 70 years, then the next generation takes advantage of it, the accumulated goodwill of 30 years can be transferred, including in politics also, father was a politician, everyone liked him, everyone used to treat him like this.  They do this when they have to come and go in the house, so the son and daughter also got the spillover effect of it. These are the middle class, who are government servants, who are not transferred further in this way.  Do power, your thing, this bread and get irritated with this thing, I want to open the society note speak from the middle of this video, cry, wash, band, you also have a choice but you wait in the government, when the diary system is exactly of Akbar, the same cut, copy paste.  If you are retiring at the age of 60 and are Cabinet Secretary at the top position, it does not mean that now your son or daughter will not be sent to the lab, Lal Bahadur Shastri Academy. Because father has been doing this for 40 years, you have done very good work, even if you become Bharat Ratna, even if your child is not qualified, then people take pride in this foolishness that this Hajj is yours, it is not life, it is good, brother, become also.  For how long are you continuing in a government job? I will also tell about this from the middle of the video onwards. It is okay for the one who is very low in social status and belongs to a poor family because he gets a jump.  in some other way  You are not going to get a jump but your family is already here, you are coming here, this thing comes from a very low level of backward class in government job because they have no way and it is okay for them to take a jump in the society if your father is good.  If you are on a position in the government then please don't do it because you will start from here again and will never be able to reach your father's level while he is alive. There is no happiness. I have never seen officers happy in the second generation group. My consultation. Because his father is a big man, isn't he? Because at the age of 30-35, not all become big men, there is also a pyramid, people are not promoted everywhere, everything is fine, so this is a very big thing and if you want to give rice to your family.  Because someone will have to take a break and change, my father is also a government employee, I am also a government employee, my son, my daughter also take pride, there is nothing worth taking pride in, it means you are a fool that your family ever got involved in it.  No, please do that government job for someone else's Tabla person, the entire family of the friend will be benefited. People take pride in us, all the families, all the groups, all are good. How many people, what about 10 families, what rubbish are you doing?  I have been working hard, listen friend, you have jumped, you have donated well, you have become Group A, even people from B become A in 10, 20, 30 years. Okay, so friend, you could have done something else for your child.  And you could have done it, your exposure was very good, you too will come and go through the same job, he will go through this struggle, he will be happy, no, you will also be very happy with him, like an example, I know so many people whose father was like this, but his son.  She is a daughter, whether she goes to Railways through UPSC, whether she goes to Revenue Service or she goes to a service below that, she is a failure tiger all her life, she is our children's psychology. I am telling our parents our What do you think about success and life? Definitions are the value of success. What does the world say? Meaning of this song 80 tu 90% veg jab ko aap bole na I am proud of you, that is the coolness and what is there in this affair.  The money which is of no use to you, what are the parents who have gone into government service, their operating system itself becomes different, like Android and iPhone are different, okay, and like Windows.  There is one operating system, any other operating system, you name it, if it is different then it is different, its rule is to do well in the job, pass the exam, work hard, oh ultimate naughty, you have to earn, then if the child has done good work then it is not like this.  I am making a lot of income strings, I have made many onrpo types, I am working through social media, I don't know what else I am working on, I am happy with life at least a little, no, they will not consider this as success, success is like us.  Those who are made of Gheesa, I am not saying that the parents who are like this brother are some intelligent government servants, also very intelligent, they know, nothing has been kept here, those who are honest, put your hand on your heart and say, Government servant, I am speaking.  I am speaking right, I am speaking wrong, but you have to be a government servant, don't write this wrongly that I am preparing for UPSC, so the person preparing has no idea.  Those who will have a job for 10 years, please comment because first of all there is a honeymoon period of two to five years. Your government job will never bring any benefit to your family and if you do anything else then nothing else will happen.  So, you can benefit from your government job. If you are working in corporate then you can fit your jugaad. You can do this. Many people will say no, no, miss him in this position. By doing it like this, yes, I know that, but what about the story?  Is it the right thing, can they do it, is it sustainable and is it a good thing, just like a chair is a job, a child's job is also a job, let me also tell you that it is not cheap because your shop is going to be expensive in 60 years. No one will ask, no one will ask, that car, that bungalow, all that, whatever more, all that is penis from the chair, like yes, only then they want to catch, even after retirement, one mother, commission, this commission, all these officers do this program, you will know, okay, but when.  till People do taxes for 2 years, 3 years and then after that and here also no one asks, they have got two-three staff, they also do not do Namaste, okay, this is also a big truth, government job, you are like, why am I making faces like this, Ramdev.  Yes, they used to make it in such a way that instead of telling it, I am definitely trying to tell it by doing it, you don't have to take it, if you come from a financially good family, then the sarees are fine, no one has a bad family, but  financially  They come from well-to-do families, they come from poor families, they should definitely do it, and in the future, there will be jobs for poor families and most of the people you will see are from poor families, then their source of enjoyment will be different, they will look very happy, I will feel to you, friend, all this. Why am I not? Hey, you are happy, that's why your platform is different from the beginning, their platform was this, now they are sitting on this platform, okay then they will be happy and you were on this platform because father had reached here in 30 years. So go to the basic level, your salary should be around 2.25 lakhs, the caste is on the basic level itself, the name is announced, every one is different, so you father, you start here, how can you be happy, you will never be happy, because till the time you go here, you will be happy.  Till then father will not be there to tell you that this one is the one who will never get coolness, his father was a rickshaw puller, his mother was a maid, his father listens to the wages.  Isn't the boy gone, the girl gone, that's so much, she became the daughter of a railway hawker, SDM breaking news, okay, everyone is taking this anyway because there is reservation, plus there is reservation for economy backward within gold too, so 60%.  So the same issue is going on, I am for that, I am for 40 people, leave them, you leave that too for them and in the future I will also tell you about what is actually happening inside the politics, these people are thinking that like  It will be a great achievement, but even after 5 years they are angry that brother, stupidity is being cut, there is no power here, this was our raw video, my next video, if you want a late video, you have heard in childhood that it is raw, hide it, hide it.  The game itself or any game is a game in which older children are playing and a younger child goes, now that younger child cannot play the game then the elders talk among themselves, he is raw i.e. if you pass the ice, he will not be out.  And  He will keep thinking that I am just playing a game. Let me tell you another example. Have you ever seen video games? Earlier, vehicles used to run and there were no video games. There used to be a lot of them in the story shops, even today there are gaming zones, there are motorcycles.  It happens like this or there is a tax, then he is riding in it and how do parents fool a 5-6 year old child, they make him sit on such a motorcycle, they do not put game coins of ₹ 50 ₹ 100 inside. Okay and he feels that he is the one driving it. Okay, he is very happy. You can't make a 15 year old wet. The child knows that he will put the coin and I will have control and when I do like this, the motorcycle will be like this.  Date Man's I'm playing is not mine, this is the example that I bring, this is my yes, if you enjoy it, then write this, this is happening with many people, no one came and told you that even the poorest of the poor are becoming  Are  Officer, that too in 5 to 7 years, what are you doing with them, you will make everyone get a discounted government job, yes yes, there is nothing here, no power, no respect, no further money and that is the same 3% increment that you are giving.  Even if you become three donkeys, even if you make three lame, still three, and lame horses, still three, and you mean a super hero, even then three are nothing. Now, in the pursuit of my small things, I have to  I get a good computer, I get a good car, my Bengali gets fixed, I get this post, I get this set up here, I will explain to you how the system itself is fooling your cat because the jobs are not sexy ones.  So bow down to the youth for 15 years, the government is also big, we have a government job, there is a lot of respect, all the coaching people tell us that unless you tell us that there is respect, then who will go, then you prepare yourself, you guys.  Give up 15 years of your life. If you take this job, the one who has come again will get his release. I did not spend 10 years. I have spent my whole life, so I will tell you this further. If you people digest what I just told you, then this is the thing.  And then you guys will enjoy what to do next, do anything else, do n't do this because it will not be of any benefit to you and in the coming time, government jobs will be available, look at Dr. Apna, what do you do when it is government, it is okay.  this 3 years  This is going to happen in America in 4 years. Check where the government jobs have come. Check in France. Check in other countries. This is not going to happen in India. Yes, right now it seems that it is not going to happen but it will happen in this year.  It is going to happen because when there is a rocket in the economy, then the rickshaw driver and the ready driver will also earn a lot of money and the story of a government servant is that the commission on the eighth is fixed. Do you people want to come or not? Government people, tell me yes or  I will never come  It is 2023, so the last time the band came 18 months ago, if we discuss it, it comes 18 months ago, that means it should come in 24, there is some such happiness, also someone said that it will come after together.  Not only this, the accord formula will be used one by one and they have given it, perhaps the spelling is correct, check which accord formula has been used, what is to happen to you, if you are not telling me, then by your grace, those who come from a rich family, are immense.  From the middle class come well-to-do families. Where from the money-wise well-to-do families come, please pass on the government jobs and leave the rest for those brothers and sisters who are at the bottom of the country. Leave everything for them too. By the way, you will come to know in 5-10 years that those fears are nothing, they are just like that, monitor, send the data here, give it, this is a scheme of the government, put this data and the third party will implement it by some consultant.  Third party, you don't have to do anything, you sit on the bus, still it is good for them, they want that recognition in the society, however, after 4 years, the society is not going to recognize them, I am also telling them this because when you enter the government, it is not permanent.  Off when it is there, that which is attracting you is your biggest negative, don't leave it small because it is like you are a tiger, when a tiger's life looks very good, the mother of the tiger's landing sometimes does it to him.  If you keep writing but it will go down, then you will get stuck, in the beginning, have a lot of excitement, okay, then government job is also something like date, you should be fully aware before you prepare, one you should be aware before you join, one in which you identify.  This with WhatsApp I have you please write in the comment area who has not yet subscribed the channel and do one more thing in the comment area above.  I will subscribe where I address these things through different types of workshops and webinars. It is not that I am not going to give you this job, this is not going to happen, then how do you want money, so that is also history.  If I give it, it will happen once or twice a month, depending on your linking, it will be 5 to 6. According to your linking, in five to six months, according to this group, one or two workshops will be held in your account, so you can attend it.  He will get the knowledge any time, on two-four-five days' notice, if you join his info group, you will get a chance to join him soon. Thank you very much."

    "title": "Most Popular Question Of Youth Answered ｜ Most Authentic Answer On Youtube [No6PL9OAcDQ].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, the most popular question of youth, especially people who are like in 20 early 20 Guruji, what should we do, what should we do or for anyone, what should I work, what should I do, so today I will try my best to answer those people who have logic. If it suits you, if you enjoy it, then write your age. If you are a little elder, then share it with your children. If you are in your 30s, then share it with your younger brothers and sisters. If they fall in this, then share it with them.  It is okay to take it and even if you are doing a job and this question is what should I do, what should I do, especially women, anyone has this question because this question is very common, what should I do, what should I do, this kind of what should I do or  Someone will say more, I have not done hotel management, what should I do, someone will say, I have done MBA, someone will say, I have done this, someone will say, I am doing this and I want to do this.  I want to do this, what should I do? Today I try to explain the answer because I am asked a lot, why would anyone ever tell you, sincerely, what should you tell me, no, you are knowledgeable people, you are consultants, you are counselors.  Well, these days a lot of people are saying, go to university, go here in foreign country, take this path, we will tell you and take your aptitude test. All these tricks are going on very, very tricksy, parents are also doing a lot of tricks, because what are the parents, poor people, they are very clueless, they think that if we don't know, then we take them to some place, they will tell us what our child will do, okay and then  They are paying a lot of money for Delhi Gurgaon, they are earning a lot. Okay, I never feel like stomping on their earnings when I come here. I never wear the mask of a social reformer. My M.  It is not necessary to have a higher moral standing. I do n't like scams. People are also doing good work but what I want to tell people is that every person has great interest and relight. Every person will set his own course, his university will set his own limits and that is not necessary.  Is it right for you, so many private universities, so many are opened, 8 lakhs, 9 lakhs, 10 lakhs, 12, I am telling you that this is small, less, less, other wise, 20  30-40 lakh rupees have been spent on water, there is no guarantee that you will do anything, the youth is wasting their time, attendance has been made compulsory on 75-70 days, you know, nothing is going to be achieved, but since there is nothing else to do.  So have n't I even graduated? Brother, what are you saying? You should not even do graduation. How will marriage happen? Yes, I also know, then I will have to do that poor graduation because the system has become such that  Brother, that will have to be done and going to and from college is wasting time. No skill is being set. Look brother, if you become an IIT IM then it will seem like you have got a job, but these IET IMs, brothers and sisters, are not even getting 99.5%, so I don't know if they are somewhere else. And even among these IITs, the top five IMs, both the original ones and ABC Kolkata and all these IITs, apart from the top ones, there is no idea about the ones below them, so many have opened these days.  So it's okay, many places have opened like 'I am' and other such places, more are opening now, so there is no brand value in saying ' yes, she has come', there is a difference in those things between the two, it is better than them.  If there are any other colleges, then I want to tell through this video. Again, people are confused, tell me quickly, what is the answer, ma'am, I am bored, this youth has less patience, tell me quickly, nobody is going to.  Tell you child nobody is going to tell you because anybody tells you ok again then you say you take names of YouTube you humiliate because people are doing that Akshay Srivastava Varaku I did this I did this do it like this do it like that  Lo see it dozen work because now in 2024 who did what in 2001 what in 2005 what in seven what in 10 He has got no meaning because he has reached here after 2022 years of experience. Now this guy here can do anything. Once he gets 10,15,20,30 lakh subscribers, he can do anything. Then you have made your own band platform. Sell ​​Kaju Katli on that platform, sell anything on that platform, sell any course, sell knowledge, sell stock market, do affiliate marketing, sell the app, sell yourself.  Sell ​​anything, sell anything, now sitting here they are sharing this knowledge and here you all are listening. The fact is that you are rich here is the issue and you are not rich here. They are coming here and saying that we did this, we did this.  If they did this then they reached there but that is not the ecosystem, that is not the time like now I know people don't like all this clarity for youth because they remain scientific but one thing in astrology we told and explained like this.  It is said that there is time and space, this is science in life, time and space are science, then there is something called time and there is something called space, then there is some event inside it, if there is something, then if time gets separated.  It is not 2007, it is not 2005, because the opportunity through technology which was available to few people in 2007, is available to everyone in 2024, since it is available to everyone, it is there.  All those things can be done There is no mutual advantage Suppose your father earns ₹ lakh a month and some month And you are the child of 80000 person, you are the child of 4 lakh person, so the child of 4 lakh person has no advantage in the market That's it  Can also do it and the one who has a high money degree, maybe the one with Rs 4 lakh can go to the one who spends more, that college is not worth it, his degree is  Not worth the paper is printed on it, now no one will tell, otherwise what is this 4 lakh person, he goes in it, this one can't go, so he starts doing something, in 4 years when he comes out, it is this air.  And he has the experience and experience in the work space, like us who are sitting in recruitment and all these leopards, we see that who can solve our problem, who can do the real work, what kind of knowledge is this?  What have you brought from the place? Gut no meaning because that is not applicable what we are going to do. We have to suck blood. 40 50 60 80 9 We have to get all the work done by paying Hajj. We have to make it work from morning to evening. We have to treat you like this.  So, the candidate we find good gets selected, now you are saying that I should take a degree, I have the knowledge, right?  So, we cannot say to us that you are a laborer, just do this, do that, never tell the youth the bigger picture, there is no entrepreneur in any enterprise, this is the work to be done, logistics supply, this is the business model, this is the margins, this is the funding here.  Marketing will come from this, the funnel is like this, if you understand these seven or eight things yourself, then you are an ass who will do any work for it, you will figure out and start your own thing.  Will do it and people are doing it at some stage, that's why I tell the youth, do a job and figure it all out, the sooner you do it, you will adopt it. I see the future of jobs in India that the companies with thousand people will be less than the ones with 100.  There will be less systems of two-three people, there will be a lot of lonely people, what do you do? You do some of your own work, you work from morning to evening, but you don't complete your life. You don't complete your life, you work from morning to evening. But I don't spend my whole life, I do n't know what all I do, and if you want to listen to what I do, it will take you a quarter of an hour to listen. You have someone who will become a youth and who will call the shots whom you will follow in your footsteps.  Can't put it, you are a doctor, you are an engineer, you are in sales, you are in finance, you do everything and everything, everything means everything, and to me, to some youth, when this seems like this, then a little abstract video will definitely seem tangy.  It won't take any force, isn't it, it's something like you are giving the knowledge of the stock market and quickly tell me which stock to buy, I will buy D-mat, can someone please tell me the sexy stock of Dewan House Finance Limited, which one can get the car, okay?  To reach somewhere in a long life, you will have to give time, brother, you will have to give a little patience, things will be a little abstract. Try to understand what I am trying to say. If you are not able to understand please type.  And if you are able to understand in which direction I am taking you, the saying goes, it is strange, it is 'thyme swark dyakti hai', people in Haryana say, I have heard it a lot, ' thym hi mare swark dikhta hai' meaning, for if you have to see.  Heaven You Have To Die Somewhere It's Not Don't Take Literal Dying Okay Please Youth Sometimes It's Okay It's Like You Have To Slog If You Have To Do Something you have to figure out, nobody else is going to do. Who knows how much talent you have? I can tell you 50 works. I had also made two-three videos, one for ET, I made that one, the other one, I made Makhanawala, all that.  How to do it, do n't you figure out the idea yourself, I told you the idea, not that, I always have the dialogue, deposit the check in the bank account, don't give up so much knowledge, what to take, tell me the account number, I can do the work.  I will tell you everything, I will give you everything, supply logistics chain, marketing fun, everything is me, no one else is going to tell, brother, no one is going to tell, no one is ever going to tell, you say this, then how do you help, how is help, listen, you are trying to do something.  You have rich a place there people like me can come and help you why because we are multiplier effects force multipliers hai hum ye soch lo jaaye bole hai hai or we are voltage ke  There are amplifiers, the current is coming, we made it 210 on G 140, but the current itself is zero, so we cannot make it 210, you understand, there has to be a bare minimum of talent, then only we can take it forward, you do not know bowling. So a bowling coach cannot teach bowling. Whoever is a bowling coach, whether he is a bowling coach or an athletic coach or any coach of any level, he should not teach bowling.  Gives training to the one who knows how to play that sport and reaches some level, now if 100 is international level and in Olympics you are reaching the finals, if it is 100 is that level then it is at 40 50 then that coaching comes because coaching.  Only 50 can take it from 60 to 80, after 80 again it is his luck and hard work, but if a person comes 10 20  If a person is 30, coaching can only take him till 50, there is no market for 50, it's like entertainment, then he is not a coach, then he is just like a gym trainer, he is like, yes brother, lift the weight like that, yes, do it like this.  Well, do it, no, do some exercise, it is different, then there is nothing, so people can only help you if you have something, now what are the children today, what is that, tell us what to do.  We are sitting at zero in everything, some things, do them to a level of 203 and do multiple things, reach a level of 40 50 in some of them, interest in some of them, you are able to reach to a particular level and then  You realize that I have to take the next step, I need a help, that's why I will give you my youtube1, subscribe again and then ask. Friend, how does this algorithm work, how to make thumbnails or how to upload videos, first do something, you have not created a video channel, you have not created the content, you do not know the videos, you do not know how, you go straight to hire a video editor first and he says, Before you had money, you learned everything, meaning how much money to earn, what to do, everything to do further, but if you don't go till 40, then only those who reach one level are helped by youtube0 subscribers or there is some event for that.  After youtube2, how many 10 crore people are sitting in the world with open channels, so should youtube1 give that yes, we will teach everyone, let's see who is consistent, who has reached how many subscribers, who has how many views, is this guy looking good or  This girl or boy, it looks fine, we have crossed this threshold, now we will help it to fine tune and go ahead, then the same thing is applicable to  Youth you have to do I see most of you doing exam preparation ok I should not be using this because a little bit many times Wola use words like this na it is some times meaning so little bit aam sorry exam only should be said ok  The preparation for the exam is fine. The public is preparing for the exam. If you are from 21 to 30, then what will help you? Only one person is helping you. How to pass this exam?  No matter how good a trainer comes, the odds will remain the same and even if you get 99.5, you will not be able to pass and in 99.5, your ability means the probability is very high. What do people do sometimes? Yes, I got number four in my prelims, he got number four in that.  Do n't put yourself in percentage. If you are not in the top 10 consistently in any competitive exam, then you have no realistic chance because that's how low it is.  The same coach can give coaching. In the same coaching academy, someone passes out. If someone does not pass, then the one who passed is already there. He was sitting with the thrush hold crossed, he got that much knowledge and he passed out. You have reached here by sitting here, that's all now. You can't go above this. I do n't know why people are not realizing this thing. This is something really practical in youth, which is look at yourself where you stand.  Consistently, you will come to know in three papers, if you are not clearing Prelims even in three times, then leave it friend, what is your stubbornness, I am talking about a popular exam of UPSC, rest you can also do your small exams like this.  If you can, then never ask someone what to do, start doing it yourself, when you reach somewhere, now ask someone that I have reached here, you are an expert in this, now take me forward, this is the approach.  Don't ask what to do in the beginning. And parents, you know your children best. Don't hold them and move them here and there. Everyone will say that whoever is sitting next to you will go to the sweet seller. Coaxing a lot is a very good thing.  What a place to cut hair, this is a very good salon, it is doing well, India is a good tourist destination, it is a blue ocean opportunity, it is a sunrise sector and you will reach places if you do this.  Everyone has to say, you, every person who has opened a shop, has to say this, why would he say this, I will tell you, you learn the technology of jewelery design, learn jewelery designing, this guy go here, he will tell the story of fashion anywhere, he will come and get a job.  It is 0000, 00, 50 and is not even available and many a times it happens that how will I survive in 50 in a big city? So first of all we ask, is there any superficial money?  You are going on things which are one technique of human being, let me tell you one more thing and I will finish with the practical one because the most important thing is told at the end of the video that you can become whatever you want to become, please do what those people have become because there is something new.  No one is doing it, okay, whatever has been done, including AI, people have gone ahead in AI also, whatever you want to do in your life, chat, accountancy, lawyer, doctor, whatever you are doing, go beyond that.  Meet people, meet 10 different people and make notes and don't meet those who have started, their excitement level will be higher because of being an idiot than the one who has been doing this work for 1015 years. Ask him genuinely. Ask him what his future holds because he has gone ahead on the path. He can see more of it. It is a hill, isn't it? The one who is sitting here will see less than the one who is sitting here.  If you want to see here, the higher you go, the further you can see. If you are okay then ask those who have gone ahead in it, brother, I am coming now, how is the future, as if I am saying this, those who are trying to get a government job in 2024.  They have been absolutely useless, the people of 2000 had fun, the people of 1992 have spent more time and those who were there in 1960-70 and are sitting retired, from 2025 they have  You looted the whole atmosphere but you cannot take a decision in 2024 on the basis of their testimonials because if you add 36 years from now, you have a job for 60 years, then the child born in 2000 will work till 2060, so does it seem now from 2024 to 2060? If this work is worth doing then those who are sitting now and cannot leave it for 15-20 years in 2024 and those who are  If you have to do it for 15-20 years, please ask them, brother, is it worth it or not worth it or what is the scene, then it will be explained to you, please connect with two people, then only you will get the opinion, if you meet someone while walking.  If you keep taking opinions from shoppers, you will get very superficial shopper knowledge, but you will not get practical. Always what ever you want to do. Meet 10 people above.  10 years of experience in that ideally 15 and more other wise 10 is the bare minimum don't ask 3 years ago Now this is what they become, in the first two-three years they keep making their own reels Tata Teena Tata Teena scold here  They have been scolding there, they are scolding them, they are scolding them, till date no one has asked them that brother, you came to make this reel. Here again ask those who are 15 years old, 20 years old, 15 20 years old, you will not even be able to see them, you will not even know where they are because they are actually you know in to work and above all these things and they are pragmatic that yes friend.  It was fun, you will get good knowledge from him and he will tell you on the basis of next 20 years, which he will not tell on the basis of yesterday and will tell in private. End  I am talking about only one thing, It's not about this only, It's about everything, you want to go anywhere, anywhere you want to go in Railways, ask in which small places are the postings, how do children study, what is the struggle of wife.  Are there job opportunities? How much leave do you get? How is the work culture? Ask all these things. Are you enjoying it or not? Brother, how are you feeling, uncle and uncle?  Uncle, everyone is somewhere in everyone's relationship, ask genuinely and then take references from 10-12 people and ask them, friend, 15 people can never be of any color, you will see the pattern, the real pattern will be visible if you go somewhere publicly or someone organizes it.  Or the coaching academy has organized it, the school or college has organized it, they are giving wrong knowledge to you people because everyone has to be trapped somewhere or the other. That if you go today, the one who motivates, the one who motivates knows that I have come to motivate, then I demotivate, it is very good and or it is very challenging and we get to change the world and the world and leave we need to get to make the  Impact and take it as if you were sitting in your car and had brought the file and told you to do it. Why don't you get it done, nothing is in anyone's hands, it's the only thing.  Politicians and businessmen are changing the country and the world, there is no third this thing, remember that everyone else is a servant, so if someone wants to change the world, then I will become a businessman, entrepreneur, there will be an info webinar group for you in the comment section. Under that, I do some workshop or something like this on jobs or something. Recently I am going to do it on 25th Feb. If you are listening after that then no problem, you can watch the recording from it.  If you are listening first then you can do yours. Please be realistic about your jobs and your career. Do n't keep asking endlessly what to do. No one can tell you what to do and who has done it and reached where he has.  Neither does he know, I also don't know, I am going to have 2 lakh subscribers on this channel, I am going to have 4 lakh subscribers on my second channel, there are many more, how can it happen, I too don't know, I do n't know very much, I can't.  Tell you the process and the results because ultimately it's like no one is teaching acting. If he is such a good actor who is teaching you acting then why is he not a superstar.  There must be some difference, that means there are many people who teach acting, now this guy who has become the brother of Bobby Dil in the movie This Guy Animal, what is his star's name Saurabh Saurabh  Saurabh is the name second name I am speaking he teaches acting to the people he is a very fine actor but he is such a fine actor we liked it very much in small role but still we have not seen much of his work tell me why that happened  He is a fine actor, he is a judge, there are a lot of actors who have become superstars and have become big hit movies. I have seen him in this. I have seen him in this.  Animal and Kisi Aur Main I Don't Know It's Okay He Has Intense Eyes Good Acting Very Small Role Good Impact No Doubt But Then He He Himself Not Ray Places What is the answer to this, can you tell me, sometimes it happens like this, it's late  There are so many things to be successful in life that people can't tell you can't tell ok so you have to every person has to figure it out  At Some Places People Will Help You People Will Help You Give The People Helping You Like Me Like That Surfer Who Teaches Acting Give Them Themselves They Can't Reach These Places But They Fill In The Gaps In You So You Can Become a Greater Person But then you should have your own story on journey, beyond that you are getting a little push which is sitting at zero, sitting at zero current, brother, some of that  No, I don't know how to act, I don't feel like it from inside, you go to someone, he can't make you do anything, it's okay, so that's the message, I hope you a"

    "title": "Mutual Funds Sahi Hain？ ｜ Why You Need To Move Beyond Them ？ [_b4RmIWliZc].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, I would like to tell you some things on mutual funds because mutual friend is right, it is right, it is quite right, it is going on, it is also right, I will not tell him that it is not right but I will tell some more aspects of mutual funds, many people are crazy about mutual funds.  Youngsters are told a lot of compounding stories and this is how you give itna dal do 10000 give itna dal do for so many days in 20 years.  By doing so much crores in 30 years, you are told that it will become 3 crores, it will be something like 7 to 8% inflation, if 6:30 continues then it is equal to today's 40 lakhs, that is not so great, firstly, secondly.  The thing that I want to tell you is that there are expense ratios in mutual funds. Their fund managers are given very high salaries. Please Google and see that their salary can be up to Rs. 45 crores.  It is being taken from the same money, remember that every year, if you don't earn this income, you will be charged one and a half to two and a half percent, which can be called expense in different ways, what does it mean if you go inside a fund house, then you will not know that there are hundreds of mutual funds and  If there are fifty such then it means that a scheme of 4 5000 mutual funds is going on. I am telling about equity, there are as many mutual friends as there are shares and every  If there are 60, 70, 80, 90 shares in a mutual fund, then you should understand that this raytana means that they have twisted it like this and what do people do in this? Many people among you, I will give some advice in this, many buy schemes of mutual funds when they become elderly.  Let's go, nomination is not okay for anyone, nothing else is okay, someone in digital format, someone in demat, someone in paper form and that old man has gone or anyone can go at any time, his life is so big. Give more 324 games. If you take a little small cap, it covers the market. If you are taking more than that, then you are buying lottery tickets. Sometimes buying in index funds also gives this good thought. What happens in mutual funds this date? Two men read and say that it is okay to type Ram and Shyam as an example and it is a lot of fun that you take your 10000 team and you are set, it is okay and also  You will get 12-13% return from mutual fund. What Nifty has given is fine, which is the expected return and period and time, if you are growing your money even at 6, 7, 8%, then the SIP of Rs. 10,000 that you started every year.  You are increasing by 10%, first it was 10, then 11, then ₹ 1200. If you keep increasing like this, you will have. Give much more money Forgetting about it De focus what I want you tell people understand Youngster In the beginning even if you do not sip this thousand rupees ₹ 2000 and nothing else happens then there will not be much change for you because you should follow this advice carefully.  You have to understand, this is a very, very deep advice, okay, in the beginning you set skills within yourself, you add value within yourself, the salary increases quickly from 30. 50 becomes 50 to 70-80, it becomes 1.5 lakh, after that a number of technicians come to him, till then your acquired wealth is also increasing a little, then it mixes a lot of difference, his CR becomes two to three.  Now those three C's are gone till 12, one is ours, there is 8% less, there is a lot of difference from the mix, our 12 are ours, that agreement is there, so much focus has been put in it, people have given the team to the youngsters.  That he is not skilling himself, brother, he takes Rs 30,000 and sips Rs 1,000. There are 10 cases of punch. No one is getting anywhere. This excel king has become very famous on YouTube, he will open such a laptop at the same time and show you excel with the money.  Will give and you will like it very much and it will seem that you have spent so many crores. If you do not buy coffee at Starbucks which costs ₹ 400 and if you drink Man Lo Char coffee then you put it here for ₹ 1600.  So in 30 years it will be like this, hey, people are fooling you, try to create so much wealth in your life, try to create value that you will not need this Starbucks coffee example, even if you drink 10 coffees, always remember.  The statement is not yours, not mine, no deal is being made, you are sitting there, there is networking there, brother, that coffee is worth Rs 300-400, does anyone digest some food worth Rs.  There is a bill of rupees, you also get to sit there for 1 hour, then you come comfortably, sit, talk peacefully, order one thing and then do another, that is one and a half hour's time, no one is promoting it in such a nice place, example, it is mandatory.  Also, I am taking an example and telling you, mine is not like Starbucks. Okay, so I am taking an example and telling you, there can be some other changes as well, which depending on the date, I  I am telling you an example, don't focus here because all the financial insulin like I am also this channel is one of the things of clarity. I give clarity and things financial are also the van of dam. Okay, so I said to give this in our life.  Brain is juice. Brain juice is called brain juice. Focus, don't let them focus on these small things. Youngster, your focus should be like this, you learn if you can learn.  You invest in stocks it is very good thing I am no where suggesting don't do SIP I am not and don't invest in mutual fund its a starter initially you need that support system for cycling ok then after that they remove  It is fine but it is necessary to remove it, it is right, it is right, no one asks that every time two percent is deducted from your account and that is to focus on increasing the SIP and only then the SIP will increase.  When your income will increase, then my focus should be on increasing your income because income will be there for the first 10 to 15 years and there is one more thing, you have to understand one more thing, today I will tell you a deep thing, understand people, there are only three benefits of money.  Things are meant to be consumed and donated for that then your goal will be you will consume. After so many years, many times the body is no longer there. I am telling with my wisdom, now I don't have any bungee jumping.  I will go to the garden, there will be a shock and a scandal will happen, that bungee jumping, you will get that experience at 24, 25, 28, 30, 22. It has to take time, it takes all the time, if you play the game of sip, sip and savings, then you will get that experience.  It's time, then that's the time, the job poor can't go, also and dear balance, it is also said that those who are financial influencers have different responsibilities, they say that brother no.  So I don't do like this, do like this but man, these games cannot be played completely, this is not a game that is telling people that brother, increase your ability to earn money because this is a difficult thing and not an easy thing, the action is opened and the computer shows the share screen.  Kari watch youtube video see I put it person and gave it because 12% and then become 14% and this will happen date will happen are nobody can predict returns if inflation  Of Percentage When Inflation Is Four And You Are Getting 8 It Is + 4% Return When Inflation Itself Is 9% 12% Return Which Is More Than 8% It Is 3% I Hope You Understand And Reverse Its Maths What Can You Do  You can see the loan when inflation is high and loan is low, you should take loan, this and micro economics will be discussed in more detail.  samjhaunga Today I had to learn this thing that you cannot be free from this syllabus just by doing this mutual fund, have you outsourced it, this is not your 11th 12th project which you have outsourced and someone has made it and your project will be work.  And take your numbers, life does not work like this and it is being run like this, this is how it is being told that brother, you cannot invest in mutual funds yourself, you cannot know yourself, we will do it. [Music] If the market goes up by 2%, if it is 2:15, then you understand the biggest compulsion of the refund person. When the market is down and he should invest money and buy more stocks, then the retail money is going out, so he has to  One should buy stocks, instead of buying them one has to sell them so that one can give them money. When redemption comes and when the market is now heated and returns are seen increasing, then when the grid of retail comes, that SIP increases further.  Used to be  Or other people are giving and this person needs you just sit on cash, he does not do 50% cash at the time because of the mandatory 4-5% cash, the proposal is to buy the thing and the rest is to scan it, how to catch something in it.  You know that your mutual fund people are buying stocks. I have already told you that because you will buy stocks, you will be hanging in these set training. Googling is the raisin and manager of the fund. Even if these are low, he says, we have to buy this share, if we buy mutual fund, then the share will increase, this is the first knowledge, okay, so all these are also going low, so what I am saying is, do it, but don't think like that, that's it.  I did it, TKT, something like if you want to be healthy, it is just that you did Chavanprash, started eating one thing, now I just eat this, any one particular item.  So I will stay healthy. It is you have to do these things, you have to do exercise, you don't have to take stress, you have to relax, you have to sleep well, you have to drink water, you have to do these things, you have to be healthy from financial  Health mutual fund is not going to work less than the right one. I am telling you in the coming time that brother, if you just outsource it like it is taught then neither do you yourself.  You have to study, you have to take tuitions, you have to prepare for the competition, you have to learn digital, you have to prepare for the competition, you have to do things for the school too, you have to do things for the school teacher, you have to do many things, you can't just hope that this is done.  It will just cross me, the date is not going to happen like this, it is the biggest missile, so anywhere I have again made the disclaimer, please comfortably sunrise and tell me, nowhere I have said that if you do mutual fund then this mutual fund.  Stop doing mutual funds, it is a very bad thing, no, it is better than doing nothing, it is better to do HD, but will we be able to survive only by this? No, we have to move ahead with this. You did mutual funds for the first one year, see the performance. Slowly and gradually you start understanding things on this channel. If you watch the videos on the stock market, these are my 11 12 basic videos on man and this mental model on decision making. You must watch them then you will understand everything when you see them.  If you do then you will be able to relate these things thank you"

    "title": "Naukri Vs Start Up ｜ A Fresh Perspective Given [FPBQDprElFw].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, the topic is very simple, the heading is very simple but the video is going to be very late and I have to tell you did you understand, did you enjoy it or not, what exactly was there to say, job versus start job, do a job, do a startup, I will separate this-  I will explain it in a different way, one thing is that whether you are 22-24 years old, whether you are 34-35 years old or 44-45 years old, after that it is time to become a shop-band in today's time. I am fine, then you have to do that. Okay, then I will address these people. You are a 23, 24, 25 year old kid. You are a big star. You want to do a startup. First, you have to finance the entire expenses from your parents, then take a degree, now do a startup, then you will ask for money.  And someone whose father is not ready to give money, why would she invest any money in a startup? When we have a meeting, something like this happens and we are sitting, my first question is simple, who is the son or daughter?  is also  Friend father, this is putting money on father, this note putting is the same sold way, trust is there or not, ideas roam around according to the forts in Chavadi Bazaar to get gas oil, idea has no value, what is the idea of ​​startup, sir, game execution, give it to father.  Do you know that you do n't change the bed and seat? There is no shortage of people in the house, no one goes on time, what kind of person you are, you invest money only after thinking, then let's discuss about startup, why should it be six to start a startup?  Because your story is that you did not get the job, you are not worthy of the job but you want to become a star because you have done chemical engineering from IIT and have taught yourself the formula and that thing is done very well in India, there is power because of the people of China and you know everything.  And but you know that I have set up this factory from here, my plant will come from Germany, my girlfriend will set it up, her friends will also set it up and people like us will also set up it, everyone will set up it, it is okay with the money, they do not have any problem, the problem is a normal man.  There is no need to rush to start a startup in the early 20's and it is definitely better to do something in a supervised and internally regulated environment only when the first question was asked and something was done because when you told me that I was on a debt company. 4  Years, what did you do less for me, how much are your skills, how good, I will not know, I will know one thing and do something less, this is missing in the new generation, a basic thing which the world used to do in India and even now.  Another group is doing it and it considers nothing great. Yes, I pick it up, I go, I go, sir, this Jain doesn't do it, I don't know, she sleeps at 2:00 am, 3:00 am, I don't know what she does, what intoxication she does.  And where do they all do less, there is no discipline in their living, neither is their moral moral, moral is correct, neither is their stomach correct, nor is their soul correct, there is a problem here at this level itself and that You can do anything to yourself in the name of startup color, we will reduce you like this, this is also a system, the physical is getting exhausted, so first of all you should establish yourself by doing a job and do not get into this thing.  Ghusso's job is bad, startup is bad because ultimate money is what is important, you establish a company after that and then come back and start something else dream11 and after doing all this and style is such a relief, now I have to say if I stand  I am fine and there is a car parked behind me worth three-three- four-four five-five crores or I show my house worth Rs. 10-20-40 crores, then if I come and talk nonsense then people will think that yes man, he has layered it.  Hey my brother, it is not his, brother, he must have done something, so you should also do it, all kinds of people do acquisitions on him, everything is his, now ultimately he has become, he has become, now he too has become.  If everyone comes to YouTube then everyone comes to YouTube because the ultimate thought is to show or do this business, there is always a sixth class on profit, seventh class basic cost price, selling price discount, profit loss, this is what profit is, nothing else but valuation.  Made it 30 times the revenue of Rs 10000 crore and took funding from Gurgaon on valuation.  Man, now we also invest money in funding, we know that it gets multiplied by 10-20 times, if 10 places are sunk, so much money is invested in one place that you then get money to play 10 more such games, then this money is used in playing startups.  This is a startup, it will run, this system will run for 5 years, but this is the story, the company is not producing anything sustainable. Of all the companies that have come in the last 5 years, take the name of one which is in profit and which is showing growth.  The money of all the investors has been wasted and who has billed out the ultimate investors? The biggest fool in China is the retail investor. Since all these systems of theirs are destroyed, only then the startup people go on the IPL route and even then their  Some say that earlier I used to attract so many people, now I will become so many, I am feeding so many people, Indian customer consumer is very questionable, cheap food is being delivered at home, the food is available as soon as  You increase money in it, then he will start cooking in his house or start going there, then he will not eat at home and then your model is crushed again, then you will bring him down to recover, then he will come again. He will run away again. Okay, change some schemes here, so people sometimes live with Airtel, sometimes live with Airtel, sometimes from here to there, from there to here, such dogs, which plane to get, then it is not easy to do business in Indian India. Date is what I.  M Tring, what else are you telling us, you are making us negative, such a big country, the country is very good, but we are only so many, will it be anything else, brother, is this Swami doing this kind of thought process outside?  I don't do it. Someone outside said, this is less, this is the rate, this is the product, this is the price. In India only, the system of MRP maximum retail price is not there in America. In America, in the rest of the country, how much is the shopkeeper looking at the thing, how much is it in other places. between  This is the story and how many has it been there in India, inside any cinema hall in India or if people started selling it by charging higher rates, then they used to send more money instead of going to match, it is only ok and if they say MRP then MRP bottles are printed.  Drink ₹ 60, now there is some marking on ₹ 60, now after taking the tax, it is very difficult in Indian. Understanding the consumer, understanding the customer, satisfying him is very, very difficult. It is not easy in India and the person who is doing this startup.  After that, ask the person who is doing this business, he is in a job, the employee is not happy because he is doing the job as he likes, there is nothing wrong with his job purse, did he reduce his monthly assured salary? Not in bed, you leave your life, only think that you get sad due to the humiliation you face there, it just does something, brother, I am telling all the working people, if you reduce 40 hours in a week and  If you reduce 160 to 180 hours in a month, then you will have to reduce more than 300 hours. Saturday, Sunday will have to be reduced. In the beginning, the person who is a startup and has less business, he has to reduce the most on Saturday. Because the rest of the people are free on Saturday or Monday, there is no need to reduce the days from Monday to Friday. Holi is also reducing it on Diwali, it is his holiday, so when the body is insured, if there is any insurance in his family, that is his holiday.  For the rest of the employed people, there are weekends, 52 Saturdays, 52 Sundays, Republic Day, then Diwali, then Holi, then your Independence Day, then this birth anniversary of yours, that birth anniversary, sometimes yes, sometimes that. Do you know how many holidays are there, then you have understood that the job is bad, the job is somewhat bad.  No, the thing is that do a job, do less than your wife and you can do something small on the side. Do these three things. If you do these three things then the trend of job is better. Do business in India then it means a lot.  If you know about liability then it is okay, there is a lot of grind in a small business and it is a matter of compulsion, no, you are doing our moral, all the people are saying Startup India Startup India, where more people are going, there is competition.  If there is competition then go to the place where it is less and now you are saying that you are not even getting a job, you are not getting a job of your choice, you have a lot of other vices, you have to do yours, then I have to do what you like, if you want a job of your choice.  If you can't find it then  If it's your choice, change it, if not, then I will reduce something of mine. You know how much time it takes to reduce yours. You know when to pay GST. You know how to pay income tax. You know in the supply chain.  How to give vouchers, how to input what to do with credit, then care has to be taken and everything is done by you and you know how much of a headache it is, you are this wedding, sometimes all the videos are not of oil, you have to do like this.  Sir I want women  I want to say that do it for all the less women, do it even while you are in the job, who hasn't done it, why can't we do both the things, if you have a wife and she is doing it and you are giving her 20-30 40% support.  Ho it is sesame butter give you living de job in discovery 35 in 45 if you have to leave job and do less day date is steel n butter option because atlist you know skill it and you have to know your product  You know the franchise, you know this, brother, I used to do this in the company in my life, here was this product, it is sold like this, its margin is this much, at least you got this idea which comes only with time.  How much can it be, then you will have the realization that it is not necessary for me to leave the job because as soon as you leave the job, your huge network, many numbers, WhatsApp goodwill, that too will disappear and that is necessary for you in your business now.  you will say that  Should I do this business and should I do this? Yes, this is the catch, this is the catch, I am telling you, do the business while keeping all the systems here and in the name of your better half, whatever madam's name is, open Neha Private Limited, open any property form of Neha, open anything.  Product batch send multiple products and utilize whatever supply chain system you have. Utilize your distributorship. Utilize all the people below you. Not for wife's business, but this would not be ethical, our company will come to know, this is how it will happen, in that you are in a shop, you are in a phone company, if the phone is left, then the shopkeeper must be sending something else too, then you have typed that.  You have made it a private limited, you can do anything with your friends, what are you cheating on your company, then it is in this matter because what is the problem, this is the fear that the company will not let you do anything while in the job, I do n't know what.  there will be solution  He has to earn the living of both job and startup, you have to become someone's servant and also reduce your private life and we also have to stay and give consultation and we understand these things better as team members if I do.  IF ur hearing this you felt a bit confused, felt like oxymoron, didn't understand the advice, did n't understand the lead, didn't understand what exactly they are saying, you can't just leave the security in the comfort of job and just po  It is not possible only it is something like jumping in NC and sanvere without a life port without a life jacket without anything required dat nahi kar apni ko aisi nahi ho do n't know when the situation has come to do it and which  Yes, you ca n't do it, people can't do it, so what is the use in discussing it, we have given them the idea of ​​doing this versus this, the catch is that we have to do it like this.  You have to take it, the transaction will be done when you get a conviction, then you will not ask whether you will leave the job, when you say that I should leave the job and do this, then what do you have to do, you have to do the tree while working, you do a 6 month pilot project in the name of your wife.  If you get an idea and want to do it then you will get a job and sometimes what happens is brother, leave the job and do it and then get a job at some other place, there is no need to worry so much but I will still suggest it to people.  Please don't leave your job so soon. Do n't find happiness in your job. No one is happy in a job, but it does not mean that you have to do a job, no, I get a lot of happiness. I am so excited about your certain Mondays in things in life.  If there is no happiness in what you have to do, then that job is also like this. After a stage, take any job. In the beginning there is excitement, then the excitement subsides, then it becomes a Monday, then you have to do it, you are almost settled. Some?  Shikha and there I kept my mind focused that how can I start my own small business from this job and be satisfied, in any job you reduce, how can you reduce all the departments there, what is the distribution of the product, what is the supply chain, what is the margin, things. How are the vouchers sold, how are the ranges, what is the system of GST, you will have to understand that sir and you can understand it only while you are on the job. No one can give you entropy training. You should imagine yourself that you are on the job.  You  You are a business owner, now you see how it works, you will learn to perform those functions. In the beginning, you cannot think that you will get 50 employees, then he will see that for that he will have to withdraw only ₹ 25 lakh as salary. You don't have much money per month, where we have started drawing salary of Rs 25 lakhs. Naughty easy, we will learn to do it ourselves, very less they will learn to do it, so first learn to see.  How much is it less and whether it is executed or not? So, if you want to understand this thing through detail channel, then subscribe to Info Web Minar Group in the comment area. If you have not done so yet, you will get notification there in the month.  If there is one then we will meet again. Thank you for telling me."

    "title": "One Actionable Change Young Indian Men Need To Make To Live Fulfilling Lives [f1aoBnBKwTY].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, One actionable change which Indian young men need to do immediately if they want to live a fulfilling life, it is a very important topic, explained it very well, please share, there should be no condemning man, you must have seen the women running away from here.  If anything goes wrong with women, they cry along with many people, they will call their sister, they will call their mother, they will call their friend, they will call their friend.  Are there relationship issues or does something happen at the thought process level? Demand your rights. Feminism: Feminism is also going on a lot. You know, the reactions of men are very out there and what is the reason that they do not become men of the old generation?  If it is going to happen, then the reactions of the men come. They have created a toxic ted club that even if women do something wrong, it is messed up in the sense that it is not reasonable in the house.  She doesn't work, doesn't earn money, does n't keep up with her mother, her nature is not good, there is an affair of extra-marital affair, whatever, everyone has their own list, days are the complaint list of men, as if women are roaming around with them, but they don't hate red clubs.  Keep it up, she is sensible, she is roaming around with it, she is crying, what am I saying to change here, to the men that you should not make hate raid club, tod tox city  Don't go to the level, do n't ruin everyone that everyone will do 498. Everyone will go to jail. Marriage means marriage. Earlier we used to say that marriage feels like a jail to some. Freedom goes away. Now people have taken it literally or actually.  If you call yourself a social scientist like me, you will automatically become more of a scientist than a social observer.  Okay, I am a social observer, I would also like to say that I am a social reformer and I have started a campaign to bring peace in the society, people should get married, people should live comfortably, girls are not bad, boys are not bad and if they are bad then both are there, they are there and I am Like a man who mediates when I also know what a man's pain is, I am not like that in Switzerland, in Switzerland too men are suffering different pain, they are suffering but men are not allowed to articulate.  The biggest problem I face is that women will quickly say, 'Come on women, this is mine, don't show me [ __ ] here, I make many videos for women, my problem is that women also run away, say something against them, my subscriber.  Then don't grow and sometimes make videos for men, they run away. Hey friend, I am talking about both, so for me both should be made. There should be ads. Sometimes you will like it, sometimes you will feel a little bad.  If someone thinks, what happened, sometimes sour, sometimes sweet, sometimes cold, sometimes hot, it's okay, man, understand what I am trying to say, you people have made me with such extreme views, if you want a woman to do the work, which I always say, then she should be.  What do people say? No matter what the man says, if it works, then affairs will happen. Again the thought process, if the colors work, then why will affairs happen? What is lacking in you, if you marry a woman, then what self-esteem issues do you have that you have?  It seems that if she goes out of the house, she will see many men. You are so bad, there are men in the society too, you understand, and if you go, she is alone in the house and what's more, if someone wants to create an illusion like this,  It can be inserted somehow and in my personal consultation I told that this is very much my view, there is no pattern, in fact, outside you are caught having affairs more, so it seems more because there was a report in Kerala at some time. That a lot of crime is reported, brother, the crime is not much, the crime of UP was very less, this time I normally do not like to take the names of states because people make it political, but take the names of some states or in general, you see. If reports are not being written anywhere then it means crime is less, that means you are not seeing crime, then crime is less somewhere. If you become a pigeon and put it in its mouth, then the cat will eat it, otherwise according to the data.  You get to hear from them that see, because there is gossip in the office, you know that even if someone is not having an affair, then our mind set is like the Indian narrow mind set which many people have, we are okay with these things. Seeing that she is talking to him, it is okay that she is having an affair with him, then that affair becomes very affair in the mind and also becomes real. If you combine both then the number comes out to be very high. If you apply the ratio to 100 women. Who  It seems as if only 25-30 people are working, out of which 90 will be imaginary and 10 will be true, but there is no database of those who live in houses, no one says anything about them.  If you don't know, if you do n't know then it's good, I am teaching you that don't go to talk city, actually discuss and debate, yes this is an issue, women also need to change those men.  Who will not do this? No, you should work at home, you should do offcourse, but what should you do, we do this much, so define how much we do, put tension force on it, there are two people, breakfast, lunch, dinner, ok, we made 12 rotis, but  He did n't come for lunch but he didn't do this one and what are the people facing outside after going there, so if you articulate and discuss about this, I want to do a free webinar for my subscribers, if you guys. They want that, I will do it for free, I want to do it on discussion basis, so I would like a lot of women to join it and a lot of youngsters to join and for them to join, I will share it on my info group for the subscribers info group which I create for Clarity for Youth subscribers.  There is a free information group for that, it must be posted in the comment section, you come and discuss once, I will mediate, you all come and join, whoever has been poisoned by me in the society, in one go.  Those who will join directly, I will remove them by giving them the platform, what fear do you have, like many big men have, she doesn't respect my parents, so you better do it, no, what do I need to do, I was born a boy, how much respect do you have to do?  Are the parents doing respectable work? Is his default setting a manufacturing problem that he doesn't know how to give respect or is not giving it after asking? Some hard questions will be asked: Will you marry your parents?  Do you want to serve your parents or want a company in your life, want to write your journey and story because if you marry only to serve your parents, then maids are available servants, are available drivers are available earn.  What do you do for free on that money? If you give nothing for free, you will be asked tough questions by the society. Pre-marital consultation is also a very good thing. Today, my pre-marital consultation is for those who want to get married.  If so, in the comment section or description, you will also get the link to that workshop which is of two and a half hours duration, in which there are 30 questions and its fee for a small pizza is the same as the pizza, the fee is the same as the veg pizza.  That one is fine, you take it, you can become a consultant in it or you will come to ask questions yourself, the boy will ask the girl, the girl will ask the boy, common question is common 30 questions.  Which you need to ask before you get into a relationship and get into the bond of marriage, so much of this is what I am doing in practical terms, I am not painting only idealistic scenarios here, what is it, whether yes should be done, no, no, it is good.  No no, women are absolutely white, men are black, not you, everything is grey, but men have no manners, women have their own network, men ca n't even talk to their father, son. Apart from this, if a man says more than this, then he will go to his father when the forest is over. If someone like this, he will think that I should not kill him, this is what the father's syllabus is, women still listen to each other and tips.  She makes you do it like this, you do it like this, this goes on, now for women, now for men, you also make a syllabus. If the man shares it with his friend, he will say, well, there must be something lacking in you, only then Bhabhi ji is not happy.  He also knows, I will tell my friend, he will beat me in the office that his wife is not happy with this, if he is not happy with this then he will come to make her happy, there are many like this and if men know, then men should do so without vulgarity and without fear.  Without doing that, we don't understand what is the point of discussing, so we paint everyone, we all are like this, doing it like this, it doesn't work, getting irritated won't work, we can't run away, even going to Bangkok doesn't work.  It's a very expensive ticket to Bangkok and even if you go, it's free there, people say you won't get AIDS, I will use that, yes, maybe you won't get AIDS, but you will get this one, the one with the virus, isn't it?  Diseases will not be found, bacterial ones will be found. Now I can also become a sexologist, but I am not becoming one, but I am explaining that brother, there are many issues, there are many issues, it is not so easy, it will not be possible, learn the syllabus, come and do it openly.  If you talk politely then it will be fun if you yourself and your friend will reveal the truth of the world to the four experiences you have had and in essence you will become that person with a huge experience and wisdom comes mostly. I have seen.  No matter how much I control myself, I am also an astrologer and the channel Clarity is for youth, but Sango reminded me that people who do not talk about astrology to you because I ask them for my life. Here people say that it is not scientific, you talk so much, you talk so well, we have subscribed, but if you have talked about this, then we are going, so don't go, that is why I avoid it, but still we will not be left without telling that Sango by doing simple astrology.  There is a separate youtube3 6 activation of Saturn, wisdom will come at the age of 36, even a donkey gets wisdom at the age of 36, the one who has no brain, his 36 is the age, his intellect and consciousness gets awakened by him.  First you have to run to wake up, it wakes up automatically after 36, so learn it before that, friend, because 36 is a lot of overs, it is a 50 over match, so you mean you have reached 30 overs, in a way, you are already at 40 overs.  If your batting is not set till now, then you will never be able to score 300 runs. Well, because 36 is quite old. Look at it in a way, from 22 to 36 to 14 years 14.  Ram ji was in exile for a year, he came back, okay, it will be activated in 36, first learn, I am ready to teach, if you join there, you will get a free webinar, I would like to keep it on a normal week day evening, when  The video is also going to be released in two to four days. Whenever you are watching the release, it will be released in the evening in two or three days and you will get its information on the webinar info group in the comment section. Go and join him, then you all will get clarity at once, otherwise you are giving knowledge to each other, one bitter boy is saying to another bitter boy, everything is like this, brother is brother, friend is friendship.  Come all like this, then this one will get married, then where should I go now, how many will we catch, till 36, everyone runs away here and there, show me these 40 year olds, I do n't get it, there will be many like this, you are stuck alone and all your sets are done.  somewhere  No, friend, now I have come to my senses, hey, you used to speak like this a lot, yes I used to speak, but no, now I have come to my senses, so all of you friends are not taking the decisions of your life, that is what I will try to do.  Bring in whatever I do, I will do it very well. Please join in it and take its clarity. There will be a discussion and whatever be your questions, their questions will be answered. It will be on other platforms.  Because of being open a little bit, she comes to that fear that by saying something politically incorrect, you might put your foot in your mouth, or there is this fear and the content does not come out of the fear, so you have to tell it openly. Many things are ok so please join thank you very much"

    "content": "Hello friends, this is a very interesting topic which will benefit the society a lot on one big region, happiness in society, Indian Society, what a big thing that is, what is that one region, you would like to know by pausing here, write yes so that it sounds like yes, many people were there to know that.  I will discuss the region and tell the solution and that region is the note of today's people, putting family first, I have a formula and in all my videos you can see that family is mother's family is always first.  Don't put the family first, I will go into the whole history, I will go to the whole Quran, till the old Vedas, I will tell you how to survive, why we should do that, you understand and today the topic of pain has become very prevalent, don't put the family first, parents too are included in this.  There are sons and daughters, there are brothers and sisters and you also have your son-in-law and daughter-in-law, it is a great Indian family, it is okay not to put him first, it is okay to put someone else first, people have seen in today's day, if you tell, there is a big discussion on religion in the society.  There is a big discussion in politics, who will win and who will lose, there is a lot of discussion on religion, people support their religion a lot, they support the country, what should be done, it should definitely be done, I am not making this religious or that, I am just telling about the family.  But I am telling you that religion can be changed, yes, it can be changed, people change religion, one was this, then that became this, they call it conversion, which is okay, maybe the country can also be changed, people can turn you off course.  Do you know how many?  Do you know how many Indian citizens can change their Canadian passport after becoming an American citizen? You can change your country, you can change your religion, you can change your family, will people write 'little people', you can change your wife, you cannot change your family, you cannot change your children, if it happens, then she is your woman. You will remain the mother of those children, you will remain the mother of those children, even if you divorce her and she cannot change the fact, then I will not go into that Mian Bibi and I will focus on the family, Indian family which  There was tradition and color, it saved our society, so many people came, we were not there, there were thousands of years of foreign rule, do you know the kind of people, everyone is sitting on it with so much knowledge, but we still went back because the heart used to beat here, family.  The last unit of the smallest unit of the society is the family, the community chain and all of them come next, then as they go further, religion and the country gets divided, after the community, then smaller ones.  By uniting the community, village and brotherhood, finally the family has come, just like the cell is the smallest unit in the body, all this is there, the smallest unit is the cell, similarly, the smallest unit of the society is the family, if the family is not together or leave it like this, then the society will be destroyed.  What will happen to religion? What will happen to the country? Let's go to save the religion. Let's save the country. Take your son's child, pay attention to him because that is where the pain is coming from. Parents, a father of the house, a job in the society.  Is giving importance to something else, is not giving importance to wife and children or is the parent engaged in some program of his own while helping his daughter-in-law in her job, without helping his child? Story  Do something else in my life of politics, whatever these rallies are, whatever these rallies are, I say, friend, where is the family in your life, you can't even be happy, we know that you have done a lot of wrong and  Ram ji gaye [music] did not support the family but in India no one named their child Vibhishan, the name is kept either Kahani or Kahani, there was a younger brother Kumbhkaran Karan, the name is still kept [music] The human being  Not your family's, not anyone's People Code on Vidya Family People Change Religion Change Country's Boundaries Also Change Country's Ideology Also Change Religion Everything Bill Change Covid  People realized what is family, governments will fail, society has failed, the world has failed because people need to know the value of real estate, what is their home, it happens when you lie in the hospital and they press the button and the nurse  She has come or she has not come and sometimes that button is not even pressed and sometimes you also know how to tell again and again, I am feeling lonely, someone should press my waist like this, someone should give me water and if  When even that did not come again and again, we came to know what family is, the importance of family is waning, some cartoon type gurus of social media are gone, cartoon type conscious awakeners are ahead and there are some other types too.  You are living and that is suiting you, basically, continue to take responsibility, etc., the shop that is open, it's running away from responsibility, leave it for the sake of responsibility, leave the parents' house, the house is not left, you can buy the house.  You do n't have a job, you can't cook, your clothes are not washed, you are the one who, according to me, has to wake up such people by giving them big talks through family or someone. Vivekananda ji is very Gautam Buddha, isn't he? And leave it.  Then sir, if you want to follow me then show me completely, nor do you have to follow me half way, I went for breakfast, then I went for lunch, then I went for dinner, I will eat in between. Chetan is awake, will I sit with someone or is someone engaged in the rally?  any  What will a leader get for doing that? Politics will be such that you become a leader, you become an actor, you become a leader, you become nothing, nothing remains with you, Mins Dhore is the English Haryanvi word brother-in-law, there is nothing with you, nothing remains with you.  There is a lot of democratization, due to technology, no one is giving more jobs to anyone, no one is doing postings, no one is giving tenders, things are getting tight.  Politicians too have no stock in wasting time on religion and politics. Religion is a private thought, whoever you want to follow, follow your own privately, do as much as you want. You are creating noise. There has to be some YouTube channel that my one is good, your one is good, this is it.  Look at him, don't look at him, look at my one, whoever thinks whatever he wants, do it and this is politics too, vote for him, do this, the country is in danger, the country is in danger, the country is in danger, the country is in danger in 2023.  The country is in danger when our economy is so good, it is time that foreigners have come, our armed forces are powerful, it is time that they are so high in the affairs of the world, it is right then that the country is in danger, it means the country is in danger long ago.  Bhi tha yaar, what was the country in 1857, what was the mango cafe family, mango country, India's boundary will change 10,000 times in 10000 years, already family Hajj, you are  Treated first: Many elderly people leave their family, leave their children and are more engaged with their siblings, then family men, your lineage first, then next, then next after that, first of all, your own family, then parents, then siblings, then mother-in-law.  -Father-in-law, then village, then community, then that, then that, it has gone like this, it has not gone the other way, in your family, your son is not talking to you, your daughter is not talking, Dhamal is not talking, daughter-in-law is not talking.  You are doing and are engaged in improving the society. No one is doing any good. You are passing your time. You are a person who runs away from responsibility. Every person, the head of every family, should fix his family and in India 35 crores 30 crores 25 crores.  These are families, the country will progress on its own, it will go up in its index, development will happen on its own, sitting at your table, Das, know eight, sit as you please, yes, what to do now, yes, which property will you take, which one will you bring in the lion? What is happening to your salary, which school will he go to, what food will he get, which account will he have, which car to buy, what to do with him, everything is being discussed, everyone is working together to do something of his own and when his  In this way you will reduce only then there will be a family like life in the country, community and society will automatically be there for one's family, one's own family, whenever you are watching the story on video, it has become a scandal, it has become a street scandal, this has happened. What benefit is your family getting? Just saw. Now breaking news is coming. I have not even watched TV. It is a very good thing that people related to you are watching what is happening in America. What is happening in Ukraine, what is happening in Putin, what are your boys and girls doing in the next room, we do not know what their thoughts are going on, you do not know what they are seeing, you do not know what else is going on in their life.  You don't know but everyone else knows Which candidates does BJP have to field, where does Congress have to do, what is happening with the Aam Aadmi Party, what is happening with whom, all the news is there, all the opinion is there, there is the feed on Twitter, everywhere, that is the complete information for you to do like this. You don't know what's happening next to you. You don't know what's happening next to you because in the family, family is first. Otherwise, do n't write the story about your family. As I say, you should take out stickers which you can stick on your fridge.  Family first, in family first, when mom opens the fridge, she will also see it, the child will open it, he will also see it, he is opening it, he can also see it, family first family means for each other, father is facing some problem, father, work very hard, father  Make coffee, a child who is engaged i.e. teach me 17-16-18 20 years father mother story, child is engaged family first father has come to office father coffee  Papa, I am the only one who will open his heart in such a way that if I have any question, he is only concerned about the family because what is happening, if he is not giving his feelings to anyone then everyone has become engrossed in himself, is n't he the one who is the head of the house?  The man who is useful for the money is not getting the feeling, so he goes somewhere else for the feeling, the man is not giving the feeling to the woman, the woman is busy in her story friend circle, on her WhatsApp group, on the phone.  Kitty is busy partying  The parents are not paying attention to the children, the children have made some private limited program of their own, everyone has made their own and everyone is giving opinion on this on Twitter, the country's religion or brother and then it should be in the frame in the photo and then  They say, we are not happy brother, we cannot be happy because friend is your friend till now as long as he believes that he is your friend, yes, the day is short, from tomorrow the friendship is over, it is not like this with father, father, you will not be my father, this cannot happen.  father  You have beaten me with sticks, you have to scold me, father, father, and will always be a father. Son, if he misbehaves there, say something, give me your hair, where will the son go, what will you do to him, he is misbehaving, he is in pain, he is frustrated, why is this given by you, no, he is his company.

    "title": "One Problem With Friendship [voMbSj0p1jQ].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, clarity is a very important thing for youth. One problem with friendship means I have you should also have this problem with friendship. This is an aspect which people forget. In the matter of friendship, the belief system of many will hurt. It is important to keep this on the back of mind.  It is not that whatever has been told or explained will change your life on this but they say that they are giving the disclaimer first, read the offer.  Document Carefully for Investing Past market returns are not indicative of future returns but I am telling you the biggest problem of friendship is that your friend is your friend till the time he believes he is your friend the day he believes  The friendship has ended. The same thing is not true for your brother and sister and wife and father and mother. You cannot run away from them. You will not believe that there will be a fight today.  You are not my brother, tell your real brother, then what happens if you believe, that is what I am saying, there is no shadow journey because what youth is doing is wasting too much time in this friendship business, not realizing that when you are in the friendship business  And you are here at this level My college friend Life journey has played differently That friendship cannot last because you are not the same person  There, friendship with the person whom you are calling friendship is time pass, acquaintance ship, colleagues are peers, you are on a job, you are talking, you are passing time, you have no means but to be cordial to each other, nice to you. To be nice to each other. To be kind to each other. To be helpful to each other just because someone is your friend.  Kind to you Helpful to you Talks nicely They do n't have a choice She has a choice You don't have a choice That's not friendship, brother, people call it friendship, it's silence, it's cordial relationships, everyone in the world is like this  At the same time, there should be very few people who will do extreme things to you and will make you feel bad that friend, don't do this, he is a true friend, a true friend.  So one, two, three means this number of fingers, how many fingers are there on this hand, it is only four, if you remove this finger, it is less than the fingers of one hand, meaning, he is the one to whom you will call at 11:00 in the night. He will ask why he has to come to give, what happened when he came, he will not ask anything, how many people are there in your life, he will try like this before I see people not getting addicted.  Efforts Toward Maintaining Relationships with Their Own Parents Wife Husband Spouse Siblings Siblings Are There for the Means for Life Time Journey Your Whoever if you're listening to me if they become a little bit more of a brother to one of their closest husbands to boys to boys Hain Friend Kabhi Bhai Nahi Hota Never Ever Call Your Friend Bhai It's a great injustice to the word Bhai Bhai, this is a very big thing, our movies have also done this This friendship, we will not break it, was glorified a lot, in which two heroes used to love a girl, before that, there were many different movies like this, before that, I made sacrifices for it, all this was nonsense, it was a joke.  Nothing happens in life, there are a lot of comparisons in life, there is jealousy and there are big issues, no, my childhood friend, my childhood friend, everyone's stories, let the relationship between brothers be maintained.  It is a big thing if you have to depend too much on your friends and you will not listen to me and troll me and say bad things to me then you have to see that your personal relationship is not true if you have to depend on friends.  Wise in a normal healthy environment Your own parents Your own brother Sisters Your own children Your own spouse There is no greater friend than the one you marry If there is no other than these, then your energy should not be wasted because to maintain any relationship, energy is needed, food, drink, travel, expenses, water, all these have to be done but the ultimate gain should be that you are becoming a better person in it.  The friendship that I see these days is not becoming a better person, it is as much food as it is as ignorant as you are, in which you can mentorship gurus and teach them to them and where this Entertainment is time pass and this is the shade of future, for this you should have your own close relationships, if not extremely close ones, then it is okay if you do it with your cousin also, because the cousin is also a shade past yours and is in the blood line and his athlete is your father.  And both his father and mother are brothers or both your mother and his mother are sisters, they are called cousins, then you can be friends even to the extent that yes we will because we are.  Doing something other wise is nothing, then that is partnerships. Partners consider business partners as friends. This is a very loose term to get your work done. You are my friend, neither are you my brother nor are you, nor will you be someone else for things.  Wise, why do you need to enter into it so much, then why do you need to enter into it so much, then he is a friend, so he will enter, everything is getting boring for the youth because what is happening to the youth these days, they are not getting support from their parents, nor are their parents understanding things.  That friend is understanding because what is being understood is he, you, he is also in the same situation, his parents also do not understand, so two unhappy people are able to interact with each other on some common understanding of things like your colleague is  Now your colleague who works in the same job will understand your pain better. Vanaspati's college friend who has joined a different department or job because he will not understand with that term, now you. You haven't even joined the merchant navy. Do you know what happens there? You are not in a PSU bank. In a small town, do you know what pain is going on there? Somewhere friend, someone has gone to some place. If someone in the department has gone to some place, then this is the change.  It keeps happening but this word should not be friendship that this is a misused word yes there are friends yet I will say they are friends but I will make its definition in a separate video sometime.  Sustainability is there in very, very different ways. Then who is that? Who are you and what is that? It is not what is like, that is the spiritual connection, that is the connection. I have been saying throughout my life that it cannot be more than this, these four fingers only.  Isn't it, it will be less than this, it will not be less than this, these people don't think that he likes it, by making him sit with us, by making him sit with his father, by making him sit with his mother, whenever he sees, he is busy with his friends, hey, you don't let him stay, his friend. gives comfort  Whether they take drugs, whether they do wrong things, whether they do useless things, or have useless dreams, or whatever they do, but whatever it is, your child, the boy, the girl, or the boy is enjoying it because he or she is enjoying it.  It is fun, he is going there, nothing is happening to him, but nothing is happening to him, now I am telling the parents, give this send as a youth, you also send this video to your parents, it is not  That I am becoming a strict moral science teacher by having only one sided knowledge, I am not becoming it, I am not becoming it for the children, you understand that it is coming the other way, there is no better friend than a father who becomes a friend because if he  He is a friend and he is not judgmental and he is not judgmental because he is working hard to put you in a good position and if he understands what you say and is not judgmental then very few people would.  Such are the fathers we meet. Mothers' role is only after one stage they ate bread and washed clothes. This is what happens to mothers. They are failing in their roles. I can tell you as a mentor as a guru. Their only job is to worry and nag.  To do, doesn't study, doesn't get up, doesn't do, no, nothing will happen to you, no, it won't happen, I have made your bread, I have finished your food, or you should shoe your father like a dog, a tommy on the child means father, the tommy shoe means me.  If you are not able to handle the shoe then that, that Tommy, that too, understand them, the parents feel after a stage in parenting that brother, we have to do shoe only, this was my biggest problem, I hope you people will agree with this, those who disagree, do it.  I am not saying to end the friendship. The word friendship is being used very loosely. I am doing that because when you make a friendship then you also become a brother. You are like my brother, no brother.  The way someone says to someone, you are like my father, you should not say, all this is like a mother, no one is like a mother, no one is like a father, no one is like a brother, just what one is, is whose is gone, gone, don't tell anyone.  It is wrong to have a sin in that relationship. Never ever in your life. Sir, either you or someone else, you are my father, no one is equal to anyone else's father, father is always a father, it is okay, father is always a father and no one is equal to anyone else.  cannot be like a father, if he is like a father by force then  Then take his property, then take the demat too, break the FD too. Who is like a father? No, I am speaking like a father to whom. I am speaking out of respect. Why do we talk so superficially? We have learned this vocabulary from our films.  That in this situation we have to say like this: You are like my brother, no, you are not like my brother, if there is a brother, then he is a brother, but he is a brother and brother is a very big relationship and friendship does not even come close to that.  Unfortunately, that relationship broke down or you could not handle it or your parents did not teach you properly or your values ​​were bad or your intentions were bad or there is something wrong with you then you take the help of a friend but what is the biggest thing in a friend?  Your friend is your friend as long as he believes, so this relationship is very weak. First of all, because I don't believe in believing, then he is not your friend. You say, you are my friend, I do n't believe, end of the matter. Can you say this for yours?  Father and mother and brother and wife and child, I don't believe in you, you are my son, don't believe, what happens if you believe, then you will come and become one again, this does not happen in friendship, if there is a conflict in friendship, if something happens over some useless thing then there  There is no scope because there is no shade past; there is no shade future; it is just the present; I am just enjoying the present; it is going well and the shade is near.  It was from some college, it was because of some other time, now the story has changed, the path has changed, everything has happened, only now why do people keep these normal friendships mostly because people in their life want thermometers like measuring fever.  If there are any things then a reference is needed that where is my life going, my friends are going here, if I am here then I am behind or if my friends stay here then I go ahead then I am happy. My friend's wife is very happy.  She got the sexy beautiful one and I am not able to get it or did n't get it. Alas, I am behind this constant. This one has been robbed. My one never even smiles. This is her life. This is the photo of her poor girl. After her photo, you will come to know sometime. That brother, someone got divorced, well, this is the mind of human minds, will any man ever be happy if someone gets divorced like this, but this is the friendship that is going on, we need constant comparison, who is looking like, who is earning how, who is like. Whose life is living, how is the personal life, that's why we want to know how much, where did you make the property, how much is there in your D-mat, how many are your numbers, it's the initial of friendship starts with numbers, how many came then where did you feel, then what is happening.  Phir Ladki Teri Bandi Tera Banda This Thing Can Be Just If You Have To Reach Somewhere In Life Ya Chhod Do Just Be Nice Let People Seek You Let You Seek People Who Are Good And All Don't  Put them not the one of friendship because when a friend comes and goes away most of the time he will waste your time. The definition of friendship that normal children and youth think of is that of a time waster that if there is someone to cry with when you are sad, then you consider him as your friend. Yes, this is the real friend who will tell you why you are crying, this crying itself is wrong for you, your very existence is wrong, everything about you is wrong, but this is how I told you, so if you have more friends than this in your life then All of you are sitting there with the material of time pass. Could it be pro, you do this to me, I do this to you, you do this to me, he does this to me, this is not friendship, it is okay, I scratch your bag, you scratch my bag is not.  Friendship: Drink tea, drink alcohol, go to the pub, pass time here, take a girl here, watch a movie, do this here, do this here, it is a need of human interaction, don't call it friendship.  I am saying that it is not a big thing, it is a small thing, it will be missed, new people will keep coming, it will work but as much as you can understand alone and keep your core energies, core emotions and whatever you have, for your siblings, for your wife. For the wife's siblings, for the parents, keep a little bit for the in-laws. This is the advice. It will take a little bit. I know people these days are dependent on their friends for their survival.  So that shows a miser in your family let me be very very blunt your parents have not done the job if you are a youth listening to me life will not work without my friends then your parents have miserly failed because if your parents are  There if your siblings are there and yet your life is not going well without friends, look, someone's parents have gone, it is a different matter, tragedies happen.  I don't have any siblings in my life, I do n't have any brothers, of course I am not that much, I am not that much, but I have a full family and I am going to push you, friend, friend, come, come, I will take you for a ride, I will make you drink, I will feed you, my friend.  Friendship will remain alive, what are you doing, okay, that is the message, I hope you understand by doing a little higher order thinking, please subscribe the channel, like, take membership of the channel.  If you want to take a very iconic decision making workshop of mine, I did it a few days ago, it will be available to the members of the channel, you can listen to it, you can watch it in other ways, if you want to download it from the app and watch it alone, then there is a one time fee for that and also.  You can take How to Learn the Art of Decision Making because in all these also decision making is developed somewhere, so 12 to 13 more five points by using very good mental model.  The framework I have taught in it has become a very good hit, it means I am very happy as a creator, I am getting very good feedback and it is becoming very popular, so if you have not seen it then you should definitely watch it, that is my message. Thank you very much"

    "title": "One Wrong Thing That Parents Are Doing To Their Adult Children [5idE5_1tqHA].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, what parents are doing wrong to their adult kids is a very important topic for the society. This is a phenomenon which is playing out in middle class India. As a social observer and social scientist, I am observing this thing a lot. Family conflicts. I do the resolution through consultation and I am seeing this pattern, you are seeing it, you tell me, if you are a youngster, you can do this.  If you are suffering then tell me and keep your hand on your heart. If you are a senior citizen, you are not doing this to your children. We will try to understand what is this phenomenon. This is a passive aggressive behavior which is being done towards the youngsters. That is, those who are between the age of 22, 23, 24, 25 and 40 years and their parents are between the age of 55 years and 75 years. People are doing this, we say this in English, but I don't understand. If I try to explain it in Hindi, then it is called making a face, puffing out your mouth, being angry, being angry, being angry because of your own ill health or issues in your life or Time is not passing, hanging on children. I say this, I want to address this generation which was born today in 1950 and 1960 and the rest who will come later.  Those who are probably born on the side of this phenomenon and are suffering, they will also watch the video and spread it and it should become a topic of discussion in the family group. Don't be shy, say it openly, let's discuss it on the issue.  It is not necessary for us to have political debates and discussions on religion at 89 o'clock. This is happening in our family. I am bringing the issues which are touching you real. I am actual.  It is okay to become a politician, but now is not the time, or will the country become so wise in 10 years that all these things will be discussed openly, but let's start from now, for my subscribers, the issues of father and mother's married life, children.  They are coming on salary and they are not even being shown the married life. You talk to your father, you talk to your mother. Parents talk directly to each other and they talk through the children.  They behave in such a way as if they want to get the votes of the children. They have got their influence mixed in the lives of the children. They are not understanding their relationship with them. If the husband is the wife, then the wife is not able to manage her job. How can I get it done? Even if you are not coming, it will not come from us, okay?  If you can't raise children, then leave us with us, leave us with grandparents, leave us with maternal grandparents, who are such parents? These days, the hearts of today 's parents also beat the same, don't they?  If she leaves her child and comes to another city, then that woman, being a woman, will leave her job if she needs help, and secondly, feeling victimized has become too much for the parents and this one is such a cruel parent. Who is probably not creating anything in his life or is a cunning senior citizen whose children are settled in Australia and America, are doing well, are earning money and he roams around a lot and has created havoc.  What is left is for your relatives to check by putting some of these messages in their diary. Those who are watching my video, there must be a cunning relative in your relatives. Please check yourself. It can be anyone, he, he, he, uncle, uncle, uncle.  Uncle, these are the relationships, all of them are fine or your father's mother's friend or friend or one of their friends who keeps giving them feedback again and again, what is the need for you to do it, the children will do it like this.  That is another biggest example of Raymond Wale, till date no one has told his truth, that of Singhania Sahab, now he does not come out with these things publicly, his son cheated on him and that son is a woman, he did this and told that.  I am not even defending my son. Disclaimer, I am a shareholder, so I am not talking about increasing or decreasing the shares, but I want to tell in a different way that he has another son and also a son whose  He had decided to do something in 1999 and his children had filed a case against his grandfather for giving him the money, then for some reason the grandfather gave it to his second son, you understand what I am saying, the politics of the two children, he did not tell that thing so that he would not be displeased. What is this day in India? If I have white hair like you, even though I am not of my age, I have knowledge, but its default setting is that I get respect by suppressing that I don't know what is my age, I am old, this is if.  this is how i dye my hair black  I wish it would be 10 times more than me. Trolls are still there but less because white hair is respected in India. Even after telling this, I am telling you that white hair should not be respected only for white hair. The person may also be white or cunning.  What I am trying to say is that your youngsters can also be cunning, it can be anyone, just a man, wherever an old man is seen helpless, he goes into the default setting without knowing that he has done so.  Totally guggle the story that I am telling you, this story will not be out brother, why would any man give his all to anyone, think something, tell me, I have given it, it must be a mistake, no mistake, it must be accepted, okay, everyone heard one side story each.  But brother, why did you give it, someone else was asking for it, there was a court case going on, there was something and if you gave something out of Rs. 00 to someone for Rs. 100, with some cleverness, then the next person increased it 10 times, now you want to say that if  They  If it is a thing worth Rs. 000 then it is all yours if it is not his then the question is that here we will not become moral science teachers, within these relationships we do not have to become moral science teachers, I am telling this under the example, there is no point in criticizing anyone.  Or defending someone that he is doing very good, we all can be a little bit villainous, I am sharing so much knowledge, I can also be a villain, if I have my own relatives in my life, I can do something.  There is some devil in all of us, there is a devil and there is also a god, there is mix and match, sometimes the devil is more in some, in some that element is more in some, we accept it, don't we, we have to accept that the parents are  If the children are white, then keeping them black is wrong, rather than making them black and white. The parents have never audited us. We have done so much in every generation. The previous generation feels that they have done a lot. Oh brother, the previous ones are like they say.  In the World War one, do you know what war is, how people die, in the previous one they used to bring water, there was no toilet anywhere or there was no education or we used to go by swimming. You heard all those stories like they make politicians nowadays.  Isn't it, I was very poor, all those born in India in 1950 were poor because India itself was poor, tell me who was rich, count 100 people in India, except this Tata Birla and these 100 people.  Okay, Bajaj, leave aside the 100 people who were rich at that time, all those born in 1945-50 were poor, so why are you praising such poverty? Even 25 years ago, all were poor in whose houses.  It was like this, nowadays this Minister Sahiba has become ours, it was like this, it was like this, we used to travel on scooters, the whole of India used to travel on scooters, did we travel on scooters, did we travel on bicycles, did we walk on foot, what stories are you telling to the people these days?  Will he be impressed by that? Don't they know? Their parents don't know what it is. They used to watch black and white TV. Color TV used to come on. They used to go to a neighbor's house to watch Ramayana. They used to go to someone else's to watch Mahabharata. What is so great? Not us, neither in our house.  There was no TV either, we used to go to someone else's, the whole of India used to go, if you look at the people of that time, then 90 out of 100 people would watch TV in someone's house and people would show it very lovingly, they would like to come and see us.  lot  Sir, there used to be better times, people used to go and watch. We have seen ours. Now it will be like that, I should not tell too much about my personal example. It used to be fun. We used to think that we don't know what it is. There used to be a big gathering. It was good that people used to watch. So coming again to the parents, the feeling that parents have that they should do more physical work is a truth that nowadays people feel that they are not doing physical work. This is a fact. They are feeling that they are not getting up early in the morning. They don't know that they sit in tension even at night, they don't sleep at night, Saturday and Sunday, they see that he is the one who wakes up easily or is it a woman, she is a sister, she is getting up after sleeping late, so brother, she is his. Monday to Friday Saturday, see what poor people are doing. The previous generation does not know how much mental tension sucks the body. Every previous generation has done more physical work. If you  If you go backward then you will know how people used to eat food before agriculture was invented, what they did before the wheel was invented and if you go back then what were there before fire was invented, then fire came, then agriculture then came wheel, so it is easy.  It has been happening, is n't it, that every successful being has physical comfort? It is the lazy people who make some progress in life. Those who work hard, if they were still working hard then we would not even be there.  By now, you would have been picking up the stuff yourself, you would have been busy, okay, so some lazy person has come up with all this technology, man, he is not in the mood to change, earlier only two channels were coming, so he got up and changed.  We used to watch Doordarshan and then that DD Metro or something came, okay, it used to take effort, no, you go and change it, then a remote came, okay, then started doing things like this with it, it has come with 200 channels, now it has unlimited thousand.  Address  No, it is okay, so what am I trying to do with the next generation, looking at the previous generation, that brother, this is not the stability of the job, you did a job for 60 years, you were not beaten, you knew that the increment will be given like this and the job will work like this, you know.  It was said that the school fees were not as high as they have become these days and if the children had studied then the children of the previous generation who are being harassed today, who are above 35 years of age,  If you have done well in your studies in childhood, then you can get into something or the other, but this should not happen to your children who are listening to me today in their 40s, now or in the late 30s and 40s, whose children are now in the age group of 10 to 18 years.  If your children are in the middle, even if they have studied a lot and have done very well, there is no guarantee that anything will happen because many of their children are studying because technology has leveled the playing field. What was it earlier if the father was from a middle class family?  Of  Books are available, brilliant tutorials are available, Akash Akash FIITJEE etc. were open at that time, many years ago, you got admission in it, so you had an inherent advantage of your child getting success over other children. Today, that Khan  Who is a research center? They are giving IAS coaching for Rs. 7500. Now their strike rate can be as low as they want, but if they are teaching 20 lakh, 30 lakh, 50 lakh children. Brother, those people will also come, now you cannot say today that I have the money to pay the fees of Divya Kriti ji or someone else has the money to pay, if it is Rs 1.5 lakh or more then only I have no chances of success. Today money can.  Not Guarantee You Success Early Relative Money Could Guarantee You Success These Times Are Still Easy For You Today Times Are Not Easy In Any Way Your Job Is Not Lasting Your Relationship Is Not Lasting These Parents Who Throw Tantrums They don't know that the couple you are doing, the one with Rohit and Neha, whether Rohit is your son or Neha is your daughter, what is the inheritance, they do n't know that Rohit will be a newly married couple, this is guaranteed to them and you.  Apart from throwing tantrums, they are also saying that we are not respected, they do not respect each other, their shoes are worn out every day, their life is not going well, they are not getting food, their sex life is bad, their marital life is bad.  It is bad that the children are not growing from them, they are having pain in the stomach, they are having gynecological issues, they are having sexual dysfunction but it has nothing to do with you. You have looted all the good qualities from the previous generation of 1950 and 1960. I am telling you this openly.  Shame on you, this generation is not doing as much sex as these people, I would say sex on the rocks. This generation is seeing more sex. Physically, you are seeing a lot of sex. Open your mobile phone.  You all take it, sex is visible everywhere but it is not happening, this is what Guruji is telling you from Gurugram, write it down somewhere youngsters and tell your parents that you have cut too many sheets, please spare us you stay too much.  Yes, you used to live, so how can you live, now you lived at that time and you, you too are not living, we too are not living because everyone is trapped in politics, not so much, that term.  It used to happen that even when there was an emergency in the country, people went out. Ask, at that time, while the emergency was going on, this happened to the public. Oh my, the public still went out. Even during the British era, people did not feel as much oppression as they do today. Atrocities happen because of wherever they are happening in front of you on your mobile. Earlier, atrocities were happening a lot but were not visible and were not even known. If it is happening anywhere then today it is the inputs of an average man which cannot be stopped.  As for entertainment  10000 options, 20000 options of conflict, 20000 options of job pressure, 25000 things, first of all you have to sell the thing yourself, whoever does the job today, you are selling something, you and 10 crore people are selling something to you, so this is what is sold and sold, every time it bursts, it is You will take brother, you will come, call me, hello call, how many do not disturb, you will take insurance, these are the people, those are the people, brother, it is only for your call.  I was waiting for madam's call to come, then I will take the insurance, okay you take this, take this, cold calling, we have given everyone's numbers from here to there, so life will be very normal, there is no pause, what should the parents do in this?  We have to give coolness to our children, we have to do like this, we have to become cool trees like this, these are the parents, I know it is right and I also give training to the parents who want to become like this, if you want to become then  Tell me, if you want to change your parents, then through the Consult Webinar Workshop, let me speak knowledge, give them Guruji's knowledge because the previous generation is distributing the same knowledge to their children born in 1950 and 1960, even at the age of 5.  I am never seen applying in my life, nor do I see him applying for his 5. But brother, something is cool, now look, I am claiming, I am testing you, today is my test, you have to fail, you have to fail.  Pass me, look at my face, look at my eyes, look at my everything, if I am coming here and imparting knowledge, then is something bright visible, is something laughing, is it the laughter on the face or the laughter of the stomach or is it from somewhere deeper than that?  There is a smile somewhere, a little bit of peace is visible. I do not claim that there is Jhinga Lala in my life and there is 100% greatness, but some peace is visible. If it is visible, then I have a little moral right to save your knowledge. If you see it,  There is a little confidence, a little pause, a little practical, a little coolness in my talk, now the heat is coming, look so fast in my talk, pause, calmness, coolness, peace, fun, enjoyment. If you are seeing some elements of relaxation, then you should listen to me and this is the test to be done. Put this test in the conversations of elders and tell me friend, you mean passive aggressive in everything, you did not say hello like this, you did not say good morning.  I did this or this in the morning, I didn't say Namaste, why didn't I say good morning, brother, I did n't feel like saying good morning, I couldn't sleep at night, I have a stomach ache, I am in a lot of pain, why is there so much pressure, this is how the English people say to say good morning to everyone. Good morning because their morning is not good. India is such a blessed country. Our every morning is good because we see good sun. We have good weather. Our weather is so gloomy. They have good morning.  Good morning, good morning, we have to do good, everything is good for us, good morning, good afternoon, good evening, everything is done, our country is very good, we do not need to do any hard work to do good, everything of ours is good, we have our own good dung.  They are doing just fine and that is the previous generation in it because there is no work, no, what is the work? Your children have grown up, studied, everything is done for them, now you have nothing to do except imparting knowledge to them, why doesn't anyone help them a little?  C Why don't you have a little discussion with them Why should a 1950s and 1960s burn parent is interacting with late 1970s 1980s and 1990s kids Why the conversation should be about the elderly The 1950s 6 Pa Ki mom how is your health how is yours now  The situation is only going to get worse from below. Why can't you talk about what's in your life? What's going on in the job? Do I need money? Should I send a mobile phone? What should I do with the SIM card? How am I enjoying? I had put pickles, it's good for you. Summers are coming now. I have prepared that for you and am sending it to you as aam panna.  I am sending you, she is a woman sitting with all the skill sets, no, we will not do this, these daughters-in-law do not do anything, we too, we too will not do anything, hey, daughters-in-law do not have any talent, so show your talent, what is your problem?  The daughter-in-law is somehow supporting herself, and she is somehow eating and drinking her own food. She is alive, it is a favor to your son, so you show your power, then expect from him how much he knows like a father-in-law.  What I mean is, it is like if you believe that you are a topper student of housewives, which I believe are women, I am speaking with respect and also taking out sugar, I am doing both the things, you are a topper student.  Women of 1950's and 1960's know everything about what the solution becomes, where it comes from, how to add tadka, tell me, please show me, give complete happiness to the next generation, you are someone's mother-in-law, so send your son-in-law. For some son-in-law, some people, daughter-in-law, some people, or queen Damaj ji, and giving this respect has stopped the next generation, the price lady has such a sense of entitlement.  We are sitting in this because it is 1950 and 1960, their parents were not born in independent India, they were born in slave India, of course, any child of 1950 or 60, his father would not be 12 years old, right.  So, they were born before 47, at that time they were poorer by default, had less education by default, so this generation dominated their parents too. This is what they have been doing for the last 50 years, they have been dominating the parents for 50-55 years and the parents folded their hands in front of them because brother, your product was so far ahead, you were illiterate, your child became an officer, your daughter did not know where to get married.  If you read, write, write, you will like it. Distinctly, this generation of 1950 and 1960 was much better than those who were born before independent India.  They had not even got independence and they had control, they were not able to give them much knowledge, they could give them something like I will decide and they did a lot of things, there was no denyer to them that only then the country moves forward, that is why today we have reached the off course. These people have done what, who is denying them, but Chaudhary Hut has come and worked hard, in a family, one man used to leave, whoever is listening to me, see, he may be your father, he may be that uncle of someone. He used to be my uncle, he is doing everyone's weddings, taking the whole family, but is not able to take that much of his family for some reason because it is the socialism type, isn't it the one where everyone became one, so everyone had those struggles.  I am admitting that those were the struggles, but Chaudhary Hut was also completed. When you used to come home, you used to get the feeling of earning money, now your same child is earning five times and 10 times more than you, he has no feeling at all.  When Bhauji used to come, food will be served in front, apply hot bread, slippers, water, apply this, do service like this, and all of you who are listening to me now as Youngster, will remember that father has come, meaning what are you doing father, yes, he is a clerk in the bank.  It does n't matter but respect is complete, today there is no respect. You come into the house, that is, there is no feeling that some king earns 5 lakhs, earns four lakhs, earns three. I am also addressing those who earn more and less.  Well, the poor guy has nothing to do with it, okay, that wife also came and sat here, I have also come to earn money, now you can pay for the rent or fight, okay, and he is a child, he is holding a hand in his hand.  He stood up, he grew up a little, he doesn't know anything, he is busy in his mobile phone, he is also not doing anything, you were still 151 years old, if you who are listening to me now, you are 30, 35, 40. Then  Also, perhaps he used to contribute some vegetables to the house and if not, he would keep a bottle of water in the fridge. Today's children do not even do this. Otherwise, children would not listen to the programs as per their parents' request.  This is the generation that sees that these children do n't even have a chance to do something, leave it to do, don't make us do it in the future, this is the greatness and the programs of the demands of our parents never end.  So, this is the remaining generation in between, whose fate has remained like this. I am here to save you, brothers and sisters, to give you the right perspective. See, you will neither be able to change your parents nor their  You will be able to change your desires by showing them a video, you can do that a little bit and that fight will happen, I will block you, I have subscribed to you many times, Hey Guruji, I had given you your video.  They say to mom, if you send it again, I will block you. I cause so much pain to the elders. Do I want to ask, am I saying wrong things? The next generation doesn't seem to be doing anything, this is the generation, it's okay, 2000 onwards, 96's.  Those who were born later and are the most crushed generation in between, who are thanking the 15 year olds for whatever they say, then I will organize a workshop to give them perspective.  One of my workshops on relationships was a big hit. Well, mostly it was about the wife and the man and the man and the woman. This was not a relationship, but I have to cover this one too because they also give pain. It is not that only men and women.  Women are giving pain to each other and husband and wife are giving pain, those packages are also coming from behind, okay, that's how it is originally, no one gets married, that yes, they will play pain and suffering, that pain comes from behind only, okay, that too.  I have to cover it further but if you want to watch the recording of that workshop and want to buy it, you can find it in the comment section, please buy it, you will get a good perspective. If you want to subscribe to the channel, then please subscribe the channel, the content is very good and the membership is enough. You will get to learn something and share this video. Thank you very much."

    "title": "Paisa & Sukoon ｜ Clarity For Youth Channel Membership ： Benefits Explained [aQ9sGwHLURo].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, Youth on Clarity will discuss about the exclusive membership of this YouTube channel. We have crossed it. You people had said that the fees should be kept close to Rs 500, do not keep more than that, I have kept less than Rs 500. You will know by pressing the join button.  We will discuss this What You Bill Get Membership is called Money and Peace, so if you remain a member then after being a member for four-five-six months, there will be increase in money in your life and  Peace of mind will increase. This is a tangible thing. Someone who has come to learn the alum balm type has done it like this. Both things will definitely increase. Before telling what are the benefits, there are five benefits, I would like to tell the requirements for those who want to take membership. These retirements are mostly done only then to take membership. Now there is no IIT IM exam. Anybody and everybody can take this exam to take membership.  Welcome but my suggestion is that your age should be between 18 to 35 years. If your age is above this then you want to give knowledge about war then you can also take second retirement. My suggestion is that you should be a person living in a big city. Boy, girl or in a big city, you need your honey, if it is not there then after all you will not be able to do so much. The third thing is related to the content. When I say top city i.e. top 30-40 shares of India, whatever are in the top 30.  Coming in, I am talking about 30-40 big lions, the third thing is that you want to give consultation, no matter who is your left side, but you want to make money from consultation because you make you consultants also, the fourth thing is that you want to give your communication.  Want to improve the skill, which bill help in doing. Point number three is the fifth most important. If you fail in this then please do not take membership.  The fifth point to take is that money is not important, if your belief system is that money is not important, then you can cut it like this. If your belief system is that everything is important, everything is important in life, Manish, debt is required, money is required, everything is important in life.  If this is a belief system because what I told earlier is to increase money and peace, then if money is important to you.  If not, then you are going somewhere then it is fine because what is the problem, why is peace added because many people are going for peace in order to earn money, this is also a fact, so both the things are needed for increase of money and also for peace.  Growth, this is yes, the sixth thing is if you want to improve the decision making process, you want a template, again and again you are living on the support of someone, how should this be done, brother, this is okay, that is okay, this is the job.  Okay this girl is okay this investment is okay this is always war confused so if you want a template to improve her decision making process so that you do n't have to take help of anyone's crutch then this membership will help you. Seventh and last thing if  You can be a sponge. Fixatives are not on the side of history. When you can, you can learn knowledge from templates with an open mind and where you laugh and laugh.  Let's fix things there, you are not the kind of person who is reading a book of one hundred pages, you are reading a very good book and on page number 48, something was written which you did not like, it disturbed you and 47  There was a lot of good in the page and there is going to be a lot of good in the coming 49 to 100 pages too but you don't stop reading the book, whatever is on the page you hook it but I also don't follow it or do it with him.  do not coincide and  You enjoy because you enjoy anything at any time, consistently, be it good food in a hotel, be it the shape of the cook, be a singer who sings to the people, hundred percent of it, everything is not always necessary, sometimes you will like a song, sometimes you will find some song bad, sometimes some tea will be bad.  Sometimes a dish will taste bad but if you are fat then you can walk like this then on this channel you know the five benefits which I want you tell minimum one you are workshop you get complimentary attend  You will get to do the work which other people will add by paying fees, it is 77 pieces, but you will get complimentary here in minimum but instead of one, two or three taxes can also be done. The promise is of one but even two or three taxes can be done and that is in these topics only.  But it will remain on these things which I discussed above, the journey of a job, the journey of relationship, communication, consultation and investment, things like money and all these, there will be different topics of jobs.  The topics will be like Doctor's Special Wagner, that workshop was conducted, next is my Lawyer's Plant, Engineer's Plant, every career is defending on, with that you will be able to know the important aspects of your career very well and you can also give this knowledge to others by giving the workshop.

Only the recording will be received automatically, you have to press the join button, to take membership, you will be added to the exclusive WhatsApp third explosive WhatsApp group that short note, do you want any information on this, is there any workshop, something.  If there is any activity then you will get expressway, it will be a very passive WhatsApp group, only admin can send message, nobody can see anybody's number, it is billed as a privately secured WhatsApp group, then it will be very good, fourth thing, what will be some of the best videos that come from them?  You will get early access and you will also get to contribute. You are billed as a full part of the journey in content making. On which topics do you want a video? On which topics do you need clarity, then you are billed.  Have date access and also from the middle of those videos and anyway and fifthly you will find in some exclusive videos some things which cannot be spoken in front of many people because maybe the society is not ready to share those things for the public right now. But the sensitive Bill B. N. Very below platform members Bill B. Lee and cannot forward any video to anyone, it is protected, only the one who has membership can see it, so these benefits will remain, whatever membership you all have.  Please tell me on the given WhatsApp number that you have taken the membership so that you can be added to the WhatsApp group, so let's begin this journey this month of Sawan, the energy is very good and it is the time to learn, it is a very hot special time.

So and the price is extremely low, meaning it is lower than your small veg pizza, it is okay, because you people had said that most of the students are students and are gangsters, so do not keep much money, do not keep it more than Rs 500, so I have kept it much below Rs 500.  I have kept it here so that everyone does not face any problem in taking it. Thank you very match."

    "title": "Paradox Of Success ｜ सफलता का विरोधाभास ｜  A Perspective Changing Video [mPaPsw5e2yw].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, D Paradox of Success, video will be in a little layer, it is okay, understanding success and understanding sadness will be a little layer, tell me what will be your take aways. Bringing up such an abstract topic, bringing up the HCF tax thinking seems very strong, I hope.  You will enjoy it, all the youth will identify it and you have to see what we can extract from it. Okay, I will give you its example. UPSC is a popular think in. India is fine, 20 lakh children in India are mothered by this Bana every year. Every year, Banna wakes up red. If this is okay, then out of these 20 lakh, 10 lakh children say that we should not be there, which is the application for P exam.  It is not only the exam, but the place is lost in the mother and the place in the mother is lost. Now the 10 people who are there, start the preparation, put in their applications, okay, so these 10 lakhs were there.  Those who did not do the tray at all, now they are not sad in the sense that yes, we had already taken out the delinquent in the tent, they started doing something else in complete peace, now these 10 people started putting in a lot of effort within themselves, seriously, okay?  They insisted too much, okay now that I gave 10 lakhs, when the exam date came and in the morning my mother raised three lakh people, they did not have any preparation, they did not have motivation, their Thane was 400 children.  Those who did not go to give the exam did not go to give 6 lakhs, now those who went to give 6 lakhs, this is the exam for those who did not go to give the exam, there is nothing for them, they will not pass, if they fail, there is nothing, they gave the exam, the result which will come is Rs. 15000 for Mains.  If they clear then those who have filed are more unhappy than those who did not go for the exam because they had to work very hard and did not get cleared but they are better than them as per law.  By doing work, not by desiring the result, but you should be destroyed by doing hard work, but you see what is happening, ideally speaking, I am someone, this doing should be butter, give someone a note, doing this should be true, so now let's move forward with the story that that 585  Those who did not go, such highways did not happen to us and they are seeing that those 4 lakh who did not go have something of their own going on, till now these 585 are still doing something.  Those who gave 15000 prelims, that money is gone, those who got cleared in mains, now they have cleared mains, three worth 3:30 thousand, those who have not cleared 12000, their sense of disappointment, sense of loss and sense of sadness, give more money to those who have cleared 500000 in prelims. Just imagine, if Mains is not cleared then Prelims is cleared and Prelims is cleared. 585000 were not cleared but Science was not cleared in your Mains. You have 12000 students and they are very sad. Now those who got 3000 interviews are selected in that. 869000 are all types of services and 202200 are not selected in these 20.  Now give more loss in this match, give more sorrow in this match, give more disappointment in this match, give more that  12000, those who did not clear mains, they have cleared mains, interview has not been cleared, now let's go to the selection, out of the 900 who have been selected, those who had entered this or IFSC, whatever, why did they not get the IPS which they had entered?  When he reached there, he thought of 20 lakhs, people thought of him, 10 lakhs applied for India, 6 lakhs went to give the exam, ₹585000 were withdrawn in RIMS. Out of only 15000, 12000 were removed. 3000 appeared in the interview. Out of 3000, 212200 were removed. They reached 900 but are still sad because now they have to get it and then prepare again. Whatever you know, they remain in the system but they  There is a lot of sadness factor and yearning factor, whereas if you look at it systematically, as you are progressing as you are clearing levels, it is like a game.  Have to play video games at level one, two, three, four, five, six, at a higher level, there is pain in life, actually there should be a sense of achievement that brother, I took care of my mother, I gave the exam, I passed, I did this, now those who are close to 180  Got this one, got this one, now went to Mussoorie, all of them should be happy, now who among them got a garden, Chhattisgarh Electricity, do you know, some, North East  Or no one has got this state, everything is equal but there is a complete race here too, this quarter system is run even after marriage, you people would know that you are a woman in Haryana, if any of your cards were late.  If you were from Tamil Nadu or someone from North East, then if you marry this woman then you will get this, then that one is also gone, now because life will be married to the right person and she has got the right order, if anything happens.  They also have satisfaction but not everyone's.  Sir, sex ratio also got the note correct, everything is done, when Badal started the job, my district did not get what I wanted, mother, like every status is different, there are some districts which are considered more butter.  It is said that if I become DC there or something like in Haryana, I feel that maybe it is Gurgaon, maybe I am also from Gurgaon or someone in it, maybe it is Noida, then Gautam Buddha Nagar district is fine, it can happen. that you know  There are some areas of jail inside every state and then the tenure of DC is also two and a half years, dead years, 2 years, 3 years, there is such a relief, if you do n't leave soon, then what is the job for 35 years, after that then the department is not right, political lineman is fine.  If you don't get it, then you don't enjoy it, then you are thinking that the sense of disappointment is reaching the level of joy. So what does this mean in life? Do something again, am I demotivating you? I have seen these people of mine sad like this, how do I tell people, I have to say that if your ocean of love is cleared, then you can join a good coaching institute, that is your achievement, if you have played Ranji Trophy.  Suppose it is your achievement, eat the bread of achievement, don't be disappointed that I did not get there, every person, every child who plays cricket, does not play for India, every person who plays for India also plays the game.  It is not necessary for him to play the shortest game, okay, some play five, some play three, some play series, some sit on the bench, do not get bowling, do not get batting, go around in three series, you know but brother. Cherish where you have reached. Its classical example is that in Olympics there is gold, there is silver, there is bronze, the one with gold is happy, it is okay that he got the gold, the one with bronze is also very happy that he got something, he would have come fourth. No one even knows the name of the Chadha on the podium. It is a big disappointment for the silver one. He doesn't feel like he feels that my gold is gone. Make the silver one to be sad because one of the D words is what I do, I am cup telling, I want you to spread actual happiness.  It does not mean that one should be happy, one does not become happy by being happy, one becomes happy with clarity, that is, what is happening, the silver one is butterier than the bronze one and the bronze one is as happy.  People with silver should be more happy than that, because this does not happen in case of silver but in bronze, in real life I told you this as an example, people always think about what I got next, it is not there for them, what could they get because they will say prelims. If you have cleared then what is the use, if you have cleared Mains then you are a very intelligent person, you can give very good coaching to you and they check when you go, they check whether you have cleared.  Did you lose a lot of money, three to five crore rupees, this butter is still teaching you how to gamble, okay those who won, you understand what I am saying today, I am telling you on the basis of example, in this I have solved your competition, I have solved UPSC.  I have ordered thinking, made clarity about what to do in life, done career consultation, everything that becomes good in life, now like I will tell you my example also, it is done like this on YouTube, I have a channel like this one.  But we are getting closer to ₹ 40000, 40 is more than 2 1/4 people, if I see, I don't know, people are sitting standing, that PewDiePie, that B store, I don't know, my curry is served, then I feel sad, I have never reached there.  I will get this much, but I have seen below also, I have seen that mother, if there are 10 crore YouTube channels, then one of my channels will be at the 40th, 50th, thousandth number and you will be at the 50th thousandth number.  After listening, it seems that at 50, ₹ 8 crores brother, 8 crores below, see how many of yours are there, how many views are there on social blood, impact ratings have come that what impact are you making on the society, so I am typing on Tik Tok from here. My view time is not going too much, someone is walking the dog to tease me like this, but if it has 10 lakh views, then I would be happy, it is a relief, if even 20-25000 comes, I would be happy.  If it is like this then I said Malika Arora ji's so 30 seconds, my watch time is 25 times more Malika Arora 25 30 times moon to I am also riching almost from watch time plus me content is the content sense it is giving you youth Give sensible concern to the nonsense content concept of YouTube releases, then the offerings will be distributed accordingly, Science U  Don't know the algorithm, you don't know anything, don't try to tell me, now I have clarity and knowledge, so I am not the only person who doesn't know what all this system of social media is like, how have you managed it? How will people think, what have you made, this much of yours is subscribed brother, it is solid, what is the standard of my subscribers, what is the standard of you people and those who are watching 10 lakhs?  You are watching and why are you watching, where will you reach and what are you watching and why are you watching, whom are you watching, that dog, the dog is singing cute, something else is singing, I don't know I don't want you make it something like someone But brother, that video of criticism was made by Malika Arora Ha ji. She was on her way and someone shot her like this. She gave her pulse, so I am not criticizing her. If someone makes a video of someone while walking, then what is his fault in that, okay?  but who  Who is watching what is happening, what is happening in whose life, we do not have to be sad, we all can go everywhere on this social media and here I want to help people a little, in the comment area you will find the subscribe group Vavinayak For this, there I will teach you this thing better that how you people, whatever you actually achieve in real life or achieve even a little bit, you can further spread the thought which is yours and which you understand. Have and you don't have you be disappointed date you have too rich hair only riching hair is very good n bin good ranji trophy players hoon bin very good coaches and de de aur meaning i bill tel you of an actor called chunky pandey ji chunky pandey  Yes, never top star, ok Pandey, which one is yours, what is his daughter's name, ok, tell me the name, sorry, it's ok, why am I yours, why not become a hero?

I also think, let's get this done, give us bill talk money.  D lower class bill talk money when you know rich class rich class whenever you meet each other give bill network give bill talk less give bill talk money business and if they talk anything else if and if they talk something on politics give bill talk ho  IT IMPACT THEIR BUSINESS AND WHAT THEY SHOULD DO  Middle class witch is you, this is me, audience is middle classes, cordiality is yours, I am telling you, and if it seems big then it felt big to write but it was fun because maybe what you are talking about is very important, if ladies talk then school will talk.  Did and studied. Those who are older will talk about politics, should you go to a park, the discussion being held in Dhaba is mostly middle class public parks, where like you will see from Hooda's park in Gurgaon, this kind of park is there in every city.  The small neighborhood where people come together and discuss a lot, discuss religion, save religion, save the country, talk about soldiers, talk about Putin, talk about Modi ji, talk about Rahul ji, do good by making it bigger and one After the meeting, I have seen the satisfaction on their faces, you see how much hard work I put in to bring contacts, you people think that I am just sitting here, hello friends, he can make anything by doing, it is not like this, you still have to work hard. I don't go there to take drone shots, I don't do video recording, but you tell me what I am telling you, you are identifying, not doing it. When he picks up from there after the meeting, there is such a sad look on his face.  There is satisfaction, even the cabinet of our country will not have that much decision, the decision is late, the cabinet of the country means do you know, Prime Minister and Minister, they also meet, everything is fine and some or the other decisions are taken and on those crops, it means the country is at risk.  If so, then they must be getting a satisfaction that we are doing so much good for the country. These people get more satisfaction than that that they don't know what child we have taken and what they have done, brother, if you say these things then where are you going to reach.  The story doesn't reach and then the middle class gets hit as much as the middle class is hit by the lower class and the rich class because what is the narrative of the middle class that whether the government helps the lower class or helps the rich, then brother you have the middle class.  Class has only two choices because middle class is on M. Middle class is on M. Misery m4 Miserable because this is what it is and money on M is okay so you don't need money. Many such videos of mine will keep coming. I will make one video.  I was trying to put it in but I was thinking that it will be completed and that then those people do not understand it as I understand it, people do not understand it but they do D and then it gets diluted so I am small  I will make such a video by doing this. If you are able to understand what I, the poet, am saying then listen to it. You will talk about whatever you want, it will have the same effect on your life the whole day. If you are talking like this then the country is in danger.  Religion is in danger, we are in danger, middle class is in danger, loot is in danger  The husband is gone, take this and class A is gone, the rich must have had fun, so you have only two choices, middle class, look and listen carefully, there are three, this is the lower class mother, take this middle class mother and this is the rich class, so you are this middle class. If you are middle class then it is ok, if you are mediocre then it is fun, if it is fun, then you are having fun. If you are not having fun, then throw you out of here, either become lower class or become rich class, these are the only two choices now.  You will not want to fill the lower class because your conscious conscience is so much awakened that you should also take it in actual and the class time is not that much, that is, it is a different thing while sitting under the tree and I have already told you about the different reasons of teasing.  I will also tell you further that the reason for teasing is to tease, so I don't even agree but I say that if you get irritated then do something to make an impact, then it should be right. What time do people of lower class wake up from sleep, what should I do or not?  You know, when I don't know what to do but he knows what to do, then why are you crying in his name? He wakes up at 4:30 in the morning, sometimes to deliver newspapers, and sometimes to put clothes on the car, and after that, he Jamaab gives him parcels from God and their Amazon, then he becomes the buyer of Zomato, then he does something else of his own, he learns it and he is ready to do whatever less he gets and does not talk unnecessarily like you, lower class.  I have seen these class people on motorcycles, I do n't like speaking class, poor, speak more, you will have to give an example somehow, you will have to tell who is the Zomato boy with C key on the motorcycle. When I found a washerman standing there, both of them were class brothers.  Okay, so now they do n't come and talk, they don't discuss religion and politics, what are they discussing? Friend, tell me one thing, no, the small elephant has been bought, how much did you buy it because he is a washerman.  What did the washerman do? To expand, he went to people's houses and picked up so many heavy clothes. He kept a small elephant, which is called Tata Ace. It is worth three-four lakhs. He also bought this.  The guy is saying to the ID that friend, I should do the social delivery like this to do something else because I carry so much in the motorcycle, I should do three-four like this, my packets will come more. My mind is going on there and what do you say friendly?  Neighborhood Spider-Man does it like this, the content does not come like this, do the clipping, like it, brother, what is happening among them, who is talking about what, who is talking about what, you are astrologer, I am astrologer, to tell the future, to make predictions, to see the horoscope, less  Isn't it 1 month, what do you do less and what do you talk about, what do you do? I will definitely tell you the future by looking at the horoscope and you all can become students. Can anyone tell you how this chart is divided? How is the horoscope like Rahu and Ketu, which zodiac sign is the ascendant, where is the Moon, some people's uterus, some people definitely don't have it, 1 month, come and write, with whom you meet, with whom do you talk, when do you wake up in the morning, what do you do, do this and yours  The future can be told. The future of the middle class can be told. The lower class can be told. You will have to look at the horoscope for that. You will have to look at the horoscope for the rich too. To tell the future of the middle class, I am middle class. Why so much? Friend, he is spending my consultation fee, it is mine, why is he spending 5 minutes? Just tell me, what time does he wake up, what time does he sit, what does he talk to, who does he talk to and what does he do and what have you seen on social media, take this for your future son. 5  Tell me in a minute and you too can become such an astrologer, I also make all the consultants, I make those who are my subscribers and members, you all know what you are doing, my friend, 24 hours a day.  Ladies are talking among themselves, they will talk about expenses. Wherever you meet middle class women, they will not talk about expenses. Where did you buy from? Where did you buy from? It is going very well. Where did you buy from? They will not talk about earning money, never will. I am not saying that don't talk at home friend, just talk about expenses, where did you go for a trip, took a photo, then expenses, hey, sometime talk about earning also, you have brought this Maheshwari from there, okay, you got it from Indore, good there.  it's just like this  Here, so many people of Rohtak do not know that the suits of Kutch are so cheap, there is a shop vacant there and now I will not do that to the poor shopkeeper, I am not kicking his stomach but that time is from you. Open some specialist shop on the story, take the society of the story, the ladies there are of high height, sister wears a big and neat suit, because the sister wears the same kind of suit as in Rohtak, when it looks good with the Bandhej suit.  If you ever see Rich talking, wherever you will get stuck, give bill, take consultation, give bill, no or do you know, can you help me in this, come, I have gone, number, you want this, okay, I am forwarding, hi, hello, I have gone this.  The problem is not like this, we have to talk among ourselves, this picture is bad, this religion is bad, this is good, this is big, not even the poor, sorry, the poor are still coming up, stay in the middle, those in the middle, no matter what they say.  Is it the washerman's dog, neither of the house nor of the ghat? It is a big statement that the elder mother will go, but the problem is that neither of the house nor of the ghat, so the middle one should be the middle one. If there are three children, then the middle one is a miserable relief.  If there is anyone then identify him, the elder one will be his boss, will beat and bully, I am the elder brother, the elder brother and the younger brother will get their own tempering that this one is younger, this one is younger and the middle one is the poor one.  There are many people who don't know, but the slightly elderly audience may be 30, 35, 40 years old, if you have three children, then the middle one is a poor child, it is such a relief that neither I nor I, the youngest name is the eldest, this is the middle class.  If you have a problem then I want to take you towards bridge class but for that you will learn how to break the believe system. What do you want to break then I will make a video, under the video I will give you templates and all that tailor made. Want to talk.  If that has to be done and if there can be a larger audience then there is a possibility of having a workshop on Sunday on this and it will be held in the month of June only. If I want to do it as per the schedule now, then you can write June. Whoever wants to attend the workshop, that's it. Live change should not be like this, caste comes first, whatever you see, the problem of middle class, what is the output, there is nothing, what are you getting in life, you don't want to change the input, brother, if you put a song in the machine, you will not get pomegranate juice. Want pomegranate juice, rich class, ok, if you want to drink pomegranate juice, then you will have to put a song, you will have to do a band, you will have to see brother, how much pomegranate do you get in line from the village and how much can you take from the village, if the whole class is not filled, then use less than half of the pomegranate juice.  I want to drink juice, Bhai Saheb, you are putting it in the song, it is not good, it is good, it is useless, I don't even get it. Will you change the input? Give respect to accidents, only that which is thought by the mother happens in life. If the mother does not think then it cannot happen. Sambdi hai tu think in your house. If Rajma is cooked the next day, then your wife or mother is the right Hajj, you are Rajma. Husband cannot speak at 8:00 after waking up in the morning. Those who have some basic cooking sense will understand that husband cannot speak at 8:00 for breakfast. Hey friend, please make rajma rice today. 8:00 Meaning, not only that, I had to tell you yesterday, every man has to think, give respect, the accident is not the head thought in the mother, but whatever happens, it is thought in someone's mother that it has to be done like this.  If such an agenda is to be had in someone's mother, then it means that the thought in the mother comes out of the tongue. My mother and my tongue, if thoughts are not just these things, then what is happening brother? Some people in the country have become lizards. I belong to the middle class, I am wearing a saree on Chhath, I have borne the burden of Chhath, if I think, I will be protected, religion, religious temple or other institutions which are different temples, class, caste, middle class caste, tell me, more poor people are going to the islands.  Is it like ringing the temple bell or is it my class or caste, how many times do you go in a year? Do you have to protect yourself? You have to do it on Twitter, you have to do it on WhatsApp, you have to do it in forward, the middle class is there and the actual energy is there. Look at that rich, you look at this, Sidhi MLA temple, this is yours, who are going to Mumbai, stand tall and see, you tell me, write down which class, you will see big photos, where do you go, yes, so much, so much of the middle class is going.  Are photos being taken? Yes, we went to Vaishno Devi once 8 years ago, then 9 years ago. Hey brother, I am saying 20 25 30 40 times in a year, how many times do you go to the mall, how many times do you go to the movie?  And whatever is your religious place, address the middle class and do not make it religious. This video makes me feel sad at times. Talk a little about anything, people start writing directly like by Gods, hey, I am mine, please subscribe to me, intelligent.  Don't increase me by saying such useless things that idiots say. You haven't understood it, it is not necessary that you have to see everything. If it suits you at all, then it will not be much otherwise you will not talk about it. I am talking that brother, you are yours.  Do it, wake up in the morning and do your routine. Whatever your routine is, you will sit and talk more. You are actually a religious person. I am an astrologer. I understand religion very, very well, what is good and bad and what is good, you should also remember this.  Whatever you say out of your mouth will roam in your mind and will any of your feelings be removed from it because it is not like you can say anything and get away with it, you are discussing the same thing all day long. Ho ho kahani mere reach kahenge rich class absorbed d lower class middle class am telling what do they talk and what you talkally different and if what you are not riching others where date men then what you are talking and discussing it yourself wherever 2  Middle class people are talking right and they talk. Oh brother, money is everything. All of them are retired or those who cannot work for money.  Let's talk, you don't like money, it will come to you, we don't have a job, we don't have a house, this house has become expensive, clothes will be expensive, inflation has caused a flood, all this has happened, we are not going to tell the story, the government has given it free too, give it.  Gave electricity for free, gave it to this person, gave it to him, if you have 100 crore rupees in your account, 10 crore rupees, 5 crore rupees, if you have even 2 crore rupees then it is a rock, what will I not take, then reduce it for that, otherwise that is less.  have to do it  It is not easy to cry, but why give electricity to it, our country will collapse, it will become Venezuela, you don't know economics, but he actually told through letters that it will happen, it is WhatsApp, he told that the sky has fallen, the sky has fallen, the sky has fallen, the sky has fallen.  They have asked about stepwells, are ours free too? DMK and Anna DMK have been giving these for 50 years. Tamil Nadu has the largest number of industries in India. Rewari is said to have been started in 5-10 years.  It is in 5-10-15 years, brother, it has been happening in your Tamil Nadu for 50 years. 96 minutes Color TV has increased. Study on it by sitting on Color TV for free. What is the difference in the psychology of people in the life of the post, how in the books. Hey every one.  What is the difference in giving a washing machine? What is the difference in giving a phone? What is the difference in giving a tablet? If you do this then you will become lazy. Well, you will become lazy. What do I tell you about ₹ 500?  If you do something then you will become lazy and your aspirations will not be awakened. This discussion you are having is bad, it gives you a temporary good feeling from inside that something has been taken out and then it turns you into butter permanently and then it destroys all of you and everything.  N classes are becoming the same, channels are attracting all the classes. Middle class got cut here, middle class got cut there, this got cut there. Hey brother, if demonetization happens then who is most in line?  I felt who was the most unhappy, whose jobs meant which one, who had gone. Just now your cobit had arrived, who was going in the trains, which class was going, which class's low occupations were going to be affected. You didn't cry so much that you were a rich class and  Have you ever seen the poor class earning as much as the middle class, because it means that the middle class only has the right to run, not the door class, the one who doesn't have time, doesn't have the luxury of run, which the middle class has and you don't know.  date run  There is no use in this, they make up their mind that starting from this encounter, here is the hurdle, you try to find the way out. The middle class is that which is like a tea bar, keep stirring it again and again and it will create a lot of storm, it will be a bitter poison. Even when you boil tea, there is a limit before the filter. There is a limit to boil it or I will turn it into a donkey, then drink it and say, friend, this is poison. You have turned your life into poison, this is how you boil your blood.  If you stay like that, you will become a donkey, become a pot, cholesterol will enter it, then there will be pain in the heart, this is happening in the middle, why are you doing this, why are you jealous, then what should you do if you become rich, then you will know what is rich and how much tax do you pay?  And how will you know how many lives are lost? The government will punish you. If you save wrongly, then you are being captured. You are paying tax. What do you say, ₹ 2 lakh per year, ₹ 300000 or 20000 or 4 lakh or  Five lakh more rupees were spent, I don't know what we gave, what was looted, see the maximum tax in this life by D. Top one day after tomorrow, maximum majority of D tax payers and those who file income tax returns, 50% pay zero tax. They don't know, those people go to the child, the tax goes to the child, I will tell the video in the future also, I will make this band on the one who is a tax saver and does not see his income, then there is no fun in it, there is relief instead of garbage.  What remains is to copy the content with a little effort so that there is no confusion because I have seen that my content is being copied, I am not that sad about it, but that content is copied okay, which is my original content, it is my original that even copying the messaging requires a lot of skill.  Easily because whatever content I am creating, I want to take you from here to here, whoever is listening, but the one who is creating, the one who copies, has no aim, he just ends up making this.  What he has to do is not to know the story, after that the next topic is not to catch the journey which I am taking, so if you are my subscriber till now then please subscribe the channel, like, comment and share, okay that's it.  These days, there will be practice of speaking quickly, if you like it, then you have to take me from here to here, brother, you don't have to show me the sign, even when Guru comes, after beating me with a laddu of name, he will go away, it will feel a bit bitter, but we do not say that you should give up your hand.  I don't want to leave my hand, now my hands will move here, Holia, cry a lot, friend, now I have to do it in the future also, I have to move ahead in life, if you are not getting this, then there is no one, if you go in search of TRAI, then I hope you guys will understand this. Will like, share, thank you very much"

    "title": "Private Jobs Analysed ｜ Circus Ka Sher [jBcfL_fN9is].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today we will discuss about private jobs, there will be a private job perspective, before this you must have seen one of my videos on government jobs, there will also be a little mention of government jobs, it will not be about private versus government, but we will look at the aspects when in the job market. Also we talk, we say that the practicality of private jobs versus government jobs is actually very less because if we look at the entire job market, government jobs are less than 1% and  If it is a private job or 99%, then here if it was 2018 and tan90 also, then there was no advantage in doing Bhishad Versus. The probability of getting a government job is 100%. The person who wants it can get it. Now what are people talking about in a private job? So you will have to give an exam, you will have to clear the post, you will have to appear in the merit list, only then you will have to do it and you know the competition in it, but in a private job, no one can do it.  It may seem that if you are thinking of getting a job here in your country and are not getting it, then you have to lower your level, then in the movement, if you had lowered your level, you would have got a job. No person can say that such a big country and so much less.  Yes, just like the tantrums in marriage, I will reduce the tantrums in getting a job too here. My father is a government officer, my father is a doctor, engineer, so many in corporate, what will the society do, will the world say that this is an issue, if there is no problem in getting a job. Similarly, my audience is mostly middle class, if you are also from floor class then you are most welcome but if a person adjusts by taking someone else, then here we will compare the jobs, the children who are coming from the lower class are the children of the poor. They do not have any issues in doing any kind of job and climbing up the ladder and those who are middle class, most of their children are continuing their preparation till the age of 28, 29, 30. And when you keep preparing for a government job for 8-10 years and you are not selected, then you are not eligible for any job even in private because you do not know what happened in the market in private in the last six, seven, eight years.  There is one thing that people compare in private jobs, look, I am going to give you a hint about one thing, the way of doing the job and you will understand all that also, people say no, yes, in private jobs, they suck blood, it is okay.  There is stress in a private job. There is a lot of comfort in a government job. I have talked to the government people and am in touch with those who work and are also unhappy with the private ones. In both the places, it has nothing to do with the person as to what he does in life and whom.  You come to life to bite the bullet, you come to have fun, you come to be happy, a little bit which is very rad, it's okay, he will be happy anywhere, private jobs are exploitative because your skill set is very ordinary.  At any time, someone else can be replaced who is not normally there in the government. No matter how it is in the government, be it stressful, normal, skilled, unskilled or busy, but he will come through the process only and the job is insured, that's all.  The thing is Adverise, which was my video from a government employee, please go and watch it. You will get to learn on your own what many government people have said in the comment section. Why would I criticize from my mouth, I do n't like it.  There you will find out for yourself that brother, who has seen the peacock dancing in the forest? There is a peacock dancing very beautifully in the forest. No one has seen it. The situation is quite like this. A government employee is equal to a lion in the zoo. Okay, I am not condemning it as an example.  I am telling you that there should not be any pain because what is the biggest problem, we need respect for a job in India, we do not need money, we actually do the job for money but we need it. You are understanding that we will not get money even for money.  If you don't get it, no one will do the job, okay, money is such an important thing, okay, you mean anywhere, money is so important, do n't you just throw money at the crossroads and start harassing those who are picking up the money, on the contrary, in a rude manner.  Start talking and make this a routine every day and people start coming there and listening to you, then you know what they will say, they will say, Hey brother, your heart is good, your tongue is like that, you give it wherever you get money. People are ready to compromise. It is a fact. Whether it is good or bad, it is also a fact. There is a lot of power in money. Well, in a government job, money becomes the captain. One has to wait for the commission on the eighth pay. The government says it will not come.  The economy has to be rocketed ahead but the capita income has to be increased, the government employees will feel behind and in the very good computer market, the people with education in the economy are getting it, but this is what  The advantage is that in the next 3 to 4 years it will get diluted and will reduce considerably and we work in private for 30-35 years, you listen, what is the problem that you are unhappy there because you want to do well in the job, whatever.  If you ask the private people then should we not do well in the job? How are you eating? Stop this yearning about doing something when you reach the job. You are the lion of the circus. When the ring master comes, he is the lion of the zoo and this is the government one.  One who has his own private job, what is there in a circus lion and he does not want you and makes you do it, the audience is happy, the tickets are sold well, the sale is genuine, then Sher Khan gets some good food and if he is not attracted  If he can't do it and there are no sales then he has to spend every day and he also travels but there is a link in the performance because there is no performance happening in Juwala and there is no incentive for performance there.  You just have to lie there, the physical public has to come and see, your physical presence is needed, there are many government jobs that require your physical presence from time to time, it is a desk, no matter what your job is, performance is a Monday in  If it is routine then you stay, it is a lion, you will get three times, you can enjoy it, but you will not get any excitement, still there is excitement in life, the crowd will come, today my ring master is happy, today is the performance.  It was very good, there will be a party tonight, so these are incentives also, yes, there is a risk factor too, there are many things, if you do a private job in such a way that it is a stepping stone, I will make something of that in the next videos because once you do all the things, Imagine that you studied in school which was towards something and college education was not college education. Many people turn private jobs into everything. You have to understand that even those who are on good posts. 45 46 years from now, where you will get force retirement, I never say that, there was a video of my retirement, I said that you have to bring retirement forward, in that I wrote a comment that in a private job, it is happening soon, brother, retirement is happening in the job.  Retirement, when you stop reducing, you stop earning money, now you are not a ventriloquist pony, I am in a corporate because this is what Indians are becoming, so what business should I do if not in the jungle?  You can become a lion of the jungle, this is not a business, where will you do business from, friend, 95% of people's notes, you are business without you, father, don't say, grandfather did it, if the family did not do it, then it cannot be a direct business, even less than B. You guys, there is a government job, there is a private job and there is a business and what is there, there is something else also, I will teach it in my Sunday 26th workshop, I have 10 more housewives and it is normal that they are less like this.  Digital Interconnect Solar System How can you do this in today's time? How can you become a jungle lion? What is a jungle lion? You have to hunt it yourself, no one will come and give it to you, but excitement can happen in life when you have to wake it up while sleeping.  Have to lift it and when it beats and is a devotee then there is excitement in life, you are not eating code, you are a lion, how is it made and if it is not made straight, it is not made so quickly, then in 21 22, when you  If you are doing a private job, you do not have to be exploited in the job there, you have to learn how any organization system works, how to speak politely, how to wear clothes, how to operate, what is politics, how to be harassed.  What is sorrow? What is pain? If you remain sitting at home then it remains sitting. When you take yourself out for any job, you will meet 10 people, 20 people, 50 people. This is a private job.  Very very natural and important first of all it is very easy Hey brother why are you looking for Rs 2 lakh Why are you looking for Rs 1 lakh You just search for Rs 40 thousand No you won't find it but Rs 40 seems less to me Yes then Rs 40  If you start then only you will reach one, that's why I am saying that lower classes are just catching up, they have no problem brother, we are doing less because father is a punch.  10 15-20 thousand people are poverty, whatever they do is upliftment, the tantrums of the middle class because they think that I will do less of this, this is not related to my education, there are also IIT people in India, there is no report yet.  Reset has also come, I had put it on Mani Control, okay, recently the report has come and by doing a non-core job, two things happen to an engineer, that's why those in computer science have very good salaries, the rest are your civil engineering, your mechanical.  Engineering is some other job, these are bridge builders, these are some of the college kids who are going to do it, you look at what you have done, you have done honey tax and in the core ones, the salary is also less due to enthusiasm, this is also a factor called why should I hold it.  If I wanted to add, then you have to see that there is no connection between the studies you are doing and the less you are doing, these people who are sitting on such a salary and position and have so many qualifications because this is a very big thing.  Mani caste  Isn't it in India, so if you have passed that too, you will see that he is an IIT engineer selling toothpaste, what is the link in that, the 4 years of engineering he completed, he should solve the problems of pulley, fear integration, all those coordinates, geometry and then  All that engineering study and all the practicals was to be sold to IIT, then for this, after studying so much, it comes from doing YouTube like this. Look, the saying among IT people is that you can do anything you can, they are Gates, they are hardworking.  Okay, the power of sitting and studying, the salary that IT people get is because they have the habit of sitting, studying and being combative for 16, 17, 18 hours. If you have the ability within yourself, then you will get IT.  There is no need to go, I am also telling you this, I am telling you from the job market and I am talking about the above posts, I am not talking about the people of Rs 10-20 thousand. This has happened in your personality, right? In the beginning you have to do less work and learn everything. You will feel that you are being exploited i.e. the money you are getting is less than what you feel you have done.  I am going to say that this is only an exploration and what else is it, every human being does this, if inside your house even your mother wants the maid to die from below and to die from below and not to die, remove it and die with the broom.  go here utensil  You have n't kept it outside yet, you will feel happy by keeping it inside, then don't keep it and go, you are waiting for 5 minutes. Look in your house, right, your own respected mother also exploits, maids are not exploited at all.  In this world, it will always be the intention of the person giving the money to exploit the women of the house earlier because those old women had the power that I will make you leave and I will reduce it myself, that is why I, the maid, also tolerated it.  they had  I knew that sir ji and badi madam have a lot of choices, but if not nowadays, then the game is all about demand and supply. Are you in a job where the supply is coming and there is no such special grid and  It is replaceable and does not require much training. Even if you are stuck in such a thing, exploitation will be all you need. If there is nothing else, then you should do exploitation for a few days so that you also learn because it is possible that tomorrow.  You will also have to do all these things, look, no one will explain or teach you through practical tea, everyone wants to be set, you will not be able to be set, this generation has given you what you are doing at 25, you will never ever know what I am doing at 45 and  What am I doing even at 35 and what am I doing even at 32? Those times are gone. The parents who became our brothers, our child is set. The definition and time of being set will have to be changed in the society.  And you will have to become a lion of the jungle. Multiple income, multiple work which you do and summary ask because what do you do less? You have the oil percentage because I reduce so much like this. What is this called lion of the jungle? I am the lion of the jungle.

I will tell you the procedure of how to do the registration, there are 7 best topics in it, you will also get to see them equivalent you should ok then you can do it comfortably, you will definitely benefit, please share this video with your people, private job  It is better to do a private job in 212 years than wasting 10 years. Do one, leave the second, do the third, get out of one half, do less good, do less bad, okay, meet people.  Meet boys, if you are a girl then meet girls, if a boy meets a girl then it will be a happening, at least you will not go into depression and you will go to the office, there are girls, there are boys, you will wear some clothes, you will shop wave, you will make a bun, it is okay, you will take a bath, you will give some fragrance, you will die.  You will do something to reduce all this, it will become your routine, you will wake up in the morning and go, now tell me how much money you are getting in that job, take your mother, father and mother.  You are living together and we are talking about a big city. Whatever city you are living in, what are the expenses? If you are living less than Rs. 40000, then all that is left is the food, father and mother are feeding their clothes, I am saying that when  If I haven't got married till then, then the period of 21, 22 to 25, 26 years is very happy, I just delay a little, nowadays I left and did not get a private job, saying that private job is not good, no job is good.  Let me tell you, tell me which job is good. People say that teacher's job is very good. This was started in 2006. His salary is some government and this and this. Ask him once, how good is it compared to loan, very good.  Then get started, it's not you, I can't get selected, I ca n't pass, or I don't have that qualification, then there are doors coming from far away places, everyone is being rubbed, ask the teachers of Haryana Government, if anyone from Haryana  She is a government teacher because I can't live without talking to her. Look at all this, in which jeep do I sit, in which village and where do I go to study, what will happen to them if the government does not do this on Saturday, Sunday. Do it today, today is that day, today is that day, today this is less, you are a government employee brother, you are not a teacher, not many people, nor are government people, how do people think that they are having fun, you are having fun, I am not agreeing. the your one  Posting in a place in a city where you don't want to live shakes up your life. You understand. In a private job, if your boss doesn't like you, it bothers you. You do n't like the environment. If you sit in the office every day, then  You can leave him, you can take the job somewhere else, if a person is trapped in a government job, if it is not very good, neither the boss can go nor you can go, you have to suffer for him, let him tell you and that situation is very complete for you.  You will spend time in managing your postings. This is not possible in a private job. If someone thinks that I want to do a job in Gurgaon, my house has been built, my family members are parents nearby, my wife has a committee of Rs. 40 thousand.  And we have managed the house, now whatever happens, I don't have to come anywhere, it will become a constant in your life, the variables will reduce, which I explained in detail in Happiness in 2 hours.  Explained in two and a half hours how to have more constancy in your life. The one who has all the variables in his life, the more uncertain his life position is, the more uncertain he will always be, the more anxiety, stress and the more distracted he will be. In the beginning, after that, figure out that you yourself are in the jungle.  Sher Cannot be done on time on first day job c ho d world works c ho people talk c ho people exploit c ho d customer care c ho you should behave c ho work  Place politics, whatever happens, teamwork happens and toxicity comes within the team, it doesn't come, let you release what is happening, you will start understanding everything from where this company makes its products, where is the sales, where is the margin, where are the sales.  There is franchise, there is distributorship, there is logistics, there is money, you will start seeing that yes man, where is this money coming from and how is it being made, then it will be a lot of fun, you people should attend that and that.  You are watching the video later, even after 26th is over, you can still connect with him because his workshop will be recorded, so you can watch the recording.

    "title": "PSU Banks Ki Naukri Ka Sach [tNVz0yrsYFY].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, the truth about jobs in Youth PSU Banks on a very important topic, although I am not making it up tomorrow, I am telling you the truth, you all have to watch this till further, this is a very important video, I am feeling a lot of consultation, one, two, three sounds is a normal thing. But one trade is clearly emerging among the many and one must see this if you are applying for a job in a PSU bank and if you are looking for a job in a PSU bank.  If you are having a lot of audience, then brother, write below in the comment area, Guruji, you have explained everything absolutely right, even if you say this, there must be some nonsense in what I am going to tell, keep your hand on your heart before writing, this thing is correct because tell.  It is very important, it is very important for the youth, I am from, do not apply in PSU banks, if you tick the eight things which I am going to tell you below, if you have been brought up in a big city, you live in a big city. nice house  If you are not from a poor family, then do not vote in PSC Bank. You will not be happy, you will not be happy, nothing will be left. If you want another thing, my wife should also be earning money, I should be supported, my wife should work and stay with me. In that bank, otherwise you will have to live separately. Someone is living in a village 180 kilometers away from Bareilly. There are postings at such small places. It is a bad situation, it is not like that even in big cities.  Brother, listen to him 90% 95% of the time you will get stuck in a bad place, sycophancy is the next thing that is important, if sycophancy is not done, caste is not there in the personality, it seems like why should I do it because I will have to do a lot, he is the only one, he is your biggest, not he is outside in private. Yes, even in private, tax has to be done everywhere in India but if you have come here then if this is also a thing then please don't come here, do n't come here in a small town with poor family.  Be it Mains or Mains, you will not feel much difference, you will feel fine here if you have got a good degree and finance people have done it from good colleges because you have passed the paper. If you are doing a private job then no matter how much money is invested in the story.  It is necessary to apply. Most of the fathers have no father. Dare, you are the one who is butter, just drive, you are sure, you have seen the comedy too, we have seen it, have you seen it in the court, what has happened, Gross has also not been in the government. very nice crowd e rakhi hai  I am telling you that in the movie Jawan, you saw it, sir, the bank guy comes and takes the loan tractor and goes to the lake. The reality is that the bankers reject the loan, their words do not want to do it, but it takes their soul out of them to reject it.  They have to live there with the villagers, life is not so easy, they come in shorts and take away the tractors and the farmers and common villagers there are so happy and poor, they have to live among them at any time at night.  t ho  Shakti is this, people are living in this stress factors, people live in this area, their children have to study there, all that is the thing, it is not very hunky dory, date is what I am trying, you are oil people, this is a very good thing, 75000  These have happened, there are delays in promotions, there is a lot of work pressure, there are forced targets which cannot be achieved, how many accounts should people open, how many people should they give life insurance to, and if  If you can give this much, brothers and sisters, then it is necessary to get a job here. Come, get your own insurance, make your own profile on LinkedIn, wear your suit-boot type and send the financial 50 thousand products that are available in your financial space. Now people.  They say no, there is no work, they are very stressed about this thing. You are in a small town which is seen in the movie, Kalinga Pong, someone is in North East and you live here, your story can also be posted in North East.  I am sitting here, my wife works in Gurgaon, so it is 180 km away from Nagpur. I don't know which one is the same. To reach there, it means why one has to go through the sugarcane fields. There are postings of such mean people and there they are.  It is said that if there is no work, then it would be a very good thing. If there is no work, then what will we do? Do people like to live in a big city, not work, earn more money and then have fun, watch movies, visit the mall, wear nice clothes?  Wear girlfriends and boyfriends, do photo ops, eat ice cream, eat food, then you understand that there is no work, but brother, what will you do sitting there, who will come to cook food, you don't have any system, there is not even a system, it is a big situation, is n't it, call him big.  It feels very bad that I have got a job with great difficulty. Today I went and got a job in the bank. You are calling this job like this. It feels very bad. I know that sometimes I come again and again and say that my audience is very defined. I am.  But people are like poverty line, it is also good, they are the audience of my channel, it is big, I have also told about the money, told about the middle class, told about the definition, told about the income, but brother, the public is the public, they like things. But those who come from poor families are also crying because ultimately if you have a job in a bank for 7-8-10 years, then you are no longer poor because you have used the money, you are ahead in the middle class, but then your life.  I have nothing  Children story education is not good posting inside small lions sister is not ready to come relative is not ready there dream and all the others if you live in her settings then you bill be surrounded by people am not your calliper ek vice kehna mere ko vote nahi  If you need someone then it is not necessary for you to be politically correct. You will fill everything with a small amount. Hey sir, you are sitting like this, you are not having any fun with them, your knowledge is not being generated. Yes, what growth is coming in your life, will it be incremented, will it increase, if there is some job of 60 70 75000, then after studying a little, it will become 8090 thousand ₹ 1 lakh, then one day you will become a manager, many years are spent and so much.  This is politics, isn't it? People are crying tears of blood for promotions for postings in PSU bank jobs and those who are working in their PS are not required to write the name of the bank.  When I told the banks about PSC in particular, they said that now it is not found in this one, this one is mine, this one has the same story in all of them, that the color is complete nonsense, today when so many people have got the light, only then they will understand that this one is  Why is there frustration among the bank people which we keep seeing many times when we go to government banks, why should they stay because just sit with them properly and talk to them for one or two hours, if you will not fully believe me many times, because it has been made. Maybe there are many people commenting too  Do it but you don't say, I don't know if they are from the bank or not, so brother, go and talk to the bank people in your relatives and friends circle and whatever else because you will get a job, whatever test will be conducted, job will be conducted, interview will be conducted, it will be very big here.  They will pick you up and throw you here for further posting in the city and then your struggle is East Struggle is struggle only struggle and then you will see the marks of such life emerging - two five plus eight and you whatever your desires were ever if you are at this level.  Yes, if the PSU is at this level i.e. in a big city, it is fine, mother, you are earning money, you have done it from a decent school, it is ok, English medium, big school, true school, English speaking and your opinion is that this is the situation here.  Your LinkedIn, your branding, your image, the more hard work you put in here, the more hard work you put in, by building your brand, three times it, five times the money, work, people, you will live in a big city, you will live in a good place, you will have fun, you will see some growth here.  There is no growth in money, there is nothing, there is nothing mental, there is no mental growth, there is nothing, so now that security should be given to those people who are very insecure, for whom absolutely every kind of work has been done for them.  Well, now people will say, no one has to do this, hey, I am addressing the audience by doing it to my subscribers, who is my subscriber base, who is my coordination, not for him.  If it is for you then you are not my audience, I am also telling this and by the way, it is good to listen to my words. If you have subscribed then you are trying to run away. It is not my intention, but I have come to tell you about a person from a small town in Samastipur.  There is relief, okay, there is relief in Munger, there is big palla, there is not much problem in going to Motihari, now we are in Motihari, now that is in Gurgaon, has anyone read pal, there is palla in Delhi, in Mumbai, in Pune, where is the big Motihari?  Ashu Where is Supaul district? People have to go to Chhindwara, Madhya Pradesh, Polo, Bhopal, third after Indore, if there is a GK test, then I don't know the city, Maharashtra. If I ask, Maharashtra is such a big state, then yes, it is Mumbai, yes, it is Pune, and tell me, it is Nagpur.  Yes and Chauth Chauth, then you will know Jaipur yes and Udaipur yes yes Jaisalmer, let's go to Jaisalmer, let's go to Jodhpur, oh brother, the one from Ude, the one from Sirohi, both will go, ok, it is understandable.  Does he have food and drink brother, he will come. What will your Kolkata man do? He will go to Jhunjhunu and play jhunjhunu. It is very difficult. I do n't know where to get the lottery. I don't know where to get the uniform and after getting it, it is not small and then why many years are spent, then let's say now.  What should we do brother, now we can't do anything because you people are not going even a little because you don't know anything ahead and by living in these lions among small lions, now you can achieve big and some extreme growth in life at any time.  You can't do it, this is also a fact, your confidence will end because in the beginning all the energy is fun, then the work gets cut off and then there are bribes in the mobile that come on, this mobile too is not visible to anyone in the city.  Look, we are from a real world, so if you are finding yourself in this situation, you can connect with me, try to extract this power that I have told you, from such 650 districts, sleep like this.  So  There are 300 people, no one is ready to go there, the world is living there, it does n't matter to those who are born in Aavah Y-Environment, but you, sir, were not interested in the story but were of the clean type, so you go here, this note is worth giving it to.  Jobs up pass it note it is ok you have gone to bharuch bharuch bharuch in gujarat then there is also a bharaich up there all that is ok i do n't even know which one is where this one is ok  Which train will I catch, then how will I go, then how will I come, then which bus will be, meaning all the modes of transport, I will go to my bank for my life, where do you live. Do you understand transport, you mean it can be a ship, it can be a train, it can be power, then a bus.  Also there is power, then which one is below the bus, then the below one means you can get rich till the bullock cart also in some cases if note that rickshaw means you can reach that level, I am giving clarity, my work is motivation and giving.  You don't have to give motivation. If you understand the point then either try something brother, if it doesn't happen then try it. If it happens, then cross check. You can call 50 people and ask, and my comment is on the comment area.  I have brothers in PSU banks, you will do good to others, they will say, then why don't you leave, this is the problem, in India, people are crying in weddings, people are crying in jobs, it is not even a small Chhath, because Chhath's questions.  If it is possible, then once you take him to task then it is not so easy to leave, it is a job worth Rs 75-80 thousand lakhs, if it is a government job then it makes a big difference, then please write in the comment area, thank you very much."

    "title": "Rent Vs Buy Debate ｜ Full Clarity Given [Jkfg4PS1mWw].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, the always popular debate rent versus buy will be settled once and for all and you will get clarity from India's number one clarity giver before anyone doubts it, if anyone wants proof that I am the number one clarity giver then today the proof as well  I am going to give a discussion on rent versus buy, we will discuss house property, the youth will get clarity, you will find my two and a half year old video in the comment section, look on YouTube, I cannot make it 0 years old and many people have also seen my video, that two and a half years old, April  There is a video of 21, you can see it in the comment section, I had made a prediction about the property and in two and a half years the same thing has happened and all these fin influences which are increasing are fine, two-four are main in the first few and they also increase rapidly, it is a good thing  Hey, they are spreading all these misconceptions, I will answer them in their seven points, once and for all again because many people are connected to me and say, friend, tell me the answer to this, counter attack, counter action, entire youtube2, it is easy to tell, finance with sharan, he is against the rent  one somebody  There is someone like Sahil, there is someone like Sinha, there is Ankur Warku ji, there is Akshay Srivastava, there are mamma tune changes, I am telling you by name, okay and there are others also, there are financial people, there are many other people, rest you can add the names, 101, these are there along with it  The answer to all those videos of his is that you have clarity, I will tell you very well on seven points, but first of all I will tell them that people are crying after following his advice, those who have been doing it for two and a half years, what all things have gone but still Along with these, I will tell you in points, first of all, a house is not an emotional decision, buying a mutual fund is an emotional decision, buying a house is not an emotional decision, buying a house is a strong decision, I ask you brothers to do a SIP of Rs 10, 20,000 in mutual funds  Sisters, is it an easy thing or a difficult thing or is buying a house a more difficult thing, then of course you will say yes brother buying a house is a difficult thing, of course because SIP is 10 20 30  Make it 40, buying a house is very difficult for anyone, this is the generation that does not want to do difficult things, commitment is not there, even getting married is not easy, but it is difficult, if you give the option of living-in, people will run away from SIP.  Give her the option, she will run away, there is something to be done and if you hear the old stories about its confirmation, then I will unravel each and every thing, I will unravel all the points, the video will be a little long but there are so many videos on this and so much discussion, so many articles, so many  There is discussion on discussion groups, every single thing that they say, every single thing they tell, I will explain it in this way and that and even then I will not say that equity and share market is bad, I am not going to do this versus that. Haryana  They are the ones who eat rasgulla as well as kheer, it is not just one bowl, they eat both the items because this creates a problem of and versus which one is better, so I will tell you the method in that way that doing exercise in life, eating good food, maintaining relationships  Work hard, these are all difficult things  Easy things are their escape routes, so commitment is needed, yes, you know how strong financial discipline becomes, your commitment has started, so now you will work properly and will not break your duty, you know that at the end of it  you will get it and its calculation now the second thing is that you say hey where is your job the second thing of yours will keep changing then will you do it by taking a house do you not know that yours is more important I am in Gurgaon village I have got a job in Gurgaon I have a house  I bought it and I don't have to pay rent. Now if I have to go to Bangalore, this rent will be added to the rent of the house, I will pay rent there. This is my arbitrage, my hedge happened, English, whatever you want to do, do it. Rent was more here, it was less there and here.  It was less there and more there, something happened, something happened there in my inflationary times, it is something like you gave a car to someone here and took someone else's car on rent there and gave it on rent here, like this  Look who told you that  You will never be able to settle for a job and will your home come to the country? Do you need to go for a job if you already have a home? Can't you take the same job in a bigger city? How much percentage jump should you get in the package?  I am for you to leave the city, maybe your wife has a job here, maybe your children are studying in school, maybe your parents have an ecosystem beyond this, and a detailed video can be made that can go out  It is not even necessary, the third thing is the most important, Maths Evolved, I will teach it very simply, I will not tell you any Excel or Fuss, even if you know Maths of fifth or sixth class, you will understand, I will explain it so simply, you always ask, you get 3, you get three, brother, in Gurgaon  So in many places the rental interest is at 4%, but if you say 3, then I will accept 3 for 3 only. I will not use any of my superlatives to prove my point like you people do because your interest rate is always at 10.  They never diminish  Still I will tell you, there is a house worth ₹1, you are getting rent of ₹3 per year, rental is ok, very nice, then you should not buy it, okay this is the story, yes you should not buy it because you will get this much there, you will get this much here  You will get this much, the story is oh brother, in 7 to 9 years that thing worth ₹1 becomes worth 200 and that rent becomes of ₹ but the rent of ₹ after 8 years and 9 years then tell the story that brother there is a house worth ₹2000000  The rent is ₹ 3 only but should it not be taken, yes we should not take it, you told it well, then another 89 years of time passes, a thing worth ₹ 200 becomes ₹ 400, a thing worth ₹ 200 will become ₹ 400 and the rent which was ₹ becomes ₹ 1  Now the ₹ is gone and there is 400% again brother, how should you take it, you should see this now  They will say that if something has doubled in 16 years, then this is not a return on 10 or 12. Hey, count the rental also, that is 3, so count the starting price of 3.25, 3.54, that too is big for the person who bought the original.  He bought it for 6 rupees and it became 12 rupees, no no, that is at today's price, oh brother, today he bought a flat in Janakpuri in 1988-89 for Rs. 1 lakh, its annual rent comes to 45 lakh, so his rental is 175 rupees  D is there no no no we will not calculate like this it is worth one and a half crore today so I will do it for today this is just psychology this is all this is just an illusion of maths because any person thinks for 30 years no wealth creation real estate is for wealth creation this  You are in this pursuit of income and that one Sinha who sells it like this in Bihar, you sell it, why sell it, sell the property  What will you do then, go and visit Switzerland. You have bought a good flat from Manwan Construction, it has a life of 100 and a quarter years, you have bought it, it is running well, it is giving good rent, why do you want to sell it, it is all about cash, are you using ITC?  The shares which you have bought at cheap rates, whose dividend is due for you today at 15, those which were bought at your rate, let's say today's dividend is at 4, then what will you do by selling them, NHPC, you had raised it at 12144, if today its dividend is 3  It is at 4, it is at 5 for you, so it is at 20, why should you sell it, it is held there for 20 years to get returns from mutual funds and share market, people want returns from real estate in 3 years and 2 years to get real estate Why don't you calculate it for 20 years? This maths which is evolved is very bad and there is a simple thing in this maths which is called leverage in English. Today you have to watch this complete video and forward it to people because  This debate should be settled somewhere. I am saying it again and again on every point that equity and mutual fund are extremely great things but it does not mean that real estate has become bad. It is not necessary for something to be bad for something to be good and both  I will tell you at the end how to use it and I will tell you one very big advantage, I will tell you two advantages which till date no one has even mentioned in the discussion because arguments are there in peer groups, they are there everywhere, okay so  Leverage Leverage If I buy a real estate by taking a loan of 90% by paying a down payment of 10% and it increases by 10%, then I get 10% i.e. ₹10 lakh if ​​I want to invest in the stock market.  So where is the leverage? Leverage in futures option is 10, 15, 20 days settlement expiry, you can make a little profit in it or you can also get completely ruined in it and you should not do that, you guys know that otherwise if on delivery based basis  You are buying mutual fund units, you are buying your shares, if you are buying it for 1 lakh, then you are buying it for 1 lakh only, even if it gives 100% return, then it is only on 1 lakh, you cannot do it like this with the bank Go to any reputed bank and tell that bank that I want to buy a property, it will give you a loan for the property at 80, 85, 90 and tell that bank that I want to buy shares of your bank, give me a loan, see how much loan it gives, ask it  They have the power to ask about the shares of their banks which they are running on their own, go and ask these equity guys, there is one Kamat ji who runs this Zerodha, if you go to him again and again, he will always set his cut, I am an MPI guy also  I am an ARN, you can mistake me, we do all the things, 70-80 percent of the work, take everything, this as well, this as well, today I am doing education, there are a lot of advertisements of your financial products in the mainstream media, so someone  The real estate guy doesn't come and tell me Story: His goods are selling as usual, there is a fire, he says leave it, let them say whatever they say, it is okay, collect the mutual funds, you will buy a house in 20 years, otherwise what will you do with him brother 22 2  If you do not buy mutual funds in 24 years, then they tell you to buy the same house in 40-42 years, no, buy that, then you can buy it later and even your father will not be able to buy it, your child will not be able to buy it in the family of the city  Then go inside and stay 40 kilometers away, yes you can take it outside, it is open, they have ruined you people and no one can say anything against them because see where the two years of rate and rent went and the property went but today  If you ask them about the rent, the rent has increased by almost 60-70% in the last two years, check anywhere in big cities and the property price has also increased by the same amount, so the rental amount is still the same, brother, if the numeration has increased, the denominator has also increased, so the number Denominate  The answer is the same, so the logic which they had for two years, see, that logic will always remain the same, look at the graph, the graph will keep moving like this, the numerator will increase, the denominator will increase, their logic will remain the same, among them there are Kamra ji or one or two, they would say that I am a real estate  I do it, I share the knowledge with you that you people should do this, with your own money which I earn, by taking all the courses and all the knowledge, I buy real estate myself, if someone says this, I am sad about it, I have respect for them, I only say clear cut things, so this is the lesson  Okay brother, I will tell you further, the fourth thing is fear, hey, you will not get it, it is under construction, it got ruined, it got ruined in Noida, firstly Noida Greater Noida has created fear of real estate in entire India, no one has any uncle, maternal uncle or paternal uncle, if you are in North  If you are an Indian or any relative who is not trapped in Greater Nada, but you tell me that we cannot compare real estate with equity. If you are buying penny stocks, if you are playing futures options, if you are buying random things, then your money is invested in the stock market.  You also get trapped in it and get ruined. You bought Asian Paints in the stock market. Okay, you bought Hindustan You bought Unilever, where did you incur the loss, tell me when did it happen, now you will buy speculative stocks of poor quality builders and such penny stocks, every time you will give examples of poor quality ones in your real estate and your brothers are getting ruined in the stock market  People are getting ruined in real estate as well, people are becoming very rich in real estate, people are getting rich in stock market as well, people are getting rich in both the places, who said that it means show it selectively here, there is inside cow, by shining and that too this  He runs a fund mand, okay he is saying that my mother's tenant has not paid the rent, so the real estate is bad, that means if any unruly person issues your corporate governance, you can take Dewan Housing Finance Limited or Allen FS.  Look, these stocks which have been ruined at some time, not just one but thousands of companies have gone down by thousands of crores, then that is bound to happen, if you did not do your due diligence and the tenant did this, then you should have seen that there is a problem in Gurgaon.  that this boy and girl live in  They do not last, the tenants leave within eight months, that means it is difficult to take out and keep them, so everything is happening here as well, there is an example, if you are a fund manager, there will be this problem in your mother's house, then now you can invest your liquidity  We will keep it because liquidity is very important, liquidity is very important, by making such money first of all the person who invests liquid money in the share market does not earn any money, the money which remains lying in the market for 10-15-20 years is the one who will earn, this nugget has come out, nugget has come out, nugget has come out This target has come out, this target that all these do cos are there, no, no, to earn money, they themselves told me that the market has gone up, now get out, now put it in, now get out, now its target, now its target, hey, is it a good stock, good company, let's go.  It is increasing at 12 15 20, keep lying in it, put this target and get out, you have to earn brokerage only, you have to earn brokerage only, tell me one thing, I ask the mutual fund people, you are a mutual fund, one guy invested money in you  every year you  You take it at Rs. 2 after the fund management expenses, it's okay, you take the expenses yourself, okay, if someone invests in property, someone gets him a house, then he takes brokerage at Rs. 1, does he take it at Rs. 2 every year and if you invest Rs. 100  If the mutual fund has made it 96, then money will be invested even on 96, if it is made 110, then money will be invested on that too, you always have to earn money, so the direct way for you to earn money is to always put that money here, always put it here, you have to tell the story  it is that brother always keep this always keep this then you will earn money because only when there is always money then only you will earn money you are understanding you are understanding that when the money remains lying under any pretext then because I have to keep taking out 2 rupees from it always  You have to keep taking out the money from inside the house, someone is taking out your house like this, you have bought the plot, bought the house, built the house, done something, who is taking out the money from that, if I get you a house and come every year, knock knock sir  2 but why give it to me? Hey, last year he didn't get me a house, you could have given it to me if I had asked.  I had given it last time, did n't I say that I will give it this year as well sir, it is always a must to give, once you got me a house worth one crore, now it has become worth 1 crore 20 lakhs, your house is still being built and next year when the amount increases further, then it will happen  Even if it decreases I will come, I will come every year sir you understand I am not talking much at all I am giving examples rent can also be invested in mutual funds once the asset becomes yours let's move ahead okay this is the benefit which  I am going to tell you that no one would have ever told you how to buy a house quickly, when you buy a house quickly, how can you buy it in 23, 24, 25, 23, 24, you don't have the money, I will teach you that too, inside the comment section, you will find my real estate telegram group  If you do not join, I also have my real estate channel, you should subscribe to that too, I teach these things and bring live opportunities, there is no need to spend in the wedding, neither the girl's family nor the boy's family has spent half the money on the flat, 50, 60, 70 lakhs  all in the wedding  Look how much they spend, they buy such expensive jewellery, they keep it in a locker or in the mother-in-law's cupboard, everything can be bought if there is intention, and if there is no intention, the children will buy it, we have just done everything, many people should take advice  People are saying thank you to those who bought it for their children, now the child cannot buy a house when he is in college, he has to play SIP when he gets a job but if you have bought it for him or have bought it earlier, then You just gave him support, then took a loan from him and transferred the property in his name, but you kept the handkerchief first and the property increased by 203 lakhs and your child or your family got the benefit of it, but this as a family is not a thing  I am not doing the thought process, 40 to 50 percent of people are busy playing mutual funds. 2 lakh, 4 lakh and 5 lakh and they sit everyday and watch their money control pay and post, portfolio increased, decreased, increased, decreased and this financial money is being consumed.  They keep doing it all the time because that porn is being consumed by the youth  Youngsters, teens, early 20s, 40s, men are making financial pawns. It has increased or decreased repeatedly. Yes, buying a house is a confirmation bias. You cannot buy a house. You don't want to buy it. You do n't have money. Whatever the logic is, you will listen to them. Counterview  It will be painful to listen, so I am just telling all the counter points, there is one more aspect which I want to tell, the sixth aspect is a great relief for the wife, the wife will never tell you hey husband you can leave because he is 40 years old and he is 42  The 37 rupee note has dripped, he has gone to the gym, the boss is giving him stress, what will I do with your mutual fund portfolio, 12 lakh, 20 lakh, 30 lakh, 50 lakh, is there anyone among you who has not bought a house and his mutual fund and  The stock market portfolio has become worth Rs. 2.5 crores, it is very rare, it is very rare, they are earning a lot of money, it is very easy for them, it is very easy for Kamat ji, now you have a company worth thousands of crores, you have to take it home  You can live anywhere you want, you will show this to prove your point that story I believe in this story but you have your own house, a nice big one, where all the family members live, no one tells you this 121 141 161 Stock brokers have single storey houses and all the promoters of these big companies also buy their own houses when they sell shares. You can be one of the biggest promoters of big companies.  I'm just forgetting that there are 100 houses in the US, 100 houses Sibu, Sibu, I think the name Sibu is if I'm not sure, they kept selling their shares because the stock did not rise for long, they know the company from within, what to do with whom  He bought his own stocks, okay, it will be a great relief for the wife, the biggest relief in the family too is the house, it is not an emotional decision for her, when you take an insurance policy, term insurance, is buying term insurance an emotional decision you Answer and it is a practical decision because unfortunately cases come to me, they bring demat, they come but that is not there, my husband had invested in 100 places, he does not have a house, which one to sell, where to sell, some are lying in demat form  Some have hard copies, some are missing, some are here, there are 10 bank accounts, they have created a mess and that house is not there, then the last point is the most important point, the seventh point, today brother, marriage is not happening without a house, so people say why to get married  Yes, if you don't want to do it then people in mutual funds are not getting married without a home, today I am talking about the middle class, I am talking about the upper middle class, they are saying that brother we should have a home somewhere, where will our daughter go home  If not, then the person who has been working for 10 years is saying that he is doing mutual funds and neither the mutual funds are visible nor the house is visible, the house is security, the house is safety, the house is everything and the one who took the house in 23, 24, 25 years  He took the loan at the age of 35  After becoming free and the owner of the house, you can show your eyes to the boss at work. Are you sitting scared of the boss? Why are you most scared of the job at 40? Of getting fired from the job because you do n't have a house yet because of that mutual fund. You are sitting with Rs 30-40 lakh and you know that you are not getting anywhere with it, and you got fired from the job, then you know that at this age you may not get it again and this is your helplessness that is being exploited because you are following  Some advice why you can't make multiple properties when multiple properties yes I had made one with Robert Gayo Saki that was a big hit but I will tell you exactly that the one with Robert Osaki does very fast churning in the US but in India also the cycle is a little  Even after growing up, how can you make 4-5 properties in 20 years? If you want that video, I will make it in future so that they get a reply and those property experts will invest it in mutual funds. Just imagine that in 1988 in Janakpuri, if someone  Brothers and sisters, he took a loan and put Rs. 50,000 in it. The loan gets repaid in six to seven to six years. Every time they do the calculation for 20 years and show it to you. Take the data of any bank from hdfcfund.com. Get almost all you can  Go for another property by using leverage and it can happen in India. I will explain it in a different way, you should understand this thing once and for all. Please read the real story, it will be in a link, subscribe to that channel. You will see it very soon, next weekend only.  Meaning whenever you are watching this video, within a week within a week I will bring that thing for you, within in one week I will bring it live that brother here is your financial planner on 6 7, they say high percentage on 3 and money  Yours will also go in three to four years. Cheap property in top location of top builder in every respect and rental at Rs. 6-7, you are cash flow positive on day one. Here the property increases your cash flow positive, leverage is also not too high and loan also  Very  Not much and then again you can go for property, I will give a live example, what is the point of people coming and speaking like this by giving this arbitrary example because what is the problem, they are in finance, only in finance, so they get that thing  Speaker brother why not everything, why can't you just imagine if the person in Janakpuri, which I am repeatedly taking as an example, the DDA flat in Janakpur, when he repaid his loan up to Rs 9596 in a year, then if he started getting that much rent  Brothers and sisters, if he had started investing in mutual funds and would have been investing till date, then in 2023, not only this, he has taken capital appreciation of the flat which may have been stagnating for 5 years because it has become old, but his mutual fund  Think about the level to which the fund money must have reached by investing in SIP. Why don't you do this exercise on Excel that in 96 its rent was 000, then it became three to four today  Suppose the rent is Rs. 35,000 to Rs. 40,000, so if I assume the average rent of Rs. 22,000 in the formula and put the return of Rs. 12 in your mutual fund, then it will be Rs. 12,000. Now see how much is there in the market and it will always come because you have generated income in the long term, but who thinks so much like this, who will think for 25 years, you are 25 years old, I will tell you this here, 5000, 7000 crores will come, crores have got no inflation  What will go where, it has no meaning, if someone had told you in 96 that it would be 23 crores per crore, I do n't know what you would have thought and today see what has happened, so this is what is the message to you, please subscribe to this channel and subscribe to real estate.  Do this which is my pure real estate channel where in I bring opportunity in top seven cities of the country top seven shares you know  Which country has real time real estate opportunities in it, I bring you that real estate telegram group, you can join it and that video which I mentioned in the beginning, whoever doubts that I call myself Clarity One and I am not that when you You will have to spend time watching that video because you have a doubt that I am not number one, I told you that if you don't have any doubt then don't watch it, but if you do then you want to watch me, you have explained it in such a lovely way, with so many examples.  Yes and the same thing of play out of demand supply which I had explained with such a nice example, so I will do my own clapping, you also do my clapping yourself, I am doing it with proof and you should watch this video today also, how will it happen in future if  Brothers and sisters, you want a prediction for the next two and a half years like I did in that because the situation has changed now, but what is the future outlook for the next two and a half years, then I will make a video again but for that you have to give me a little respect and honour.  come on we need it come on that song  Again, you will have to give a little feeling of a rockstar, I will have to give some feeling, increase the likes and give the feeling that I want Guruji, I want the counter attack, it was very good, what kind of a counter attack was it, so put it in like this, the adrenaline increases a bit, hey, due to dopamine, everything will rot  If it happens, okay then get it done, tell me all the examples that I gave, it is wrong, during Covid, the tenants had come to know the reality, they were sitting with 50, 60, 70, 80 lakhs, that is why this real estate also ran away because now this was an emotional decision, emotions happen.  My wife told me that the tenants would have to be Covid positive if they even entered inside. The treatment of the house owner was different in the society during Covid and that of the tenants was different and the tenants were not so poor. I am giving you the example of a society in Gurgaon. I am a good salary, three, three, four lakhs, two and a half, three, four lakhs, this much salary is normal in Gurgaon and give them treatment, got was ask them only after that like  Hey, Covid has come, we are the first one to book, so this pattern should be real, you should know everything, life design assist on Excel, I say it again and again, there is no benefit in Excel, you can only see the cash flow in Excel, you can do the analysis of the company  Discounted cash flow and all that happens. You cannot guess anything here. Life is a cricket match. The run rate can be anywhere. It can be 120 or 180 or even 350.  So I hope you guys will share this and like it, thank you very much"

    "title": "Sandeep Maheshwari  Vs Acharya Prashant ｜ Clarity On Fake Guru Debate [YPKA72BK3Uk].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, you must have seen a recent video of the top YouTuber and the things that both of them talked about and many other things that they do, you know that I also keep on messaging, so I am making the video because of my subscribers.  I got many messages saying that if this has happened, Sandeep Maheshwari ji, who is in this, does not even take the name of Acharya Prashant because everyone understands whose name it is, so people were telling me, Guruji, you are very good.  If you are happy, then I am going to give clarity on the same thing. Sandeep ji also thinks in my opinion that some people follow the team because there is a middle class person, then this one is that one, I feel that there can be misunderstanding too, happy misunderstanding too, whatever you want to say.  It is possible but I would like to give clarity on this, I will give it very well so that it will be understood very well. First of all, I want to tell all my subscribers that my people do higher order thinking and generally the rest. Forward or anyway, if someone says something against someone, I recently made a video, brother, you should blow your own stomach, don't panic at all, do n't panic at all, Modi ji, Rahul ji, Rahul ji, Modi ji, why are you so nervous?  Don't be afraid, people will come and say, what is okay, what is okay, no delay, absolutely okay, it is not even ours, all this influence will influence, it is not there in the old times, but thousands of years ago or being French.  During Sia's time and this was what happened in Europe or the intellectuals or Aristotle or Socrates or in India it was called Shastra in India, there were some people who used to discuss among themselves and that discussion is very good for the society, very good, very good.  What is being shown and explained is much better than those who keep discussing only about religion, religion and all these things on politics. You have those debates with the nine PMs and all that. Brother, it is a very good thing to be with them, so neither should the audience be angry with Sandeep Maheshwari ji, nor should the audience be angry with Acharya Prashant ji, nor should they be angry with people like me. You are talking like this, it is important what are you doing and whose is it?  Whose side do you think has logic, what do you enjoy, what is it, that is a different topic, but this time, like last time I did Sandeep Maheshwari Vivek Bindra, Vivek Bindra ji's army did not come for Sandeep Maheshwari ji.  This is a fact because it seemed to them that it was not that much and maybe they are taking money but this time the video made by Sandeep Maheshwari which was made just a day ago, my thoughts in the comment section of it when this video  Probably 11 12 Haj comments have come. It seems that Acharya Prashant ji's idol is very big, but I want to give clarity here that this should not happen. Do not fight for someone's idol like this.  It is my power, I was saying this, do not throw any influence and it is like this, Guru ji, this is also not very good, Sandeep Maheshwari ji's last seven videos because the business series he was running had flopped, then Vivek Bindra.  If Ji's scam was done then the views increased and in the last seven videos he is exposing all the meaning, as you say, he is exposing the world and if he continues like this, then if the children who follow him then they will come from home.  We will stop going out because there is danger of something going wrong everywhere and India has to be careful. Life is natural and should be lived. Am I very reluctant that I know what Acharya Prashant ji used to say and what he said?  What were my views, but whatever knowledge Sandeep Maheshwari ji gave is very superficial knowledge, he gives it like a normal teacher or any child, you should not go along with every person who gives you a sweet pill, you should not do this at this level.  What is the problem, this is the problem, I will also take the name of many YouTubers and talk about their messaging and this is us as YouTube2, we do not have that among ourselves, I do not want to speak personally in this, as if I felt bad about one thing, Sandhi Maheshwari herself was very touching.  Can someone please say something to him, even a short rant is very touching, it is fine, but here he is speaking only in the name of Acharya Prashant, everyone knows that it is his name only, so what if you say it?  The problem is so that the understanding becomes clear, someone is telling them that if you are not married, then what do you know, it becomes a little below the belt, it becomes a little below the belt that it is not necessary to know the current only after receiving the current.  It seems to be the meaning of marriage. If we look at it, even today and earlier too, many of the people who run this country and those who run the states are not married, so you tell them that you do not know how to run a family, how will you run the country? You don't know how to run a family, there is no logic in why you will run a foreign country, that is, if you yourself are not a doctor, then a doctor woman is talking about common sense that eating this can cause upset stomach, one should not do this, however, it is necessary to do something. Every person is a Chartered Accountant, Architect, Lawyer and Doctor and how can it be like this, but since we can still talk, then this argument of theirs is not right, it is enough for them and their videos as soon as that video starts, right?  They take it themselves and Fake Guruji means they have made the children stand, I don't know what kind of format this is that by doing yes yes like this, they do not fill the stand up com with laughter by force, now as I am making the video, now this  Technology is not being used anywhere in the video to divert your attention because he himself says that he changes the mind set when he runs the ad and then the program, so you too, something similar is happening here too. he got the kids to sit  They are asking, but you promote them and take them in that direction because you have done the preparation for the same, so make a simple video like this, people listen like this also, people listen like this also, one eighth, ninth, tenth Dhruv Marathi has caught the children of 11th, 12th and BA first year students. Sandeep Maheshwari has caught those who are not getting a job or are not getting married.  Two people, Vivek Bindra ji, who takes the business, and the other one, who is not able to be there, then his Acharya Prashant, who has the consciousness, intelligence and discretion, only then these are three crores each, but I am there, I am also one, now I will say, yours is Chutku Channel 2 lakhs.  You are not happening after all this, hey, you are not happening now, you will happen in the future, you are making this video for your views, yes yes, I am making it for my views, every user makes videos for views, like every politician does whatever.  have votes  A businessman does it for profit and like you, mostly those who are employed sell their time for money, the rest are standing in the queue, buy my time, buy mine, buy mine, give me a job, give me a job.  If you make it then don't interweave a motive, it is okay, what is being told here is logical, enjoy it, I have a great video of mine going to be released in 48 hours of this video, I think what will be the topic, it was already shot.  Ok youth and all the lofty talks are going to get a lot of clarity. What is the problem? Youth need clarity, not motivation. We have to tell them that brother, this is the world, it is confused like this, these wires are entangled like this in the world. Can someone please clear it like this?  Ca n't give it for you but can show you that this is the complexity of life, it is not a thing that if you get married then it is okay, if you don't then it is okay, as if one should believe in a simple God.  No, God should be believed, God does not exist, God does not exist, it is a very simple question, but what is said, it happens in many things that if you believe in this thing, then it will be better or not. Many times, if there are two choices like to marry or not, then at the society level, I have made many videos earlier also - Some people are not meant for marriage and If they marry, people are also not meant for marriage then. The clash happens that out of two, one should be meant for marriage. This is also one. Very clear videos have already been made on this and I will keep making more for you people, but because of this clash of the two,  If yes, then I will definitely say this to Acharya Prashant, although you can say that he is my competitor or he is different in ideology or who is morality and who is shellack, I will not take his name, Professor, he was son noir.  What do you say, these are all the English words, okay, that's how I consider myself to be Shellac Holmes, okay, every man should be the hero of his own story in his own life, so even though he is like that, I would say one thing to those who  He also has consistency of thoughts. Those thoughts may be questionable but there is consistency in the athlete's messaging. It is not like that of Sandeep Maheshwari, PK Lotte's work is dependent on him. What is the situation that such consistency of logic should be enough, which one is good, Sandeep Maheshwari is good, Acharya Prashant is good or someone else is good or I am good, I also talk about a test which can take you somewhere, make you travel somewhere. It is good which takes you forward and has logic because all are coming from philosophy. Now what is modern day? No books are being written and in India at all they are not being written for the 21st century.  Philosopher, because the world has become so dynamic that if you use the word philosophy, if you use the word idol, then if you use the word ideal, then the word gets attached to politics and religion. What happens is that talking about life in this way is a truth or something.  It is not happening, okay some people are doing it but there is a lot of discussion on this thing, I call it mental massage of your brain, if it is mental then the answer is in this domain.  When you listen to me, listen to Sandeep Maheshwari ji, whether you listen to Acharya Prashant or anyone else, then do not come in conflict and take sides, be relaxed, first of all, you have not taken the contract of our houses and our organizations and the way of running those things.  As for him, he doesn't even need anyone, he will take care of everything, so now I did not like the personal thing of Sandesh Maheshwari against anyone who comes to the comment section, but Acharya Prashant ji who  Followers are sitting here and they are writing nasty things in the comment section of Sandi Maheshwari. You did not like it either. And that I am the noise of Acharya Prashant ji, even those who are themselves would not like it. If you accept that you like my words or  I think I am a very knowledgeable person, so if you are a follower, if you like someone then why will you misbehave, will that person be endorsed in politics? What is happening unfortunately is that In politics, a leader cannot go and tell his followers not to misbehave because he feels that votes will be lost and he does not maintain a higher moral ground. The same problem is being faced by Kats too. Now let us assume that you are a very good subscriber of mine and you are here very much.  If you write dirty words then I am not going to approve it from Sandeep Maheshwari or Acharya Prashant I am not going to feel happy this is why I am on my record.  I am telling you but the same thing is not happening in today's discourse, be it political discourse or religion or creator's, if someone becomes your devotee and he speaks very forcefully against it, then it feels good that we are among them.  We have to avoid this, those who are genuine creators, who are giving knowledge, who are giving wisdom, who are giving philosophy, have to try to influence the society.  They have to come out and call out this. I feel that Acharya Prashant ji will give his answer on this matter, according to his thought process, it is okay and he will tell all these people, not to do this, now one more thing on this.  And I argue what is normal, I have also seen them in the comment section, I saw that I followed them, I got good benefit, that is the journey of life, at some stage you will follow Acharya Prashant, it would be better to follow Sandhi Maheshwari at some stage.  There is nothing worth following, so he is my go-round and which one is up and down, what is this called a swing, the one who does it like this, right, that makes sense, isn't it, it is like this, it is like this, there is something above.  No, there is very superficial knowledge, the same thing cannot be said about Acharya Prashant. You cannot call Acharya Prashant and say that your knowledge is nothing, brother, I know what he says. Now what would he have said and taken away, that could be an issue for debate, so if I mean, if I have to talk to someone and have to debate or I like to come on someone's platform and talk, then I will choose Acharya Prashant I.  Will Never Choose Sandesh Maheshwari is very shopper knowledge which is called if you have read what is shopper knowledge, the concept is very superficial and very for children that this is not right, that is not right. No, don't do it like this, don't do it that way, don't do this, so I personally feel that if a question should be asked then everyone's follower should have all the questions, then the way I do the question is like now, my bandwidth is too much.  If yes, then I question the financial influencers also. Akshay Srivastava wise, in the name of others, because if the main two are going on, then questioning the messaging should not be.  There should not be any fault in it, it is okay, then this Acharya Prashant ji is okay, then I did not take any side of Vivek Pindra ji that I am a big fan because people said, hey, you also do like this, he is selling, listen.  Look, no one means no one is that great, okay, and Sandhi Maheshwari, if you add the subscribers of all these people, they become several crores, okay, if there is anyone else about whom you want clarity, then tell me because I am now  come  I will give clarity even beyond this, I never say that someone 's cause is superior or for my own benefit I say that everything is for a noble cause, but even in that noble cause, there can be something wrong, just like your own mother comes and says, 'Son, yours'  For the good, daughter, for your good, there can be a problem in that good also, so when there can be a problem with the mother and the father, then why can't it be with the influencers, I am coming and questioning the same. I am not giving ulterior motive, I am saying that whatever Sandhi Maheshwari is doing, it is in his heart, he is doing it for the betterment of the society and the world, for the betterment of his country or the world, perhaps Charya Prashant is also like this.  Vivek Bindra is also doing the same, Waraku ji is also doing the same, Akshat is also doing the same, he is doing everything right from his side, but in the process of doing everything right, things can go wrong as I told in the example.  That it may be your mother and father's brother, your mother and father's genuine desire to do something good for you may also be flawed, there would be someone to question it, right? When I come there, I come to question their messages to the messenger.  Que means you should not do it ever. That is the English proverb 'Never shoot the messenger'. Reply to the message that yes, this is its messaging and I wish it would come to us a little bit.  There is a lot of negativity in political discourse also, if people make fun there then one should laugh a little, it is okay if you are a top politician but it creates too much of an animistic atmosphere, it is not good for the country, so I want to mentally prepare my subscribers.  That brother, when this conflating comes to you, enjoy it, Hrithik's picture is coming, Shahrukh's is coming, Aamir's is coming, Salman's is coming, why are you fighting with John as to whom you want to see and whom you want to watch? Away, I am saying go for take away in your life, as far as I feel, whatever I tell you, every friend is important at every life stage, of every kind, it can be messaging, you were in some zone, he was in that zone.  The things seemed right to you, seemed suitable, you liked them but you moved ahead in life, wisdom came in your life, then you did different truths and my mostly subscriber base which is following me very closely, they are the people above 36  Because till now till 35, you feel that you have figured out, it turns out that after 36, when Saturn happens, then I had to create five channels to give different messaging to each one and all that.  The source of all my five channels is the same, that light is the same, wherever that knowledge is coming from, I don't even quote much, people would quote it anyway, it is written here in that chapter, chapter number 100 verse.  Number two, it will take effort to do it like this, I know how much two and a half to three to four minutes it will take for someone like me to memorize one verse, okay then I will come here and memorize it and if I take the help of editing, it will become easier but I am not that.  What is M is to tell easily, what is M is not to show one's knowledge to others, what is M is to open the notes of your life, am I capable of opening the mental notes, wherever notes are made in such a way, open them, open those which are  human being  Open your mental notes, it should be the number one influencer in your life, whatever is opening, if yours is opening and you can follow it and it remains relevant, the solution is to never just call anything bad, like Sandeep Maheshwari has suggested.  Like I have made videos in every video, now it is very easy to say that a marriage is good, bad, not good, it should be good, it does not happen and counting her more virtues and taking her towards her, because I am like a mother-in-law.  Don't say daughter-in-law's serials, it's not Ekta Kapoor's work, but like I make videos of mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, no woman is even making men, leave it to men, it's okay, mother-in-law's serials, family's conflicts, I started bringing all these things up, now big ones.  I do n't believe that Sandeep Maheshwari, the team of YouTube, tries to copy my content after watching my direct content. As far as I know, they have teams and those teams keep roaming around, wondering from where to what.  If it is relevant, then in general my messaging got a voice which I too had been speaking against the thought process of Acharya Prashant for many days and years, so I got that voice, okay, so I liked it, I see Acharya Prashant ji.  Beyond that, what will you answer, what will you say, but the way it was told was very superficial, this is the problem in the content of Sandeep Maheshwari ji, no one brings anything from somewhere and leaves it there.  They go, do not lead anywhere, are not on any journey, are random, do something like this and make something middle class, what they did to me and that is enough, what is the definition of middle class, they are earning money, they are not earning, they are original, my content is for everyone.  Do you know that youtube0 with 10 lakh 15 lakh subscribers also copied it and I am happy that the athlete started talking about it because the original person will come and claim it any time because  I did n't do it with you because there is a date, although there is copyright here and I don't like doing all this so that I kill her, then they set it from the example of India, it is like that it is fine but there are many things which are absolutely cut.  If you copy and paste it, it's okay, if there is an issue there, then the biggest take away from this video and for the subscribers in general is that don't be sad after coming to the conference, get different messaging comfortably.  Look, in life, taste the sweet, it's okay, taste the sour, it's okay, it's like sour water, sweet water and Gol Gappa, it's okay, taste the spicy ness, taste the salty, taste all the flavors, don't sit holding on, no, only sweet is good.  No, only sour is good, no, this is bad, no, everyone enjoy, everyone is bringing something or the other, I am bringing some of my sweetness, okay and all the things which are like this, I am bringing from my side, you guys.  For Tell me how are you feeling and if you are watching Age A Forward then subscribe, I too am above 2 lakhs, bring subscribers, there are only a few left, there are not many left, at least become above 2 lakhs, I too will become one one day.  Everyone's time comes, inflection point comes, someone increases subscribers by doing ads, someone does not give ads, does he increase subscribers by sitting on high moral ground, I am not among both, I am following fine.  But I say in organic that brothers and sisters, please increase it, please no, I don't like it, I do n't like it, when it becomes two and a half crores, I too will not say anything to increase it, I will also come into the attitude of 'I am style', listen to me, now I am like this, that Like a small leader, brothers and sisters, please, if you want to win the MP election, give 2 lakh votes, it is okay, 8000 or 9000 are left, increase it. You will see so many people in this video, increase it one by one. And whoever increases it, write plus one, I will be satisfied, it will increase to 500, 1000, 2000, 10000, now so many people will watch the video, increase the subscribers from your friends, mom and dad, whoever you want to increase, then you will enjoy till the end of this video, if 2 My second video will be released in 48 hours. After 48 hours, two days. If you are watching this video, then go and watch that too. Youth and Uchi.  high words thank you very much"

    "title": "Should Indian Youth Look To Go Abroad ？ [qHvI_o50Ltk].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, one question which is asked to me a lot is by the youth Guruji, should I go abroad or should I not go? So should you go abroad and should you not go, there is a discussion beyond that, my view point is also off late due to many reasons.  What has changed are my sources, I do webinars, workshops and consult NRIs. I consult many NRIs.  There are marital disputes, there is recording of property, there is regarding investment, there are very detailed discussions and after consultation, there is a chit chat of 10 to 155 minutes asking what is going on and all and many a network. I am very interested in that, I have done research for this question in the last six months before making the video and now I am telling you this video as per July 2024 because dynamic  When things change in the world, then this answer has to be understood in a good sense, the answer to every question is not the same, the answer to each question is different depending on who you are, sometimes what happens is that should I go abroad, so I am sharing the video here.  If yes then dozen means that it is a for everybody it will the answer will depend on first of all who you are so let's discuss who you can be  Who are you who want to go abroad? Who can you be? You can be from a poor family, you can be from a very poor family, you can be from a middle class family, you can be from a rich family, these are the four five parameters which are the rich people.  They know everything, they do not need consultation, they all have a set pattern, their father also went to college, they also know that people like Ake belong to political parties, they will come and go, they have a lot of them, they have that system, okay, I would like to address here.  To the core audience which is the middle class, if you are ultra poor then like you are going but the only thing I would say is don't go on the dinky route, go in a clean manner is a better thing so in the middle class my new take is now Chot I have started telling people that if you are hearing that you should go to a foreign country, which country to go and how to go will be a topic of discussion but definitely go because you will earn more money from India and the quality of life will be better from India. Don't start putting patriotism in it, especially friends who can't go like I am, I still have a lot of reasons for not being able to go, but if I get to go or get to stay or the place gets cleared then there is no such problem for me if you see this.  No, you have to do Namaskar only to friends, like Dhruv Rathi ji, he is doing it sitting in Germany, okay then go and do it friend, do it anywhere, friends, you have to do Namaskar, this is a sofa, brother, in Gurgaon, in Rohtak. In Jind In Dubai In Switzerland In Zori In New York How does it make a difference for most of the stuff Ch I do infact all the stuff Chch I do a dozen make a difference Ok I will explain my case study separately to you guys sometime but why A Youngster Should Go Let's discuss beyond that, it is better to prepare for the exam in India between 21 to 35 years than going to a foreign country or a developed country.  Go and struggle with one eye, important people always make it a medium of study and come with four or five countries, one is US, one is popular, one is Australia, one is Canada and one and a half is some other country, if you count, then you are not able to go there.  Then give up the dream of going. I am saying that a country like Tajikistan, I talked about it, like I will have to take the exam of some, now it does not come in this circuit, this circuit is Australia, Singapore, US Canada, children go there also.  Own  They are earning very good money by going to travel agency and are very happy and that is enough, I am not telling you exactly about one country, I am telling you that you can go anywhere, open your survey, open your eyes and ears, I want one crore. If our children go in the next two years, the biggest benefit will be that these 1 crore children who go in two years will invite 4 crore more children in the next three years because one child is linked to at least four children.  f in the terms  Off Kinship Cousins ​​Brothers Sisters Younger and Elder Plus Friends Everyone has one or two close friends and at least two brothers and sisters. I am telling you by mixing cousins, like close cousins, maybe there will be only one, but if you add cousins ​​then you will have four.  If these 5 crore children of India go away, then 20 crore people will benefit because there are four people in every family, so there will be a per capita benefit on GDP. Look at the story of Kerala. This is the model of Kerala.  Today there is no industry in Kerala, no manufacturing, there is a tourist system, everything is going on like this outside the Middle East and there is no harm in it because the Indian government will come and say no, this is not the case and there is no employment in India. And it's better that you go out in your 20s because once you're married with kids it becomes difficult muh utha ke aisi  It is not possible when you are in If you are listening to me if you are 21 22 23 24 25 30 then your parents are 55 56 years old meaning they are young your father may still not have retired from his  Job If You Are Less Than 30 And Your Mother Is Also Relatively Younger She Does Not Have Diseases  If you have come, you are not married, if they can support you, then the experience from outside will definitely be useful. I am not saying at all that you should leave the country, do not look back and settle there. I am saying that today's  During the day, if I board a bus from Sector 17, Chandigarh, to reach Gurgaon, I have to come to Delhi via Delhi Bus Stand, it takes seven to eight hours from there, the distance is nothing, fast bus also runs but there is jam in between.  The bus gets stuck even if there is a stand and stops and it takes so much time. It seems that I have measured it, that is why I am saying that if my Chandigarh Gurgaon is ready in seven-eight hours, then brother, if I can come from London in such a late time, then what is the problem?  It is only a game of money, time wise, where is the distance? Today, see the country from far away, how far is it. If you are coming to Delhi by train from Bangalore, then reach in more time, or not in too much time.  Compared to any place in the world, if you come to Jha Sehi, you cannot come there by train, then the concept of this is far away should be removed because the whole game is of tickets and money, it is okay if you do not come every day, then at least every day.  If someone does not come from Bangalore then it is okay so there is no need to worry about going but there should be a plan that I will go and do it. It is not necessary to get a job but you can go and search for it and work and many people have said this to me.  Discussion takes place with the core group and with other people, some people say that youngsters say this, they say that India is so good, everything is cooked, Zomato comes to the house, time is saved, maid comes, time is saved, I am also like this.  I used to think about the benefits but when you talk to a lot of people, sometimes it does n't work to think of yourself as a fool. I consider myself very smart, but I find that a good thing about me is that I do n't consider others as fools. Understanding you is always a good thing, if you get to learn something from others, that is also a very good thing, so when others told me this, I too used to say the same, Guruji, tell me one thing, your time gets saved, how much time would have been saved. I said, what is left for me, but the world says, I only eat a little from the cook's hand, do a little special thing, but I let's leave, the gentry are left, those who order, say let's save it, they say yours is one and a half, two and a half.  Hour  Where does the traffic go in jams and to which account it goes, it is said that we have so much open work here, in most of the places there is almost everywhere where a person himself wants to walk, go shopping, eat and do all that and in that he will get exercise in the same.  There will be entertainment in it, the work of eating is also done in our country, the video which is being made now, it is the time of rains, you can watch it, going to work, going to a job, going to an outing, liquor, watching a movie, liquor, eating at home.  It is better if it comes only on paper, if it is put in the mouth, it is better then brother, the air is not good, the water is not good, the electricity is not known, such medical issue, crowd everywhere, garbage everywhere, fighting in the parking lot, all the troubles. Hey, do n't call us unpatriotic.  Go brother, I am making a patriot, go out, earn money, make India rich, prepare for exams in India, which of your India is getting rich, if it is happening, then tell me, you are not doing anything, tomorrow you will earn four paisa, you will give one paisa at home.  There will be a trickle down effect somewhere, if you invest the money somewhere, the native will become rich. Why should the people of Kerala go there, they have made Kerala poor, they say God Zone Country, stagnation is stagnation, it is fun, Gujaratis have made Gujarat rich, go out.  Some of our belts are such where there is some problem, many people have started leaving from Haryana, that is why I have heard of people leaving from Haryana, donkey route and all these dangerous things are also happening.  Because don't know me, hey, don't go to US, go to some other country, then go there, go to US from there, this is also a matter, what is the matter, there is no one to tell me, the problem is this, Guru, so I am here in the video like this.  I am not going to tell you that you are in Dublin or that one in Ireland. I am not going to tell you that yes you have to go where you have to go, there are some countries in the left side of Iceland, Ireland or the rest of Western Africa, like this, people are going everywhere there.  Are  Those who have figured out, go to Spain, go to Greece, go to some country, India, I am telling you, listen, brother, 204 countries are clear cut from India, 100 countries are better, follow some criteria, I am not saying to go and visit all the forests of Africa.  I am not saying and the rest of Syria and Varia are not saying to go. Okay, I am not saying to go to Iran and Iraq. I am okay, I am saying to go to North Korea, but if you remove all these countries then you will also remove many.  Out of these, you will get a choice of 100 countries. Out of that 100, remove those who are in your top 15, America, Japan, where you don't know how many visa lines are there, still 85 countries are left. If you zero down on those 85, then your work will be fine.  You will get 10 countries, in that also you have to go to only one place and in that, what is this game of networking, Gujaratis are the best, they go to New Zealand, this is working there, what is it doing?  Those communities which have not been set up, those communities where no one from the family has gone, they have hesitations, that is why I am saying, remove this hesitation somehow and make up your mind that it will always be possible to tell the parents to the parents.  There is no plan, if I keep preparing for exams here from 21 to 35 and I do n't get a job, then I will cry over the reservation, but life does not get better by crying about it, so many people would rather come here because if not from here.  If I go, I am seeing the youth, the testosterone level is very high, brother, the people of Punjab and Haryana will either go drunk or there will be law and order issues because no matter what a man does, he can become spiritual in 25 years, if he does not get a job, he will not get married.  Bad or just try to go out somewhere because people have requirements there and go there, these days there is only one basic skill which becomes very useful at the phone level, this app and this will save your money.  Because if a child is coming to Gurgaon these days or is going to a big city, then he has nothing left in Rs 35,40,50,60,000 and he is living in a squalor like in Bangalore, there is traffic in Bangalore.  This is garbage, there is nothing left, so brother, stay outside in a clean place, do some work there, do networking, chances of doing better are more and that is learning.  If you come to India or come with a degree, or if you have gone with a degree or if you come with experience, then its value will also be there, I don't have any reason for that, see, you can at least attempt for the 5th year of your life, if you do n't pass, then come back.  Then prepare for the exam because here people are so engrossed in exam preparation that they don't realize when the transition from 21 to 27 and 27 to 32 has happened, so I am saying. From 21 to 27, go somewhere else, then from 27, come back here and do some struggle, it is your home, father is there, maybe once and in 30 and all parents have grown older, you want to come back here, is there any responsibility because if Brother, I am not able to meet you here because earlier my take was, don't go, India, country, we will become so much, they will become so, now it is a bit of misunderstanding or pride, it has become a bit like this or not, friend.  So, you have to grow on 7, it is not yours, the government has to come and do the work here, now the government picks up the work from here and sends it to Israel, the work of the plumber sent from Haryana and this work, please arrange something for the rest too, Israel.  There is no taste in a place like this, it is happening with Hamas and Israel, our children are running here, now they have to be caught and brought back and issues are being raised, they have gone to fight in Ukraine. Somewhere in the middle the middleman said, go away, you have to prepare food and drink there, you have to do security work and you want to eat a little bit, you do n't want to fight, you don't have to take pills, I thought there were two children of ours and they also went.  That is also unfortunate, but at least find a network, some may be a school boy, some may be from the community, some may be from relatives, some may be from the village, some may be from the city, some may be from the city, then don't avoid him now, prepare.  And many a times I am saying that we leave the children like this because my core audience is not the very poor for whom I make videos, father and mother can go, if they had got admission, they used to go there too, go to school here also. You too go, come and see what is happening and I will suggest till this point, because if there is any hesitation, I will also suggest till this point. Mummy will also stay there, mummy will cook food for the child, otherwise it will be a bit tight. Somewhere in the same room, maybe mommy can also work. There is a foreign country so mommy can also get work. Somewhere there, the minimum wage is $15. She worked for 81 hours. Well, she took out some of her rent. I am  I am saying that father can take leave and go, I am saying that look at the idea, let the family go, what is the tension, even the parents are not tensed, then who will look after our house here, we will look after it here.  Some relatives, acquaintances, turn by turn, go away, once mother has stayed, the child is fine with the boy, then once father has stayed, once again some other uncle has gone, then he also fitted the jugaad, then it is set.  Then what happens next, what happens after one stage, then the money starts coming, father, once you are convinced, it is okay, the boy will do it right, if he does it, we will give you the money, buy a small big house there, do something.  take money people  There are people too, don't you all think once brother, choose it, how can it be found everywhere now? As much as I am saying, the country is sexy to you, as much as you want, it may be difficult to settle there on paper, so the less sexy ones.  Look, I am saying this where there is no problem and I am not giving such advice just by getting up, I have come to the US, it is difficult, so why are you going brother, don't go to the US, it is easy, visit there once. no what is happening there  The matter is, go to the easy ones, get some visas from there, do some citizenship there, then go there from there, it can happen again because how powerful is the Indian passport, could we have adopted this through the media?  I thought that I do n't know what is ours but perhaps it is not so much, that is why the waiting list is coming, the waiting list of so many years is coming, to go, so brother, go somewhere else, I am not able to live, this is what I am saying in my heart.  I am telling you  Think of it as a tour and travel, as if the child is going on a trip, do a recreation as a family recreation tour, list four to five countries and the feeling should be to fit some arrangements there and get something set up there.  If you can't get there then take a photo and come back. This is a practical advice. If you had to go for a trip then go with the feeling that something can happen here or because whenever you go to India, there are people from outside here.  Do you know how Coke is there? It is not like here. Even Pepsi there has something in the nose. Tomatoes are like this. Fruits there look like fruits. Apple looks like an apple. Hey, let's go. Go, friend, there is no need to feel bad about everything, no, ours is tasty, first of all, 90% of the people have not eaten, have not gone out, Indians are still fine and those who have gone, they did not go with that feeling only. that photo Facebook's have come to life, what is living, what can I buy, what work can I do, how much salary will I get, I will work as a librarian, I will work at a store, I will work at a petrol pump, then I will do that work, I will change values, I will do this, mine will do this.  And had gone to Gujarati, all the motels are on, there you can get almost 90 rupees but in US, you can get it with hard work, you can't get anything by doing that much hard work here, okay, if you work hard there, you will get something, something will become base and  There you do n't care about status, India has half of its people dead because of status, I will make a separate video on that, I don't know what we will become, don't run after status, run after wealth, run after money, become very rich.  For how long will you listen to the stories of others that he used to work at a petrol pump, then he opened a refinery and then this has happened to him, now his grandson is going to get married and all the people of the whole world are dancing there in India.  come and  He became such a rich man of India and he has such a big Antilia. For how long will you remain happy after reading the biography of this story? You too go and do the work, follow the same route, who knows, by the time you come, try to follow the same path.  Why are you not doing it, but I will try Guruji, then mine is at the grandson's level, yes, so you don't want to become a grandfather, neither did your grandfather do anything nor did your father do it, so you go and do it friend, no everything.  Are you waiting or not? Become Anant Ambani, become Anant Ambani 's son Amani, I don't know what his name is, become his, that is even more privilege, okay, so it can't be like this, isn't it?  You cannot go and change your father and mother. If the circumstances change then go out. Many times it is written in the horoscopes of many people that these days the dynamic world will be like this. Going out is not wrong in my opinion. Those who can go must definitely go out for a walk.  So definitely go and roam around to see where the Jugaad can be found and maybe it can be mine and after shortlisting it, go in the intelligent way because look, you will come back after seeing the Leaning Tower and Pizza, then what a wonderful thing will happen to you, you see.  I have seen the L Tower, taken a photo, but then became rich. I am telling him that he can go wherever he wants, first see how easily he can get a visa, how he can get a work visa, how he can work wherever he wants. I  I can go legally, go to small countries which are not run of the mill, it is easy to go there, I am telling you this again and again, I am explaining to you that I am not going to come here and cut your visa and give you the service of telling me everything yourself.  When I die, heaven appears, how long have you heard, okay, you will have to do something on your own, I have given you a hint, tell me, write in the comment section, let crowd sourcing and information happen, I am here and  Those Indians sitting outside us, okay, I have a request to you also, please run your YouTube 2, what is there, some have been made there, it is not that there are absolutely zero made, but many can be made, you people are in very small countries and there.  But what is happening, how can we reach, what is the inflation, what work can we do, how much salary do we get, because look, at the age of 25, you do not need a medical facility, you get into many arguments because whenever we talk about foreign countries.  When he goes to work, people think that he has just gone there and will come back as a 90 year old man. Do you know how much does root canal treatment cost? Yes, it is a lot outside, friend, I know, but take care of your teeth.  Get it done and leave from here. If there is a due date, go there. First of all, Rude Kara has to be treated. Let's talk about it in a practical way. Before leaving, I have to undergo a heart operation. I am 27 years old, so so many years. Who is saying to stay here, will keep preparing for the exam and here and here the pot is cheap, if it will not come back then go out there it is not that far world is so much, the ticket is not so much, your coming and going may be scared or  It would be like, Oh yes, I have come, so come back, who is going to fight and fight from here? Go explain to your parents, tell your parents that you are also a bad bed, you will also come with me, you will also come, come on, Papa Ji Pa.  Come settle me for 10 days, come there, we will not struggle like this, the wandering will also happen, tell me, you all come, I will settle there, okay, so this is a new trend I think should start, give me for our country.  It seems very beneficial, somehow one crore people go, how much is one crore, let me tell you, one crore in two years, going out in two years means 50 lakhs going out in a year, going out 50 lakhs in a year, that means around 4 lakhs per month and  I have captured 100 countries, I have captured 100 countries, I am not saying that everyone just capture these 5 10 countries, US and 100 countries i.e. 4000 4000 people, if you do 4000 in 100 then it comes to 4 lakh, 4 400, sorry four, yes 4000.  If you multiply by 100, it comes to 4 lakhs, so 4000 people.  You can go to any country, friend, there is so much visa problem, 4000 people can go, instead of 100, make it 150, do different countries, go back and forth a little and one crore will not go in two years, brother.  If you go in three, if you go in four, then you will catch people. Well, it becomes easy if you have gone to a country, you are living decently there, your history is good, you have settled there.  After vetting, if you call a relative, the people there also say that given his reference, it becomes easy, then for the next person, yes, he is living a law-abiding citizen, the work is done well by the citizen.  Say it or whatever the person says, let's let it go, okay, then it becomes a cycle in 10-12 years, let's you know, capture the, okay, capture means wherever you have reached, then you have reached yours, okay, spread all over the world.  Let me go brother, there is no census in our country, let me ask you what is the population of India, some will say 150 crores, some will say 145, some will say 140 crores, some will say 2 crores or 3 crores, so in our railways, people are traveling in trains every day.  I do n't know how many people are sleeping at the station at night. In India, people count, so what am I saying? Out of 150 crores, 1.5 crores can be a counting error. Counting on 1. Error Na Tooth 4 If you count more or count less, then if 1.5 crore people go out, you will not even know that here the population here will not reduce. Even if 1.5 crore people go away, only this many will be visible. So what do we say, born in six months.  It is okay that whatever figures I am telling you about, but if you go out, you will earn money and that money will come to India directly, indirectly and India will do good. On top of that, our soft power will also increase, so all the NRIs.  Brothers and sisters are listening to me, through this please encourage your family members, it is not necessary tell them that listen and see, my wife will not let you keep you in the house but I am ready to give you all the consultation and make arrangements for you. I am ready to do this much, you can do this much, what do people do, brother, Indians are not helping each other because of Indian default setting, we are going to hang ourselves, uncle, if someone is gone or someone is gone, then I will just hang myself.  If I go, I will stay in his house only, I will eat all my leftovers, he will say, brother, I do n't tell you anything, he says how he says, I am losing my life, don't come here, India is very great, I love India, we love India, we love you,  Respect you bye bye Tata bye Hey you first say brother listen it is like this tell me your nature before you listen brother I will not come to your house you are my relative I have Indian connection I am scared to come please guide us a little on phone we have like this  Yes, father and mother will also come, we will not even come to your house, we will feed you in the hotel, it is okay and we will bring a gift for your sister-in-law, okay, if you tell it in such a spirit, then all I am not trite put NRI down here but this is the truth, mine, mine.  There are a lot of consultations in a month. He is very upset with the NRIs. They are not travel agents there. I was joking with many people. I said, you become one and tell madam that this Become a travel agent, come, tell, guide, become a consultant, this is also a good business, a very good business, this is something which I can't do because I don't stay there but if I were staying in some country then I would do this there.  I could not have told you that you too can come like this, it is possible to get a visa, it is not possible to get a work visa, this is how the study scene is, this is how the job is, this is how you can come, it costs so much, water, these are the places, the food and drinks are like this.  You will have to remain polite, this is the rule, it is raw, you like it, come, pay a fee for one hour after telling all this, and if you have to come here, if you want to facilitate it, then we will do more, I am also giving business ideas. People who are youth here, go and fit Jugaad yourself, then come to India and do it legally, don't do the same thing, don't start pigeon-holing here, what is wrong is the problem, it is not a simple educated lot.  It is not going, which has completely gone to the village as if it was a donkey picture that the fields will be sold, man, that phenomenon is playing out, there are so many of you having lot of money in your accounts, parents accounts and you can easily take it. This option is why I am telling you, my audience is the same, my audience is not poor, brother, my audience is those who are not able to think what should I do because it is basic.  What is the problem? Do you people not have the answer as to what to do after going there? Some things will be known only after going there, what to do, so create a network and share it with people. I think it is very time is less, not so much here, more money in India by staying outside there. You can earn by linking to India, you know the pain point, you know the market requirement, go there and become knowledgeable, then come and give the knowledge here, you go slowly, then in this  It sounds like patriotism and Mother India will always be there. Okay, come on, take the money, invest it. Okay, so according to me, I have not given any wrong advice because at one time I used to have a feeling psychologically. If you are speaking like this then  Will everyone go to India? Hey, where are everyone going? Everyone will go, everyone will go in the train, everyone will go in the ship, everyone will go to school, there are not enough of them, there are too many, we have 150 crores here, we will not even know if 1.5 crores will go here.  We will not even know how many, but they will go there and do good work, if they earn money, then we will know. Look at the GDP, how much the number will increase. So my request is that everyone should go, that is, those who can go, those who want to go and those who are struggling here. Brother, there is nothing here, if someone has nothing to do, you are sitting in blue and silent, then because what is there here, working here seems to be of lower class, you will go out and do anything, friend, it is fresh air, water is good.  The infrastructure is there, the clothes are also good, who knows what they are doing, there are a lot of people, do any work, then in my opinion, go once, okay, do 1015 work and see the reward because even if I apply the formula on purchasing par pari.  It is worth it yaar the savings aa worth it this is my recent awareness which I have gained in six months on this and want more detailed videos or something or someone genuinely  NRI can bring someone who wants to ask questions if you want that Workshop Webinars A content consumer Ok thank you very much Share like the channel You can also take membership of the channel You will get access to many workshops and webinars Exclusive which is done  And in the future, you will not have to pay any money, it will be free for you, so you can take the membership of the channel by pressing the join button, you will definitely get clarity on many things.

    "content": "Hello friends, today we will discuss a system, we will try to discuss it, that is, should you believe in lakhs and hard work, this question is asked a lot, this question is fine and many people call it destiny, some say luck in Hindi that brother on this.  Is it true or should we work hard to do this, so today I want to tell you that the question itself is wrong because everyone will get the answer when it is freshly corrected or understood properly because by doing it in the wrong way, luck is everything.  If yes, then there is no need to do hard work and everything is possible through hard work, then brother, even a donkey also works hard, okay, I don't know, everyone does this hard work, not everyone gets it, then the answer is date in life. 60 Things 100 Things Are Working More If Sachin Tendulkar happens today, then perhaps he would not have been included in the Indian cricket team. If he was selected in 1989, then perhaps in such a competition, people talk about astrology like astrology.  Little is taught in the old wisdom Time and Space in Your Hand Your Hand is Action I Won't Call It and Something Career Mistake Decisions Are Gold and Dreams Or Are You Limiting Them Because There Are So Many Things You Can Be  And they can take you anywhere because what people say is that they are looking for their patients, they are looking for fashion, but what I am saying is that look for something less or less where you can get money, because when money seems to be coming in a lot, then that is fashion.  It becomes like this, people are not doing it in reverse. Nowadays, no one is discussing like this in the society. In our society, talking about money directly makes people feel bad, this is a wrong thing, how can we become something like this?  We have to do something for the society, don't talk about all this, we have to do something, now it will not work because 7-8-10 years ago, what is being reduced today was not at all less, otherwise what will you prepare for today?  the child of  He is in 10th, when he will enter the job market after next 5-6-7 years, then what is happening to him at the time, go to the market i.e. money earning market, what will happen after 7 years in the money earning market, we don't know the only thing is this way.  Can we prepare ourselves, keep our mind cool, how are our people skills, how many remain happy, how many do not panic, how many mean vans do not become tripuni and remove these ghosts from their lives that I have to become something because even if your dream is fulfilled.  And even if you become something, what grade will it be because people are running after the name, I am saying again and again, run after the name, you see in any field, the name is temporary, the name does not always remain that big-  Big cricketers, big film stars, big leaders came, Bharat Ratna remained for a long time, now it is not talked about but money is more permanent, then that money is more permanent in money than today, not in name, there is a lot of sleeping in one year.  The position was for one and a half year or two years and after that it ended, after that it ended, be very very, keep you focused in life."

    "content": "Hello friends, today's topic is should you blow your own trumpet, do you know that trumpet of yours, should you just praise yourself, should you or not? This is a very deep video, higher order thinking, I would like to teach you a lot, no one is teaching this thing, no management school.  Neither in college nor in family nor in society, it has been explained in a different way and that is why today for the first time I am going to explain this thing to you people and please like and subscribe the channel. My t graminity.com In the country, such people may seem very exaggerated. Many people like it very much, many agree, many troll, there is every kind of reaction, but there is reaction but I am consistent. You must have seen my approach.  I answer and then I will talk, the answer is that you have to praise yourself, you have to blow your trumpet, you have to blow your trumpet because Nobody else is ever going to blow it for you I am my address, my middle class, you have not become that, you have not become that of the biggest leader that many of your devotees will do that, yes, anyway, you are not going to become that, there is only one life, it will pass.  This is what I want to tell you, no, but we should not praise ourselves. Who doesn't like it? You don't like it, you do n't like it, or people don't like it. Hey, what will people say? Those people are of no use to you, those people whom you like are of no use to you.  You are praising that this thing does not look good in anything, that one rupee of yours is not worth anything, there is no use because you have to understand it yourself. When you want to buy a confectioner for your child's marriage, he will say yes.  No one has made it better than us, now it has not been made, I am not talking about it but I am saying this in real life, you always like and love people who are confident and they give that there is nothing better than us that inspires confidence.  The one who does not want this confidence does not have your requirement, you understand my point, I go till second third fourth fifth order thinking that it is completely layered in between, you have to learn, do not watch my videos 1.5 exp, listen and you will understand.  Nothing will come, you understand what I am trying to say, what inspires confidence, when you go to a shop, your sister says, show your suit well.  Or that seller, there is no better suit than us, look at the clothes, there is nothing better than this, what are you, what do you want, decide on you everywhere, what kind of a person are you, no one says anything, whatever you think, you are a financial influence, you run youtube1 by suppressing it.  Here they give money, they give it and then the world speaks about them that if they publish a good newspaper, then they spend money on marketing. Now many times people tell me that I should take the name of some influencer. Okay, so I will take the name.  Let me tell you, I have said Akshay Srivastava, sometimes I have said Varku, sometimes I have said Acharya Prashant, sometimes take the name of any two or four others. Okay, I said friend, they speak wrong, they speak wrong, you want cheap popularity, you want cheap publicity, you want this.  Work is cheap publicity. Hey brother, you have to do it for cheap publicity. Yes, who wants expensive publicity? Who wants to do publicity by paying crores of rupees? I am telling this to the middle class.  You will have to do it, yes, speak good to yourself, do n't speak bad to others, you have to say that you have opened a golgappa shop, if you have opened further, then my ears are good, my water is good, I am using mineral water, my masala, you will enjoy it. This is useless, I have to say, there is nothing wrong, this middle class becomes someone, that is why it is not able to reach anywhere, middle class is not able to reach anywhere because you, brother, it does not look good, do not speak ill of anyone whom you want to speak ill of.  Do that audience which is the audience, the audience will decide, the audience is not worth anything, it is worth deciding, and how many creators will say this with a straight face, declare yourself an idiot, those who are watching my videos, that friend, you cannot decide in life.  Whatever you want, you can achieve it, but what would you like in life? You can't even think. The thing that you can't even think, then how can you want that? How can you decide? You are made to decide. Yes, you can't decide anything, you are listening to me, which car to buy, which phone to buy, which house to buy, which girl to marry, which boy to marry, this is also being done to you for your own benefit.  It is not a decision, you feel that it is yours, you cannot wish what you want in life, you can get whatever you want in life, but you cannot wish what you want, are you understanding this, it is very important that you  blow your  Trumpet butt comes with some catches, if you do n't know how to cook at all then can you say that I am the best cook, first of all you should know how to cook, then you should also have some knowledge in it that other people are cooking.  I also cook my own food, according to me mine is quite good, then we need 510 people who can speak, 510 people are needed, we don't need 510 people who can speak, it is very good only then there will be some substance, absolutely from zero to 100 if you  If you are sitting at 60, 70, 80 then you can claim 90 at 80, you can claim 75 at 60, you can claim 95 at 30, then he will be called a [ __ ] because every time when you come and say,  I am the number one clarity giver, this is how I came and said this because of what I am bringing and thinking, no one brings it.  No one is approaching this issue from the point of view of finance, from the point of view of relationships, from the point of view of astrology, from the point of view of psychology. No real estate people think that real estate is  A mother-in-law problem, real estate is a marriage problem, investments are related to marriage, quality of marriage is related to job, happiness in job is Related to Money Money is also related to marriage Now my video will come, I will teach you very well in bad marriage and economy, your marriage is going bad, what will you do, ask what is happening with Raymond, you can reach anywhere, no matter how far you reach in life, if  If this base of yours shakes then this will also shake, everything is linked and these are the linkages, I have explained it beautifully, no one else is coming on any platform who does marital consultant and also does real estate.  Be it finance, relationship, communication and astrology, there are 25-50 things that I do which I don't tell everywhere, so when you connect all those dots, you get confidence. Confidence comes because you do some work.  If you are not doing it, then brothers and sisters, you also have to do something in life in which you are good, it is not necessary that you can come and say that you are number one in India in this thing, but you can say it while remaining in a coat. You can say that I am the number one in Abol Nagar, you can say that I am the number one in your colony or the number one in a small town or the number one in that locality is in a big city, then you can say, but you have to know that  You will have to be better in one thing. You can say that no one makes this Dream 11 team better than me. Well, you can be good in anything too. So find something that you can teach in speaking, in understanding, in teaching or in learning. Others How To  Absorb Learning Learning how to do something Can it also be taught You don't know anything but you know how to learn Very well Can you teach others Can you teach others You can teach any skill set Are you a woman Hear me  You can say that no one in this whole society can tie a saree better than me. I know how to tie so many pleats. I know how to tie it like this. I know how to tie it in 18 ways. I can tie it in one and a half minutes. I can tie it in 80 seconds. Mukesh Ambani. That my wife Nita ji is the one who ties his saree. As far as I read the article last time, please check with such celebrity gals. She also teaches many people how to tie saree. Can you teach? Can you say like this?  I know how to tie a tie very well, the American one, the European one, the Oxford one, this one has so many patterns, it can be made like this, it can be made like this, it can be made like this, no one learns better than me, can you teach me, Shah Khan ji, summer will come soon.  So winter is going on but there is time in summer but people will come. Why doesn't he make better shikanji than me, I have that masala, why don't you say you will and dear people, you tell me this today, I come and speak openly, there is no better clarity giver than me.  So you write in the comment section whether you agree or disagree and how many people feel bad as to why you are praising yourself. Do yours too and if you criticize someone's message.  What has to be done is in direct conflict with your work. If I say that we should get married on time, then I automatically come against Acharya Prashant. I am not worried about this. When one top politician does this to another politician, then we are also in competition.  I want, do you want that Acharya Q. I want all the subscribers of Acharya Prashant to come to me and I have around two lakh of them and mine will be more than them. That's a joke. Two teachers were going. From in front of Mukesh Ambani's house and she says one, hey, how would you like it if you get all Mukesh Ambani's property and she says, it would be great if you get all his property and my two tuitions, so a person has to think about himself. A messaging. If anyone is against that messaging, then he is against it and it is in the message. Now who will decide? Who will decide? Acharya question: Is it okay or am I okay? The public will decide, no public.  It is just that people will follow the one with whom your views match, this is also a true thing, so then brothers and sisters, now you will ask, then who has decided first?  Who wants to drink tea, who wants to drink coffee, who wants to eat dosa, who wants to eat chana bhatura, then why are you making it like this, so that if you want chana bhatura, then keep eating chani bhu.  Don't go for dosa and if some dosa people get tempted or they get tempted, what word should be used, is it right to create greed in them that you should give up yours, come and try it, then what is wrong in work?  Said no, no, cholesterol is high in dosa, this is true, yes, this is also true, and in dosa, this is good for the heart, that is also true, okay, this is true, but come and eat.  Let's see who has to eat, whether the 22 year old, 23 year old, 25 year old is eating or the 50 year old or 55 year old who is being fed, the one who has cholesterol issues should neither eat Dosa nor should he eat Bhatura.  He should eat idli, okay, and with South Indian filter coffee, what I am talking about may cause a little confusion as to where are you getting this dosa filter from.  Acharya Prashant, this is that, I am taking out your fear, the fear of speaking good about yourself and also about speaking bad to someone else. If I have to become the Prime Minister of India, then I will become the Prime Minister of India only by praising myself or by criticizing anyone.  You will also have to say that this is crazy butch, all of them are crazy butch, I am only Shana, I am only Shana, look at this, I have horns, you are not able to see much, you are feeling that something is happening, this should not happen, brothers.  Sisters, who goes and takes a tape measure and measures 56 inches? Have you ever asked anyone? Do you know how much is 56 inches? I am quite good, mine is wide, I am from Haryana, I am also fine and I have not built a body like this, but for me, how much is 44 inches?  How much is 46, how much is 48, how much is 50 52 54 56, okay, you will also have an idea, but someone says it, it sounds very good, many people should also like it, then why do n't you say it?  Can you say something even an inch smaller than mine? Why are you feeling shy? What are you afraid of? No, we will decide. How will you decide? You give every person the confidence of a doctor. One person said, go to operate for the doctor. Tell me about anything, doctor, it will be fine.  Neither is he asking this, the doctor said, this is my daily work, Abhay Tihan Saheb is from Medanta of Gurgaon, he is fine, India's number one cardio surgeon, I don't know how many thousands of operations he has performed.  Now don't you have confidence in them that friend, I am mine, my name is enough, so if there is any lesser surgeon than him who has done all those, then it cannot be Tihan Saheb, now there are many surgeons, so what kind of doctor would you like who is doubtful?  Brother, I will do the surgery, after that you decide whether I was good or not, you get it done, you get it done by him, you tell me, are you planning to hire a confectioner for your daughter's wedding, are you planning to hire a caterer.  Yes, tell me how is it, then you keep it, then you don't have to decide, business doesn't work like this, business does n't work like this, no work works like this, you will say how do you do coaching, you can decide, join if you wish, you have a chance brother.  Coming to join again, there are 10 crore channels, 10 crore people sharing knowledge, then you have to tell that brother, I am number one, you are number one, so why don't you have the highest number of subscribers? Subscriber is an idiot, he doesn't understand my words, I am Shana, I am intelligent, I am number one, I am feeding you desi ghee, where will I find someone who is telling me so openly to teach you people, because I know that I can lose thousands of subscribers in this. I have hurt someone's feeling by making such videos, those whose feelinglessness I myself like, 22000, some subscribers are 300.  They get 35000 views, these 2 crore 80 lakh subscribers are sitting there, they don't get 4 lakh views, but even 6 people don't see them, sometimes they join, sometimes they come again, there is no relevant content, it doesn't touch the heart, it is not practical, it is not its own.  You will not praise like this and you will do it by doing marketing. Hey, you are my audience of middle class including myself. I also do not spend any rupees in my marketing. I myself I am marketing, Swami Ra Ramdev ji is yours, he is ours, he says, I am the one, do it Kapal Bharti, do this, I do n't have the expense of marketing, I do n't have the expense of marketing, so brother, that's why the product is cheap, I am giving you the art of decision making 99 comments  You will find it in the section, take it, you will enjoy, I have taught you all the templates for Rs. 299, there is no high production value in it, you will feel like what on Doordarshan's 90's serial in my content.  Byomkesh Bakhi, what a great serial it was, what a great story, see today, the production value was kept so high but there is no engaging content, look at the Vikesh Bakhi one, with his attention, even the mike was visible where the dialogue was hitting, it was shaking at times, okay, the production value is bad.  It was okay, it was not that good, but even today people watch it on YouTube and you also go and watch the content, the story of grandparents, some serials were old because they were from old times.  There was no production value and budget. There are many movies which have a budget of 15 crores. The picture Katara became such a super hit. Like you, it was so expensive that it was made in less than the sales and marketing budget of 250 crores, 500 crores, 300 crores. Brother has made the whole picture, now you have to see that this expense is not water, you will never be able to do it, no one will ever speak good to you unless you speak Shahrukh Khan's song.  Have you heard that I am the best, I am the best, yes you are the best, both girls and boys also say this, first you will have to say once, I am the best and you will have to say the best only, but that is hard work for that.  So you will have to do it, you can't say best, how will you say best, with which mouth will you say it? If you don't know how to cook, you can say best in food, if you don't know how to tie a tie, you can say best in tying a saree, I don't say any big things.  stay here  I am speaking about science and research and cricket and all that. Okay, people will decide, don't do it. These are the people who don't have confidence in themselves and think of themselves as arrogant. There are two types of people, one is the one who does n't have confidence.  Brother, they want to gain confidence somehow, you teach me, I believe you, you seem perfect, you will learn this, but there are many people who do not consider themselves inferior in their own eyes, but are hesitant in telling people.  Then someone says to him, he comes forward and thinks man, it seemed to be a common man, he is sitting on such a normal software, he doesn't even come on the helicopter, he does n't even get an ad for this, so we don't have much back and forth too.  I don't know, I don't know how to make myself number one, it's so easy, who made me number one, why is the lion the king in the jungle, neither can he run the fastest, nor can the leopard run, is he the biggest, because the elephant is so big and neither is he the biggest  high  Because the giraffe is so tall, but why is he still a king? Because he thinks he is a king, he believes, he says, I am the king, then he said, yes brother, in the jungle, yes, who is it brother? It is okay if even the donkey believes tomorrow.  Embrace yourself and people will accept democracy once or for a while. There is no democracy. Actually, it is fine in the jungle. But if you understand democracy in our country, then anyone can become that.  The one who wants to become a hero will have to humiliate others and in this, the middle class sensibilities in decision making become such that they say brother, I am like me, I like this politician too, he also likes this. I am telling today in the recording, earlier I told you that I like Modi ji well, I like Rahul very much, Do I like both of them very well, Can I vote for both of them, What can't I vote for, I like both of them very much, Not a little, Not very good, Both of them.  There is a lot to learn from both of them, I will also make a very good astrology channel about both of them someday, if you want, then listen to it, I will make a very good astrology channel on P and I. They are saying something to each other, so I, I, what?  What should I do, should I leave both of them, should I not dislike both of them, should I like both of them, and should I like them more, what should I do, that is of no consequence, I can still like the third one, also, the fourth one, also, and them.  Also, to live with this contradiction, one needs an ease which is not there in the middle class. The middle class says that they like you, they like you too, but don't speak ill of them, because if you speak ill of them, then there will be a lot of problem.  There will be suggestions that I like Modi ji, I like Rahul ji, I like both, if Modi ji says something against Rahul ji or Rahul ji says something against Modi ji because I like both of them.  I am now  The problem will come that I will have to dislike someone, naturally because I like him, if he has spoken bad about him, then if I have to continue to like him, then I will have to leave him, but I like him also.  Hoon It is like that Rasgulla Telling Gulab Jamun That is better than Gulab Jamun This is Rasgulla and Gulab Jamun than Gulab Jamun Singh Ki No No I am better Rasgulla Hey brother, we are from Haryana.  Eat Rasgulla also, eat Gulab Jamun also, eat Kheer also, eat Halwa also. Take what ever comes to you and be friends with both of them. Look at the India level, if India is a friend of one country and is also a friend of another country and both of them are friends.  It is necessary for you to take a side when they are playing among themselves, see who is talking logically, what relations can be made with whom, what to do, but that is the problem, not that someone should praise himself.  Or will he speak ill of someone, watch this video of higher order thinking, it takes 22 2 24 minutes to explain, it cannot be explained in shorts, it is explained only through examples, but you being middle class, why are you or not, we will decide and you  Do n't do things like this among yourselves brother, even Coca-Cola and Pepsi will say which one is better among me, okay, you can't do this like this, you must follow the decorum, that's something.  I also agree, now we should not say the words 'that is also agree' but if the messaging is going out then since when did it become wrong to oppose that messaging? If I say marry on time, have children on time, it is good and someone else is saying.  Or not, the intellect, conscience and consciousness have to be awakened till the age of 42 till 45 years and then these things which I am saying have to be done. If you do them in 24, 25, 26 then it is a direct consequence. I say, home first. Should buy 2425 Wari who calls axle axle should not buy a house after 42 years, that too even if you want to buy one, it will be my 42 p. buy a house only, so why can't I buy 24 and then why can't I put the money  Ca n't, no, how will you put it in that mutual fund, if you go to e, then e will also end, the rent will also increase, the salary will also increase and that's what I used to collect in the market.  By the time my time came to buy a house, the property had increased and the market had fallen, then where would I go? Otherwise, if you keep doing it for 90 years, then how will you have so much money, neither will you have teeth nor will you keep your mouth, then it is conflate.  It is messaging and it is important to tell that there is more importance in my words, I am influencing more people, I am benefiting more people's lives, more people are thanking me and if I am explaining to people directly then never.  You  Will Continue Seeing To whom I am speaking today that till date I have not spoken clearly to whom when I say that whatever I do in praising myself, my friend, you cannot praise yourself, you cannot do good for yourself, whom will you do?  All should be the biggest favorite person of all of you, you should be yourself and then someone else should come second. Love yourself first, don't turn to yourself, only then will you be able to give it to someone. Will you hate yourself or will you give yourself somewhere?  If you don't even make it to the top 10, how will the work be done? You will have to work hard. I told you that if you are 10 out of 100, you cannot become 90 out of 100, but if you are 70, 75, 80, you will become 90 and the day you become 90, don't say no.  I have started making the world 95, I tell in my exam, I talk about real estate, no one is above me in India, I am fine in knowledge.  Did the message come or yes number one Clarity's letter Tell me this capital Some question came one and a half years ago at that time the rule was changed and the government does not change after so much advertisement Do you know and that had just happened, I did not know it or completely. I was not able to give the answer to mine, so I claimed that if I don't know the answer to the question, I actually know everything but there is no answer to any question that I claim that I am number one. In the matter that I will not give it to you in 24 hours, with full clarity, that too, the world makes you think that you are 80 out of 100 and you say that I am 9095, the world will make you 100 by itself giving me the knowledge.  The number of forward messages and number of messages received is called crowd sourcing of information on any thing. Funding is done, isn't it? Crowd funding, you understand, is an information then.  There is knowledge, then there is wisdom, and the amount of people give me, the video I make, when it is published in the newspaper, I do not read the newspaper, just disclaimer, I don't read any newspaper personally, I never read it, because then it is the same, that, then because advertisement.  It comes in the newspaper, people do not know that the advertisement which is printed separately is not the same advertisement, the rest is also not advertisement and they make it like us, okay then I  The things that I say in the newspaper and the things that I say are published after three to six months, if what I am saying is published today, then my audience, you are the subscribers who are connected with me, the number given by it is now available only on Tegra.  This is whatsapp-web, can you tell how you liked this video? Never be shy in calling yourself good and if you cannot call yourself the best, then say good, first say I am good, I am very good, then gradually say best.  go to the side  When you become the best, but what is the point in saying no, no, you do it yourself, you decide, no, no, the public does not decide, the public is told, the public is not explained, the public is told and then the public accepts and then like this.  This is how votes are cast, this is how you become a leader, this is how you tell a product, this is how it works, it will feel bad to hear, the public feels that they are deciding and not deciding anything, all this such a big system has been created just because I have no sales.  Budget is not enough  Because I do n't have any marketing budget, just because I don't run ads, it doesn't mean that you will take away my right to praise myself, because then what are you wanting, that the world should praise me and then I should consolidate it.  I get 200 messages every day that I have changed people's lives, now how should I do that, make a site, post testimonials, take screenshots, post on status, will it take a lot of hard work, won't it take a lot of hard work?  It is the work of hard work, people are getting connected, many people have changed their lives, thanks to them, people have seen a difference in their weddings, people have seen a difference in their mental peace, people have started feeling relaxed, then write in the comment section because if not then I.  And what will happen will be seen in the comment section if I have brought any change in your life which my audience is listening to till now. What ever late you are seeing which comes through message, then I will give the direct result only.  Let me tell him that brother, he is better than me because why am I saying that I am number one and no one is doing the work I am doing? You people should also find such work which not many people are doing and if they are needed then you will.  Do well and never ever shy from saying that you are good. I know that it takes a long time to speak the best. It takes a long time to become the best from good. I agree that it is not easy. It is also the stage of claiming.  There is no actual best, it is relative, we learn this from Sanatan, everyone has their own absolute truth, there is nothing, everyone is living with their own truth, my truth is that I am the best in this thing, this is my truth.  This may be your truth too. If you agree, if it is not the best, then brother, you are not finding anyone better than me. Tell me the name. If you have found it, then go to him, then why are you listening to me? It is a simple thing, go, you have found it.  No, when not, that is also good, you are also good, but do n't say the best, why don't you say, why does your mind feel a little troubled, your contradiction comes to your mind, there is tension in your mind, why should I deny myself for that, you live.  With that fact, if I am speaking 80 things out of 100 that make sense to you and 60 of them are taking you to a much better situation, be happy with it 100 out.  Of 100 never happens like that in life, someone is taking 40, someone is taking 30, so come with a straight face and say one more thing, now tell me while leaving, if I am the number one clarity giver, then comment.  Write in the section if you are not there then write someone else's name, but I give clarity on those things which impact your daily life. Spirituality does not give by force.  And then we have to ask your question why don't do it like this, I am the one who is connected to the ground, I am the leader who is connected to the ground, I am the one who takes the votes, I am the creator, I am connected to the ground, I am connected to the ground.  I take votes, the rest are the ones with hi-fi style, they are okay but they don't reach anywhere, I just feel from them that yes, it was fun, as if my go-round goes like this, isn't it fun, they went up like this, then came down, and then went away.  it's fun  Came again got down and stood there, did not reach anywhere, did not reach anyway, this is a lot, this is my matter, this is not my matter, walk comfortably and you will reach somewhere in life, subscribe the channel, if not, request more.  Have one or two subscribers and add some ads, we will grow further in lakhs, okay, then we have to keep messing with so many and so many, there should be something to say about them, okay, it is not that my words are in India.  There are so many people who understand, there is no shortage, there are many, we have to reach a lot, many people understand and I try to explain it simply, thank you very much."

    "title": "Should You Give Money To Your Parents ？ ｜ Must Watch Video [uyPt6ll3yB4].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, this is a very good topic. This is the name of the youth channel on Clarity. If you have not subscribed then do it. There is a lot of clarity in many topics. There is a lot of love in the comments. People say that no one has created original content. No one means plagiarism.  Can someone get infected? People take mine. Today's topic is Should you give money to your parents if it is for youth then you can be 24 25 30 35  I am 40 years old, I work less and earn money. What is the question? I asked, should you give money to your parents? Money is your parents, it is a very simple question. If you vote mostly then people will say yes, the same note is for the question. Video is ok.  If it is, then it will be good for you that some people will get to listen to it, parents are also listening, those who take money or not, listen carefully with an open mind, so the clarity of youth does not mean that only young people will listen to it.  It means that senior citizens will also listen and they will give clarity to their youth, so this channel is for everyone, you understand, what attention will you give to your child, otherwise you have to give him knowledge, then you see us thinking that Sudi you give money.  Parents, this question will come in your life only when you have money, otherwise this question will not come, if you are dependent on your parents then how will they take money, then the situation here is such that parents  There is money for retirement and if you have money then you work, do business, I would say that even if you are married, you take money just like that before marriage and I would say that you should not give a lot of money even before marriage.  It is necessary for the parents, now you understand this, first of all, those who have children, their parents have become good, they have to understand that the parents who are the plates for the children, it is their duty, not a favor, but no, the duty was to raise them, but that.  stomach  What was the duty of the CAT that we sent to the college? Now let me tell you a different story. We have to remember one thing that the children give more happiness to the parents. They are more forgiving. Parents give happiness to the children.  Children can never give the happiness that they give to their parents, so they balance it in this way because the one who is there to give them happiness since childhood is not their own. When the parents have seen the child, they have seen the same, whether it is a boy or a girl, otherwise they have not seen it.  You tell me the gender goes to A. But when the child is looking at the parent, he does not think that he is a daughter or a son, he loves him, there is a lot going on in his mind about my father or mother. In North India, a lot has happened, this is a boy and a girl, so this has to be done by a girl.  Sometimes it is the love of the parent and sometimes it cannot be. Salutations to the mother for her child and the father is also awake, I am also awake, the world is awake, the man also goes, you are awake because you do not do a favor to the child because you are asleep.  can't if you  You can sleep this very feeling date you child note it well and only and right requires you country note let you sleep it is your problem you are awake for yourself it is a very deep thing for you to understand I have to speak myself in my video I live in third fourth order  It is not for all the audience, they will not understand because what I am trying to tell, many people will run away. Hey, you should give less, it is limited to ₹ 15000, don't ask for it, when you are at psychology level. Deep will not understand things, Deep will not understand, nothing is being explained in India, nothing is being explained in India and if there is no problem of waste, then no content will be created in the waste, in 18 years the child will be kicked out, they will live on their own social  Security will not become Prime Minister, India only system, you have to find out what is happening, what are the parents doing, how much are they doing, how much are they poor, if you take a loan from the bank then you have taken a loan from the bank, okay understand.  This thing was worth ₹ 50 lakhs and you got a house in return for it, you gave it a house, then the loan of ₹ 50 lakhs ended, this will end, the house is yours, you did not pay the bank's aarti, then if the parents who brought up like this  We are saying that we are investing this money and we will get it, then brother, you are a bank, banks do not get respect, you are understanding the deep thing, if the poet sometimes has a share in this, then it is okay, then sometimes the actions of the city people, whatever.  If you want to give those likes  Please like this on this issue. On this issue, are parents a bank? Because it will always be a bank. I have given it to you, so give it to me and if we have to have such a relationship going forward, then there is no respect in it. Take the money but be clear.  Go son, what is the problem then? Have you invested Rs 10 lakh for the boy or the girl in the marriage? If you have invested anything, then she did not say that. Now you want her feelings, many idiot parents.  Want a feeling from the daughter-in-law, I have invested so much money in the boy's marriage, she does n't respect me much, now why did you invest, the daughter-in-law had asked, the boy had asked, why should you invest, you want to become a bank, whether I am an investment or invest 50 lakhs, then boys and girls. You will give one crore and the girl will get the feeling and respect of Rs. 1.5 crores, from Rs. 50 I will get 2.5 crores, you will get multibagger returns, just put it in the stock market, then you will meet there, then you will see why they want the story, isn't it because of money?  It is necessary to send your sister because her father- in-law has a small house in front of Dehradun which he wants to expand and respect. Our child has joined a multinational. The story is that if he becomes an officer, then we should show our social status to the neighbors by showing our functional functionality.  If there are six in my son's bathroom, there is no bathroom, there is no bathroom. Of the problems that will arise if you drive late for Innova Cryst, then tell your father which one should be given, L2 should be given, Desire should be given, Amaze should be given, Honda City should be given, which one should be given, because many people can say this themselves.  Well, if you gave this to us, then the answer is this: Match money, social status of your parents, match today, give them the phone, mantra, take the phone, you sent it to your daughter, why are they asking for money for food?  Those parents who are so hungry, become so poor, who don't have a scene to eat, then there is no spice, there is no question to be asked, there is no question, the application for that is to be my audience, I am the audience, take this note and go to the class.  Ordinance you should understand and give money is required bill you give it, we have to build a house, why do you have to build a big house in a small town, you will never live in that house, the cost of construction is inflated everywhere.  Small lions have more cost because of labor and stuffing. I will build a house in the mountains and it is expensive. I do not make it from my imagination. This video is how studies have been done. I have seen the pain of people with me. I am based on SOAP D guiding principle.  You Give Loan Sorry Money To Your Parents Should Be Weather It Is On A Loan Basis And Non Returnable Insurance To Your Parents Because You Wish You Start 24 25 26 Your parents are of 50-55 years of age, get medical insurance because if ever the big expenses arise, they will be covered from there. You pay the money for medical insurance, which you get in clean money. You people know that the income is up to Rs 25,000. In 80's the government had also said that yes, this service has to be done, this money has to be given, but the money is being asked from your father for your father's false pride.  The boy has become so big, Seth ji, yours has become like this, give it to me, they will say that my money is not given to me, this BJP is a fool in speaking to the parents or in the Indian society, even if the parents do not say, ' My child would have given it to me'.  No money, give flowers, very shy, itna your son is [ __ ] so big great, I had just taken out something at the beautiful picture's house, also say something, I didn't read the article but I can't relate that to some father's house in India too.  Sarcasm: It is not about tracking you in things, it has to be given in functionality, it has to be given in a fair manner, it keeps some accountability and it has to give you clear messaging that it is very hard and money is made for free and again and again you have to remember that thing.  Is it a bank? The money given by your father and mother, now they want to recover from you that if you have spent so much then it has become a bank, otherwise the bank will not get respect. You have to understand this and if you can't explain then read this video.  Explain to them so that if they come to know, then it is a matter of giving a conditional amount, it should be given on retirement and it should never be reduced endlessly because what was the limit, it is not that you are giving money to the house and it is there to the village, Newton said.  You are going to a function to eat food which is not Rewari or the wedding was organized for 10 lakh rupees, sister's wedding and after taking money from you it will go on 25 rupees, then you too will spend 15 lakh rupees and that 25 rupees will be spent on sister's wedding.  There is no difference in the quality of giving, which is derived from the psychology of giving first, because it will never flow in reverse towards your children. The favors of parents can never be repaid. Your children can do and they cannot repay yours and this is the method.  Life is like this, clapping is not enough for your parents, neither are you, honey. If you are not doing it, then it is okay. If your children are not doing it, then it is okay too. You should not remain in clapping mode forcefully because this is the same.  A disease and pattern  What is to be broken is that your parents have done a big crime to their parents, clapping or forced service or money exploitation, now they want to do the same thing with you, then it will be with you, then you will also follow the law of law and follow that program in our family.  I have said that we take care of our children, I take care of mine, I will take care of yours and you take care of yours, tell me, what is this rate, the rate in our family is that they are very nice, you and  Children and they don't expect anything from each other little beat love and respect but they bill give everything body mother and wealth this is ho r family progress they don't expect anything from next generation new and bill b d tree and bill love you aisi ritu  He is not driving India forward, then what will he do in the future also, this happens many times, he is not born, he himself becomes so expert, he flies away from the restaurant so much.  This is also not the story of the generation, it is okay that we do not marry, what is this, what is the meaning of this type and many do not do this because our parents have to do so much, on the contrary, my parents raised me and I have to raise them.  I, you ca n't live life further, if you have clarity, then youth is this, you do n't have to raise your parents, how many garden pictures can be made, how many stories are there, the story was made because there was no social security in this country, so it was not in America.  Bunty  So there is security in India, Prime Minister's scheme, this scheme, ask whether you can give 25 thousand or lakh and not for what, if you ask for what then our heart will break. We had asked you one thing when you got selected there and we had given you away. Then they open the account of the bank today, find out how much they had lent, put interest on it but reverse it, I and that software of the bank is Microsoft Excel, that very happy Excel, you will get it easily, all that in a good way, the loan ends on Excel.  Tax  They give gold these days, it's fine, they go to the loan on Excel, they crust it there, turn it into practical content, friend, now if you talk, he criticizes, what does he do when he criticizes, so many people are watching this video, it is effective for more people. No one will make a video, everyone will make a video, you should respect the needs of Indian society, you should understand that the bank also has its expenses, it also has its expenses and we have given you life, so now you do not give money for it.  So how are you born? After the loan is over, then taxes have to be paid. How much will be spent on 24%, 38%, how much will it cost here, how much interest should I put in my love and care for you, then put it in, what is the time for the society?  I talk about connecting, I talk about awakening the society, I am talking very deep, if you people understand this, I know this, you will come and speak for free, you will eat the dog and the street too, give it this butter, give it.  You are the people, I genuinely understand and require and sometimes what happens is that you have to give. After a stage, you have to awaken the society and also learn the code, because I want to play the role of a social scientist, social reformer.  Whose name have you heard in the 21st century after Raja Ram Mohan Roy, Vidyasagar ji and others like him, but I want to include him in the role, from this middle I can go to every house like this. Jakar to koi gyaan dega nahi chowk tu so mein people so please make this video write in comment area thank you very match please subscribe note donation and parents who have seen the video and who felt a little sad if it went to please request you too  By subscribing, you will also get a lot of clarity and you will get it further. You will feel pain gradually but you will get rid of that pain, your belief system will change and then you will eat.  We were cheated by our parents, yes, that happened to you and now don't do it further, don't do it further, don't follow the wrong rule of law, follow the good one which I have told you, thank you very much."

    "title": "Should You Invest For Long Term Or Short Term ？ ｜ There Is More To It [mo8JdxF8crg].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today's topic is should one do short term investment and long term investment, it comes in the form of short term long term investment, no one should see it in long term, not short term, these are the terms to fool us. Will cross from day to day, I always give a different good perspective. There is already a video on the channel for mental model and decision making and always watch share market. Invest si have tu investing jab tak hai jaan but it means that after making that one investment you forget it and never change it. To invest, we have to invest in anything, it has to remain in the thing till the story of it. No further, I have to get out of this investment date investment rate, it was like short term only, brother, there was no benefit in it, I have to stay invested for long term but in between I will come out of this.  I can do left and right, then people perform weather it is real estate and stock market. In real estate, have you ever heard that it will come here like this, there it will be like this, Norman will be oil, Radha will dance, have you heard the saying, then it will be like this, it will be like that Norman.  Brother, if there is no oil then sell it and monitor it. What do people do? Psychology of long term. Thought, there is some asset class, there is lion, there is mutual fund, there is real estate, there is battery and said, I will look at it for 20 years.  Otherwise, when things start going wrong, neither the people who have invested in it, like you, are seeing it as if the story is changing a bit or the initial story is not getting played out, those who are making assumptions.  They are not playing out, these people go out, you people are in your world, long term, long term, Lal Lal, change is taking place here, after that bye time, do you have any world, brother, this has happened, you will say, oh no, otherwise it is long.  It was for the term, tell me again, you have to leave, by then everyone came to know that now no one is going to buy from you, so the wise man is always in the market, you are in the market for a long term life, term you don't get married.  If you invest even in marriage, then till the time you have the life of all the seven births, no, no, no, whenever sir, whatever you thought, you are not playing out the time, you move on and what do you have to do in that, whenever you invest, you  Not only monitor these, your radar is running in other places also that someone else is getting good, someone else is getting good and someone else is getting good. If you get something good, then consider all of them like a garden and take them out. Water your flowers. What do people do? They give water to their video. This rate has reduced, I will give water now, it will increase and if you take four paise less in the flower, then you plug the flower. If it is the opposite, then you have to buy those stocks in that company for the long term.  In real estate, where the cash flow remains high, some story or the other is going well, if you have deposited it in the bank, you have deposited it in a paint company, in a company selling products to someone, then everything is going well, its debt is under control.  Corporate governance is fine, product is fine, cash flow is increasing quarter on quarter, if not half yearly, revenues are increasing, there are no losses, there are free cash flows, business is doing well, the company is playing out the story that was your jumption. promised  We had said that we will do the same, this is our vision, this is the position, so everything is going well, but you have to monitor it, you cannot do it like this, I just did it and I did not want to see anything, mutual will not reach anywhere by doing it like this.  There is a lot of confusion even among the funds, if the mutual fund is not performing then it will open another mutual fund and then it will perform a little, make the smaller one perform.  And it remains easy, I will tell the government every time that it should not allow more than five mutual funds, one big cap, midcap, small cap, something with hybrid data, each one of them is opening 100-100, 200-200, what does it mean?  He is buying stocks, check the first 10, he will get 30% of the money, first 10, first 20, 50% of the money and then the last one.  50% of the money is in 50 stocks, various averages of van to van point of, where will we get the retention from this, it is not multiplying, if people do not do anything, then do not even invest in mutual fund, but this mutual fund has done right, not by doing. Can you people say no, I do n't have time, if not, then money is a wish, there is no time, you have to waste time in talking, doing social media, if you want to reduce everything, then you don't have time to learn.  Pass, it is just told to you that you outsource it to Advise. If a person manages it in his own way then there is nothing wrong if he understands the tricks of trade because you have a lot of control when the market is not doing well and money is not being withdrawn or put in.  If you want, then you can do it in your news and what is happening in mutual funds, even if you want to invest, the world is just going out and no one is investing money and the fund manager has to sell good stocks at low rates to propose them.  There is no time, this is what happens in the market, the fool accepted short term, remove long term from your life, you have to be an invested life, no, it has to be called long term, long term and long term and investment is there only till the time. Your investment piece is working out. The investment thesis has been running for 15 years. For the Titan example, you will have to hold on to the next one only then you will get a hundred.  But if you go then don't look at 10x and 100x. We have to see whether that investment, the investment thesis, the story, is playing out or not, or has there been a change in it, has there been a change in the business environment or in the business.  There will be a change or there will be a change in the management or in the intentions of the management or in the product that now you feel that the story will not work then you should leave and you are feeling that no.  Man, by making all these positive changes, he is making something or the other, earlier he was making jewellery, now he is also making spectacles, now he is doing this also, now he is doing something else too, so tell me as an example, like an example of something.  If it is necessary to take then if such a thing is playing out in your life then you should keep going then there is no short term or long term and if you had invested the money now and after 2 months you came to know that this is this.  If it was then there is no need to wait for long term because someone told you that you should invest for long term, it is not like this, you take out your cut, learn and cut your losses, many times wrong decisions are taken in life.  No more decisions because when any stock comes from ₹ 100 to ₹ 10, it does not come in a day, from 100 to 90, it comes from 90 to 80, from 80 to 70 again.  It remains at 60, then falls to 40, then comes back like this, and the man in it says long term, long term, long term, then why should I sell even for 40, then why should I sell even for 30, why should I even ask for 20?  If it goes to 10, then when the story is over and there is a noise shot, then you get out of it, whenever you get realization and always remain in the market. Keep watching Rai's loss from Office Ice.  What is happening where you have put it, nothing happens by doing buy and forget, people will teach, explain, buy and forget, nothing happens in life, you have to monitor this happening and if it is doing well, you have to monitor, high it is doing, monitor date same.  Because date same can change same is changing de first time sign of change should be B R Ambedkar Attention is not there, attention came only when I reached here then when you go to sell everyone has come to know  It is not worth buying, then you are stuck, even in real estate, this happens with people, this happens in many places, it is okay, so please try in life that this does not happen to you, like the channel, subscribe, stay tuned, thank you very much video  Share Thank You"

    "content": "Hello friends this is going to be a very interesting and high learning video I am making this video because many of my subscribers who happen to be subscribers of this utter also have sent me questions so that's why the video is being made the topic of the video will be Airbnb and  Goa and why you should not invest in Goa and Airbnb at all and you will get clear cut clarity on this so there is a popular YouTuber who is Goa based who does finance but now mama tune changes are coming on real estate And some real estate courses and he is talking about real estate and in this he has talked a lot about real estate in a video, I will put it in the link, but I am India's number one clarity giver of real estate, now he will say  He also last time he wrote on Twitter something who has given you real estate clarity, one does not give, one has to take it and you watch this entire video till the end you tell my audience whether I am number one or not, what did he say in the video Too  I will tell you, but if you see his videos generally, he takes an escape route by telling something as an influence on everything, I can be wrong, see this, see that, like this and I will cover each thing one by one, but why did I say I M number one I turn off the keys like Amitabh Bachchan in the movie Deewar I will not give myself any escape whatever I say will happen and it will not happen or it does not happen you can whip me, troll me, write comments, unsubscribe, do whatever you want to do, clear your cut  By putting your neck in such a way, with respect, all in that it is convincing that she is not in anyone else, that's why, otherwise I am number one, so I got this answer clearly, now let's start Air BNB, he has told about some short term rentals in Goa Commercial utilization is better and property is affordable in Goa. There is no benefit in big cities because rental is lower in big cities. Some example of Ayodhya has also been given. It has become very expensive in Ayodhya too, that is not beneficial, he has completely explained that.  have said such things Also come come to Goa, do Airbnb in Goa, it will be very beneficial, it will be very good but the points that have been put in each and every thing, God lies in the details, wherever it has been discussed in the details, it has become vague, so in seven eight points  I will cover it. I will cover such points which they have not seen and they will come to know that this can also happen. I had never thought of this. So I will definitely get four or five points and if they want to answer the rest then it will be discussed again.  You can make a video or your butt still he sucks I call myself Guruji from Gurugram again who made it, I made it, okay everything has to be made by yourself, you have to brand it, you have to do it cutely, you have to do it confidently and as far as many times what  It happens many times that people get confused on the channels, hey, he has 20 lakh subscribers, hey, what are the total views, I also have five channels, you can go to Social Blade and find out what the impact is, there is no such thing, okay, so full knowledge  I am trying to make this video with and wisdom seven  Eight point, I will tell you guys, Akshat ji, his name is 2021 and on his channel in 22, as he told that he went to Goa and was beaten, everything in Goa was beaten because of Covid, so property was available cheap, rental is a function of  The cost price of your property is that you buy a property worth Rs 1 crore, or Rs 1.5 crore, or Rs 2 crore, and if the rent is divided by the rent, then the rent will be less for the expensive properties, so what are you going to do in 2024? What have you done? You cannot be a premise  ok who are you because in the video he said to me hey have you invested in Goa where do you get such talk for around 15 minutes he teased me a bit by doing this okay hey bhaiya I am crazy I will do it to you there  It is necessary to drink alcohol to know what its ill effects are, it is necessary to do drugs to know what its effects are, is there a naked electric wire that needs to be held or else it will give an electric shock, do you want to do it by losing money by playing future or options, do you want to do it? want that i should invest in goa  Get sub optimal returns lose money because I will tell you why you will lose money if you put in Goa in next five years, the facts are logical, it is not of such a lower level, it is just a scripture type debate that bhaiya someone has told some story, I will tell my story  I am telling you, you tell me, all the stories are correct, which one do you think has more probability, which one seems logical to you, which one helps you in decision making, which one does not leave you hanging, any of my videos, any advice, any take away  It is not hanging, brother, you should check it because I am a real estate consultant also, the advice is completely clear cut, if you follow that advice, that advice will be fine, its quality is good, bad, it can be judged but the advice will be clear cut at least  It should be clear, as consultants, our job is to give clear cut information, not to leave any confusion, that you should check this, you should check this, but this also happens, this also happens, so only clear cut advice will be given. First of all, he has said in the video that 200 days  It is charged on rental in Goa and you calculate it, I question this, this is the premium and they are saying that it can be 250 for 200, I am saying it is not 200, it is 150 at best, otherwise it can be 100 as well  I tell him that I am in Goa from April to October and incidentally I am in Goa, it's not like I sit on the sofa and make videos, so I did not go to Goa, I just went and came back after facing a lot of difficulties for 15 days, that's why I was waiting for you, actually something like this  I will make the video only if the video is made. Okay, so I am telling you after understanding everything completely and anyway the rice is cooked, there is no need to eat it raw. Do you ask if there is sugar in the tea or not, then after drinking the entire tea, you will not tell that  There was no sugar in it, so it could be known even after drinking one sip, so those are many days because Goa is only 140 km away from here, from here to here Goa is 140 km away from 20  There is a 30 kilometer long coastline here, in the middle there is their Dublin Airport, a new airport has come up, I am going to tell this story, now listen carefully what happened next, it is not 200 days because from April to October brother it is hot, otherwise there is summer  I will also go there, yes I will go, the hotel rates are so cheap, the rates of good hotels are so cheap, why would anyone go to your Airbnb for 5 days, 10 days, 15 days, if even a five star hotel remains closed, no one comes, there is no cleaning, then it stinks, there are issues  They go for maintenance, they have told so much here, I only want to ask them one thing that since you live in Goa, you have got it managed by your manager, so it means that this challenge cannot be managed even while living there, when you come from outside  Get it managed, brother, the rental yield that is being generated, that rental yield will be eaten up by the manager in commission, no, it is 20, it is 25, he is charging the room on hourly basis, how is he charging, how will you monitor it, you people drive a taxi  take that taxi Give it to the driver, many times the driver himself is earning money by driving the taxi, but you gave it to someone else, the engine oil has gone bad, there is a problem in the gear oil, the tyre has burst, this person took it, the challan has been issued. This has just happened, the scratch has come, this has come, this is where the money remains, yes, it is so easy, tell me the alternative choices, if you don't want to do this then what should you do and those who are associated are going to enjoy it a lot, they have organized a workshop in June  It is for some 1000 rupees. Join my telegram group. In the next five months, I will make you so knowledgeable for free that you will go there and impart knowledge and ask the right questions or it is possible that you will not go because you will become India's number two. I will be one and you all will be number two.  Listen carefully, the thing that comes next is that this calculation is a colour, I came there after meeting the fishermen, I met the boatman, they say sir nothing happens here, who will come here in June, July, August, in this much heat, the hotels are in a bad shape, five star hotels  People keep getting beaten up, who will go to Air BNB, Air BNB is not even Pan India  It's ok, I will make very good videos on that too and explain it a lot because now they are not saying that mine is working, hey, investment decisions are not in the rear view because your rates were low in 2021-22, revenge tourism happened in 2023, now in that tourism, so hotels  Look at the shares of , where have they gone from, because they also talk about shares, so you will understand where have the shares gone from, all these hoteliers, revenge tourism has happened, look at the airlines, where have the bookings gone from, I mean, have any more bookings been made?  That much will happen in 2024 or 25, that is another thing, 200 days is another thing, then the biggest thing that you did not tell is the local politics of Goa, if I tell you seven-eight points, the video will be long but you have to understand because this is big money and this target  Who is the audience and who is going to get trapped, I will also tell you who is going to get trapped in this investment, who is that age group and what is their profile, I will also tell you that, it is going to be very interesting  These youngsters have their father's money and that money will be saved, they are going to pitch it to their father also that look this is a very good idea because there are jobs, it is not being shown that going there will be able to survive, it will not be possible, I am telling you this, I am saving your money Listen carefully, we did not discuss local politics. The people of Goa are fed up that so many outsiders have come from outside. As a tourist they were very welcome because they earn money from it, but now these outside investors, businessmen and they Everyone is coming and the culture itself is changing, the vibe of Goa is changing, what was Goa for us, it gives us peace like this, Dil De Badle Mein song is playing, relaxation pause, now there that dhichak dhichak aau tunak tunak tunak  Tu tum ta ta tu and that goes on till 11 o'clock, melt it down Goa nuisance, you will find North Indians there, how troubled the local people are, look at the politics of Goa, 40 one seats, no government of theirs is clear, sometimes people vote for it four  -Five parties have been formed  Firstly there is Congress and BJP, there are three-four more parties with them, look at their MLAs, how many come and some jump from here to here, some jump from here to here, there is some stability in the way the government runs but what am I trying to say When in the coming times the sentiment of the Goan people will come that this is happening, then the politicians can change things because here it comes to licenses, they are saying that if you take the license, you will get it and then they even take the license  You can go at any time, if this nonsense is happening, then ask in the society whether there is air ban also, today the society says it is allowed, tomorrow it says it is not, your decision making cannot be done because brother you are planning to invest two, two and a half, three, four or five crore rupees  Thinking that you can't be on ifs and buts, you can't be on that the manager will be good because there they say that look your marketing skills should be good, there should be a funnel, for ay it is easy that yes I am so much better than 20 lakhs  Subscriber is coming to Goa, come to my villa, do this So you will get it, from where will a normal man get it, you will spend money on marketing sales, you will give that manager 200-250 days, then that booking will not be yours, where will you save the money, I will explain it with the example of the farmer, from agriculture, since I come from Haryana and  I also have a channel called I am the Guruji from Gurugram. It sounds good that friends have 20 acres, 10 acres, people come to me for consultation, Guruji, grow mushrooms, grow flowers, grow cabbage, because brother  Vegetables are expensive, so wheat keeps growing in all these places, cumin keeps growing, sugar keeps growing, it takes a lot of effort to grow them, it seems like a lot of money is spent in it, do you have that much time and energy or not, someone else can manage it.  If he does it then he will eat up everything from you which cannot be managed by staying local, you have given big rules, thirdly my main point is that local politics can change anything at any time, it is necessary to get into so much conflict  The Portuguese land law is somewhat applicable. If the land was so clear, then these big players would not have come. These big listed players would not have gone and laundered so many things. If the land was so clear, then the chances of getting trapped are high. You would not have got it.  It has to be clear, you have to get the license, you have to do marketing, you have to find a manager, if you find a local manager, he will misbehave, you cannot get him out of anything, local politics, that mischief can backfire, if you bring someone from outside with you, it will be costly because the person is from Bihar, UP or anywhere else  If he goes and does it in Goa, then he will charge more money, a local person may be doing 10 jobs and then he may do it for cheaper, then this is your problem just because you have a license and some scandal happened there, because as soon as a scandal happens  There are these, unfortunately, and it doesn't feel good to even say that, that is what happened, before that there was a politician from Haryana, there was also a Tik Toker earlier, and she was murdered, okay, so all these means, these rumours are spreading here brother, it  Not Easy Risk Reward  Look at the ratio, look at the conflict for the amount, you have to get it at 6, I will get it for you and when it comes to capital appreciation, they say you should look at capital appreciation, so if you buy stocks for rental also, do you buy them only for dividend or  % or would you like that the stock of ₹ 1000000 should go up to 90 and he gives it to you at 6, even then you will incur a loss of ₹ and that is not sustainable, I will tell you why this problem is going to happen friend  No one talked about Laxmideep, no one talked about the port player, this Mamma tune changes like this, everything will become Indian, the Indian tourists are not loyal, they are increasing the crowd in Goa but you tell me this, the most expensive thing in Goa  If the thing is going by air, if I take the example of Delhi, the price of Delhi to Goa Goa to Delhi air ticket is so much, if you book it in October, November, December, January, February, that air ticket is so expensive  Then after going there it does not make any difference that you are staying there for two Hajj and you have to go for three days or four days, the Hajj bill will also come more because you are paying up to Rs 10, 11, 12 or 15,000 for the air ticket itself I am telling you recently, I had gone there last month, so I will tell you the main thing that Lakshmideep Port Blair and we have all this, there is no talk of appreciation as to whether everything can be about rental. because ultimately if everybody has bought houses there because when you go to South Goa from Dabun and leave from the airport you can see that flats after flats are being built, flats after flats are being built, now you don't say that I am a Bhaiya, which region will I go to if I have to stay in a flat in Goa in Air BNB, then what is the problem in Gurgaon, the swimming pool is visible from there as well, what do you say to me from that flat, I cannot see the sea  yes the sea  It is 4 km away, 3 km away, so I will go for a walk in the morning, then I will come back, then after taking a bath, I will go for a walk somewhere, then I will come back, then I will have lunch, then oh brother, for my entertainment, I want that same sea, shacks worth 800 Rs.  It is like that, only the sea is visible, people who have a low budget, all go to see the sea and they have to eat food during the day, there is no arrangement for eating food, if you have to cook Tinda Lauki yourself and eat it, then your wife will say, I will ignore it  I will make a big sit down comedy in which I have a fresh incident that someone I know died in this way and what is his condition but I will tell that on a different channel and separately that how rubbish this Air BNB system is in India. Why is it popular in and out of contact and why wo n't it happen in India because we are different, okay so one thing is that this Air BnB many people also use proxy to convert my hair color into it, you saw in malls  There will be malls inside malls  Shops lie vacant somewhere, no one comes to do anything, but why are you open, are you paying rent here or your goods are not selling, there are employees, these things are also done, I will add these expenses or do it brother, in this  There are also limitations, all your income is counted as residential income. If you get ₹1 rent, it is calculated as 0. You get a rebate of 30 from the government. The government says that you took ₹1 rent for residential area, we will consider only 70 of yours and will impose tax beyond that.  There will be tax on everything the biggest thing is that tie tie fish will be the argument I am just telling you the argument of finance no I will show you the expenses how much percentage can you show tell me you can ask that from the CA hey the fapa sitting here Number one reality, clarity giver of real estate, I am sitting here, I am giving the clarity, you can ask him, you can ask him what is it here, I am telling you everything, you can force rental ID at 8 there. Look, there is a lot of goods to sell there, if builders build it then there is a story, goods are sold only through the story, do I tell stories, yes I also tell stories, now you are in Goa, hey brother, to sell it in Goa, do you have to pass the IET AAM exam  It is there and who knows, maybe I have those exams too, if you have to do it then I can show you my admit card and exam and marks, okay then show me yours, tell me who you are, this is personalized, I have done this, how I did, how I did it  There is got no meaning because people who are on youtube, that man with crores can do anything brother, he will do 10 things, he will get four hits and from that he will earn so much money by showing that he will incur a loss of six rupees and in the loss  He will say that I too had invested, hey, people had invested in crypto currency, people got stuck in the world, now you will give a dialogue that I am a beggar, I will pick up my bag and go away, hey, you are a beggar, you will pick up your bag and go away What would have remained behind, you have spread it by giving knowledge because there are many youth  20-30 people who are from good families, wealthy families and are not doing anything else, they trouble their fathers by watching these videos, their fathers come to us because they don't have wisdom, everyone is roaming around with information and knowledge, half-rubbish  Tell me the thing, this happens, this happens, this happens, this happens, this happens then this does not happen, he gave the example of Ayodhya ji that there are so many rates in Ayodhya, hey Ayodhya ji is timeless, Ram Lalla's temple is only there, he cannot go anywhere.  Beach in India, beach in India, brothers and sisters, there is that Mandvi beach of Gujarat and there is also one above it, from the Run of Kutch, I am telling you the geography, from the Run of Kutch, the entire Indian peninsula is ocean, not much, all of it is beach, oh, not all of it is beach, I can also say  I have been there but it is so much, it is so many thousand kilometers long, so even if there is a beach in it, then there are ten kilometers of beach, it is just that it has not been discovered, you go to your Port Blair, from Port Blair, you write to me, which is that, two-three-three  There are beaches where there are such wonderful beaches  Thing it is just to be discovered, once Lakshmandeep starts then Goa will not be such a great place sir and the math of Goa which I did brother, Phuket is much cheaper to come and go, I am telling you about the five star hotel, five star hotel Delhi ex Delhi going  To Goa and going to Phuket, staying there for five days in five stars, okay, Phuket is cheaper, please go and check, then you people will have to remove this ghost of Air BNB of Goa, I have received a lot of appreciation in Ayodhya ji  When I had told people on Ayodhya ji 2 years ago to buy it on my channel Sango Life Sut, I had told about it, many people appreciated it and bought it because my advice comes only when the cream has not been eaten, now the cream has already been eaten there  Now I am not saying that go and take it, now I am not saying that at this rate it will become a buy, yes, now at that rate everything has been factored because everything has been made but the same thing I am saying Goa  In it is not a bye am, here my aim is not to come and tell me if you have some points on them, it's a flop show, it's a flop show, try it, the risk reward ratio is not favourable for 2024  It is not on price, there is a lot of supply coming, what will happen in the end is that if these flats become so expensive then no one will be able to live here. There are no white collar jobs here, there is no IT sector of any kind here, something  It is not happening here, there is only alcohol, relaxation and music, now the music has become loud, there is no control over the alcohol, people create a big mess, tourists from outside come and are overrated and say that you should go by cycle and you should stay in the villa  Where are you going to send the child, vehicles are running, there is a high-fi resort with a safe surround environment, you can do it there, you have taken some beach, it is a cheap, rubbish beach, somewhere like Anjuna beach, Bagh beach, I mean, fishing, it is like this.  that it is normal there  Why should a man go away, it means you have taken your woman along, you have taken the daughter of your family along, that crowd is such that you will not feel comfortable and where you will feel comfortable, then the rates increase so much, who will come and tell you this  You have to go to a hotel and stay in a room there your sister and wife have to cook rotis and you have to eat tindas and gourds, then postpone the vacation, vacation is about enjoying and relaxing, not eating and washing utensils and even if you provide so many facilities, your margin will be  What is it then it would be better if you say that you should stay there, if I am giving you this much then I have not told you these figures, these calculations, I have told you half the knowledge, I am giving you complete knowledge, it is not worth it because if you do it well then money is nothing  You will be saved brother, there is a simple thing in Goa, you should see the sea, I am going with this much ticket, if I have to stay in a flat then there are some flats in Gurgaon and Noida, you can stay in them, otherwise you will go by walking the cycle, hey, go by riding the cycle  It is not safe, the roads are so narrow and the place where it is being sold is called a village, village, meaning village, not a good village but the real village, there is nothing there, it is not worth it, where is the sewerage going, where is the pipeline going  Which thing is going where, RERA is cleared or not, land is not cleared, there are one and a half crore issues, it's not worth touching it with the barge pole, not worth even going and checking, I even went and roamed around and did all this work as well  I have gone there and seen that Goan Goans are treating these people who are coming from outside and everyone is capturing them, earlier as a tourist they were very welcome, then the pent up anger will come out in politics, it will come out in two or three years, you will see the second one.  You will see Lakshadweep coming, Port Blair will appear shining, Phuket is already yours, so there is no magic going to happen in Goa, that is what I am trying to do, so if you get stuck there, after buying some villas, brother, there is no use of it.  Is You have kept that white elephant, you will live in some other city, the rents will increase or decrease, property will be appreciated, it will decrease, it will increase, something will happen, now I come to the alternative choices right now in Kolkata, in Pune, in Bangalore, in Chennai, big ones  If you don't say city, then people, you are talking about Gurgaon, I did not even mention Gurgaon, although there are 6 stories in Gurgaon too with rental interest between 50 lakhs to 1 crore plus capital appreciation plus the money will be spent in two-three years plus Mawan Construction Plus Capital Appreciation for Short Shot High Returns When Money is Going Slowly You Get Absolute Returns at 10 Also Since Money is Going Slowly It Will Work Out at CAGR 18 In Singles The Property is Given to You Your Kick in at 6  It will be done and check how much loan is available for rent for doing this commercial thing, check how much loan is available for residential and income tax benefits are also available for residential  That when you do a program, you get caught in the GST issue, you take the CA separately and keep crying, you will not understand, look, these people who are running these companies, they have not given complete knowledge, brother, you are running a private limited, running some company, it becomes easy  Because you can spread 50 raita, I did all this by looking at my example again and again, it does not make any difference, if what I am saying is logical, I am saying it logically, then what am I doing  Who am I, what flags have I planted, what have I done, I have no meaning because whatever I did, I did it at a different time, here I should know how to drive very well, you have not driven the car, and you are saying that fast  Driving a car causes accidents. Have you ever driven a car? Do you know what speed is? You already know that if you drive at high speed, drive after drinking alcohol, or drive at night, there are chances of an accident. You have to try this.  Or will I not die after getting stuck in Goa? Karrr a man is saying no, things are going very well for me hey bhaiya when did you buy the property, tell me the year, tell me the year it was the dead year of Covid, tourism was down, there was frustration so it was bye, why are you talking about 2024 and then saying  ho that I did that, it is like parents doing it, that when we used to study, our results were like this, we became like this, you cannot do it, oh brother, at that time so many children did not use to participate in the competition, poor children did not use to participate, now poor children  If the child is carrying a phone then the competition has increased, when there are so many jobs in the competition, check these 180 IAS vacancies, it has been going on for the last 40 years and how many people are attempting and how many people will get the knowledge, then come holistically  I want to tell you clearly, no ifs and buts avoid Goa Air BnB Properties, it is definitely a very top player because now what frenzy is being built up, an atmosphere is being created, India's biggest shark, top most developer of real estate, in the next six  in the month  If it is going on, we know that the atmosphere is being created, so you have to see where the value for money is, join my Telegram group, I conduct webinars, I will do some webinars by taking money, some I will do for free, but brother, I will not do anything worth Rs. 11,000, no one will do that much  It is not expensive, ₹ 50 is ours, it is a two digit coin and that too for auspicious purpose, so that when a window shopper comes, he can pay for his vehicle, you are in a mall, even if you don't want to shop, you can come, otherwise I cannot control the crowd when I become number one I have educated people at LAX through my webinars over a period of time, so those people have benefited from LAX in real time. I get value for money. Things I also tell stories. Not all stories are true, like the stories I told before marriage. All the things that are told are not true that she will do this, she will do this, this will happen, but it is a game of probability, the story that has been told here by these tubers, there are a lot of holes in it, a lot of holes and whatever I have told you guys openly and at the end Anytime any look can make a mistake  It may be possible, but since you have to see how much potential the person who is advising you has to lose money, the person who is earning 10-15 crores, ca n't he invest 50-60 lakhs in crypto, ca n't he play all the games, antique furniture, antique paintings etc.  No, it was non-fungibility, now where did he go, it is possible that he leaves Goa in a year or a year and a half, then you say now let's go to Goa, now this will do well, now you will say what happened to his story, what happened to him, why in stocks also  So this is what happens, you need money for everything HDFC, so brother give the advice accordingly because whatever will be said, no matter how many disclaimers you put like don't take it or take it at your own risk or this is for study, these people will still  Do you think moral responsibility is not legal, I also agree but a creator cannot run away from moral responsibility, you have to give your reasoning, you have to give your clear cut opinion that this is how it is, there will be no capital appreciation here, no problem  You give this to him, you give him the marketing, he just needs to know a little bit about marketing, marketing is the most life-threatening thing, where will the marketing happen from, we know how to generate views here, how to make videos, brothers and sisters, please subscribe  Hey increase your subscribers, increase them, increase them, then come in such a wide that it becomes more lux millions, I will sell you bad now because I am this and who is he, this is age shaming only, hey, I am not saying this  Respect all the elders, but as it is said in body shaming or age shaming, uncle is uncle, uncle means the uncle will not have the knowledge, I am not even an uncle, but I am saying that even if I am an uncle, I may become more technology-fed I Have done stuff which is more technological and other wise but what is that challenge, you tell me so I am saying that my content will speak like Sachin Tendulkar's batting, will speak when Magro and one will troll him only those sixes and fours  If he hits me, I will reply with that only, so I will reply with this only, I will not come and type Vivek Bindra Maheshwari like this, okay, I will tell you my logic here, I say that is the way I understand real estate, nobody is approaching it  That's the way real estate is a mother-in-law and daughter-in-law problem, real estate is a marriage issue, how is this friend, everything in real estate is linked brother, a family issue, no one is sitting with the money, no one can invest it alone and once the investment is over, you are finished.  Donkey uncle or stupid brother in law or maternal uncle gets declared whose money is lost, no one takes any advice from you anywhere in Greater Noida, does nothing to you and now people will do the same thing by putting it here, then Air BNB Goa is no more  There is no point in attending any workshop, I will tell you openly that there is no need to attend any workshop, there is no need to do any real estate service course, take my membership, you will get it at a cheap rate, it will be available at Rs 20, 50 or 100 cost per mille  will And you will get company, you will get practical, brother, you can run PG in Mukherjee Nagar, Rajendra Nagar also, then you won't get it at 2, you will go to Delhi, Mumbai, hey brother, a lot is happening in Delhi, Mumbai, brother, if you play this game here also, then go to Mukherjee Nagar Someone will play this in Gurgaon, people are playing this on sixty yards, go and check in Deal Face, people have bought plots worth 10 lakhs each, built houses worth 12 lakhs, the rent comes to Rs 1 lakh per month, rent is 22 lakhs per lakh  Not for a year, not for a year, it comes to 30 lakhs, but the return on 180 is not rental every month, but now its rate has increased, now it will become two and a half to three crores, yes, still paying 6T, still paying 6% Many locals are considering things as their own and giving them otherwise value for money is the city for small ticket size, Bangalore is for high rental, do you know what is the rental story of Bangalore, okay, memes are made there, then he checks Lincoln's profile.  Landlord takes 6 months advance, I will also cover Pune, Kolkata, Ahmedabad, I will put it there, instead of getting a white elephant of 2.5, 3.4 CR here, instead of this 2.5, 3.4 CR, you can buy five small flats in five cities where the capital  There will be appreciation as well and if ever you need it, you can sell it and the cash flow will increase. You know here you are depending on fancy and fancy products. I have told you this earlier as well, do not buy it anywhere in tourist places because there the local  Man is very dominant, people recently came up with Maruti factory in Kharkhoda, they thought that they will become rich there, the local economy will gain, they will let it operate there, they will not let yours operate there, that program will be operated that way, it is easier said than done, even the people living there  If you are giving yours, just like he is giving it, then you should understand it, so I hope you liked it, I hope it was not meant to belittle anyone or to do something like this, but come brother, spread confusion on those subjects where we are professor number one.  If it is there then it is for the clarity of the students So Professor sahab will definitely come, there is no doubt about it, when he has gone so far that I should keep quiet, no, if I remain quiet and the wrong information is coming and there is no clarity, then this will be told and it will be explained properly.  These are fancy products, you should not enter here at all, there is a lot of money, a lot of spray, even if you are sitting with money, you should not enter here, whether the money is less or more, it is for Goa, if you want a detailed video with all more facts, more facts about Goa,  Culture of Goa, food of Goa, crowded roads in Goa, in November-December every house in Goa becomes an Air BnB, every house of the rich and poor is not typed as Air BnB, it is open, they all shift to one place in an outhouse and complete the work there.  It is available for rent and he climbs, but brother, he climbs only for two months, throughout the year, then there is tie tie fish, so the locals manage to survive there, bed and breakfast is required, food is required, no one wants to take Loki Inde and eat there, those who have small children All the things are available in good hotels, everybody does n't care about non veg, it's very good there  You get a lot of idlis, take potato puri, take paratha, take dosa, I am just telling you the whole menu, I am a foodie, take chana bhatura, you will get 25 kinds of fruits, you will get 10 kinds of juices, that too is tasty, you have gone for a holiday, people are getting confused  Who enjoys eating Tinda? If I have to go there to eat it, I will sit in Gurgaon and eat it. Why do I need to go there and face the hassle? Just go there and see the sea for an hour and come back. The rest of the time you can go to your Air BNB because I don't need it.  I have to pay rental yard Rs 6 but that is why I have come here brother, people go there to cut stones, there is no fun there, once a person goes to Airbnb, he never goes there again, his wife does not go in his family, she says I don't want to go to the house  I had got a maid for shopping, you will get all the work done by me there, I will make a very good video on this too if you guys want because the creator likes to do what the audience wants, okay and that is what you all want  ok so how is it Click on the comment section of the video and write whatever you feel after this video, write it logically and go and watch their video as well, although the issues are the ones that were arranged and I have explained it to everyone very well and my  But if there is any counter point then tell me brother, we will make the video again. Here I do not even need any editor, here it is one shot, 50 minutes, one by one shot, this video stopped somewhere, something like shik shik shik shik happened like in your house.  I explained it sitting comfortably, without moving, without any movement, it meant shik shik pick pick and somewhere else, I do n't speak so fast in English, I don't say this, make it 1.5x so that you cannot understand my main point  You just let me say something in the figures, make some parts, so that no one can ask them any question, and wherever there is a loose hand, leave it there and take the escape route, I did not give myself any escape in this whole video, I am not a clear cut person  Goa no airbnb finished clear cut 2024  There is nothing at the rate of , earning money is speculative, it is over hyped and if you don't understand then go and travel for five days, whatever I told you, you will understand it yourself, you will understand the whole thing yourself  You will understand it and there is no need to attend any workshop, I will do the ₹ 1000 workshop for ₹ 50 depending on my mood because those career charges have to be paid, so below 100 if you want, brothers and sisters, to attend webinars and do something else Even if it is free, you can join the t gra group given in the comment section where all these notifications are made and all the information is given. I hope you guys enjoyed the video. Share it and share it with their subscribers so that their subscribers can also get the knowledge.  I get them and their subscribers become my subscribers and I get cheap publicity this way, people say that you take the name of cheap publicity, yes cheap publicity, everyone is cheap, even politicians, actors, who is crazy to spend money on it, I mean me  If I spend crores of rupees for publicity, if this is happening then it is good, but I used my hard work and made the video using my mind and applied logic to everything, I applied logic on each and every point, the shares taken at the rates of 2021-22 are also very good  There are all of them, buy them now, whether the payout ratio is 70, 80 or 90, whatever it is, if there is no growth, if the competitor's product is about to be ready then buy it because brother I have and hey, what is this I have and brother what are you that your  Follow in the footsteps of what ever you have achieved and anybody who has achieved has been achieved in a different time frame, today is a different time frame, nobody can copy, anybody, nobody knows how success is achieved like this, but where does success come from? how does it happen nobody knows anything, everybody gets lucky and then they come because there is a limit to the knowledge of finance, everyday they come and do the same things  But how many topics will you make? I have five channels and I will open two more and I will be India's number one YouTube in terms of subscribers on different channels and the impact I make. So I am working on it. I have no fear of competition at all.  Someone's but I am telling you people that real estate is a very important thing to learn because if there is a problem in mutual funds then you do not invest two and a half crores in mutual funds and you do not even buy a single fund but in real estate  If there is a problem, then a loan has been taken and the fraud has happened and the interest is being spent and the fraud has happened and the money is not coming, then it is very important to know and understand about real estate and nobody else is teaching till now because now theirs too  The course we are doing, no one was doing it till now and no one is doing it at the mass level that I am doing it at. What ever knowledge of real estate he is bringing is shoppers' knowledge is superficial knowledge, it is childish knowledge, it is all  T  Keeping yourself as a centre, brother, my kids are small, I have to eat in Airbnb. Hey brother, there are people with grown up kids, there are also people without kids, India is very big today, if I make a video, I cannot make a video about what is going on in my life.  According to my life, my life is different. I am a different kind of man. I have a different kind of life. That means everything will continue like this in India. I cannot impose the trends of life on myself as to what I want. I belong to a very small class. Those who have small kids, their wife can do the cooking, you need to go, they also get fed up there because you require support, there is support inside the house also, then why is Airbnb successful in foreign countries and why is it not successful in India I will also tell you that the standard outside is different, things are different, the system is different, one video would be very long, otherwise I will tell you very clearly about Air BNB, that if you want to go abroad, then how is India because in Goa you will experience such things  There are places like this in the streets  one does not feel safe, one does not see another person, you want to stage, yes you are seeing many tourists, people are according to your language, according to your that way, so that you can feel a little safe, go anywhere with your head held high, take your family anywhere  Keep it there and if some rude fellow tourist comes, look, the locals are very nice, I am not saying anything like that, but if some nonsense fellow tourist comes and you are staying in a limited area, I have experienced this  From people's experience because whoever comes there comes to do the program, you know what program happens there and after doing it, many people are left shaken, so where do you have to stay, it is a very important thing, with your face raised  You cannot stay with your family somewhere like this that I will go to Air BNB, the room next to yours has four boys in front, what will you do then, you are making noise going up and down, then whom will you go to, your experience is getting spoiled, will you take that risk and people  why are these things getting worse and he is not doing anything like that  You can complain to the police or anyone if someone says Namaste to your wife Babi ji then what charges will you levy Bhabhi ji Namaste then the person is saying have you done anything Bhaisahab I have not done anything Bhaisahab Bhabhi ji Namaste you have to act and only then you can get the number  I am one only then I am number one because I understand 200 things which people will not bring out, even though the video is long but I understand and what you do now, four Bhabhis are saying Namaste, they are not doing anything, what charge will you put by going there, actually something  I am not doing it but that is enough to make you feel uncomfortable, so with this raised face, such Air BNs do not work in India and one should not go like this and should not buy them and Goa is no Air BN B is no, thank you very much to the channel.  Like, share, subscribe and make people aware, brother, make videos with so much effort so that the ghosts of people are exorcized, these people who come to offer, sometimes they offer the world, sometimes they offer crypto, sometimes they will offer this and after that become a fakir  that we will leave and then we will say don't talk about that because this one  It will take 5 years for a thing to fail in the world, it happened suddenly, so in that it happened like, oh my god, it happened suddenly, but this music, the music of Goa, will take five years to stop, it will stop and  These are the reasons I told, it will stop because of that, so please spread it, I don't say this on every video, I am saying this just to emphasize and also press the comment section and write, I also need clarity on how you like my content Bhaiya Hey you guys, are you not thinking that I am the only one, write more those who believe that I am the number one clarity giver and those who don't believe that no no you are also overhyped like Goa, then write that too, thank you very much"

    "title": "Should You Join The Family Business Or Pursue Another Job？ ｜ Exploring The Dilemma [n0lzeO4qYAg].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, this video is very interesting, it is a very common question, there is youth on Clarity, so I am giving the name of the channel to Clarity Youth, from the middle of this video, if you identify with it then it is very good and if you do not, then you will know from it what advice.  Honey, if you want, because my aim and intention is to make you all the consultants as well as you were the templates, I am giving some free in the series, some I will also give to the members, I am giving it to the members, I am the winner. You can also take membership of Youth on Clarity by pressing the join button. So today's topic is Should you join your father's business and do a job? If I say it more openly, then why should you join your father's business and do a job?  No, because brother, I am here to tell the society according to what is happening, the doctor does not have this choice, it is an eccentric affair, the second thing is that here I am the business, that is Mukesh.  Ambani and Adani ji are not taking it, so keep joining them, you will do it and you should also do it, there are no questions here today, when I am talking about business, I am talking about business, I am talking about small business. Small business will give you clarity on this, where this question arises, if father is doing a business of Rs 100 crore and you are getting a job worth Rs 2 lakh, if your father is getting it, then he is a businessman worth Rs 100-200 crore.  If you join then don't ask questions. If this question is being asked then it means touch and co or only then it is being asked then you have to understand that first of all my videos are second third order, you know it is okay otherwise what happens many times.  He has order thinking, what the old people are doing, they take away all the fun, we new people say, hey, what will you do, why won't you do business, brother, it depends, is it a plate business, is the poor guy in the middle of a vegetable or some factory in a ship?  Rakhi has been prepared to give a tyre. 500, 1000, 2010, it depends on the amount of thousand crores, so we will take it here as touch and that is also it can do this, it can also do this, which one should be done, what should be the template in both of them so that our decision making can be done which will give us the answer.  If we get a clear cut that we have to join father's team, then there will be a discussion on this, he is 25-26 years old, he is ahead of 21 to 25, only then the question arises that  What should be done, this is okay, then in this future, father's normal bill is B 47 48 4850, whatever this is, whatever will be in front of father and child, then if you look at father, he has a lot of time in front to reduce it till 60 years. Business people only do the job, they can also make money and don't answer, so that is the time, not so fast, means they can take decisions. Now you have to see that if you have to tighten two things, I will tell you very logically and I will tell that also.  I will also tell you what exactly needs to be done. Did you get your child to do some studies, is it related to business, did he get him to study business or engineering, or are you doing an engineering degree, or are you in the middle of a good life, or is it merchandise?  I wonder whether that addition is adding value. First of all, if it is adding value, then it is a very good thing. If you also have a restaurant and have done hotel management in it, is it okay or something like this?  If value is being added then it is a very good thing that he will be completely consumed because if you probably want to keep him as an employee then the same Note D child, then that is an easy answer but I am not easy, I will enter into difficult things also.  People, the second thing is that you have to understand that if the child is getting a job and he will enter into a stable job, then in the second half it may cost 60-70 thousand.  And his stable income which will be there in two to three years is Rs. 1 to 20 lakhs. Okay, so if he is joining his father's business and his father's business is ₹ 5 lakhs per month, it gives profit as expected on a regular basis.  What is the basis? Due to his joining, that profit is going to be Rs. 6.5 lakhs. If it is happening then only auspicious join de father business because there will be learning in it and there is own business and that dead lakh rupees which works here.  There too he is earning less and the value addition is more but if the business is ₹ 5 lakh and the work is only five out of five and father is getting relaxed that brother, I have reduced a lot Munna, now you be careful and father.  Out of those 5 lakhs, I am not going to give that boy 20-30-40 thousand in my pocket. What else do you need brother? If you get married in 23 years, 24 years, I will give you 40 if this one is less. If the boy is listening to me then don't join brother, father's bhajan, first you give yourself a job, do it yourself first and you show me that you understand that I have the capability, first tell yourself that I have the capability, that is why it is necessary for you to do the job.  You have gone into this question that if your life is not leading to growth in the business, then what is the use and when will father understand this thing, if you say it carefully, it is called disguised unemployment in the language of economics, how is that?  Let me tell you, if there is a farm in the village but two people are reducing it, now the third brother is also useless and is not reducing it. Must be his age or he is not getting a job. He also came to reduce it, so now he is reducing it.  But if that farm was giving ₹ 2 lakh to the mother, then will it be reduced to ₹ 4 lakh with the addition of her brother, because in a farm there is no limit on the crop and there is a retirement, you cannot add 50 people in such a farm. yes if only of two height  The line is your parcel and if it is not unlimited then this India is traveling in it. In this, the man feels that he is an employee. The society feels that he is an employee but there is no productivity. This is a disease and employment. He understands caste very well in economics. Everything is fine, I am explaining it here, watch it from the middle of the channel, it is free and you can understand it well, there is no need in life to survive in big schools and colleges, in great detail and  If you want to understand it better, then you can take membership of the channel there and you will get clarity through Veena, but we will come back to this point that if I want to do value add, then my income from 5 lakhs is not going to be 6.5 lakhs.  If your father goes to relax then don't do this because it is possible that this boy will keep doing a job worth Rs 2 lakh, there are many more promotion combinations which are in consultation.  More videos will come, you have to watch it in every situation, it is a very good video in which there are two brothers, brother and sister and what is the story, there is a daughter-in-law, that too will come, there will be tadka, now it is not so easy to say yes or no because what happens many times.  I will also tell you that it is okay so he has got a job and his wife does not want to do the job. She is getting a job worth Rs. 30-40. So father-in-law has some power in his business. In this, father-in-law can relax a bit and this is something.  There is the power of education and then by applying this mind and awakening the conscious mind and conscience, it can be done, take the business a little higher, maybe because it was in its 30s and 40s, in 30-40 it will go here, it will go there, if it is its own, then there is less of a home in it.  It is possible that if she goes there, it is possible that the daughter-in-law has come to the house, she is the queen, she does not have the capacity to tell her mother, she is not in the mood, or she is not a mother, or she wants to do something of her own, so she is doing something of her own by going there. Censor purpose is being served.  Is  And the family is also happy that the daughter-in-law has come, right, it means putting in and giving, right, she is involved in the household and right, it is also adding value and everyone in the family will like this, but there is another aspect of it which I have told in the house.  I have seen that father has a business, now that business is a legacy business, it is not such a sexy business, mother, take someone's small cardamom business in Chavadi market, so now it is not that we sell phones, we sell iPhones, so much so.  It is not the one, okay, these are such businesses which the generation is ashamed to speak, there are many such businesses in the name of all of us, neither will I do this business nor will I do that, but you can understand, okay mother, you mean bra.  This is panty business only, I will give half an example late. It is going well. What do you do? Yes, this is a shop, what kind of bra do you wear? Till date, I have not understood that man is equal till date, meaning society. Well, our conservative is a relief, but such a business.  are fine  Yes, this is our shop, it is in Sadar Bazaar, what is that shop number along with? Ladies, first they send ladies items, which cosmetics are not there, then when they come to know, the boy says, I don't know, it's okay, then that.  He is late after working and does not come. Now father is like this, what is happening now, what is happening in this, what I was trying to tell was the catch, there are two boys, one like, he got fired from the job, the other one is a little worthless or fickle Gehlot story, nothing happened to him, that father. If he sits at the shop, then brother because in consultation and this conflict resolution also comes many times. What is the price of the shop itself, two and a half to three crores, if the caste is there, if the owner is a good one.  It is a city and the location is good. Tell me what is the value of the shop in Qila Road Rohtak. Are you from Rohtak or any other city? This kind of old shop is in the old market. Don't ask about the origin of this mall.  As for this, everyone will come, okay, so many times, does he become the Chaudhary on the default setting, he becomes the second brother and at the same time, I am not doing anything there either, now he is being called mother, not being called, there is relief in the house half the time.  Someone takes mom to the temple, someone takes mom to the hospital, then there is relief in front of dad, he becomes an alcoholic, he goes to business, he is doing nothing, he is not doing anything, and dad has a business to feed the society, but he is the Chotu of the house, he is the Ramu, he is the Chotu.  kind of g  Will help, now he does not have any problem in reducing all these because he knows that he has talent in this, he will also take money in it, he will also come back after wandering, then he will also get married, and then he will maintain good relations with his younger daughter-in-law under compulsion in the defaulter setting.  If you did not understand that the elder one was gone or the elder one was not good, then now this happens in the story, the elder one is released after 10-20 years, which was being made as Chaudhary, right? 1 1/2 2 In a job worth Rs 3 lakhs, the same person working in a sub business bra pantry is paying Rs 5-67-8 lakhs per month. This has also been seen because I am giving him clarity, here I am giving it from every aspect, not just one. If I am the only boy, then that template will come - boy is girl, girl is girl, there are many permutation combinations to increase, there are so many that many times templates are given in connection with the winner, but even for free, the video comes. People have to create and curiosity, decision making has to be done and as far as the matter is concerned, today I want to tell a secret about the war and if clapping is done on this then it will be shared. Okay, people say that it is not fun, I don't.  I don't like to do it, it is not fun, friend, there is no joke in less. When money is good then I do n't like other vices. At least someone should do less about garbage collection. You guys.  Who knows how much money is in it?  He is that Kabaddi person, I will someday tell him an iconic model of Kabaddi people, businessman Jhula and real estate king, I will make a video by doing this, how did I make it and on that, I have given this concentration to a lot of people, Rakhi is a mischievous person, no problem.  No, by the way, I will tell you, I will tell you in some form, I will explain to those who are my pet subscribers, remember me in some webinar and give me your heart, friend, you told the story in the video, if not, then tell me that.  I will tell you, okay, but I can definitely give you a hint that if you do n't like this desire, if you don't express it then money is taken away, then this becomes a fashion, passion is nothing, passion also starts later and money also starts later, okay.  So this money comes either automatically or you don't like it, I am telling you to get hold of such money which you are very passionate about and in that the money is not like a mirror or the growth of money or the money kills you, then I ask for how many days will you spend less.  for less money  Let's learn this thing once, fashion story and take it out in relationship, take it out in travelling, be passionate in spirituality, whoever is in something else, whatever money is in less, there is no reason to be passionate in less, there is nothing in less, there is money in less.  The day you learn war, it will be settled, but why is the war going on? I am not enjoying it and you are not enjoying anything. The things that you actually enjoy are doomed, they will end, so just enjoy them.  So  Then keep doing the same less, now addicts enjoy taking drugs, so first thing is that you enjoy whatever thing you do, you can do this, you come to know at the age of 36 and get it at 42, I will tell you because then astrology and its origin.  This clarity will go and it happens many times, please remind me of 36 42 also, if you guys add it without me, then we freeze this template, here is a simple template if  If you join, there is more growth in the business, but sir, as much salary as you get, then please go to Jain business in this, but if you are getting salary of 2.5-3 lakhs and the business is not even 50000, then please do your job, date it. Message: If life is simple, now the question is very complex, caste and there are too many variables in it, two brothers, brother sister, this, constipation, this, doing this, shop becoming his, shop when in job. Elder brother had thought that at that time the shop was worth Rs 20 lakhs, after 20 years the shop would be like a jackal, now he is a jackal, he has never earned anything, his savings in the job are only Rs 80 lakhs, Rs 70 lakhs and he  You had to consider Turram special and now brother, if I sit in the shop, my saree will be mine, this can also happen, so be very clear about what you have to take tomorrow, how to take it, but you have to take it in a pragmatic way.  There were only two templates, see that brother, from this and from this and where there is a child and a boy, the thing is simple as I explained to you.

    "title": "Should You Lend Money To Your Relatives Or Friends ？ [JOqS0TE8_oU].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today is a very touchy and deep topic. The topic is the case of borrowing money from your close relatives and sleeping. I don't want to discuss it because now what to do, let's not discuss. Who will tell what in this. Okay, so my speed is fine, listen carefully.  Ka or and a very quality, you will get what to do when message best examples, I will understand that in the situation you can give money, why not to give in this, why not to give and they are fine under examples, so carefully you  Understand whenever and this is not fair applicable only for kinship friend circle also okay no big relative commission of money on a better means you have money to spare ok on this study something you have put money into space only then it is there otherwise why would it come  No one will go to a poor person who has no money and will not get up on his own and go to him, no one will go to a well-to-do saint, okay no, he is busy, what is that?  That you are giving him money and the condition of asking for it is Pari and your relative, he is asking for this purpose, the one closest to you is younger brother, okay, elder brother, whoever it is, now that he is busy with his job, it is okay.  So, the issue of help has come up in someone's life, okay, your 65 Uday, you had not taken health insurance, there is a tight contest on this matter, many times a person also shares, two are relatives and the relationship of acting, whatever you believe, your brother.  ne sister brother sister anyone  Friend, whatever you think, a man is living his life, will you get life again? Types are okay, cumin, roaming, eating, drinking, car, these John, clothes, saying happy birthday to wife, enjoyment party, this brother, investing in mutual fund, taking it in some time. And create your will, it is going well, now you have done something for your child for your future, you have done something for the girl, you have done something for your old age, you want to leave the job soon, something else.  You should do it on your own, yes then it is okay no, it is your own choice, now if a situation arises, then after this year, when he needs money, he still makes it clear that he will give the money, meanwhile if he will not give then now.  What kind of relationship are you, all the dreaded fate, how are you, you can't give me my situation, oh my brother, the account of this time will come from me and if this, if you are giving this, then whatever is his marital life, which is a pastime, whatever happened.  in that this  The money was not his, it was the money of his son, his daughter, his daughters' sons, his middle child and his wife too because he belonged to a sacrifice family, his family did not do any English, his wife could have told him that brother, you do something. If you have taken it then now if you don't give this money today then you will die and if you give then you are dead then before asking you have to clear that if you do not want to ask from me then it is absolutely an extreme emergency.  Who can get medical insurance? If medical insurance is possible then it is 5 lakh, 10 lakh, 15 lakh, 20 lakh, 25 lakh, 30 lakh. Don't go for premium. Don't eat pizza. Don't drive a big car. Don't buy gold security in the party.  Essential Oils and Relative Sequences And You Tell Them You Are Not Secure That Match And Tu Mere Par Latkega Latkegi And Make You Laddu  When I am so early and I have zero in my life you have to do it that is one second or buying a house your relation that you need some money buy all the minutes then the shortfall of 5 lakhs became 10 lakhs became 15 lakhs  Ware creating assistant: Buying a big thing requires blessings from elders. Okay, give money to your parents, give it for salvation, give it without interest, forget it seeing it as a blessing.  It is it is his land here in Europe, do n't give him money to buy a house, car, Creta, but you have to buy a Fortuner, don't give him money for these things, don't give him money for these things, and this is what you don't have to say when he asks for it, you have to do it first.  I have to create more because people say that now it is my video, you can shoot this video with a gun and sell it to all your relatives like this, it is okay if you send it somewhere then it is good, it is giving a message, say, discuss.  No, I am not sending messages, tell me, let us discuss, I am not saying this, tell you, what he is saying is true, because in the end, a man is always strong, what a good salary he has, and how a man earns his living.  He has better understanding, his wife may be intelligent or both of them together may be intelligent, everyone may be something else except one, if he is taking money from you regularly or not. You end your kinship and friendship, the ultimate is to always give money only when you can afford to lose it. It means donation is also there, don't take it here too, but don't ask again because with this I am in conflict resolution.  They come to the family court saying that they had given it there, what would have happened if they had given it, you have someone else's money, other scandal money, the other party finds it very easy, every person thinks that he has to earn it by working hard.  Look, I go to my job, I do it like this, if I do it like this, then I would have got this kind of money, for this, it is easy to earn money, for others, see, is it lucky or if someone's wife works, then it becomes a double income group.  If there is single income group then there is single income and double income group my brothers and if there is double income then double lock goes to work, it is not that this one goes to work, there is double income wherever one is sitting in double income group, both are successful and work.  Then we would get hot bread  They don't get another Rs. 500 and something that gives happiness in their life as much as you have the right to get half of the money from your wife. Where does Prithvi live in the house, she lives in it and it becomes her duty to please her husband. If both are working, then both are deprived of many things but their occupation is different, so whenever someone asks, you have to think that he is asking and you have the ability to give, then this is where you put your money.  doesn't fit the agenda of  If you have a friend then it is the center of it, then someone will take away that today you have given, tomorrow he will come again to ask for it brother, give me the word brother, now see only a few whom you have never even seen, they will also say, after that you will start hating yourself because this  What are the relationships which break due to giving or not giving money, then instead of breaking tomorrow, they should be broken today itself, the money has to be given with clarity that brother, look, it is like this, this is so much money, this is why I have to take it, I will take it for this period.  And who else?  It says friend, don't help your brothers and sisters, definitely do it, but what kind of purpose should that be, a classic example and brothers, it is your sister's wedding, my father, I feel like helping you today, sister, my sister has  I will spend ₹ 1, don't do this, the budget of 30 lakhs, the father has thought that you have spent 10 lakhs on the daughter's wedding, Preeto, the budget will reach 40, it will not help anyone, I will give something to my sister, ₹ 5, then that Hooda's will come in your honeymoon, it will be his continuation that your heart beats a lot, go and tell your sister for the bank, which fast before marriage, she is my sister, we are sister and brother, half of my father's property is your aarti, this will be my rule. Whenever someone else is there, I will stand by your side, brothers, in your happiness and sorrow, in your pain. Whenever you need me, I will do this. Edison is much more important than giving lakhs 2 lakhs 3 lakhs. 400005 is set up to be relaxed because because I arrange marriages worth Rs. 40 lakh fifty lakh easily, I do n't even realize that it doesn't happen in 50 days, I do n't understand that if you look at me with my hand, then I am going to go at this time.  Is their sorrow for the breakup of marriage or is it for the loss of money? Give a quarter is the pain of the society. I am telling others that it is not giving results. I am not fasting for a few days. I am telling the truth in marriages.  If you don't like it, then do n't spend it at all, if the money falls in your hand then what to do if the same express starts coming, if you have a daughter then you had to invest, then buy a house and give half of it, the parents will give it or both of them will get the registration done at least.  Accountability is there that even the name and continuity of the money is saved. Then if you have to give your money then keep it accountable. The message is like this, you woke up and understood it, don't spread it like this, it was given there, he asked for it, gave it to him, he asked for it, gave it to him. I have seen many times how children do well in this. I have passed ITM and I belong to such a rich family, it is okay, I was from a humble background, so this is North India, I have ignored blindness, it is okay, should it be Hindi or English, please write it, it is okay.  The people here will understand that it is okay to be bored at our place, it is okay to show your style like this, so he wants to do something by demanding money from his son to show that now we were here, don't think that we are here.  this is ours now This part has happened, I have seen a lot of money being spent on these things and brother, you have joined the team, the salary is good, if you waste money on these things for 5 years, 10 years, then that one dentist of yours will give you the first more.  If you get the opportunity to reach here in Advantage Life, you will struggle. You are very angry to see us because they are wicked, starting from negative, they start from zero but you start from positive.  So much so that you felt like saying, Dad, leave Mom and Dad, leave those mistakes where you want to hit your style, come join me and live well and take some of this and don't show the money to hit the shot because after going there  So, if something happens to the house, you do some good repairs here, do something like this, park the car, we will stay here, we will have fun here, there will be a lot of fun like this, even at night, Mantu, these parents and I, look at this society. These are the things  People will feel bitter but no, in the class I know there is sorrow ahead, either you are so much that I have told the chiefs that this does not happen, brother, whenever your money is given to you, you get as much respect as you were thinking, as much Namaste as everyone was thinking. Brother, you were thinking that he doesn't give, he cries out, what happens sometimes in life, when you give money to your parents at some point of time, you think that you don't know what credit you will get for it, you will be called such a good child, you forget what will happen. because and in that their  It is not even a mistake because what happens sometimes is that we get so inflated that everyone thinks that we took this money in our name, you took 2500 rupees and are running away from us after keeping it back from us, time is practical, I do not release my stand.  What was the interest rate? How much was the loan? How difficult was it? Was it the calculation? Nobody will remember our own parents. Beautiful member. I am telling you the bitter truth for life that you are the master of your own money.  Become whatever is in your name, otherwise you will get witness in life. When you get bitterness, neither will you be of any use to his relatives nor will he be of any use to you because once he becomes like this, now he will give you. Not of any use to me. First of all, tell me that I am of no use to you in this kind of work. I can increase your ability to earn money. I can increase your ability to save money. I can increase your ability to invest money. Life Insurance.  this medical Insurance Is Car Insurance So I Can Provide You A Backup Plan In Case Anything Goes Wrong And Start A Systematic Process For You To Love And Manish Sisodia And Whenever Something Happens That Young Rebel To Call Back New Investments And You To  Take care and brother and younger brother and daughter and spend big money in this place, sons of death, you will be happy doing this here but you are needed here.  Then you will have to tell me every time that every human being should have realization, all this was my video to make me work that if you can't do it like this then I will spend all the money here and then this is my computer. Even today, if your child wants to go to a good college after 12th and that money will be spent, then start getting focused, increase it, not money, in 10-11-12, then get a zero cup and a bigger car.  Why were they bought? The expense was visible here, but if this expense is incurred, then someone related to him will give you an example. On the other hand, the tube of the contest is forced, do not create compassionate heads and tough situations which cold have been avoided in the first place. Suluto purist doing that you have to call these most of the times when the situation has not got bad or will get worse then the situation is very good  It becomes very difficult to refuse, that's it and in the morning I know that I told you the question was asked and on the spot like illness Sacrifice till date on my passport ever tell me see my back passport is lying empty till now I have not felt this time  It has been 10 years and it will expire if something else has happened then there is something else in my life, now that someone else is in my life then it is happening because nothing else has happened, these people do not understand that something is happening then this program  Don't do this, if you had gone then this would not have happened  If it was Everybody's Making a Choice I hope you will enjoy and share this video in the society so that this explanation which you cannot give with your mouth, you would tell this to everyone with my words and you would also make this video viral.  If one can do this much, then the creator who is coming up with such things should have some nature within him. According to me, I do not say this for every video to give emphasis, I am saying this to give a little emphasis, this is not the case either.  Somebody sleep you tell and you thank you"

    "title": "Should You Lend Your Car To Your Friends？ [fvgUoEZ2J_A].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, it is a very interesting topic. Should you lend your car to a friend? It may be a very boring topic but I bring such topics in the society which remove the awkwardness of the society and give clarity and these are the real issues. Otherwise, it is very normal.  The man will say, what is it, friend? It is a car, it is friendship, it is yours, it is your wish, give it, but brother, many people have questions, I know yours.  I know the audience that these videos are not made by anyone, they are not being made anywhere and people enjoy it because it is a subject of great pain, so the answer is that unless and until there is some grave emergency, what can we discuss?  It ca n't happen You should not give your car One I say car It can mean some other things also Not like this, then our friendship Is made to buy a car Is it boring?  People don't get Rolla, do n't get drivers, don't get taxis, people take people's cars and take a good car and say, we will visit Kullu Manali, give it in your car and in shyness, there is no refusal even because that car is actually parked and can also be driven.  No, this is also a fact, there is no issue of money and he says that I will put the diesel petrol but brother, don't give anyone's car, in its practical nature, I tell you, first of all, there is no one for any car.  Even if he has an accident, you have seen the Pune case where the father had to go, no, he was not a child, no, even if there is no child and he was driving under the influence of alcohol, then the vehicle will be registered in the name of the person, brother. Many people have registered the name of women.  But the car is taken from Gudi, it is taken in the name of someone in the family, it is a member of your family and you have handed over the car to someone, so this is a practical aspect, tell me, friend, I am not comfortable, no, I have to go only here.  Very  Friendship is a great friend, tell me brother, hang me like this, you are in so much trouble that I need a car, tell me I will take you as a driver or if you have a driver, then give it to me along with the driver, but never to anyone.  Don't give a blanket like this. First of all, you should not ask for it from anyone. If you ask for my audience, I had made a video earlier also to save the frequency. You should stay at a relative's house. I hope you liked it a lot, if it is okay then this one.  What I want to tell you is that brother, when you have availability, spend your money, don't save it. Now let's assume that there is a minor damage to his car, the light loot is broken, the car can also be stolen. Why are you taking extreme measures?  Why are you taking his taxi, the taxi driver knows the routes, there is no issue of parking, there is no issue of accident, you are sitting safely in the car and God forbid something happens, but some scratches are saved, some come although professional.  Chances are very less in taxi, it is fine, he has a professional driver, he has a driver, you will not get tired, you do not have to go anywhere, it is fine, you will not have any issue of parking, you can go from anywhere to anywhere, you can order it anytime and today.  In big cities, it is available anywhere. My audience is mostly from big cities, which I define generally, but even in small cities, things are available, but this one has to take a car and go to others. Which city is like this?  You me  Tell me the names of small cities where you do not get a taxi or there are no taxi drivers and every type of vehicle is available, from small to big, small, expensive, cheap, meaning you can take every type, so why are you asking for someone's car?  You are giving it to someone, it is not worth it, get it legalized, brother, you have a lot of money, he has a lot of money, he has blood relations, if you live together in the family, then you should give it by all measures, you should give it to your parents.  You should give it to your brother, you should give it to your sister, you should also give it to your brother-in-law, I would say okay, you can go to your brother-in-law, but don't give it to your friend, I am guiding the youngsters, there is no point in giving it to a friend. Friend can do any scandal with him and there is no guarantee of it, he was taking a girl, was drinking alcohol, okay and youngsters have to speak a lot and blanket and he will say, you are not my friend, friend.  Friendship depends on you not letting me take your car and I don't want to comment much on that friendship because till when will you share what will you share because there is no limit to the extreme love, he will ask for anything from you tomorrow, then you will understand.  What am I saying? No, you do this to me, you are my brother, you do this to me, you do this, well, most of the time these days, the friendship of youngsters is also going on like this and many people are like this, as I have seen, psychology is the only son.  go  If he is an only child, it becomes a boy, a girl and there is no sibling. I have seen this psychology. Tell me, if you have brought the bat for identification, then only he is being batted. Those friends are buying toys because he is the only child, so then the parents have some responsibility.  Pampering happens because there is no system of sharing resources, there is no teaching to the other, no burning of clothes, then the first one gets some extra things, if two children are normal, then he does not get it.  It becomes a habit since childhood, many people keep giving their cars to maintain their friendship and the car is hard earned from your money or maybe it is a gift given by father, you do not have to give it at all and decorate it absolutely.  If you want to keep it, tell me friend, I have a hygiene issue, I can't give such a car, brother, I have seen it, friend, I have seen it, what is the meaning of observation, tell me in consultation or anyway, you took the car, drank alcohol, let's spit.  No car was saved, no police case was registered, nothing was saved, no scandal happened, but brother, one had drunk so much, that is, he vomited in the back side, he made dirt, dirt, dirt, now you will speak, friend, you are bringing so many practical things through video.  Actually, there should be no need for me to make all the videos, I have complete clarity but this clarity is for the youth, they say no, I am sorry, sorry, you will show displeasure, okay, okay, take 00  It's good to get it washed, it's okay, I'll get it washed. It ends like this. If you give a car, you give a favor. It always ends like in a thankless manner only. If you give it once, if you don't give it next time, then you're done. Give another thing once. I gave it to him and he came to know that I had given it to him, then he will also ask for it, this also becomes a strange thing because once it is known whether so and so is Rohit's or Neha 's right.  Is the car available? Go there, he gives it or she gives the car. She is a good girl, she is a good boy, so just let me know once in the friend circle. I am coming please give me yo Guardi. I am coming please give me a car can I go?  If you are a guard for this thing, I can do it, then you should spread this video to those who are travelling, from whom vehicles are being sought, and those who are not doing so, and will do so in the future, if you spread it generally, then what will happen from it?  Your opinion will show that you endorse this point of view of mine. The next person who knows you will know that brother, don't ask for this, so many people like my videos, I am releasing them, although they do not ask to subscribe to the channel. You guys, you guys want to have exclusive access to all my knowledge by making it yours which I used to think earlier but brother increase it man I my my channel deserves to grow at a faster place yes it  It is growing, it is not stagnating, it is growing, but why not faster, help me a little, you will help me like this, you will like, comment, brother, there is a lot of content, it is not going to end, petrol is not going to end, here you will do like this, I will take more practical.  I will come if this kind of content will be appreciated. My aim here is to liberate people from the problem of judgment and I myself am happy with the practical one.  And happiness is nothing but absent of tribulation and sorrow. Absent of sorrow and tribulation and bitter and frustration, we can call it happy and happy. Happiness is absent can be a state of neutralism. There is no judge for me, no car was given to me, you are not my friend.  Katti said Katti, I am not going, I am not giving, give me a pen, don't give in pen, if you don't give in mobile, then you will not give anything, then how come we are not ready to accept friendship, that friendship is not even practical.  These days, I have seen that friendship of all the youngsters is based on giving or taking, no, I will give him a car, then when I go there, I will use his car, no, you too, don't use his, do it, he also will not use you, no, then how will the world run like this?  It will work very well, it will work very well, there are a lot of resources, these hotels, these taxis, all this is built for this reason only, no other people, no, leave me there, you are going in this direction, he is saying, leave me there, what is the region, why do you do youth?  Yes because your time has no value, if you are earning money at Rs 2000000 or Rs 0000 or Rs 40000, if you are doing something then you should value your money. You say, friend, this will waste my one and a half hour, you take this Rs 800. Go in your taxi, how much does the taxi cost? Inter city 200 400 500 600 800 1000  1200 1500 Okay, if you want to go from Gurgaon to Noida, then how much do you tell me? Write to me. I don't travel much in off-late taxis, but you tell me what will be the rate. If you hit the limit, what will be the rate? Now tell me brother, why are you bothering me?  Will my car run on air? Does my time have zero value? Go, why should I give you a lift? We are exactly on the same route, we are going there, there will be no waste of time, so it's okay, the other way is me. Pick it up from here and you are waiting for it. The main message through all this I am saying is conserve. Learn to say no first of all to things and learn to conserve your time and energy both are limited and even money. Money is  Also not unlimited to the youth, you are not earning that much that means I will spend it on everything, so I hope you got clarity from this. Comment  In the section you will get some good workshops on pre- marital consultation for relationship. If you want to buy it then definitely buy it. If you want to become a member of the channel then definitely subscribe the channel. Like and share. Thank you very much."

    "title": "Should You Start A Start Up ？ [UKGB-QX0xoE].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today's topic is Star Startup. Startup has started. Some scan has been typed in Noida. Promise to organize a big event by doing this kind of startup. Children from all over the world came to start their startup. Very high fees, there were few and flops.  The show was a lot of police, the police came among them, will name it, Elon Musk will come to promote it, today Ani ji will come and how people become fools, they are made, now is not the time for knowledge, now is the time for funding, okay so on top of this  We will discuss that I want to give clarity to the war that you should or should not start a startup and what should not be done, what should be done, if not done, then the names of some influencers have also come in it, YouTube influencers have come, so now I have them.  If they name it wrong, correct it or initially they used the name, then they changed the name, so what I mean to say is that it has become a popular sentiment even on YouTube, which is easy to get a lot of subscribers, do it like this and do some startup yourself.  Fulfill your dreams, what can you do within your grasp, it is not so easy to do the world like this, by doing what I do, all the things go on, isn't it, one by one, so this Shark Time India is going very well is n't it because what happens when jobs are available.  If you don't feel like it then your mind needs an escape and you will go to the market to give that escape that brother, if it is not available then open this, it's okay, Baa Chaiwala Ba means the world is doing something, Baa, if the Chaiwala is gone then it should be Baa, meaning the Chaiwala.  There are so many mostly tea people  If the money is working, if you catch the total income of India, I am not talking about the people who are in any college, then get the maximum of the entire India, their earning per capita will probably be less than that of the tea seller, but now let's come.  On the question whether you should start a startup, the answer is yes, you should not do it, you should not do it at all in the beginning, you neither have the hunger for worldliness nor do you know about all the things, just your text, oh brother, you have an IIT degree, you have it in you absolutely.  some of that water  Then it is not necessary for you to take advice, it is not necessary to know Noida, it is not necessary to attend anyone's lecture, Savinay Winner, so you people do it, here I am addressing those who are 99% people, one percent, who are family members, something is going on.  When you have to deliver in the same way, don't follow them, every person thinks that I am in that category, you are my audience, so you too have a chance, 99% of you are in this category, do something in the beginning, do it yourself.  Do it alone, do something that doesn't involve any money, that does n't involve any loss, in which you do n't need anyone else other than yourself, that is, six people, you know, you took money from dad and mom, then I will take seat funding, then I will take that funding, then I will take that funding. It will be round one round you don't do it so soon just because you go three four five six story of people in there 225 wali jo chalti hai den me in de whole world hes tu ko it's jo  About probability, if people are going in this way, then five out of them will be successful or not, see what you mean, the chase of this guy is very difficult, the world knows it, but the story of it is difficult, remember that the star starts, I am telling you about it.  Now what to do, in the coming time I will give some such topics and such history where there will be a job in it, I don't know what it will be, keep this name for later, money is the thing, people wish, what is wrong in India? respect is kept  Is it very important or not? Respect is very important. Money is said to be important but respect should be seen. If we have to make something in this matter, then I will have some startup. I will listen to the story of peace to the world, to father, to mother, to relative, to future father-in-law, to wife, to girlfriend. In this matter, there are very few people who reduce Adwise quintals. I will make a video on them in the future which are not even mentioned much and that is my next video. If you want, if it is like this.  If you want a job then write it in a slightly different way, also write a name, a dog, in a slightly different way, then I will understand. You must write it in the comment area, then I will give him clarity on the matter, okay, this is not in the name of a startup. Run it, note it, extremely easy, note it, note it and the difficulty is even higher than that, just think about it, no, you are also motivating us, no one in your family has done it, how to get GST number first. How are DDI numbers? What happens to corporate affairs? It takes some time. Don't be in such a hurry. Government should encourage you. Government also has to release some balloons. The situation of guru reservation is not matching here. The noise of jobs is not matching, says the government. Do it yourself, take it, do it, so that if you are not there, then if you don't do it, you have failed. We had told you to do it, so all these are ready, this is a release, it does not mean that it should be done easily.  It will take 2 4 5 years to do something, meet people, then ideas come on their own, then scale up happens in another way, what are you five people doing? Don't mess around, want to expand pan India directly, want to expand pan state, want to expand in your locality first.  So try whatever you are, 50 houses ahead, you have a network and circle of 50 people, friends, relatives, see, you are reaching Noida from Siliguri directly.  What is happening from Bengaluru to Noida is correct because this idea will also work that today sir I have to say again and again that gold is not being extracted, it is okay, there are many companies extracting gold, so the money that is spent between shower and jeans is the same.  There has been a lot of work, you understand that there was a gold rush in America in the 19th century, so in the beginning there was so much company involved, everyone is doing it if you are doing it because of this. In People Bill Come and Everything Bill Get Delhi, it is not that their content was very great at that time or you are great but just you are their effect, like you, channels like mine are a little old, this one is the second channel, the bigger channel is a little more old.  So I have disadvantages from them but the one who is starting today has an advantage because whatever space is there is becoming very competitive, so the earlier a person starts, he has an advantage. Now you will tell him some advice, it would be good for you. If yes, then I will start right now like on D can open open any YouTube channel it is me note that you have bill, you have some expert, some inside, some skill set, something banana, something or You have connected all the dots in what you are saying right now, you are going to take funding directly, if someone opens his company tomorrow, do not take funding so soon without that, even if he is going to go. 10 20 50 Towards 100 crores, you will initially take funding at one crore, then it will not reduce, who knows, if your product fits and like me you get 50% equity in 50 lakhs, then what is the benefit, meaning hard work, your ID, your everything.  If you have sent some more equity so quickly, then if you don't want to do it there so quickly, then you must be patient and do it, I am not saying that you should never do it at all, you should definitely do it, but you will figure it out further.  If the experience is good, then absorb the things and experience in the initial time and I will make the video which I will give you in a half story and after making this one, I promise it will be released in two or three days. One of my ideas is okay, it will be a little more for women, fox inside it is okay but it will be good, it is a very big idea of ​​mine because recently I had told that thing to 15-20 people in my pet consultation and everyone  She is going on a hit, that means the success rate is above 90%, there is something witch like this, the success rate is more like 90%, I will release her to you in the next two to three days, but my request is that please add a little curiosity to her. This please they want you no debt, it seems a bit like yes they would like to know that there is no investment of ₹ 1 in it, there is no investment of ₹ 1 in it, ₹ 1 is just money and investment is not ₹ 1  It is not that some brother is a plane, this money is not ₹ 1, it is not ₹ 1, so the person telling is not getting anything, neither is he telling about such things in the market, okay, even though I will not tell too much, okay, but this I will definitely tell you about it, okay?"

    "title": "Should You Work On Your Weakness ？ ｜ A Belief Sytem Broken [rjnDrA2D1u0].en",
    "content": "Studio Work on Your Weakness will try to break the system again by questioning what is taught, periods also speak, teachers also speak, on one stage everyone says you should look at your workiness, all this is good, very good.  But yours is bad, you need to work on date, so today I am addressing late people above 21 22 years 30 35 40  Okay and this is also a message for those people who work below you because sometimes you are in a boss position and you also talk that you need to work on this and so I am going to explain one thing to you today. You understand, try to understand, everything, they should not work on our weaknesses, this is why we should leave our weaknesses in isolation, every I am not talking about weakness of character and morality, and what I am saying is that I am spoiling your money.  I hope that I have distinguished the skills of earning and the other hand skills and the physics. It is okay if you do n't want to add those weaknesses in your life to other problems in your life. If you are okay then why should you not do it because it is on your side.  It is not your inclination that your strength will give you less money and success. Weakness will do nothing. No matter how many people you see, if they are successful then it is God 's body. Whatever your strength is, everyone has strength but we do not.  We do not focus on strength because we feel that if we have strength then we will take it to a slightly exceptional level. If we are at above average level on some of our strengths then comes the level Good. After Good then comes Good and Acceptor.  But only those who take it earn maximum money. You see that a doctor is good. There will be a difference between a good and an average person, so whatever you are good at, you should become the best, like me, teachers.  If I take a winner and understand something, then I tell him that like you are a teacher of history, history is very big, from Mohenjo Daro to your cute India movement and India's independence, everything is fine, it is not possible that whatever teacher he is. I called him Ancient Indian History, whether it is Medical History, whether it is Mughal time or British time, catch a particular period, no one knows more than him, he knows everything because you.  A small thing which caught your strength and by practicing it again and again, you can acquire so much in it that now no one knows that you have acquired it in that thing, now your demand will increase in life. I have given a simple example of this, you can extrapolate it to many things.  You can do it in anything, wherever you are, you can make your own roti or any Indian food, Mukhi food, Veg food, Non-veg food, a lot of variety, but some of them are very successful.  That he knew that one particular thing very well that this Rasgulla is made only by this system, no matter what the name of the food, it makes it the best, so that is naturally his strength, if you pay it to him.  Man lo, even if you don't make the dose, it gets stuck, then it is your weakness. Now your relatives are commenting. Weakness which is there in your life, even after overcoming it, people are still not going to reach anywhere. This D message means it cannot reach. Leave him alone, even he is not aware that he is doing makrapan, he has inherent talent or not, who knows his weakness can become strength if focus is given or something is not so much for him, but you children.  You will also start seeing patterns like your 14, 15 and 16 year old self has started showing that he is not getting good marks in maths, he is good only in psychology or is good in a particular subject, he is left brain.  He has a right brain and he starts seeing patterns. You cannot force him like you can force someone to be left handed and eat with the left hand. Now I have a left hand and a right hand.  If I am right handed, my left hand is weak, so I will reduce it, okay, I will do it, okay and something good will happen, I will start writing too, I will write somehow but  What is the fact that that is my time and energy, that is under different different conditions and different circumstances, mostly those who will be giving you advice, their strength will take you towards that because it is easy to give advice to them, they are parents like if father is good in one thing.  Well, he would like my child to do the same because he feels that I have strength, so I will make him stronger too or I will make him overcome his weakness and I will guide him to AIIMS.  Amount of Guidance Will Take Your Child Anywhere If He Basically Gives From There This is a little deeper thing going on I hope you guys understand that you have to take this career, you have to get married, you have to be the boss, this whole template is applicable in every circumstance.  Has any girl come to your house? Just like girls are also women, everyone has their own strength, some are good at wearing dresses themselves, some are good at keeping the house clean. Some of them also have their shortcomings, like someone who knows how to cook very good food, then see, now the one who knows how to cook very good food at home, take him to a logical level where he can be monetized, instead of making him do this to the lady. So, if you are not able to teach your children also, is it okay or else tell him that you should learn to drive less and go here, these are the basic things, you will have to do them, like if you know how to drive a car by one weekend, then you should do that, but now what is there in that? You have to reach the Formula Van level, you have to see that there is a level of expertise in everything, okay, driving is one, driving in a Formula van is okay, so driving in a Formula van is here and driving is here.  We have to achieve this level everywhere so that we can live a good life, but if we are at a weakness level that I cannot drive very well on the highway, then now it is necessary for me to have a driver.  It is possible that someone else in the family can go. You can always see your strength. Your wife's strength. Your child's strength. Even your parents who are sitting idle at home can also have their strength when you  Father and mother are giving a lot of knowledge. Tell them, why do you do consultation? What are you giving me? Bring a client, let's see. Father, you have such a mind, you will pay ₹ 100 for your consultation. Spend ₹ 50, spend a lot of money, then you will know because if you are a code- wise advisor, I give in different status of life, then if it is good, then someone will give money, then whatever, if any man is claiming that it is mine.  Son is my strength, then see whether he has monetized it, is he going to the level of formula van, is he at a higher level, is there a woman who cooks, encourage him so that he eats less.  Do this: A woman knows how to keep a house very well, encourage her, knows how to keep things very well so that she can monetize things, tell her about interior designing, somewhere there are finishing schools, there are ladies' coaching, there are consultations, somewhere a job is available to a woman. Now I know how to speak well, I have communication skills. It is good to speak well, but the strength remains in other things throughout the day. What are communication skills and normal Hindi? You grab one strength, in my death, that of an average person.  Whatever research I do, I observe people, I find many people have two to three strengths which can be known in 5 minutes when they talk, I can find out in 5 minutes by asking some questions.  Or by looking at him or by talking to him in general in the context of his questions or anything, within 5 minutes 2:00 to 3 strengths are visible. Weaknesses are visible, someone is carrying this thousand, what to do with it, if there are so many weaknesses. You, because what is your business? Whatever you are saying, the person who has nowhere to go, does not know how to drive, he is walking, his lack does not have to be overcome, he is in the middle, so the business also arose according to others, I think he is in poverty.  So remove this word weakness from your life. Everyone is carrying strength. We are carrying two to three strengths and then three strengths are more than that. To take us somewhere in our life, force us. If someone does not have that kind of memory.  ca n't remember things  If you study, then you cannot become an IAS. UPSC exam is simple, you can study for 16 hours and can stay at night and live a boring life. If these are the three strengths of someone, which can be there, then it should not be forced.  Those who do not read useless things from those who do not remember, now get confused in dates that even the Cute India Movement was in 4942 and there was Khilafat in 1930.  When was the partition of Bengal, when did the battle of Haldighati take place or if we go back in it, then this is this battle of the reason, which one is the one of Prithviraj Chauhan, it was the first one in 119192, it was someone else, right, it was on time, then the Khilji Cup, this is of Maharana Sanga.  When was the battle with Babar? Okay, when was the battle of Khanwa? It happened after a year of Panipat. Do n't you remember the first battle of Panipat? It's just that if it is not there then leave it friend, it's a weekend and someone else is a brother.  Sir, interest time, if she remembers me, then play the competition. She remembers the teacher's people very well. She also has presentation skills. She also speaks and gets recorded. You can play on YouTube. Whoever wants to play, do n't put in as much energy as you can.  Also energy, identify your strength, I am helping you in this matter, Avinash, I am telling you what can be done according to your saint, I am telling it to the children. According to the career, I am telling you the link of one of my apps, I will give it to you, Sangolize, there is an app of mine, I will give it to you, download the app, whenever it is not there, you will get a notification, add it, it will happen on weekends, whenever you  If you are watching this video regularly then things will keep coming in it. Anyway, those who join me directly on mobile will get to learn anyway. Every person has his strength, we have to play on his strength and if he sees it with time then please you down Everyone, write your strengths in the comment section. If I am in a mood then I will show him some new thing that should be done. Now do not write about strengths. It should be an exact strength [Music] It is okay to talk nice to people and do it to them.  Hard Worker Sincere and it's okay like this please share it with your friends and the app you will get you will find it in the description at the top of the comment section you will find the app download"

    "title": "SIP & SWP In Mutual Funds ｜ What Finluencers Don't Tell You ？ [IhptFE0R2FQ].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, we will talk about SIP of mutual fund. King of SIP knowledge is Ankur Warik ji. I hope if you watch that video then tell me what is his take on it. Nowadays a new thing is going on that you deposit money and then deposit something for so many years.  You take a systematic withdrawal plan and even then this much money will be there after so many years and by spending Rs. lakhs per month, a lot of people did it along with many other YouTubers and they were also suppressed.  Subscribers are increasing, ok, I want to tell you one thing, if I consider MI as SIP for buying a house, then at the end of some years, I will get an amount and that amount will give me money for my life long and also its amount.  If it increases then why should I not hold the asset behind this thing because what are you people going to do by doing SIP in the end it will become such a big piggy bank then what will happen after breaking that piggy bank, no piggy bank anything.  It is very naive to assume that it will be like this that will give money. Buy all the returns of financial influence that they have extrapolated, but you will not get 15, 16, brother, you will not get. Going forward, 9, 10 will also come, seven, you can also come and average returns.  There wo n't be 9 10 in a few years, so far we have got so much of past, they speak quickly, past market performance is a judge, not indicative of future returns, read the  Offer Document Before Investing is a new important thing. I want you to calculate it on the basis that you have bought a house. Do it yourself on Microsoft. I will not tell you the education by doing it because I will tell you, if you explain it, I will tell you a lot of money in the courses.  I will take it and tell you, but you try it, you bought a house, the price of the house will increase, the rate at which it will increase, you also get rent and tell the EE, everything has gone into the pit, it is like this.  Let us show that it is like in term insurance, if you die, you do not get the money, brother, the quantity has also reduced and if you had died, then your money going inside this case is becoming an asset for you.  Understand SIP, say EMI of Rs. 0000 or SIP of Rs. 400000 and if it is SIP of Rs. 40000 then how much will it reach and how much wealth will be created in 15 years.  Write it down and secondly, when you buy a house, then put the rent in SIP and the EMI which is being put in your SIP, now calculate it and see how much money has been spent. Write the name MI on 40000 or write the SIP.  They are doing some magic in SIP and it is increasing in the form of money and that asset is increasing through loan. That asset can give you rent every month and you get income tax rebate on it.  What about Maintenance Cost Maintenance Cost Ka Bol Bol Bol Bol Bol Bol Bol Bol Bol Bol People have shown that if the property is worth Rs 00 then Rs 50 is spent on maintenance. People show this and it is not true. Maintenance Cost Maintenance Cost That Is It  Is a Difficult Thing to Do While Property Buying is a Difficult Thing, the Biggest Challenge in Wealth Creation Is Not That You Own Real Estate  Do you buy or SIP? The biggest challenge is having the discipline to give that money. That comes more in the real estate and with the money coming from real estate, you play SIP. Now look at the returns of 152 years. DDA's ₹ lakh flat in Janakpuri 1988.  If I was there then why do I go again and again in 88? Why do n't I go in 2020? Yes, I go because SIP also, you said for long term. Hey, what are you saying, do it for two years, the DDA flat which was worth Rs 3 lakh in 1988, brothers and sisters, the total flat was worth Rs 3 lakh, its annual rent comes to Rs 5 lakh, its rent is Rs 160 but not the rental calculation.  The Current Price Hello Hello Wet Wet Wet Wet Wet Wet Wet O Subtion People bought shares of NHPC. Suppose I bought Rs and I get dividend.  Dividend is at 00, suppose it is at 2. Brother, I have taken 20p, I have 10 or not. Tell me, if you have taken the ITC share at 00 and today it is going at 500 and assume 500p is at 2.  If Rs 500 is at Rs 2, then what is the price? Even when I had taken it, I would also say, it is only two per cent, why brother, I am getting it at Rs 10, I have paid only Rs 100. How will you keep seeing the returns on your current value? That's why the rent will never go above 3%. The rent will double every two years, every eight years, double within 24 years, quadruple within 16 and 24. Eight times, but brothers and sisters, it will remain the same every time, now we will never let you put up a house, no no no, don't buy a house right now, the rents are high at Rs 30, in the last one and a half years, Warik ji, Akshay Srivastava ji  So the tune has changed a bit which is good because when things should change but the good thing is that if I have told it earlier then it is even better right I am myself an equity guy I never speak against equity equity is a great asset good asset  You should be there but then a SIP of Rs. 000 does not help any person. There is something better than doing nothing. Everything can be told like this. Even a closed watch shows the time twice a day. Focus.  This is what has happened to people that I am doing SIP, so now I have done it and I will reach somewhere, something will happen, so nothing like this is happening, your taxation in long term capital gains will reach 30, all your  SIP calculation will go for a sex because Nirmala Tai ji, they will take it at 30, whatever the government will be at that time, when you take out, it will take it at the time of 30, then what will you do?  Even if there is a house in the house, I am not selling the house, but I will sell it in SIP, otherwise what will you do by withdrawing the money and where will you eat from? The house was bought for Rs. 10 lakhs, now it is worth Rs. 2 crores.  It is worth 3 crores, it is worth 4 crores, it is worth 10 crores, I have not sold it but it is linked to it on 3, it is a rental lead, so brother, when it is worth 10 crores, then I am getting 30 lakhs on rent on 3. If it is worth 10 crores then it is 30 lakhs. If I am getting rent then brother, I had bought it for 20 lakhs in so many years. Let's say it has become 10 crores in some 25, 30, 40 whatever years, so I am not going to sell the house. Where will this mutual fund of yours give? If you break the mutual fund then 30% will be deducted. It is also increasing here and if I put it in the mutual fund then what is the problem then I  I am giving a different perspective, I am not arguing, no, this is the count, after doing all the counts, I am telling you that if there is rent, then there is no maintenance, there is only some percentage, why do they give it in everything and who said that loan?  Someone keeps 15 only for 20 years. Please go and check the annual report of HDFC Bank. Please go and check the annual report of NBFC and Banks that the average loan tenor is how much tenor is T N O R?  Kitna hota hota hai tenaar hota hai anda half saal hota hai Nobody keeps it for 15 20 because salaries double in 78 Rents double in 78 People pay by buying new property Take new loan and you can acquire multiple properties in income tax Today you have got an income from property  There is a separate section of Loss from property, all the interest paid and rent can be counted in it. If you can have multiple properties and the  The moment it becomes a cash flow positive property you don't take anything it is not taking anything from you then you can make even multiple I teach this in detail in my real estate course why do I have to argue with them yes yes okay  Who thinks brother, your SIP is fine, you are busy in returns, I have got so many returns, this is the situation, I have got so many returns and how much money do I have?  3 crores in so many years, I have earned less in returns but I have 7 crores, so which situation is better? How can it be like this, brother, how can it be less in returns? How can I earn more money in returns? I am betting in my real estate with leverage from base. 1 If I have ₹ lakh then buy using leverage and everything becomes on that and here in mutual fund. If I am starting with ₹ 10 lakh then 10  I am starting from right now, if I get a return of Rs. 10, if I get a return of Rs. 50, then I get 5 lakhs of real estate, if I get a return of Rs. 10, then I am getting crore per crore, if I get a return of Rs. Now I have understood that 5 lakhs is less than 10 lakhs and this difference will always be there. Can't catch up. To catch up, Warik ji like they say.  One has to go for 90 years or 150 years, but even then there is no catch up. If you keep playing this game and at one stage, when you start putting all its rent in the mutual fund, the joy is increasing, then it will never catch up. You will never be able to catch it because one day your rent will be so high that whatever SIP you were doing here and you have fully repaid this loan, he is putting it all here, so now it is beyond this.  Here it is and after that this part has become of this, now since it is growing at the same rate, then this difference will remain for life long. You can explain in detail, you can explain what you understood on Microsoft Excel and in your comment section.  But you can write that this thing is neither being told to you nor explained to you because it does not suit, it suits to get the work done easily so that the one who can understand because what I am telling will be confusing to the mind, people will not understand even after telling.  so what  Do it then stop SIP. Who is telling you to stop it? Where to buy houses? If houses have become so expensive then it is difficult to become rich and happy. It is also easy to do SI. I said which one is easy? To buy a house is to become rich and happy. Staying good in life, going to a good place is a very difficult task, brother, it is very difficult to understand these things that I am telling, only then 50 lakh subscribers will not be visible here because I have put whatever is there, now I have become rich.  went and then  He made a round base investment of 4 lakhs, Ghumi Ghumi became 8 10 lakhs, bought a car, took it from him, took it from him, consumed it all, sat down, then made nothing, the returns were very good, this is the ruin of the Indian education system, my marks percentage. I came very well but I could not reach anywhere in life. How many marks in 10th are at 96, how many are I doing at 97 in 12th, what should I do, if you tell me then who is asking?  Percentage Returns Marks Has Got No Meaning This Returns It Self Has Got No Meaning All these are phrases in life What is there Does Garg Saheb understand the business of small cardamom in Chawri Bazaar and he has earned a lot He says leave it brother How much does this SIP give? Tell me, how much does it give and what does it do? We know this. Today I want to ask you all about the benefits of small cardamom.  Do you know how much is the KG rate? Don't make any mistake, just write in the comment section. We have an idea of ​​milk, we have an idea of ​​petrol, we have an idea of ​​small cardamom, we don't have an idea of ​​things about which we don't have an idea, then give anything there and calculate it in KG.  If it is not sold from the market, then it is sold according to the villages, this is the margin. In Garg Saheb's house, all the children in the family do not know where the truck runs, where it gets off, where it goes, even the little boy there.  I don't know, only Gark Saheb knows from where the goods will come, how much margin is there, what is the rate, you will do it here and there on Indian market, you will get 10 rates, first write it yourself or let me write you, don't know, after that go and do more work.  You will also get Rs 1500 rate if today you check gold rate or census or petrol then the price you will get is this money and you walk in sophisticated returns and style. English  I will make this much today, I did it like this, I am surprised, sir, how many videos does Waraku ji have? With just Rs 5000, the SIP will be worth this much. If I want this much money, I will have to spend so many years. 10 Mistakes I Did in My 20s 20 Mistakes I Did  This And I Did This I Did That You Were Staying In Different Times These Times Are Easier Times Today They Are Difficult Times What You Did In Your 20s And what ever has got no meaning in today's life That's what has got no bearing on you because life has changed People could get so do so many mistakes 25 years back 20 years back and get away today You can't do any mistake Mauka hi nahi kuch mil  Forget the mistake of doing anything, you are not getting a chance to do anything. Life is not the same and not easy.  Do this rear view system that I should learn from him, learn from him, learn from him, it is easy to give useless knowledge by becoming a Chowdhary, I did it like this, I did it like that and when the man says, I made these mistakes, then he seems like a very genuine person.  No one, I am not trolling them alone because this has become a template, these mistakes have been made by me, nonsense, your mistakes have no meaning, how many have not happened, what nonsense, there is no meaning, nothing to anyone  What has to be done in the past, there is no learning from it, look at what is going to happen in the future, no one knows even today, those who are sharing this knowledge, no one talks about what is going to happen in the future, no one talks about the future, my reputation goes down in talking about the future. I do something like this in two years, something else happens in a year, it builds reputation, keep telling your stories in the past, keep telling how many great people have achieved greatness, keep doing the story of Henry Ford, keep doing the story of anyone, keep doing the story of Vivekananda ji.  Take BR Ambedkar's work, take Mahatma Gandhi's work, keep listening to Lal Bahadur Shastri, keep doing biography, we made mistakes, this is this, you should learn and this is you should be motivated, you are not reaching anywhere, then I will make you understand like this, no one can tell you again  But don't come to my house and tell me that you want to buy Jamuna Ta, this is whose name it is, I will not tell the share price, it still came out of my mouth.  Is it not for investment? Can anyone tell me the number of the enterprise? Whose share is increasing? People have a habit of being lazy. Wealth creation takes time. If your approach is wrong, your thinking is wrong, then you will not reach anywhere. How much knowledge do you have?  Take it, because what is your M? Let me take a mobile phone, I will make you roam around, it should be a big M and it should be made on a big time. Earlier one was mine, now I will make it again, I will teach you things on the old money concept again, that video is mine. Before that we will come to the old money concept, brothers and sisters, tell me whether you want a fun channel because there will not be much content in it because my aim is not to come every day or with a SIP of Rs 5000, I will put so much before 10, how much will reach then.  Second video, if you want this much then how much has to be put, then third, if you need this much and this much, then for how many days do you have to put it, then fourth, if you want this much, if you have to put it for so many days, then what is the rate of interest, meaning friend, you are a p = 1.  + r to the power n, you have made five videos, sometimes P has been caught, sometimes A has been caught, sometimes R has been caught, sometimes N has been caught and such a simple thing, you are being repeated every time, every month and our public has become so much like that.  Especially the youth, he has become so crazy that he is not even calling out after consuming it, that he comes new fresh. Yes, you know that he has to put one grain on the first of the chase and two more on the second.  Have to do like this and then all the grace of the world, this is the power of compounding. Hey, it felt good once or twice, you got it, you beat it, everything is done, everyone knows, now how much beyond that, you will keep making videos in one simple thing, you know if.  If I do this then 20 years will be like this. Don't talk about this and that, tell me what will happen next year, what will happen in six months and what is happening now and where is it going, this will happen in 20 years.  It will become so many crores. It will become so many crores. 20 years ago in 2004, if someone had said, 'It will become one crore', how would you have felt? 'O Crore' and what is the value of 'crore' today? A 50 yard plot is not available in Gurgaon. The value of one crore rupees is left. Affordable housing resale.  This much will be sold in India, what is left of this affordable housing, then this will happen in 2004, now it has happened, then what happened to inflation, which is a witch, who will talk about it?  They talk about not everything which will be eaten, but it is not so, they say that we have to take returns in different manner, how much desi ghee was used for that much money 40 years ago, how much does it cost now, just simple, from today onwards, government employee group.

    "title": "Some Disadvantages Of Work From Home Discussed ｜ Alternative Solution Suggested [XDBQZU5b08A].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, I will tell you about work from home, I will tell you something is good, work from home is good, bad, according to me, it is bad, it is okay and at first people liked it very much, now off course many people have gone back but still many people like it.  If work from home is going on, then I will give you some perspective, what can be alternated and what is wrong, okay, I will tell you that thing, the biggest problem is that in work from home, brother, your family members do not agree, you do less because someone  also those who work from home  Is he doing that song or kya baale ye Kashi lekar and all this  It was a different thing, okay, now what can they do in that, okay, on one stage I felt very librative that just put a tattoo on the top, wear a raw vest below, sit down or generally stay relaxed, okay then it felt good, but now I don't feel good.  Productivity travels, creativity goes down, we can't be an idiot, we can't build a bridge by sitting with someone, and what is there on top of that, the networking that happens by going to a job and meeting people, that is energy exchange and nothing else, morning time. You have to go to a place after taking a bath, that is very important because if your work starts at 9:30 and you wake up at 9:00 and you don't have to go, then your whole routine will get spoiled and  Many people have a very bad routine, second, there is no distinction between work and life, not only work is not happening, life is also happening the same, so I have seen that while working from home, people are doing less and not being productive on time.  So it is not that the employer is very happy, so he told everyone that everyone will have to come, those who do not come, take their leave, it is not good for the company, it is also not good for the mental health of the employee, how many of you people are working from home? Tell me, many people say that we do not have the choice, we will have to work from home because of the setup of the company, so I am telling you that those who do not have the choice, they have got work from home. What are you doing, brother?  You go to the working space, wear nice clothes, go to a nice place, okay, I am talking about big cities, so you go there, give good coffee, good office space etc. and do good networking and you get there in 3 hours, whatever you do sitting at home.  You will be able to reduce the work done in 6 hours, your time will not be wasted, productivity will increase and you will also be relieved from home as well. So brother, install the washing machine now, pick up the child, do it now brother, it cannot be reduced because then some relative will come and someone will want to talk to you because those who are old, our elderly senior citizens, have not seen the concept of them going to work, this is D.  culture  Off India, sometimes food is visible, sometimes I drank tea, sometimes bathroom, sometimes bath, sometimes the bell rang and nothing else, sometimes I am also suffering and hungry, you see that in my video those bells ring, so many couriers come. Anytime the children press the button, the courier boy is receiving, how much is it, 220, brother, who did it belong to? Hey, what is this, the box is yours, it is open, you will continue in the same cycle because of this.  Something or the other will always be happening, sometimes a cook is coming, sometimes a maid is being made, someone is going, if something or the other keeps happening, then you will have to leave it. According to me, you should encourage more work from home.  Don't do it, according to me, it is this, it is this, tell me what is your opinion on this, tell me with counter opinion, tell me with counter reason, sometimes it feels good in the short term, okay, according to me, not in a bare minimum exercise. Look, there are these exercises which you do in the gym, there is one which you do when you go for a walk in the park, there is the conscious one which is done on the default setting that you wear new clothes at the right time, go to the car, sit in the car, etc.  You stayed in the car, then you parked, then you walked from the parking lot, then you took a loop break, then you did that too, it's an exercise, you opened your body a little more than that, at home, do n't you get that environment? Now, how many printers will you keep, how many facts?  You ca n't keep books, this kind of thing, although it is not required, means technology for these things will come, but you still need something, it is very difficult to recreate everything in the office setup, today's laptop should be connected with it.  She should be with him in an environment of the office, then it came to know that scanning also has to be done, then it came to know that someone has gone with some heavy document. Well, what happens in the office at home, like you are an expert in everything in the office, are you stuck in something?  you can you Immediately ask help, please do it, friend, tell me how is the quality, if there is anything, you are like always there and then talking and exchanging with people, seeing the face of anyone other than your family members, that is also very important and many times what is there many  The problem of communication through pen point can be resolved by doing everything online, many of them can be solved by talking to someone junior to left or right even in a physical setting over a cup of tea or in an office setting.  What gets resolved is difficult to do at home in a personal setting. Saying at home, once it becomes like isolation, either you work at all or rarely do it alone. It is a different matter, but if I am like you, then anyway. Yes, you don't have any office setting system, you don't have any boss. Anyway, I would suggest you to go to the work place. This shade is very English, ahead of their different terms, wherever you go, everything is connected to Wi-Fi.  So why am I doing this?  There are coffee houses, everything is set up there too, drink coffee worth Rs 200, 300, 400 and they will just let you sit there for two-four hours, go there mentally, you will be able to achieve a lot if you are not at home. That bed of yours is not made at home, sometimes it is being swept below, sometimes it is being left above, it doesn't happen like this brother, it seems like it is happening and the jockey is roaming from here to there with the laptop.  You ca n't ask for it on your own by taking your program, but now you can either sit at home, wear a suit or boot, sit with a tie, in that also it seems like why do you have to sit, okay, now you tell me, it feels okay.  So many times what happens is that your clothes become small and you become fat, you don't even realize that there was a work problem going on at home, we did not wear clothes at home, you used to wear jeans half the time when you went out. your daily branch  It was stretchable and the rest of the things are yours, when will it get tight, when and what happened, you didn't realize that work from home has gone on for so long, so don't do that friend, don't do it according to me, find its alternative and do it in your office itself because I think this thing will give you clarity. What is your opinion? Please write in the comment section. Thank you."

    "title": "Staying Happy Is Easy ？ ｜ A Belief System Questioned [OFbQIzMHais].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, It is very easy to be happy. This is a belief system which has been taught to us. We know one thing that there is a lack of happiness in the present time and there are self-help books and big philosophers on happiness and don't know what old and new knowledge is there.  And English Hindi courses, all this has been a lot, I am also a teacher of happiness, so I will tell you to crush this belief system and create a new one.  Perspective Dunga, this is the only unique thing of my channel to give you a very contrarian and unique perspective that will change the way you think and it will cause some benefit at the end of this video, immediately you will enjoy, immediately you will enjoy listening, notes will open and  If you want to move ahead in life then let's start with what I think is research and what is my practical experience through consultation.  Being happy is not easy, first of all, because of what we do, we will call any work easy like this and it does not happen, hey, the work that is not done, first of all say that it is not easy, this is the first point, now I discuss it. And let me tell you more and it will be fun to watch. You must have seen many books, movies or things in English in them. They gave lid happy ever. We understand the struggle of human mind. Okay, let's understand it well. There is a movie where the hero is struggling.  There are fights, there are fights, there is a villain, there is a boy and a girl, and all that movie went on, and I will get married, they will live ever happily ever after, after that, no story has been written till date asking anyone to tell me the next story, tell me one story.  And starts with happy ever after means that it has started with happy ever after and then the stories are going on, you will get Cinderella type stories that there was a girl, she had a step mother, there was atrocities like so and so.  Then came the Prince, the Prince liked her and they live happily ever after. This is in our media, in our social media, in our movies, in our stories, in our everything. Our imagination ends that how can we be happy, how can we be happy?  We don't have a template for it, we are just learning that we are struggling, learning that we are moving, moving and then we will reach here and from here there is a happy there after whereas it is not so.  Happiness is something to be found somewhere here and it is not easy. That step mother is torturing you and you go somewhere and eat some mangoes or sleep for two hours somewhere or go play somewhere or something happens, then only that is happiness.  That prince will not come and live happily ever after because his different story and struggle will start. Chapters of life definitely change but being happy is not easy, it is an effort, sad.  Living is easy, this should be known and we mostly run after easy because only the thing which is easy will be done. Stay sad because have you ever heard that he came and stole my sorrow and took away your sorrow, no one can take away happiness. You can be finished like this, by becoming more of a hero, your pants look like this, there is a hole in the back, okay, you are getting more happy, okay Rohit is getting more happy, I had seen Neha with him, end of two minutes.  I am yours  You can destroy happiness, you are Rohit, your girlfriend is Neha or is it someone else who is your close friend Neha, my friend, I have seen her with her, I have seen her with Mohit, someone's happiness is gone in two minutes, ask your mother-in-law, ask your sister-in-law.  You are coming back in a good mood after watching the La Lala movie like this, doing shopping like this, and your mother-in-law will say the same dialogues. Hey, sometimes do this also in the same mood. We make each other sad very easily. You can do this in your friend circle. In relations, in acquaintance with one's wife, a wife can make her husband unhappy by saying anything. Brother, it takes a lot of effort to make someone happy. It takes a lot of effort. Someone becomes happy with small things, but in its sustainability.  There is always effort, there is no effort in giving pain, you understand my point, first if we as a society will understand that no brother, it is not like this for us, it is very easy to be happy, money does not do anything, look at that poor man, how much he was. Such  We have not fabricated stories. Firstly, our country was poor for so many years. All those things were required of us, otherwise we would have got trauma. We were in trauma, we were in the trauma of poverty, so were the stories okay or just to entertain somehow, like the thought is good. Tell me some stories like Ghalib's and show him this hero, a poor man will get a rich girl, they are also respected, fight and quarrel, set some class differences and make the girl have a rich father and all that.  At that time, people used to go to see the message rickshaw pullers after listening to the same stories, mostly the pictures because the middle class had VCR, show all the pictures like this, he will come after seeing his dreams, be it a picture of South, whether it is a picture of our Mithun Chakraborty or  By typing Anil Kapoor and Tapori, this is the fact, this is the fact, that time has gone, now it is 2024, we will talk about today, what is happening now, if we are intelligent then we will be stupid.  It is not easy for us to do everything, because even for happiness they say that it is a fool's paradise. Have you heard that intelligent man does not come in paradise? Have you heard that it is okay, so the intelligence level has also reached, so now you should consider yourself.  It is very difficult to make others happy, to make yourself happy, I would say, still it is a little easier, at least if you set the terms and conditions, then you know that I will be happy within this time. You don't even know about the other's brother. You are trying to make your wife happy. Even if you weigh her in gold, who knows, even then you may not be happy because now she has him. So put your happiness under your control and know that it is not.  Very easy, it's a state where you have to live in a state where you are very productive. If you wake up in the morning and you know what to do throughout the day and mostly you have control over your time, then you can go towards happiness. you a  I am giving a hint until some other man will decide what will you do on Friday at 8 o'clock, what will happen on Saturday, what will be your time on Sunday, because every man today, what is Monday to Friday bossily, Saturday Sunday wives.  And made it mommyor, I am directly talking about youngsters and boys here, apart from gender, you can also change it, it is okay, you can never be happy, you thought that I will be there at 11 o'clock  At that time I will do this, at that very moment an emergency is forcefully created and an emergency is bound to come in his life and just like that you have taken five or six relatives, friends and the like and he will say just one Sunday, that's one for you.  There are two hours of Sunday for me, that's the same life from Monday to Saturday, my happiness is like that and when I am having happiness, you are not doing anything and yours is left less, mine is more, you are the less left of yours.  That  There is so much focus on others, but you have lived more than me, I have not been able to live that much, I have some dark things, I am not at all ashamed to speak, nor am I afraid of being judged, and in the same way, you are unapologised.  First you have to think, how much to speak, how to do, how to use diplomacy, I leave that to your wisdom and consciousness. I have not come here to train you to become a scoundrel, but you have to think and understand like this, only then your life will come under your control. You will enjoy this thing and you will find that your happiness is not so difficult, it is not easy, it will definitely take effort but we will have to fix the routine and we will have to promise ourselves that the most important person in our life is ourselves.  I have done a relationship workshop. If you guys want to see more, you can find it in the comment section. There is a discount during Navratri, do n't miss it. There are two two and a half hour workshops and the rest are also from me.  The courses are available at a very reasonable rate but beyond that you are also getting discount, so don't miss out, like the channel, subscribe and it is very easy to remove the worm of happiness, it is not that easy which you think of as happiness.  That's the dopamine high and it's temporary and it comes at great cost, you have to spend a lot of money, go to Ace Mall, spend the money here in Gurgaon, eat fine dining.  Me boy girl that outing of 00's 5000 100 Haj 200 Haj then came again from Monday to Friday then who It is not easy and that happiness is not there too Happiness will come and you control most of your life Which people are not controlling everything else is controlling  And then you are like what to do now, if you don't control then you won't even get money, then you have to see that you have control of your life.  And you have to take ownership of time, I have explained all these things in a very good way, I will explain something, please try to explore because this cannot be the syllabus of a 10 minute video, it has to be much more deeper and beyond that here.  I just prove you a little bit in this thinking from the video because you also have to find some questions on your own about this thought process and think like this and think like this and that.  If you want to go on the path, then it is like I am also astrology. Astrology is the light of God, the one who shows the path of God or a guide, call it a mentor, call it Guruji, call it a torch bearer, brother, this torch has shown the path by shining it in the darkness.  You are roaming around like this, happiness should be very important and it is not easy, so I hope I questioned your belief system a little, I will poke you a little, belief system has to be  Question: Not getting pomegranate juice by adding sugarcane. To drink pomegranate juice in life, brothers and sisters, we have to add pomegranate only. If you are adding sugarcane, then it may be. If your output is not at par, your liking of your life, you will have to change your  You will have to change the input. Now after changing that input, whether liking comes or not is a different matter, whether there is any benefit from it or not is a different matter, but after adding the same sugarcane.

    "title": "Stock Market 2023 View Point [vuKGiMrZ2-g].en",
    "content": "Hello friends Stock Market 203 Let's discuss it New Year What is it My take Disclaimer I am not going to give any stock recommendation in every state analyst anyway this is my own opinion based on same data you guys tell you guys  How much did you understand, how much do you agree with this, I think that stock market and in that end because Indian market also follow your marketing and later I think they will do well but first  456 You don't see dam you know going anyeware is more ok but elections are going on in India between interest rates and if they do then there is a lot of cushion. How far will the interest rates go in the coming time, time will tell but the question is very last.  The time when 2008-9 or the time when it came, he was interested very close on time, you were zero itna cushion tha nahi in the financial crisis, he was on time. Government School, two much because already they are like close to zero interest rate but at this time there are many questions, first of all this simple punch interest rates are getting close to six, it seems to me that they come at 4%, here I am talking about that.  I am interested in the home loan which my family has and the repo rate remains the same and I will be interested in it, so it will be technical but you all know that it is a big home loan, whatever is related to it is fine. So if it is 8:30 percent then first we will see it falling to 7:30 percent and then again in the coming years, if we do its trajectories then off course the direct company which takes loan on its profit margin will be seen at the individual level.  If the ability of people to take loans will increase, then you will see a Lolapalooza effect of it in the future. If it goes to stocks or sectors then the domestic consumption will increase.  When we look at the stocks, I would say that you should show them where there is uncertainty. Where there is less clarity, you should avoid what you understand. Things are being sold. You can see that the company has good corporate governance.  It is good that you have as many parameters as you can, the cash flow gives you, the equity is quite reasonable, I think you should look at it, friend, the company is new, I will not take the name of the company further, but the listings that have happened in the last one or two to three years are these. New starter brother, this is the air, I don't know which hair will go, two have been listed for ₹ 2000, at what rates they have come, then how have they given one half of them, have given bonus, have some plates been made, what is going on?  There is not much clarity about it, so the established business, which is a robust business compared to the old business, which is running well, is a lot, you have to do it between 15 to 25 stocks, okay, ideally, a ratio.  If you have 20 to 25 stocks to buy, then brother, I thank you all of you and wish you a very very happy new year, you may have all the subscribers of the year, but clarity on the channel will remain for you, my request is you.  I ask people about the mental models that have been put in it, because I look at the list, how many views do they get and how long do they take and they seem to be a bit difficult to listen to, my request is that these are very short videos. You must see these mental models because once they are seen properly, I have 15-20 overs to convince, then I will make more, then I will make more, this is not taught anywhere in colleges and schools, when decision making will come from you.  It will be good because I being a consultant make a living out of helping people, take a decision, this is my intention to give free content here, because now I want to price this thing only.  If I do it and start giving it, then I feel that people will see it more. That's why many times people ask me, don't you put a price on the content? Give it away for free. Hey brother, I will see how good it is if you make it for free and then you will spend money on it.  Then people will get interested, this is also a fact, so here I decided that I am going to give free content on this channel, I am not going to charge anything for it anywhere, so my request is that on my raycommendation, New Year is coming. You see the play list once, enter 18 mental models, everything is linked up, if you watch it and make some notes on it, do two to three lines on each video, then you will have 50 to 60 lines by the time you go for the next 4-5 days.  As soon as the new year starts, I will post more videos, then you will be able to relate to everyone, some of you will find it paradoxical, this thing has been like this but din dosh tu things can exist de se time you have tu take Congress.  Of all these things, because they are all bikes, also what we do in our mind is the right thing, so date you follow and if you want to watch further videos on which specific thing, financial, then please tell us your request. Program and India Radio very high.  I don't want to take it to the level, I want to explain it slowly and in a simple manner so that everyone can understand it well. There is also a stock section in which the basic stocks have been explained. The basic terminals have been explained to them.  Once you read it and see it, you will get rid of the hesitation that this is very jargon which many people use in style, so it sounds very intelligent and you don't know that I am from this, friend, you should learn it.  He should not leave you without impressing you too much, basically that is why there is a stock market playlist too, you guys should watch that too, thank you very much."

    "title": "Stock Market Investment ： A Sector Which Has Immense Potential [tIVNHdcNzrw].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, one of the sectors in Indian Stock Market and Indian Economy which I want you guys to research beyond that is the insurance sector, recently some players have started like this, there are not too many players, the players with private insurance are one LIC and  There are three or four more companies, I am not giving stock advice here, I am saying that you should study this sector, I think there is scope for doing very well in it because of this.  Even today it is very under penetrated in India. In China, it is 20 per cent of the population, which means the population in insured rains is the same. In India, I think this figure is 5, but you guys can recheck this again and write on the comment section.  This is a blue ocean opportunity in terms of what you know as an opportunity. There is still a lot to go. Now the people of Narayan Hrudayalaya have started their Insurance has also been removed. Okay, so please follow this sector. How do you like the valuations? There are four-five companies. Which one do you like? Put it in your watch list. Do your research and see their cash flows. Read their annual reports, what is their future plan, read that and google there are 2 stocks which according to me can be very good for 10 to 15 years but you have to do your research, within this I am telling you as a sector.  That there are other reports in newspapers and there are many reports coming in Economic Times and Business Standard and all these which you should also read. I do not want to show things in detail here but this is one sector, do not go to its present PE. Which may seem high to you and further look at the opportunity as per how many people are there, they have to take insurance and should take it. As soon as the health sector opens, so will health insurance.  Which companies do it? There are some banks which do it and some insurance companies which are listed separately. Do a little research into it. Tell me which one is your favorite. Let's do the research together. And who all have made a stock position?  If they have more knowledge then it is okay then share that knowledge. This video is for knowledge. I am not CV registered, nor am I saying buy this stock, so I have taken such a name and recommended it.  I am not telling you but as a sector, and if you want such videos then I will tell you a little more, you have to work hard while walking, do not do this, yes which one to take, how to take it, sell it, no, for the long sector.  Which is clearly cut in the Indian economy. Clear cut and there is no dependence on other things, whether it has rained or not, is it okay or what is happening in the economy, it means there is some other activity in the economy, there is no dependence on anything, it is an independent thing. As the demography is changing, it will be necessary because the health care costs have to increase and when they increase, the only way you can be insured against them is by taking health insurance and life insurance. Insurance is also increasing because you can see which players are there with general insurance, vehicles are also being purchased, they will also be insured. Earlier, vehicles also used to cost Rs. 4 lakhs, now people are buying vehicles worth Rs. 10, 12, 15 lakhs. If you buy more expensive vehicles then a cycle is seen moving ahead. So please share and like this video. Subscribe to the channel. Membership of the channel.  You can also take it in it, I have included 20 videos of some general stock awareness i.e. Stock Market, the basics are very basic and have been liked a lot. If you want to watch it by taking membership then please do so.  You can take a look at them and I have also mentioned the mental models which are very useful in investment. My top 20 mental models are also included. For those who have membership, they can also take membership of the channel. Thank you very much."

Secondly, you can see that it may not be called exactly monopoly but it is practiced to a large extent by Asian Paints because of their distribution network.  It is very true that it does not go directly through distributors, it happens directly which is sold at retail shops, they come to know about it by the evening and it gets replaced the next morning, hence it creates a monopoly.  The second concept starts from monopoly itself, duopoly, so it is a bit difficult to find a monopolist because off course, whichever market has so much liquidity, someone else will come, but apart from monopoly, there is one in which there are only two people, like if I am in the telecom sector today.  When I look at stock, I see only Jio and Airtel. Do you consider it as monopoly and what other things do you consider to be a monopoly? Please give examples below so that other people can find it useful in doing stock research.  The point of buying Reliance and Bharatiya Airtel is not an example. I am telling you that where the maximum market share is with only one player, right, like there is a company which makes Excel, these are the names of the vehicles, you will tell, right, which company is it and  Its company has 70% market share in India and in the listed space it may be 8085% because many people also make such which are not listed, then which company is that which makes the axles of vehicles?  Whether electrical vehicles will be made, the normal reaction is that the car should be there, in the same way as I gave the example of telecom, I see only two companies in it, in your branded space too, now first we talked about monopoly, then we talked about duopoly, then after this it goes like this.  Where there are only three- four people in the space where like them, if you want to buy tiles, then if you want to buy tiles, then in the market share you will see that there is Bhai Kajariya, then there is Somani, then 1 2.  3 more tiles, then how is the market share in it? So, in this way, you do stock selection of those things where you feel that the market share of this company is very high. If there is a company of biscuits, then who has the market share in it and who is the monopoly? Going towards what type of Britannia industry is there, how much market share does it have? You can calculate all the examples that I told, you will see only these, they will not keep the market. Normally it is FMCG player type but in that it has stores.  He has acquired his own and he also charges money for keeping the goods and with the money he charges, he reduces the price of the product due to which more people go to him. Now if you  P / You will see how much you will get but I am telling this as an example of such a unique company, Nun of Dame is a stock recommendation. I am not a SEBI registered analyst but I am telling you how to find the selection, something unique.  This will be a good starter for us because only that company is doing it and no other company is doing it because it gives us revenue visibility for many years ahead. Like if you look at Maruti's vehicles, they are normal, it means that you will not find these in the vehicles.  I do n't know if it is a good car but what is their best thing is the maintenance and their workshops and their network, dealer network, spare parts network and the customer care that I can say. You will go to a small place also, that is, because not all people operate a car in a big city, it is fine if they do, but if you want to travel, you will find Maruti everywhere, that is why their market share is above 50.  If you look at IndiGo, why is IndiGo's market share 57%? Is it a sector, there are only a few players in it, so it cannot be a completely one-sided thing because in this also the market will go up and down, share will increase or decrease but you can see the revenue visibility.  Shorali will see that this is one thing: the vehicles, the ships, your baby, the food, your paints, your phone, this is essential, these people, all these things which I had told and are essential, this will be used by people for a long time and in this you will get one thing. And I would like to tell you that when you have to invest in the stock market, you have to do a little higher order thinking which is not published anywhere but no one is telling you any example, if they will not do it.  So you will be deprived of good stock picking or you have to see that if anyone came, I just thought about it, why did the time ITC go down because it is a cigarette paste company, so when people were to smoke cigarettes, then on top of that, they had to do the same.  People smoke less while working from home because their wife is at home so her time ITC keeps on falling and her Vanaspati was another lion in which I realized and I saw this analysis, what kind of analysis is this, rustic analysis type.  You will say that you are completely connected to it, no one is your IIM and every word and mit and some superior people do not need education and brain. Brother, if there are less people in the house, then people in big cities with computers will not wear anything like this at the top of the house, what can they wear at the bottom?  It has been kept so that no one comes to know, so it happened as if the video is being shot. The top shirt is visible below. Most of the people wore Jockey and the sales of Jockey are very big for you to see and at this time you should check the last two-  in three years you  March 2018, March 2020, I can also tell you the date of March. See the share of Page Industry in March 25, 2020. Page Industry is a company, which is a go date franchise, you have got the license to produce jokes in India, which is from International, then what is the price of Page Industry?  What a big analysis, what am I tired? Had I read the report, had I read anything that now people will be comfortable at home, now who gets used to jockeys once, again I am not.  Promoted Branded It is a recommendation that you buy today because of today's price, the story that was there got played out and it will do well in the future as well but now what is the price, see what the original is telling you in the investment advice process. How do you think about this research? In the report, perpega's brother, such fillings are being done, you have to look left and right. There are 10 best lions hidden in your kitchen in your house. Buyers, tell me which ones.  Ask the women, brother, which glass do you give to her, which one do I like, the sink, what are the cards in the sink, what is collected from steelsingh, which is right, which appliances are doing well in the market, right nine lots of things are happening in  D Kitchen: As soon as you see one thing, the status of your India is that of an average person and that of someone, then this will increase, then this will increase, India is growing like this, so whenever it is growing, it will reflect in the kitchen, you will see steel plates.  Those who serve it will serve it to someone else's plate. Those who drink tea in a steel vessel will serve it to some other vessel. Now you have to do these stocks, I will not give it cooked here, okay, otherwise then it will be like, which of those people are you?  Many people buy it blind, so which one of your mixers is producing more butter? Which one is your fridge? Whose service is yours? What kind of personal experience is there? There are many excellent shares hidden inside the kitchen. Those who put glasses inside the microwave.  are microwaves because  If India buys microwave also, then the microwave program will increase but for that we need an antenna. We need an antenna made of glass, the other ones cannot go, that one is making more, who has the market share, then you have to see by doing this thought process and you will.  Do very well and share market and end this, the fun you will get in learning will be different, you will not waste time in thinking like this, you will not need a hobby, it cannot be called a hobby, your learning is a thinking process. Wherever you go, you will see that like if you go to a village, you will see which company of motorcycles are available. Go anywhere in the village and even a small motorcycle will not look very sexy to the people, it will be like a leaf and how it is driven and it is cheap. What is its end market share and how much dividend yield does it give and which motorcycle is it? Whenever you go and see what is happening, look at the car, which Generali vehicles are seen more these days, there is a company in which people  SUV sold very big In the last few days, you must have seen that SUVs have too many bikinis. Which company has the most bikinis? Look at that. When people get money, they are called dancing people. Those who are going to become heroes in Haryana are called Machine World, they are called ideal people.  If you say, which is the car in the shop, which is the car which has the thickest four wheels in which people sit but it is also expensive and but people have to drive like this to show who is the player and where are they going.  Let me tell you an example. In 2005 or 6, Enfield used to call Bullet as Bullet. Instead of buying Bullet, he used to get it for 50 ₹ 1000 times. Well, if you had bought shares of Eicher Motors, you would have had a car better than BMW today.  Had the car been above Audi Q7, it would have been ok, so now he would have bought it, what would have happened is this story, I also do n't like telling it, but many times I have to tell you, what stock market can do to you, ok. He was in need, he will say that I was in need, I would have given another Rs 50,000, I have money, the but the question is, what follows is youth, this is falling because senior citizens will not increase their shares, where is the trend of war, what is the thing they are buying.  Have you noticed where is their focus in the company because what wrong do people do in investment? They look too much at what happened in the last year and what happened in the last 2 years and then invest further. I will also make a video at the entrance to see the trend. You must watch it. If you have not subscribed to the channel yet, please subscribe. Thank you."

The theory is that the budget session will come in July, the verdict has come elections.  Now it seems that something will be done for the poor in the July budget and whether it is through some scheme or whatever, it is fine, although the monsoon is also fine now.  If there is hope of doing well, then whatever rural economy is based, like your shares, I am telling this as an example, not as a recommended buy, only for education purpose, I am not savvy, registered, see the run up of HL in Dispina when the market fell. Also, tell me what happened with HL, then figure out some such stocks in the market which will benefit from rural action and through this video a crowd  Sourcing of information: In the comment section, write your best two stocks which will fall in that category. If the budget comes and some expenditure is given in it, more money is given to boost the rural economy and for the poor. If something like this  If this is done, then which will be the stocks which will directly benefit, which companies and which products, then please write all of them, what will be the benefit from it, it does not mean that you all should buy all those stocks.  You have to buy it because someone  If the promoter holding on it is above 50 then it becomes a little safe. Its corporate governance is fine. It has low cash positive property. Debt to equity is not too much. So start putting filters. Even after doing the screener, one  The thing is that what is normal I think is free, people also do beyond that, most of the big influencers also take data etc. from the same, so what is the point of that, you pick 15-20 stocks from the list and do your filter, do research and slowly.  -Slowly filter out and then do further research on the companies you like and then take a call. This is how it should be. If not a lot then what is a webinar through videos or someone's sub.  People walk around and tell me something. Just telling me something will not help. I want to tell them that they have to move ahead in life because what is their conveyance, what is their horizon, what is their capacity to take risk reward ratio, what is their portfolio size.  What is its ability to do that, you check it like will two wheelers increase, Kanjampatti can be a beneficiary absolutely and that in the announcement of the budget because I feel that this time look I have seen my  Opinion This is a little about the election and on that I tell you that no such great budget has come, in the last 10 years something or the other has been happening, sometimes Covid, sometimes demonetization and sometimes it was settled in GST. There is no such big bang electoral or election budget either.  Which is not a bad thing if seen like that, it is not good for politics, it is not good for the economy, it is not a bad thing for the economy to not have a fiscal deficit, but such a discipline and all this.  There was no benefit to the public by showing it, nor was any rocket fired anywhere. This is my limited personal opinion. I feel that now the coffers will be opened. It may mean that it may not be great in terms of immediate fiscal discipline, but brother, by coming to 2440 seats, the coffers will be opened.  It seems to me that this means all this is just my imagination. How much do you guys agree with this and how do you do it? Please do tell in the comment section that you will get more such videos.  If you want small specifics, I will tell you a little more specifics, so please write in the comment section. Start doing your homework. My request is that all of you should start doing your homework. Don't wait, don't wait.  This one won, this one lost, this is a political party, understand what is that political party, you try it and see the name of a company is Heritage Foods, try it and see its owner.  Who is it? You check that and write in the comment section. So I am not saying that heritage food should be bought, it is bad or good, it should be taken. I am not saying that, I am saying that there is a company, identify it, who is its owner, check that.  What is the status of that owner and what position is he in today? Tell me and if someone does it then he will write in the comment section and the rest of the people who are lazy and watch the video later can scroll through the comment section and see. Shane wrote who is it otherwise maybe you are that Shane, you are the one who writes about Heritage Foods and see how is its cash flow, how is the company, but whose company is it, first check and tell, it is okay whenever politics changes.  If there is some change, then leaders, market leaders, things and everything, if there is a little churning, then there is a little portfolio, people have to review themselves, old investors have to follow the new ones, just think where will be the  Focus of the Government to be in the coming Budget that will be governed by the political situation of the Government that will be governed by the political situation of the Government in which situation Where are the elections coming next What happened in these elections Who voted for whom  What were the issues, were they more issues, what were the issues due to which we lost votes, can we do that which  These are the genuine pains of the people which have come to the fore because now the people have voted. How can they be made happy? How can they be won again? Such a smart politician always thinks like this and I feel that of course he is a smart politician.  are the ones who are running it now, so you have to go and research about this thing yourself, see, understand, thank you very much."

I want that whenever I see a girl, she should be a money making girl and she should be good. I should not go only on the sexy net. This means that you are following a strategy of your life but what happens is that you go to the streets and not to the plane.  There is no where to reach, no, then the story, you do some job, get some girl, see some, the girl's family also, the boy also, why the boy himself is good looking, rich mother, your brother his ambition is zero, his time is zero, he cannot complement you  I ca n't take you with the story, I can't value your knowledge  He is superficial, shallow, interested in materialistic things, today he takes this, today he takes that, in this way he is attracting you initially but what is your strategy, where do you want to be, where do you want to live your life, you have given up your job but you did not ask this  that bhaiya we will make you work even on Saturdays, bhaiya we are a start up, bhaiya if we were not of our dung today then in that small company you would have been called manager, till now you were called story executive, so this naming which is going on in corporate  This is giving the most stress in life, if you are a youngster and you are in a job and you are under stress and there is no clarity on this, pay me, do it on concentration on it, okay you can take that service  You can CC us on WhatsApp, okay and you do not promote anyone else, do not do any affiliate marketing, but if you are struggling, then our top corporates are giving clarity on things, okay, then you can take their service  So go ahead, if you have your  In personal life, if there are no streets, you will change the place, you will change the location, okay, whether you will buy a house or not, a strategic decision is a very strategic decision, which city will you live in, where will you buy a house, where will you get married, what kind of job will you do, it depends on you  I have started happiness course one which is mine too you are going to come I hope in November most of you will join the course when I announce the date okay happiness course one is an iconic course okay and you will be up in the comment area if  If you want to take it, you can take it. I think its fee is 2019 77. I think by paying that, you will get a lot of clarity in it. In those happiness courses, I want to learn strategy. There is 14 hours of content and there are classes of two hours each. One strategy is taught in about 14 hours.  Happiness you will come, then three or whenever it comes, it will come, so this strategy, you have to write these words in your mind as a story, now on that scenery position, you know what are the streets, marketing has also come in the streets, seriousness has also come in it  Accounting will also come, we get to hear what needs to be done as per the government policy change, but we leave it at work. What strategy should be made for personal life, parents are becoming too demanding, there is no understanding, there is a problem moving forward, I do n't understand  How are you going to restructure the assets, should I get streets money, how should I talk, should that be your approach and should I give up on myself, I am sitting with a job of Rs. 1 lakh, my father has a builder floor in Greater Kailash worth Rs. 8 crore, it is likely to be occupied from the back  Are you scared or uncle is not saying namaste or there could be some other issues, he is not the Sultan, you need to buy a thing worth 8 crores, ₹8 crore is your monthly salary of ₹800, you are sitting with ₹1 lakh salary, note savings, you are saving  And the work will be done, you will pay the text, you will spend Rs. 800 as monthly salary, 12 months' salary makes a year, if you divide it, then you will have so many years that you are 70 years old  You cannot become poor because your age is 25, 28, 30 and you will not do it for 100 years, so today itself 8 crores is so valuable that whatever work you do for 1 lakh in future, but you are not paying attention to that because in your life  Parents are not going to learn and understand statistics, it is a strategy, father-in-law is also sitting, some assets are of yours, now you will not say anything, that is his work, why is he even your only wife, wife means sorry wife, your wife, your wife is his only daughter, so  You have streets in you and your wife has no streets and your father-in-law is also with you, he is your parent, you did not talk about your parents, your number will come, let's be on top, but whose name will you put at number two  So his will come at number two because he also has a son, so what if that son is his younger brother, he is not studying in 12th college, so is it not your duty to help him or give him some excuses, these come in this shop only one girl two girls one boy one girl right  So why don't you take responsibility, why aren't you building streets, why don't you talk to them, how come none of us is working according to the streets in India, everyone is looking at their short term, everyone is looking at their short term and when this strategy is missing  So there is war, bill, journey and whatever else on the streets, well these things that I am saying, which I am telling you for free in the middle of the video, you will learn all these things by going to Harvard and you will also learn there, go to Stanford and learn ji thinking and  If you don't go there then you will never learn and even there you will be taught the streets for some organization, as a personal person no one is interested in you, neither any college nor any institution because if you are made the same then you will be a fool for three days  will be celebrated because without fooling anyone, without creating anything brother, without doing anything, money cannot be earned, you understand what I am saying, thoughts are the same, this is not happening everybody, bill comment talk about mutual fund, mutual fund is correct, calculate it on excel These  Put ₹5000 and you will become a millionaire in 30 years. This is the quality of content which is available in this account and it is so important that on YouTube, it seems that the Hindi language content may be somewhat okay but you do n't have access to it, neither do you want to know.  If you understood the thing then I am telling you in simple language the original what works in India because even the content of the English is not that emotional like us, in our India, you who are my audience, your parents, you or all of us Indians who  90% of our decisions are based on emotions, which is okay, I am not against date but what I want you to do, its emotions can also be predicted, right brother, our motions are like this  If there are emotions like these, then a strategy can be made accordingly, a strategy can be made that these are the emotions which you think about at 40, at 60 in your life.  That is wrong because you will have to find out from the people of the 60s and make your own streets. I have seen people in their 40s, we have to live in peace outside the story because there is so much chaos in your life that you need peace in Fortis, so you  You know you will get peace at 40, so you have planned that I will buy a house in some such Elm Vallam mountain place in Haldwani, Pithoragarh, Solan and I will live there peacefully. That is your retirement today. In today's weather, the medical care you require.  Close you, be close to you, your kids who are doing jobs, they are not doing it in Solan, not in Haldwani, Pithoragarh, not in Nainital, not in Bhimtal, they are taking the name of the place by Bhavani, how will I make studies here in consultation  Further, he took the decision that what will we hoist, okay, we will stay in Kodaikanal, we will remain raised, brother, if not, the king changes then brother it seems like something else and from there you know that the car will come down from the mountain, sometimes there may be a landslide.  If I go there, your program will be the same. Okay, you think that I will be staying in Gurgaon. Medanta is 5 minutes, 10 minutes away at 15:20 and this is my Manipal hospital. This is my that one. All the people around me feel like this.  Let's take a decision, this is not crying about fate, if you do n't have a strategy, then your fate will not be a thing, power, then keep roaming around, tell me my future, I can tell your future very easily without astrology and without looking at your horoscope, today I am going to tell you a one minute video  Listen in a minute, if any person comes to you and asks you, tell me my future, suppose he tells you that I was becoming a B Master, I will predict your features without looking at your horoscope, you ask him what is your plan,  It is his plane and that is his future because it is his planning, the plane may not get executed but it cannot be that this was my plane so now I will achieve something else, everything will happen in the streets, short term, long term goal, vision will not be achieved 50 more words of Balam English  I can but here Takbir is the real word, thoughts are the same, it is an old song, there is a lot of knowledge in old songs and I will keep bringing it for you, the original one and only, okay, so today we will band the word strategic on so much that by doing this, some concept Hey brother WhatsApp plane WhatsApp plane WhatsApp plane by doing this WhatsApp which song was it called ok have a plane with and only plane it is small think about every small thing you have to make a plane bill b part of d strategy like if there is a strategy  Any war, any battle, there are bottles in it, there is some level, then there is some tactical level also, if you read these books, what do they call military literature, read about India-Pakistan war or do something about what was the strategy sometimes  It cannot be made, if you get stuck then you have to come here, then ultimately there are streets, okay, this is what you want and this is your long one, you will keep changing, where you want to be rich, you want to be rich, this is very important, I hope I explained it well to him.

There are three things in life - time, money, energy. All these three things can be invested with limited time, unlimited energy and money. So, the judicial strategy for these three things was shown to him as to how much to invest.  Where to apply, how to deliver, where to devote, with whom to spend time, such as part of the strategy, who will be your friends, are friends, you are solving relationship problems of friends free of cost, his girlfriend left him and he is crying and after you have given him so much knowledge he will not  It does not matter, it comes again and again, then the knowledge gets tightened, then your energy is more, your strategy is zero, you are investing money in such things that you do not understand, you are getting happy with little money, 50000 is your profit  Then if there is a hundred percent return then there will be something about 100% return, it would have been better if it would have been one crore and if you would have got 10% return then also you would have got 10 lakh rupees, so with these ₹1 crore only, don't pick up the content, the original content is nothing, read the book  After reading, you will see that whoever has kept a content writer team and he calls himself as my content writer, he cannot give quality content, that person looks a bit big, he has some credentials in his tongue  These are the words of these children, so since when did the children of 22-2-25-30 years start giving knowledge, these turn out to be artificial intentions, whatever knowledge I have given, you can see it from the story, take it out from artificial intelligence, this is my own  do i have any  I don't have any content, I do n't have any team, my videos are not edited, it's just a shot, sometimes my tongue slips and I say sorry, sometimes my presentation goes wrong, sometimes I hit the old dialogue, sometimes something happens, you see that.  yes but you don't see the editing in my videos because there is no editing because there is no editor, Kalisi Mukh, so in one shot, a big clipping of Shahrukh Khan's 4 minute video was being done in that picture, eight pages of dialogue was being put in the picture People also listening, you brother in law is no script, give me nothing, dear energy brother in law is Jaspal brother in law is something that has been told to you and that thing is being said, okay, in these 4 minutes the clapping is done, I am also late for my work, please do mine too,  I am also trying to make changes, okay I am trying to make changes for the people, please share, subscribe, like, thank you, very good matches will keep coming in the future too, you have the power to change your destiny with your strategy and even the good astrologers only make strategies.  you guys  Do you keep getting into predictions?

They will be those people whenever you will take any question thinking that this is a big deal.  Is he knowledgeable? Is he an influencer? Is he intelligent? Have you read the Gita? What are the Vedas and Upanishads in chapter number 5? I am telling big things according to Sanatan. It happened in whatever place is right, so I am.  Note developing on this, they are also there where I have got to listen, I am getting experience, I am taking it as an example, okay so this is specific locations specific.  It is not religious specific, country specific, it is universal, it is okay, you will find it in your home, maybe you will find your mother yourself, you have made me relaxed, it has not been raised, why should it be done, should not be done, should not cut nails, should not be done like this.  She should be bitten in the attack, this should be done, meaning she is roaming around with as much knowledge as mom has given, mom is giving her the rest, take the rest and you are like my friend, all this knowledge is being imparted to us but it is given to us in school.  I have not taught you, yes, you have not taught me, then what is the happiness of being, I will make you do something like this, and brother-in-law, now that ₹ 1 crore [music] is being sold on this particular YouTube, so listen to everyone, where is it from? Who has written this? There is no need for anger within you to listen to, cool down, relax, that is the right knowledge. With knowledge, you get growth in life, you do not become enemies in life, you get to live with ease in life, whatever comes easy.  Your  It is true knowledge as per nature and the person who himself is frustrated, now I am saying it loudly, I am not frustrated, still there is a smile like hockey on the face. To understand you people, training comes by watching the content of such people. Who has acquired crores of subscribers and grown his hair and I am doing it for you, hey, this is entrepreneurship, the person who is doing it is from ITM, it is a spiritual business, I have many times made a video on meditation, brother.  Everything is business and let it and let it note color but same are you saying ki daan south is organization this is you basically business is called organization in Hindi and this is for you tell me one thing I am my small  Let me take an example and tell you that brother, the society is doing good, you are enjoying it, I am making money on YouTube, I have some courses on my membership, there is no donation, there is no help, there is no favor to me, there is no value to me.  I am giving, I am getting something, the transaction is clear, there is no stress, but you say, give it to the organization, you acquire a car of land in the organization, you make 65 squares in it, you roam in the helicopter, you give it to the organization. You are the one who lives in a five star hotel and meets big people, so if I give you such a life where you have a name in your name, do you definitely have an IT support control?  Musaddi Lab Al Aam Aadmi, you who is my subscriber, that poor guy wants it in his name because he wants to come to him, it is not enough, if I give you the control of property worth thousand crores, then I propose that it is worth 500 crores instead of 100 crores.  Let me tell you that yes, the assets will come, whom will you hire, give all the power, if you remain the main person throughout your life, then you have definitely gone to take it in the name, you have to go up, no one goes up with someone in the name. Whose name may be paid, but whose name may not be there, but that's the same, now I speak very deep things to many people, many people can clean me for the whole life, I am ready to become, I don't need anything in the name, what do I need for myself, everything  Man, even parents say the same thing. What do your parents say? Brother son, what do we want for ourselves, we are doing it for you, everyone is doing it for their own taste, no one is of high moral ground and neither should anyone else.  And keep in mind that I don't understand why there is shame, brother.  Kant said to the people that I am giving you this book, I have written it and you give me the money, why are they saying that this is South, what is South N, by saying that, why is he making it like this? Tell me, this is the fee, this is the consultation fee.  If I gave you happiness, gave you clarity, then give me money, now I have membership, I belong to you, come from me, take clarity and lose, attend workshops, what favor am I doing to you, do you change into me?  You are coming to watch a movie, you are enjoying, if you are not enjoying then your money is wasted, you will never come again, you are becoming such spiritual narcissistic person who will put you down because of your lock of so called knowledge in some.  spare witch is not required youth is not required you should be spiritual son you didn't go to college you didn't get a job after college you didn't get a suitable girl now  If you are not getting anything in life, if you are not getting the happiness of curd, then you see, happiness is the happiness of giving. Today, here in the skull, now we will do something big, we will awaken you by doing something, you are a loser. Spirituality is not something that you can see.  Which is available and which someone can give you, you are a nice human being. Rituals are all there, brother. If we believe in the soul, there is some spirit inside which is called Mahatma, it is the soul, then brother.  If he is spiritual then you are, if you consider yourself an animal, we have knowledge, then no, hey, how did he start studying, friend, and till he comes after studying, you eat and that and he will come, I sir, have read, you are crazy.  He is making the world again because you people are putting so much effort into it, then you also have to get something out of it, did n't you enjoy this big scammer of meditation, now let me tell you, sit like this, blindfold yourself and then how did you feel, take a long breath  people happened Although some things happen in many things, there are no such things, but as soon as you walk on the streets, you are walking on the road drunk, that situation is not there, it is not a matter, that car is nothing, something is going on, it is involved in many things.  It can be used but it is not used in ghosts and there is no need to use it, there is no need to do it, it is today I want you free, it is extremely extremely great today in this world, everybody wants you free.  There is nothing worth living in extra ordinary life, you are running here, running there. You will not get an ordinary life, normal college, normal job, normal children, normal child's school, normal second child, normal life is very great because of this, people will not be able to do this.  Those worldly things that take you away from those worldly things, I am not saying that mad people should run after wealth, there should be a way to run, otherwise you will not get anything, they should run after the girl.  If you are there, then it means that you will be impressed, it is shown like this in the movie, it has nothing to do with running away, it happens by being intelligent, if you are getting things naturally, then why run away, tell me one thing, today I will tell you a simple thing.  I am asking and I am speaking in a very conscious manner and I am giving the names of two people to say that I have not received the money. I am you and you only have to check. The names of only two people are late and you have to check. Both the men. Every child in India would know the name of Mukesh Ambani ji and Gautam Adani ji. The face of these two men. As much as I am growing up with this Baba Gyan, it seems more spiritual to me. Do you think pay attention, don't write it down immediately, first see, visualize Mukesh Ambani. Pick any random post of ji, random video, random, that Gautam Adani ji had just come, that of Rajat Sharma, he is rarely seen in your court, he is not seen much in public space, then that face reading which you give.  Everyone has got money, I am saying that everyone has got it, I am not saying here that you are very established, it is a mistake and Guru ji that you have a lot of knowledge about these things, but I am claiming this.  I am saying that even those who do not have it, you two are the pinnacle of your materialistic self, both of them have a mission on their faces, they are goal oriented, there is satisfaction, not frustration, because if you  Spirituality is pleasant, write it in positive and this Acharya who is roaming around with crores of subscribers, watch his 10 minute video of shouting Shivaay Run and doing this, he doesn't have any quality, which place, which one?  There are six great things that have to be done, tell me at least one great thing, because according to me, there is no great thing in this life, there is no great thing in this life, this is one life, we were born, we lived, when every man started his life.  You are searching forcefully and he is saying no, this is very high, low, see, rising above happiness is low, something is said in Gita, there is a soul, the soul does not kill, the body changes, the body is like a cloth, so there is a need for clothes.  Neither is your Nannu's father producing clothes. Nannu's father only says that Nannu's mother is his mother. Today's big politicians are becoming bachelors and serving is their basis.  But can you become all of them? You can move there and go towards it and for whom are the bands? The country will no longer be a country for the countrymen. How will the country survive if there is no population? Go and see what is happening in Japan that children are born inside.  Children are not being born in South Korea, they are giving money, they are giving child care leave, they are also giving it to the husband that brother, you give birth to a child in 2 years and here Narasim is running a spirit in the name of special.  Very important part of a country but not so easily. It is not easy to leave. He was Soni's bird. He was there when everything was achieved. He was not in a confused state. You need speciality, you have to join his army. First of all, leave your house, stop living with parents, no job for 20 to 30 years, 31 year old motorcycle, take out clothes, good father is raising you and you are conscious, I will give birth to children and I will be able to take care of you.  I will take it and I will become the protector. Father is recorded as the eldest. Mother gives birth to the Guru. Chauth house is seen from the Chauth house. New house in Astrology. For the father, for the Guru, for the religion. I am the father. You know how to be a man, but he  It is very difficult to maintain and run a relationship, Vivek goes to wake up, Chetan goes to wake up, Goes to wake up at the age of 28, when you take responsibility in life, like, take responsibility, look into the eyes of the one who comes, when the baby comes, there is more purity than that story.  If you don't get it, you will go to the hospital on movement. The story of love is not necessary, take care of your wife and children and be a hard worker [music] and this army of losers and frustrated army is gathering and they will do very little in this country.  There is a lot of talk about religion, no one knows much about religion, because if religion is known, then these activities are done in the name of religion, this ignorance will become a honey band in this country, which brings this religion.  They roam around and have to write their names as well. Some of them are okay. They belong to all three religions and all four religions. They don't know who they are. Just like there is one basic thing in Hinduism, Gayatri Mantra, similarly there is one thing in every religion.  It is a basic thing, there are some basic things in everyone, even those basic things are not known to those people who are doing the activities because those who would know even the basic things cannot do any activities of their respect religion and cannot do it and here  One  Then there will come a time which will take you in a different way, you will know the relevance of the things, you will become comfortable in life, you will know everything gradually, do n't put the one with commandments, don't put it in the Atlas Sanatan, it is not in Sanatan, there is no book, do n't put it.  Follow the book, don't keep saying it again and again, you have gone to the post, you have read it, rest of the places are already saying it, you have n't read it, it's theirs, it's not here, brother, it doesn't exist, it's good if you haven't read it, even if you don't believe in God.  Well, it was because this also exists, also believe date, also believe and date believe, whatever it says is also believe, whatever you are carrying, every big way, you have read, this is a belief and a believer is a believer, no matter how strong he is.  And beliefs change with time. Believe systems are broken to break them and to break them and he tweets them. It is very important to understand this, so do not forcefully ask or catch.  Everyone's calling will come. Not every man can stand at the border. Not every man can save the country with a gun. In this country businessmen are also needed. In this country money is also needed. Money is also needed. Soldiers are also needed. Doctors are also needed. Every friend is important. Every person.  Just like every man is not needed to reduce everything, similarly every man is not needed here even for his life, but you have told the one who is not joining your army that what are you doing, I will come tomorrow and tell you to come and join.  you are not loving the country  No, why didn't you take the exam? Why didn't you go to India? Why didn't you join the Agni Veer line? You don't love the country. What are you doing? What is a corporate job? Hey, what is becoming a doctor? What is it that you are busy becoming a doctor? In a private college, protect the youth, who is taking it, ask someone who is doing it, there is interest there too, we will have to go, we will go, brother, we had tried, but the selection did not happen there, what does it mean to have received an invitation?  What has happened is that yes, whoever picks up a gun and stands at the border, that is some procedure, some other training, we all are ahead of awakening consciousness because now one crore people are awake, if we run as many as 10 crores, then what will be left in the country? Conscious conscience is awakening, we are awakening and whoever else is doing less is sitting at the straw stock market terminal at 3:30, the future option tomorrow is Port Reliance display, that is a stepwell.  He is also buying mutual funds. If he is a fool then the rest of the people who are doing less are all mad. Whoever is there to do big less is not a brother. Tell me, what is less, I am spreading, am I, you are confusing, you are doing like this, I can't confuse you, you can't convey, you are confused, this is a big saying, it is very difficult to understand.  It is very easy to seduce and mislead, say anything, that next person is going to get job and satisfaction, it is a basic thing which people used to get comfortably earlier, now they are not getting that, neither are they getting fulfillment nor purpose nor anything else.  If you get it then you just say that I am 222 rat, all the rat, you can fall down from the mountain and you will fall somebody needs you comment check this the day before yesterday but unfortunately  People giving over setting is also like this, so they are not able to understand that a mess is happening because what should they do when they come, they are respecting all the things of their mother's sisters and what are they doing to respect the respect of their mother's sisters. You are that too, you too, don't get married, live your life because if you get married then girls should also do their own thing, boys should also do their own thing, join the organization, awaken your conscience, don't meet each other and don't do anything like this and above all very good.  The way is, you feel very good while watching the disc, you change every time, but every time I stop, because I also have 50 less businesses, my friend, I am not conscious, but my conscience, intellect, I am realistic, connected in the real plane, connected to the ground. Sagittarius again turns on the leaders, there will be peace for a month, change will be fine"

    "title": "The Difference Between These Two Babas ： Whose Influence is More Dangerous？ [tsF5Ycmy8Tg].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, this is a clarification video to give a point of view to my subscribers that actually what ever I do and less than a lot of high order thing which I without you know teacher of, brother, by doing this, think about it now recently.  He said that I had made a video earlier by doing Ek Koi Dham-Vam, and by the way, you support Baba who runs Super Station and is another great Acharya ji.  Those who are doing so little and are like this, then behind them it means that you are lacking in brain or you are stupid or you do not know that he is taking it from there, is he taking subscription from here and wants to take it from here, then people like this  If told, I would like to say something clear, I did not support anyone etc. through any video and today I am giving clarity about one thing, dose you three five myself and all every rapper, whenever any person  A very poor kind of person is going to some Baba, is it okay, is he going to Superstition, is he going in a stupid way or is it true that Baba can be only six or four things, he is getting so much by going there, it is feeling good.  He is getting hope, some magic is happening, some miracle is happening, Siddhi has been achieved or not, we will not discuss that too but after draining it from there, he goes away raising his level a little, it does not make much difference to the society because  Which is an educated society which Those who are above all these things are not going anyway. Some different types of people are going. They are going from different societies. There is no direct control on them. You see, this one is of our time and then this one. Now this one who is from that time cannot influence this class, he can only say that either you are a fool or why is Ritu making a fool of him? which has been  Whoever wants to be fooled, they will do it among themselves, everyone is not affected, it is okay and maybe I am enjoying fooling them, for all you know, it is okay, you are getting something so less, the next person is not taking money.  If something is right then Nabu is not missing you. He is not doing anything in your life that your routine will change from the next day. He is not doing anything in your life that the path on which you are walking will change. Change it, he is satisfied, he narrated some story, you thought like this, do this, do that, don't do it, he came after saying hello, he came after saying thank you, it is good, it is not done, okay, it is something like a date, there is also an astrologer like this.  People also say that astrology is nonsense, useless and scientific, knowledge and teaching, I will tell you a lot, astrologer is like telling something, this person is not like Mars.  There is no effect, whether it is right or wrong is a matter of separate discussion, but it is like, if it is also a poison, then it is very diluted. What I want to say is that it is so diluted that it can be ignored because we even use pesticides.  It is okay to eat, everyone eats, but the person who comes from a highly educated institution, who is revered, we call him IIT IMIS, there are a lot of them here, although I do not revere them, that is why it is okay.  But I would like to tell anyone who comes from here why I think these people are very weak in emotional questions, because so much attention is lost in studies that if we do not even know what is happening in the world, then we feel helpless. If you feel like I am doing the same thing to everyone, then let it be so, but it is a fact that when you climb the ladder of IIT and in this, you were in 8th and 9th class, you become a different child, you have a different education and then go there. Reading  By going there and studying, one does not understand that much, it is a fact, it is okay, one knows a lot in many things and does very good in life, I am not talking about that, then when such a person goes to a level and helps very educated people.  Attracts them and then gives them a knowledge which is sure to be a well established institution of society in which marriage is the last holding unit. Apart from this, it will become Anarkali.  There will be no control of anyone with anyone in the society, anytime, anywhere. The actual animality will wake up Pashupa, because there is no marriage in animality, animals do not marry, why are you comparing married people with animals? Living in is also a kind of marriage, in that also you do the same things in marriage, in living in I can get nervous, some man is walking around and a video of him is being made and people because I am we.  People  So a normal man cannot make it, we have to record it ourselves, we have to do it by doing our own work, here it has become an organization, I was told that no, those who are very big in their organization are not with them, no, yes, many are saying ITM. He is I, sorry you and mine, many a times he has to say that he is a startup, yes, it is necessary, you have to do manufacturing, you have to make vehicles, you have to do it because he has a lot of it, this is also a startup, this is a startup, so many subscribers, so much like this  Account So many people ₹ 100 Organization Sanatan Religion This something is private Spirituality again Something is wrong with you It happened to you All these people do consultation with me Do n't clean your bathroom Don't change your bed sheet Do n't know how to cook your own Come on, you can take life  We ca n't keep our environment clean. Dirt around us can't be cleaned. Let's save the earth and save Mother Earth. At least do yours and show yours.  If the body is visible then we will also agree with it, yes friend, you are doing a very good job, war is being confused, because it is easy to seduce, it is always easy to confuse, it is always easy to confuse someone in any video. Also, there is no take away from the lecture, they say that whatever I say, they talk in clear cut words, brother, this is nonsense, do it like this, do this, why is this nonsense, come and speak in general terms. Give because that thing cannot be done, tell me one thing, you have installed speed breakers on the national highway and many other speed limits have been written, the limit is 30, so brother, go at 30, the next one cannot be done practically, neither will you go, nor will you cut, who will go 30?  But it means that somewhere on the National Highway, there is a school, there is a hospital, somewhere there is a public place, if a person applies his 30s there, then a person cannot go through life in the practical zone, then such knowledge which cannot be followed in life, which  The one who cannot butter life, the one who cannot be monetized, the one who cannot spread happiness, the one who cannot create wealth, the one who cannot solve the problems of life, what is its purpose and you caught it in the video because the next man is someone like you.  Chetna knows this, you know this, Vivek knows this, you know what Buddha said, you know this Saurabh said, we don't know anything, it's just that now you are not worth anything, otherwise yes, then we don't even like anyone, our job is brother.  Ultimately this is what you have to do, isn't it, why are you living this animalistic life, tell me because even after awakening this consciousness, ultimately there must be some purpose to go somewhere, I have to save this vision movement and by doing all this, this is a very good movement.  So the world is doing it, the world is doing it, it is not a wrong thing, it is not a wrong thing, but the world is doing it, whoever eats, whoever has to do, will do whatever I want, I am doing it, I will do it like this, take this money, make it.  Whether I am a transactionist or a religious person or a Sanatan person, I am not like that, I am a normal man, I neither call myself a religious leader nor do I repeatedly say that I am extremely private, very relevant, very good thing for all religious people.  Very private think, these things which we should discuss outside, we are not reducing them, I will even suggest this topic in old videos that friends, discuss these things in your home.  Talk about breaking the money of the house and making two floors, then give the basement below on rent, how to earn money, how to live with love, how to have a wife, how to make my job good, do you want to get more resources, what is the little man doing?  You can ignore the one who is doing a lot of harm on a large scale, he cannot be ignored because he will make many people fall into the pit because he is leading towards elections, everything is bad, don't do anything, what to do. Read my book with me, then what to do after that, then go as far as you want, then do something, marry someone who lifts you, then you have made them all fall down. Now you say marry someone who lifts you, she said. I have taken a contract to pick you up, I will not marry the one I picked up, nor will I marry these losers, then my knowledge of you becomes zero. In a minute, I think many times, not by sitting somewhere once but you too are my 50.  you tell the point  Now you tell me, how should it be after agreeing all the points, but this cannot happen and will not happen, I will prove it, all your 60-70 lakh subscribers, all sit down and do not do everything online as told to you.  You should marry someone who lifts you, who lifts me, who wants to lift him, then she will want to marry him by saying that he should lift me, then this person will say that if you do it with me, then this is a cycle of lifting and lifting.  I am not getting married. The ultimate team is that no one should follow the rules on marriage. If it sounds good then it sounds good. Yes friend, we should marry someone like this. Lift me and lift me, lift me a little.  Lift me, no one will be able to get married, because every man does not want to lift me, lift yourself, many will come on your own, lift me, lift me, lift me, get married as John likes, now tell me.  I will go and give you a lift for my practical. If you understand the videos then please like and subscribe us too. Thank you."

Some are cycling and some are doing other things and simili life is going well there it doesn't seem like there is leaving one job and doing another. In our country the thinking is that we Indians have to perform well, you say I will not do it 40  Will be ready, I am ready to do it, Malik.  Fire him from the job, I will come on Saturday and Sunday, then the culture has become bad, brother, sometimes when we want to escape for half the time, people say, let's go to a foreign country, let's go to the country immediately, it is not support infrastructure, it is not about air, it is  Not about pollution, these are not issues here, our country is very best because if you go by saying wrong reasons then people will say, this is not suiting us.  The country is blessed but there is so much stupidity and stupidity happening in our country, so many people are not able to understand those stupidities, they are not even trying to correct them, but they reach them and such accidents happen to them, as many of our brothers and sisters are sitting and me.

I came to know that if someone with Anil Kapoor watched this one, then this  Take this, take this, how many, how many, now I too, we also want it to be like this, friend, I want less, I don't understand which mobile phone to buy, it is practical to say that I want less, keep it, if it is not a solution, then the solution is this. Only you have reasonable desire and not genuine desire. You should have a desire to travel, eat good food, wear good clothes, this is a genuine thing, do not reduce it, you should have a desire in clothes, you should have a desire in your gadgets, you should have a desire to travel, you should have a desire to eat.  This is the basic life, you are eating less from the rich, why are you fooling your mind, I mean brother, every thing is toxic, isn't it?  If you add water to Coca-Cola and its color becomes the same and you drink it, will you get intoxicated? Will you not get intoxicated? Because you are fooling yourself, you cannot make your own, I am saying this, it is foolishness to say this, you want less choices when you have more life.  Come in, wants cannot be reduced, it is necessary to satisfy desires, you have, your child should know that brother, how does it feel to eat food in a five star hotel, how does it feel to sit in a plane once, this is what it means  How does it feel to travel? How is a good mobile phone? How are good clothes? I am not saying that if you have bought good branded clothes then I am definitely going to buy them. You are doing such and such to increase your desire, but brother, you are doing so much.  You should have the desire to put on a good perfume, buy a good phone, even if you have finished your life even after wanting so much, then you will have to sit in the forest and mountain, I am saying this, I will go there and sit there, please do it with your power. when she sits she is so  If you don't have power then people remain confused because you see one next to you, he is not reducing his desires but he is looking for ways to earn money and do more because in India it is said that if you talk about money then there is one generation.  Those who are above 55 years of age become moralistic because why should they do so because their shop is being closed, they do not have a choice, they can now say to themselves that we have reduced our wants, why did we close it?  brother you 6870  She is a 66 year old woman. You go on a tour of the religious circuit, whatever is yours, you go in your nice Innova car, you travel by air, what is the use of becoming rich without doing anything, it is by forcing yourself, no one can do it.  Also call your loved ones rich, I am contented, there is wealth in contentment, there is wealth in contentment, I am also talking about wealth, neither are you looking for rich nor in contentment, you are looking for contentment in wealth, which is more important, wealth is in contentment.  is the line  What, do it by making it a more important question, no friend, in a society where war stops questioning, progress will end there. I come from within every day and try to shine some light. By saying anything, I am giving the choice of good or bad in the comment section.  It is not good to put it because I should know the SIP, don't wear it, outsource it on rent, content is being created like this, it means that it is going in the direction, it means fine. Today you are capturing the thought process, this is the most important thing where you have captured the thought of war and good and bad videos will come made for you people, now for some other time, the country is our aspiration and young.  There are many people who give useless knowledge. More people are coming to give clarity. There are more people who are motivating. There is no need for motivation. Motivation is needed to get up in the morning to do something in life.  You need motivation to do this. Hey, you were born as a human being. This is your great luck. You did not become a dog's child. It is okay that you did not come into the human vagina. What else do you need, meaning something in life? Do you need motivation? Do I want to do something? Motivation to do something is rich, my wants are less, Papa will wake me up, that's what I am doing, so do n't say no in the morning, my wants are less, I do n't want to eat breakfast, I don't even want to take a bath, I don't even want to see sexy, I do n't even want to get married because I want to.  No, he doesn't want to get married, if he doesn't want to get married, then why should he cut the car? If he doesn't want to cut the car, then he has to do this job, then he has to do this too, he is going on this and I will try to stop him, okay brother, being normal.  Having normal design, as they say in science, multiply by multiplying, or someone like that, like a rule, if it is not working in 90% of the cases, then what are you sitting with, even a closed watch shows the correct time twice a day.

    "title": "The Rise Of D.I.N.K.S ｜ Why Young Couples Do Not Want To Have Kids ？ [F8N02lIXFtk].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, this is a very important topic, a current topic, a relevant topic, this is the rise of Dinks, double income, no kids, this video has also been triggered by Soch by Mangal or Aise Karke Ek Woh Mohak Mangal, perhaps a video of his came that he is the rich.  People Are Not Wanting to Have Babies Although he is wrong, I will explain it very clearly, he is not rich, he is rich, he is Kareena Kapoor ji, she is having two children, he is rich. Peace has come among the four, Shahrukh Khan ji is rich, the third one has also made him rich, he is one, the middle class does not know, this is a little bit of thinking of himself as rich, although I am the first one, youtube0, he is middle class and is also earning two lakh rupees. You are middle class, you have two husbands and wife too, don't call yourself rich so soon because rich children are doing it, they want to do it, they have the capability and they will do it, only then they are rich, they are looking forward to themselves, if everything is fine, then not middle class.  Wanting to do and rise of double income no kids is Dinks which is called off course woman. If the woman who does not work is a housewife then she is not able to justify not having a child is also a fact but wherever Dinks have got a job this discussion is there.  If it is being done, then what are the factors which are mentioned but what is the actual factor, I will tell you and further if you are going towards decision making in this direction, then you will get some clarity in the end.  You will definitely get information about this because I did not say it completely because it is a complex thing, so I will try to give complete clarity. I was getting questions from many subscribers even after that, the subscribers of that channel can be my common subscribers. Because Sir, you tell me the way you tell, I want to listen to you, if he tells the reasons, then first of all I will tell you that whatever is the analysis of youtube1 and class, the things that  Their report is being done, it has not come and there is a biggest mistake in causation and collation, I try to tell you, sorry, the reasons for not marrying, not having children. When a man tells, he does not want to tell like a one marks question, that this  Reason is, he wants to attempt like five mark question, if you tell him a lot of reasons, then he will mean that global warming is a higher thing, he will tell that global warming will happen, he will say that it is okay, there are big pens in the world.  Will we talk about it but will do it practically like it was told in that video that the rents have increased, well if the rents have increased then don't have children, if you have children, do you have to live in a separate house or can you live in the same one, you have to think, inflation has increased a lot, when will we live?  How will we be like this, then these reasons have been mentioned, we will move a little towards the real reason and what reason do you think that if you do not want to do it and what other reason can you think, there will be a break in the girl's job.  Ok  That is one reason right, what other reason could it be that it is too expensive not to have children or why bring children into this world and the question of global warming is pressing, no matter how much warming you are doing, brother, reduce it a little.  Drive less car, sit less in the plane, waste your plastic weight, do this, child, do this much, the child will do too much, he is also a pickle, they say 10,000 trees or I don't know, 1 lakh trees are cut, maybe they  If one child is born, there are some calculations like this, you have to see that the fertility rate in India has reached 25 because in India there is no point in talking about increasing the population or it is decreasing on its own or due to some reason.  If you are saying that it is a good thing, then yes, I also agree that it seems that the fertility rate has come to two, the replacement rate is 2.06, so when you go below the replacement rate, that means now. Is it a reason that the population will not increase? The current population and the number of children and those who have to take the decision of having children, their parents have never made us feel that after having children, we have got great happiness or have they felt the same. We have made a big sacrifice and it has entered the minds of today's generation that having children is a big sacrifice and we should not be able to do it.  Thakur Hai, it may not happen to us or someone says, Munni may not happen to you, Munna may not happen to you, we have made a lot of sacrifices, so look at this elderly population whose children are now 25, 30, 35 years old and they are taking decision making.  As for whether you should have a child or not, on what condition have you put it, your service should be done, you should not let your DNA grow further and your blood line should not grow further, I, the elders, have finished this.  I am telling that those whose children are 25, 30, 35 years old, you have seen your sadness, that crying, that constant crying of mother, this is how it happened to me, this is what my mother-in-law did to me, this is how it happened to my daughter-in-law, this is how you became, then this is how we became.  This dirty marriage has started because you people would have said that if there is no bamboo or flute then it will be a dirty marriage and there will be no child because even before this many people are saying no, why should they even get married, now many people are saying no.  Why are people having children after marriage and getting cold feet? What is the actual reason for this? In today's war, there are new married couples in it, especially upper middle class and middle middle class, you will not find these things in lower class and  You will not find it even among the rich, as they said, Rich is not rich, the definition of rich should be clear, man is right, this is because the reason that is giving for the lack of money is not the rich but the money. He is feeling lack, he is an upper middle class who has aspirations and does not have money. He feels that if he spends so much time in raising children, then my pharmacy programs will not be completed. Rich can complete all his programs, you are Ekta Kapoor.  Ask Karan Johar, ask Tusshar Kapoor, ask him, even if he is not married, it is okay to have children, so Rich is ready to have a child even without marriage, you have to understand, this is Rich's matter.  If the point is wrong, then this is the problem of our middle class. It is okay, so much chaos has spread in our life that it is not being limited, so there is no need to bring someone additional, there is a lot of burnout, now I am in the society.  Going to Address This Burnout Whenever some things go very wrong in the society, normally the government is supposed to step in but the government is not talking about any Indian government across the world.  Mostly it is fine, they are always reactive, they are not preemptive, they do not think before that it will happen, so we do it in advance, when it will happen, now this panic will happen in India, if the number of children is less, then India is not reaching a Japanese situation right now.  Any time soon, in 1015 years, a trend will be visible that these children will not be born. Children of a particular section are not being born there and are not being born here because if we cannot give them the best then the best schools.  Why should the best ones be so expensive? Get the education from the best and the best ones, which jobs they hold and become tycoons. In which school were you born? Because it is not the parents but the parents who scare you, brother, these days, just see. Fees have become very expensive, inflation has become very high, this happened, that happened, this happened, there is this fear in the society that the inflation of everything has increased, I am saying ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹  So you can get food somewhere  Take it from the government, no, no, but we will not take it. Yes, the poor are getting tantrums because of your demanding program, so the poor are not thinking like this, because what is the point, getting a job is such a big thing for a woman in the middle class. For the middle class,  It is such a big thing for a woman and a man for everyone that even after getting a job, he gets so burnt out that now he cannot even think of leaving the child to compromise for some reason. A man can think of giving up his child, but he can't even think of leaving the job.  the idea of ​​quitting  No, it is not so difficult to get a job, the lower class are maids, like many children do, but it is easy for them to get a job, it is easy to leave, it is easy to get a job again, they say, I have to work as a sweeper, what will be below this and this work.  So if you can't do it, I will come anytime. My body should be fine, whenever my mood should be fine, you will hire me whenever I want. It is a matter of demand and supply. There is an attitude in it and one child becomes two.  It is easy, although they are not doing more than that and they should not do it, but two should be done, if there are not two then there should be one, now people have come to the question why do even one, now people have asked what used to be the responsibility earlier, it is believed that responsibility is women's, women should speak.  It's my body, my choice, what's wrong, see how if you are mentally not ready to do anything, someone saying that children grow up on their own is not an easy thing, which was supposed to be the support system of parents. What used to be available in the default setting earlier is not available now. Parents themselves are saying that it has to be done, it is not in our power to do it, because what is the matter with the parents today, those whose age is retired and those whose age is 60 plus. They themselves have burnt out, they don't know where they have burnt out, in serving relatives, in flattering the boss, in doing their own thing in the job, now when the need came for their own children.  say  You know your work, you take care of it and do it. Brother, if we are very tired, then you are tired. If your children are also tired, then the program of your family is set. Children definitely give you long term fulfillment. In the short term, yes, issues remain but I will tell you.  No, raising children is very easy, it is very easy to do, there is no expense, there is no water, if something like this does not happen then it will be wrong, I will not do it like this, but you have to see that the real estate should be spoken, only then I will follow this Sango Life Sutra which I have shared.  five pillars  They are holding, this is what they are holding, real estate job is fine, marriage emotions are beyond this, I am running a very good Happiness 2 course, if you want to join it also because this video of mine will be released on Sunday, whatever Sunday it is.  I think on 10th December, I have a two-hour talk with him about his job, how to do a job, people are ready to do so much for themselves in a job, he is not ready to leave his job, his wife is ready to leave, which means getting divorced from the marriage.  Ready to divorce, ready not to leave the job, ready not to have a child, but to leave the job, the job will be so important that means doing a job there, doing good in the job, getting fame there, you will get a lot of clarity, then you will find happiness.  By doing this, you have WhatsApp 2 classes, only one primary class has been conducted, its recording will be available on 1st December, even now you can board the train or the bus, nothing has been missed, there are many more four, five, six classes ahead, if there are any plans. Child  What I am saying is that if for some reason your decision is not yes, then never do it, but do not take the decision now because God has also created a fertility window for women, which in the course of 18, 19, 20, some  It doesn't happen, it should be done so quickly but it can be from 21 22 years to 42 43 44 years Aishwarya Rai ji Madhuri ji Shilpa Shetty I am telling you something, only rich people  Will you agree that they are rich? Children are okay, they should also breastfeed. Shilpa ji, Madhuri ji, Aishwarya ji did it, they become one at that age also. They never said that yes, we will not do it. Alia Bhatt ji also did it, is n't she rich?  No rich man is doing everything, tell me a rich man, the one who is not doing it, if someone has a medical issue, then it is a different matter, today another phenomenon is also happening, it does not happen to many people, unfortunately instead of that thing.  To accept this, now they tell the world that no, we do not want to do it, this percentage is very difficult to find because no survey of this kind has been conducted and cannot be conducted, who will tell why the one who is hiding it?  Will tell if it is okay and is there any privacy issues, no one is supposed to tell also, but many people have spoiled their program in such a way, Pre Marital Sex 72 Hours Emergency Pill Men too are making their body shapeless by eating, that is stress, testosterone and testosterone levels are low, there are sperm count issues, there are some ovary issues, so much of it does not stick to the uterus at all, what is formed as a sperm, people have those issues. These issues come on daily basis that is why I am telling you and it is because of all these things then that is not happening, this is not happening, children, sometimes parents do this and that.  Only between the couple they decide that let's go friend, we will say this, we don't have to do it, I don't want to come, confirmation bias is going on a lot of people, I don't understand why there is confirmation bias, suppose you have taken a decision. Of not having why do you need to justify it because this is the pressure then you will come to global warming who cares about this much global warming the earth  You will save the earth. You will not save the earth. You have to save yourself because no matter what humans do, the earth as a planet will exist. The only problem is the weather. Humans will exist here and not. The earth is not being destroyed. Dinosaurs are gone. The earth is still in the middle. Many species came, 3 lakhs, 4 lakhs, 5 lakhs and Bing Bang theory, go back so many millions and crores of years, then this happened, that happened and I am not having children, you  Do it, you have to think, if you are a conscious person, educated, middle class, have money, you have thinking, you are also socially responsible, your heart beats for global warming, if your heart beats for pain in the world, then you are a good person.  If it is your area of ​​influence then I am telling you a very deep thing because this will be a lot of discussion, if you give birth to children then you will make this meaning a livable space by guiding them by giving them good values ​​and good knowledge, otherwise  These crazy fools, accept it, those who are giving birth are all crazy fools. Let's assume that you are very intelligent, then whatever these humans are doing, they are doing it unconsciously. They have given birth to one child, turned it into two, turned it into two, turned it into three, yes.  Some are becoming criminals, some are not, some are doing something, some are smoking beedi, some are setting fire, some are these people, if you propose, they are very settled middle class, educated, sophisticated.  English Hindi Intellectual Knowledge Spirituality Faral Lalam Everything is great for you, so you have children, can you make their children great with your greatness? You can't make them great, you have nothing to do with it, so you could have influenced a population, you were born yourself.  By doing this we could have made good citizens, we could have made good world citizens, we could have made everyone good human beings, but you have not made them because you said that we are sacrificing all this to fool ourselves because if you  If you actually value this earth and the world and humanity and the continuation of humanity, then by giving birth to one or two children, you will make them such that this thing also goes ahead, otherwise they will have to do whatever they have to do, whatever work they are doing.  If tomorrow they will become the majority, then people will quickly destroy your beloved Earth. You are responsible Nana, I am sure you will have wet garbage in your house. Separately, you use less plastic, you do not use polythene, you do not use a car, you buy an electric vehicle and you go by bicycle for short distances. You are responsible for global warming, and you are not even giving birth to a child.  Child, I do n't know which calculation is 10000 trees and these trees are also planted by you, whatever is going on in Kaveri river, Satguru ji, you are very developed there also, you are planting trees there too, very much.  You are very aware, that's why you are not having a child, then see who has to answer the number five, you have to give 1.5 crore justification for not having a child, first of all, don't give up, I am not in the mood to have a child, I am not having the courage, I am not having money.  How will you do it when it is spread here in your mind, you should not even do it in this state. To have a child here, you need a sense of excitement. Excitement, happiness, stagnation, happiness, happy state. You should have a child in a little time. Misbill of life has got nothing to do with financial status because poor man, there are many people, they are cool, they have a roof, they live in one room, there are four, there are six, there are eight, it is happening, it is happening, theirs is also going on, you will not do it, I  So let me add a little bit of astrology, the soul that has to come has to come, whether it will come through you or through someone else, it will come, you don't do it, someone else will do it, it is late and a time when it will see you tomorrow.  We used to search in the security numbers. The time will come again to search in the security numbers. There is a security in that too. Having children of my own, I do not take it to this level at all. I too do not have the habit of finding children in your old age. No no, children will not be the support of your old age, but children can become the reason for your fulfilled life. Live life well because of doing it satisfactorily, then that direct question will come, why are you  You will get inheritance from your parents. Traveler friend, I am here, experience there, experience here, photo there, photo there, photo there. I am saying that these things should also be done but it seems like there is a limit to everything, start from 2022, what is the problem.  It has been said that if people do not get a job for 30 years, then they are so busy in the job, then where will they roam, if they have not earned money in those 20 years, then they are not getting married or are they.  If you are getting late then you reach the age of 35 and then you feel that you have just got married, you are getting money now, you have a job, so enjoy a little now because now brother, there is one thing which happens in a worldly manner as soon as you have a child.  It is considered as enjoyment to do this and that, to do this and that, if there are some restrictions then the man does not want it because everything is getting delayed, now I am saying that the window is till 40-42 years, these people are in their 40s. Live for a year, do as much life as you want to live, although I am not in favor of doing too late also but then it is still better than not having any one because you have just told me the example, Randeep Hooda ji, we know he is a popular actor.  47 years old, just got married, he is 37, so he was asked what are you looking forward to, he said, a lot of kids, that is clear in Jatt.  It's okay, Haryana's okay, so if you're late, you've done all the work, done the adventure, taken a trip to Loveratri, will get married in 222, have a child, by the time you're 24, it used to be like this earlier, it's okay, so let's do ours, but now.  The athlete is very clear that he is looking forward at 47, the wife is 37, the wife is 37 and has a child at 38, what is the problem, the body is fit, the mind is fit and  If it has increased, then do it, I am saying that do not write it off, it is okay that you are feeling inflation today, tomorrow inflation will be less, you have become rich, the money has come, then do it now, I do not feel like it, I am saying this as much as possible.  You will do it quickly, if there is no inflation then it is bound to increase. Now people are saying that the earth is a violent place, the earth was very violent earlier also, someone says like this, girls are not safe by having children, girls are not safe, oh girls, historic world over.  Are we the safest that has ever been? Should it be safe and should be safe? I am not denying it. Doesn't a little unsafe situation happen at many places? Yes, it does happen but look at the history, they should not be created like this.  Those who were being attacked so many thousand years ago, 200-300 years ago, are being attacked, they are becoming Sati, they are becoming Johar, they are being attacked, so nothing should have happened, then why did they take birth? What is feminine, what was its disease, which is plague, okay, plague used to happen in Europe, it wiped off millions of population, any disease could happen, people used to die due to malaria, 100 years ago, so many.  Then why were they creating such bad people in this world? Why did they create so many bad people? One reason can also be said clearly, there was no system of contraception, people could not live without sex and by having sex  We would have had children if this was also a reason, so I would deny it completely because this was a reason, let me also tell you that, okay, now this contraception has come, now the choice has come, earlier there was no choice because we are humans. Mostly many people are unable to live without sex, okay, and then if there is no way to stop it, then it would have happened, okay, now it is, now it is a choice, so let me tell you one more thing, I am a marital consultant. I have seen that husband and wife feel that both of them are in love with each other, both of them feel very sexy, they feel more loving to each other and they feel that they do not need anyone else, only when they decide that we both  Not only don't you agree, but that too ends in a year. The relationship between a man and a woman lasts only when they have a child. This is also a fact. For some reason, the fugitive for marriage is not happening. Unfortunately, the majority has not yet come, but that number.  The number of these fertile couples is also increasing, earlier that age used to be an exception that out of 100, one half out of 200, now it is happening at 10, 15, 20, 30, now again no one is doing any survey, again no one can show such reports.  I don't do this report because I do n't have time and there is so much work left, this work is done by being a developed country, India judge is not rich in situation. Currently, the government is trying to incentivize you whether to have children or not. What is happening in the rest of the world is that the government is doing it, Japan's is doing it, it is giving maternity leave and giving money, it is giving something.  That increase, increase, increase population but the thing is that what am I, the government thinks that I have taken the contract of individual athlete, at this stage, the children are looking so much right now.  Is there any speech of 2019 or 20 by the Prime Minister? He is talking about over population in India. So if the Prime Minister is talking about population from the Red Fort then will there be any change in such 3 years or not? The population is decreasing.  This is not happening right now but a section of the population is now avoiding it. This is a fact. If it is caught then there will be a drawstring. These things have now started becoming normal. Is this good or bad? I always I say things, nothing is ever good, never bad, there is always an action and it has its consequences. The action is that if you do not want to have a child, then it has a consequence. You should have an idea of ​​those consequences. I just say the child again and again.  I never tell you about support in old age, and yet I say that children should support you in old age, your bank balance is your spirituality balance, if you have gone towards spirituality, as long as your spouse is there, that is.  You have to live with its support and I am not talking about children. Children will help, they will not help, they will not happen. You cannot live life with their support, but doing so is a good thing because it gives a sense of fulfillment and purpose and this is very historical. It has been happening for years that yes, it has been giving, it is not that it is new, it is like the institution of marriage is one of the oldest, as soon as a little bit of intelligence, rational consciousness awakened in human beings, then they Relieved that this should be an institution of marriage, all the partners should be partners, one with the other, no one's setup is okay, in the same way, having children is also considered good, as I tell people about marriage too.  Many times people come and say, no, it's marriage, nowadays children say, 'do n't marry, marriage is not good, this is what marriage was very good when you were a child, because it suited you, no, whose. Marriage Did You Ever Want As A Child If Your Parents Divorced Because Marriage Gave You Protection Gave You Security Gave You An Environment Where You Could Be Like Relaxed And Focus On Other Things In Life So Marriage Was Very Good When  You were a child, the same marriage will be very bad, when your time has come, your time has come to give that security to someone, it is  Something like that if someone plants a Taurus, then who will eat the fruit? You have got it, someone had planted it, but the person who planted it has not got it, he is gone. The trees and plants that are planted and those which are fruit bearing trees, Mango is 10 12.  If it is given in 14 years, then someone planted it, the person who planted it also ate mangoes, he ate mangoes when someone else planted it, this is how the world is going on, now you come on a stage and say, no no, this is too many trees. Or am I going to do it, what is the benefit to me, I will have to spend money, okay brother, I am going to do it, what else do you say, I should water, I should give this, I should give that, I should worry, I should do this, and there is no benefit for me, I don't have it.  Already in four trees I do n't need I want to live my life Something as a society we will have to do in it by reducing the burn out of the new generation the previous generation  Has to now step in and open the treasures and treasures to be opened only by those who have them and those who have them are not producing children. Those who do not have any treasures are the poor. We are in India, we say India, I say Bharat, I say Bharat, One India, Two India, Three India, One India, Two India, I exist in this country, I get messages, Guruji, I don't want to have children, this is a  Someone wants to say good thing, I have two girls, I am trying for a third boy, I said yes, it can be a girl, it can also be a boy, now what can I tell you, here in India today a third child is also being born, I am interested in a boy.  It's happening right now and there are many people here who don't want to do even one, so this is also a contradiction. Call it a funny situation, call it black comedy, call it dark humor, but the thing is that Datchi is also acting, what are you talking about?  Is  The population is so high that you are not having children, so it is good that you are not having children. Brother Saheb is also engaged in the third and fourth classes, so he will become a thief. Then what gold medal will he bring to you in the Olympics? Do you feel like this? Whether he will do it or I don't know what he will do, then let's see, a lot of work is being done in this India. What is your opinion, I want you to write in the comment section that brother children, should we do it, should we not do it, whether it tastes good or not, it is too late.  I'm nothing more joy  Full experience in life I can tell about my life I can tell about a lot of people I see that the one who comes with a small baby in his hand and brother does not see his own one in someone else's child, he sees his own one. Hey nose on me or face on me and then you are looking for it, okay this one went on this one like this and then this one like this and then that one like this like this like this is the same joy, it is worth it, what will it do after growing up?  It will make a difference in your life, what do you see, that is of no meaning, the fun lies in itself, those girls never played in their childhood, nowadays girls have stopped playing games, mobile phones have come and don't you know, even girls and boys used to play something else earlier.  And even now they do something else but the girls used to play Gudda Guddi, this is my baby, this is my doll, this is my doll, I will change the clothes, it was going on feelingless, that feeling is getting lost, played some other games.  I am going to say that earlier when girls wanted it then men used to say ok, it is your wish because the man did not raise it, it is a fact that man, first of all there are many men who say that no, no, they are very rare, no, children are something to be done and I.  I will also help you and earn more money for me and what has happened and should happen, these days people are becoming less and less and these days people are saying that it is okay as you see it, it is okay because it does not make sense for him to do something himself. So I swear that I will not  I will do it suits him, he should also not get the responsibility, he feels that yes, if this child comes, then my programs will be spoiled, my getting AC-ex will be reduced, my wanderings will be reduced, I will not be able to do anything here, he will not be able to do any good.  And the rest must be looking at those who are with them, it is theirs, it is theirs, their parents are not coming to help, there was a generation which was the last generation, their parents used to help, in-laws used to help, mother-in-law used to come and the girl's mother.  boy's mother together  It used to happen that aunt used to come, Japa used to happen, something or the other used to happen and those children used to grow up okay but now no one is ready to come, relations are not settled properly, mother-in-law is not tolerant, that too they also have attitude.  It is not useless, if we don't come then these are all the reasons due to which now they say that they do n't feel like it but now the society will have to step in at the level of elders at the level of society, there is some big need to discuss.  From this end, what is your issue, why are you not opening the coffers, let us open, take the child, take the house, we will give you rent, you do it like this, you do it, you do it, you do it, you do it, you do it, you do it, you do it, you do it, you do it, you do it, you do it, you do it, you do it, you do it, you do it, you do it, you do it, I will pay the fees, you do it  So how much is the correct fee to be paid, from first to 12th, it is ok, 200 Haj, 100 Haj, 15 Haj, we will have to open the treasury, if it is not done, then we will not do it, for the next few, monetary help will have to be given because  Those who don't have it, I keep saying again and again that everyone can't give. Those who can't give, they are doing it anyway for those who don't have it. I am also telling this to those who can give, or I am telling it according to the class difference. I am the one who is coming, neither are the knockers nor their parents, they are of good peace and leave me like this, friend, let it be ahead of you too, but it is important that there should be population growth in every section, it is good for a healthy country, you don't.  Want a particular kind of people only having babies and others that don't come, then what will happen to them when there will be no children like this, then you will have to do immigration to get this work done, demography will change, see what is happening in the rest of the country.  In those countries where population is growing and not increasing, there is no immigration, there is no immigration, the demography is changing, now you understand.  I am coming to India for the country, I will have to do it for Mother India someday because you want the outsiders to come, then they will definitely come, then you will not be able to sweep and wash utensils and your people who used to sweep and wash utensils have become your lower middle class.  And then that way the population of every section is not big, then you will bring coders from outside, the rest of your things will come from outside, now we Indians are going out and doing this work, and they are doing it for the rest of the society.  Think the original countries are very happy having us there as they love Indians. Is it like this? After 10 20 30 40 years, this is such a thing that it will burst, so I will end it with one more thing. This is a long video, you want.  These are such long periods of time that will have to be made long to give clarity. The biggest thing I would like to tell you is that you should try to understand that we can never do things in the long term.  Let's see in the short term that right now I want to travel for three-four years, if my platform is doing it then I will never do it. I am saying that you don't want to travel, you don't want to face shocks, this is how they say shocks in our Haryana.  You eat well, visit Goa, visit Switzerland, make a lot of money, do whatever work you have to do, and then take a call. If you have understood this thing, then please share it with this thing. What is your logic?  are you child If you were not doing it, then you will do it now, okay, what should I do, should I not do it, or Ma Ma, yes, your body, your mind, you decide, but before deciding, understand that no one has had a fulfilling life, not till date, but he Vivekananda  ji has done it and Yogi ji has done it and Modi ji has done it and Rahul ji is also doing it and yes yes so you are operating at their level then come on but you are doing a normal job.  go somewhere else  Then this one is not going to give you full feeling, it is okay, you are not operating at this level, if you are operating at this level, then where is the time, where am I saying that there is no need to do it, but look at what level you are operating at. If you are living an ordinary life, then this is the only extraordinary activity happening in the ordinary life, which is life itself. It is very important to serve the people. You will find many who will serve the world if they do not have children. You are busy doing this, you do one thing for yourself and make that person worthy of something, that too is a great service. For Maha Bharti, for Maha Bharti, they do this, they do that. These days, a lot of slogans are made and words are also used a lot.  If it happens, then for Maa Bharti, is that mother not giving birth to a child? Where will Maa Bharti remain? If Maa Bharti does not have children, then a country is not about its infrastructure, it is about the population, not the people.  Lick the infrastructure, for whom should we build roads, for whom should we make jazz, for whom should we make vehicles, for whom should we build schools, if children do not go to school, then these school fees which are increasing so much, look at these also, friend, one day your school fees will increase.  Only the children will stop doing this class, then the children of the poor will not come to you because the fees are so high, then if you reduce the fees to improve the children of the poor, then reduce it a little today itself so that the children can do at least.  Just come up with some scheme, if someone has two children and the other one is also a student and has a brother or sister, then we will take less for that. Incentivize it. I am telling those running the education institutions that your schools will also be closed one day, one day they will stop producing children only.  Will do that class which is paying 20 25 30 4 Haj fee and wants to send its child in that class only, does not want to send it in a cheaper one, that class is now shying away from doing the child. Because of the high expenditure on water, as a society, there should be a debate as to what things we can reduce. Brother, if you do it then it is okay, take a reasonable fee, otherwise people will stop having children because they spend so much.  You won't be able to do it, your salary is not increasing, everything is not increasing that much, your fees increase every year due to Covid, still you don't feel ashamed, no matter what comes, you don't have to do anything, this is on school fees, one more video is made, one and a half made earlier butt  Another half is formed because  It is necessary to shake them also because one gets angry on them also. People like me feel that because children are not being born because of your affair, that is the truth, what is greed, this is a big sin. Incentivize that one of your brothers studies and your sister.  Or brother, even if he is younger, we will reduce his fees a little, that's how it works, buy one get two free, get one free, something has to be done, otherwise your institutions will also not run after a stage, the trend has started when  till  By the time its report comes, it will have matured but not having children. Is this right or wrong? I will not go into this because if the situation is like this, you cannot do it, then you cannot do it. No matter how good the buffet is, you have 25 dishes in front of you.  Out of these 10 favorite dishes, if your stomach is upset and there is severe pain in the stomach, then you cannot eat it. Yes, but I believe that after four days you will regret that it was that day and you would have eaten it, but you could not have eaten it.  a truth But will your stomach be upset every day? It will get better someday, so when it gets better then think about eating. You do not need to say that at that time the stomach is not well, so after today I will not eat, I will never eat.  I will never do this thing. Agreed, you are 25, 28, 30, married for two-three years, do not want to have children, are not in the right frame of mind, in that zone, it is understandable, you and yours.  If you don't have a wife then brother, think about it after two to four to five years and think about working towards that situation. If it does n't happen then tell your parents once that brother, we can do it but we have these issues. Can you help us? Do you want your grandson or granddaughter to become a dhoti or a dhoti, speak openly and have some shame, now I will use the word 'we', elders should also do this, oh your line is closing today, why did your life come here?  Earlier they used to do so many marriages so that they have children and there may be many, there may be many, earlier in the old times they used to do it like this, do it like that, but now the grandfather will take it with him, hey, open the treasure for the daughter-in-law, open it for the son. Give it friend, if you do it, you will get this name, now it is up to them, the government is not going to do it, as long as it does a program, the program becomes very bad, when the government is gutted, it has to be given to the farmers. Now we have to give 000 rupees to the poor, now we have to give it to our beloved sister and this is our kitchen, the government is at the same level, India is not giving the farmers the money to give birth to a child, nor has it reached India to give the child.  There are still 20 years left to provide incentives for birth. In India it is not there yet because the middle class is stopping having children. The middle class, upper middle class and the poor are doing very little.  The upper middle class will never get any subsidy directly from the government, so only you have to see what I am saying to your father and grandfather, Nana Ji and Nani Ji, they have to do something that son, this one of mine is special for you.  Will we get something or something, we have to lure, we have to incentivize, only then we will be ahead, otherwise this story or global warming is a pain for me, it means be realistic, yes, there should be so much concern about global warming, brother.  Sir, there should be a lot of concern about global warming, so watch your actions, what are you doing about global warming? No, I am not doing it today, I am not doing it today or I cannot do it. Don't dialogue, which choice is what? Okay, so please share. I hope.  There must be some clarity in it because it has a lot of layers in it, it cannot be made white and black, it is very grey, this is Khichdi, it is very difficult to separate rice and pulses, it is as if Khichdi is made.  It's difficult to move, ok please share."

    "title": "The Role Of Serendipity ： The  Fundamental Attribution Error Working In Life [Zpy-PJYiDnc].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, this is a very deep, wonderful and amazing topic. The name of the topic is Role of Serendipity in Your Life. It is a very English term. You can use it in simple English. Please Google its meaning and understand it. It is also not very English.  It will be buttered, okay, those who don't know, the devotees will know, you are going to be very liberated by this, all the people who are working, looking for jobs, working hard, your children, if you or the elderly are watching, this is going to give you a lot of clarity.  You will not find any such video, let's start with an example, India's population is 144-145 crore, we exclude very small children, those small ones mean very small ones, then there are 128 crore children, mother, we have taken children above 5 years of age and we have to play a game, 128  If you want to play a game with crores of Indians, let's start with Devan in particular and what is that game, 128 crores will become 64 crores and the toss will happen in such a way that whoever wins the toss, the coin will be heads or tails and the winner will go to the next round  which will go  If he loses, he will sit peacefully in his house and keep playing the game, like on the first day, out of 128 crores, 64 crores were there, then the next day it became only 32 crores and then 16 crores because it is becoming head tails, half the people will win and half will lose, so again 16 crores 8 crore 4 crore two crore one crore 50 lakh 25 lakh 12:30 lakh hundred three lakh if ​​you do it like this then in 27 days 10 people will be saved, by doing this 10 people will be saved and if such a game happens as I have done  He said that if something like this happens in India by doing Khelo India Khelo, then you all know what has happened in it, in which if there is a famine in a proper way, but the media channels, social media, Sir, Tantra Mantra, society, they are interviewing these 10 people.  It will reach first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, eighth, ninth, tenth, brother, sister, who are you, how did you win, then it may be that someone among them says that I am a Metrology Engineer from IIT and a voice of a Khan has come, I always know that  If there is a mine then the head will go and if there is food then oil will come, if someone says this to me then Mata Rani comes and tells me that she will say that my form is open, I get to know about it beforehand, anyone can come and claim anything and we  You know, under this example, many of us know about it, like now when I am giving you an example, you people must be thinking that no no Guruji, why is he doing this at such a time, how do we know about it, when he is doing this in real life  In real life in India, people start drinking milk suddenly, pay some attention and sir the world is making them drink it like this, okay otherwise actually it is going into the drains from the back, then all of them like us will come and say that it is gone, what's great in this, oh  do n't talk nonsense, this gay has gone it right 27 times, something will happen, someone should try it 27 times, if you try it 27 times now, then so many people were standing there, out of these many people, this many will become this thing, when that period of life happens, see this example, if 27  If it plays out during the day, I believe that many people are intelligent  And under this example, we will see that there is no talent in this, it is just a game of probability, started from 128, then from crore, next day it was 64, 32, 16, what is the rate in this, this thing is happening in real life  It is ours and we should put our motives in there and from this also I am going to tell you the learning, you should see that if you took out the coin on the third day, someone took it out on the second day, someone took it out on the first day, or someone took it out on the 18th day, all will be taken out on different days, story na  The story is that 10 people are winning, so brother, what should you do in your life because this game is being played when you are giving the exam for a job, this game is being played there, you are roaming around in weddings, looking for girls, looking for boys  You are there, it is getting played out in your life, it is happening within your promotion, you go to a government department and there is a batch, no matter whose it is, sit for it, take its batch, no matter how many government departments it is, you know 1000  there comes a batch of them  One Bharti says okay and he slowly goes up, now only one among them will reach the top, the rest will keep falling like this, someone's mother will be ill, someone's son's child is unwell, someone's child is not being born, someone's child  There is an issue in his marriage, he is failing because he is not performing well in the job, he had got selected for all the jobs, but for some reason he is not performing, what happens many times is that those who are toppers of the batch, When young people get jobs, they are very talented but they are not able to reach much ahead, someone else reaches there, the one who reaches there comes and tells his story, while the same thing is being played out everywhere, so what is the meaning of hard work in this way  No, hey, any person can also consider jumping as hard work, that it requires a lot of hard work, you should understand carefully, it is not like that about India also, but if you ever understand, a lot of such things will happen in life, learning from this is going to come out to be three to five, look at it calmly, deep Incidentally, I would like to mention one thing here that my content is so original that I can come and talk about it  I am original whereas there is a top youtuber who has copied a little bit of mine and that UPSC exam related thing has come out yesterday-day before yesterday, a few days ago now I cannot blame them because they have a content writer team, they steal it.  He is in love with the channel and has lakhs of subscribers, who knows, I do n't know how many crores I have, only I will be watched and I am watched and the entire content is stolen, such things pain the heart many times because you should have had some knowledge  Not only this, not you friend, I should call you friend, you have to call me Guruji so get away from these things, yes, till now I have probably not become such a great Guruji that I will not get away from these things, I will get away from them, I did one thing well, I did it well and that was UPSC He is related to exams and parenting, he is India's top motivational guru, you should take his name, you people know he did it well, the same topic as mine and he said it on the channel, he said in his YouTube video that there is no YouTube channel  who is telling this like this hey so tell me this friend  I am I am I am telling you from last two and half years what is the problem with this on YouTube, their content team steals one thing from the story, it gets views, after that give it to me, take you any other place, if you are connected with me So you are going everywhere you are going somewhere something is happening I am changing my thought process I am going to watch one of the games of life this is hi I will tell you and what the middle class is doing again I will tell you who is poor then the game  he is playing a lot, the kid nearby is playing the game a lot, he is applying for peon as well, clerk as well, doing group BB, doing option as well, I don't know, he has opened everything everywhere and the middle class which she wants to play the game with only one coin, well I got out on the 12th day, we will try again next time, then next time I got out on 18, then on the 19th day still she is not able to win the game because in 27 days she will reach only 10 and this game  so many others Kids are playing this game which is not your probability chess and the rich ones are not playing it at all, ok no you make money, they are playing some other game of theirs and there is no chess in those games, this kind of chess is also there my wife  My style is that of my father, I had delivered a dialogue there, both Ved and Al, meaning if the coin stands up, then it is of my father, okay this dialogue, whether it comes in first take or second take, you have to play it  D wing game if you are in a game in which you are losing and you are going loose and in a relationship you are running after this girl, she is going after him, he is going brother the lock factor is playing out a lot in everything  There is writing on the wall at commerce, I have to become this only, I will just work hard because the person who becomes this, he is not going to pass the prelims again after two days because this is a game of coins, is n't it brother, if  You have heard only this much of the coin, either your ticket gets cut or you have some dream at night  If I go then I will tell you that when you play the game next time then you will win as much as you want and next time there will be some other winner. You will never get a winner again. If you play the game of 128 crores again then the 10 crores you won will never be there again. You guys will also know that D story happens but whichever department or organization some idiot is you rich top and I am using the D word idiot only because actually every promotion it is an incumbent date you are going up your contender every you never know what  You may also do this but you did something very well and you rich here and the system is working and that thing becomes very big and you show your talent, talent is there when you have an equal system like cricket, like athletics etc.  You are seeing the records, if Hussein Bolt has won the gold medal in it, then he will have to run every time, it is not like he ran once and got the gold medal, you became this or some other person like this, an officer or life  In  Once the story is made, after that you are just earning your bread and butter from it, you are not running again, so now when you reach the top, when you reach the top, then you cannot clean the leadership, date it as a message and that is the head of the head in life.  If the thing is playing out then when is the reason why I am teaching this to you people because how did you do the stop wasting time, it is exactly it is like you have to play the game, yes there will be some qualifications in the play, there will be some limitations of playing Date which of you understand it is not that all are useless and all the others are in pieces you should have a cut off so if 10 lakh children appear in this exam then the competition is only between 70-80 thousand and that is ₹920000  So there are no likes at all, they just put it, dad, but now out of this 80 thousand which is a very high number, if 100, 150, 200 are getting made, then brother, this is now playing out, which interview got your vote hit  Are the marks in Raika's interview not very high but five to seven marks in it will make you rank up or down such that you will be directly seen going into account service or you can go to center security below and the rest of the shackles that are put in place with our help  The crutches that have been given to take people forward, do have a role to play, so after discussing that, if you want a video on reservation, a very nice and lovely one, which does not think of the pro-reservation or anti-reservation brands, then that is done very well in the video.  I will make a video for you guys, how did you like this, tell me that you are a lock and I want to say this, you cannot pronounce it as lock completely, that is why I have used the English term, this cylinder PPT, because you should see its meaning, it is something  More sometimes Charlie Magar is live and I follow us a lot mental models and decision making and it helps me a lot if you want to become a member of the channel then you can get access to solid videos you can become a member of the channel we will get a lot of clarity  You can become a member of this channel, the name of the membership of this channel is money and  Comfort in 5 to 6 months there will be an increase in money in life whatever was additional and there will be an increase in comfort, there will be an increase in both things, so if you want to take it then you can take it, everything is one of their words, Lala Palooza effect, okay, what is the Lala Palooza effect  It happens that in life when many things start moving in one direction, as we say in Hindi, one and one make eleven, one and one make 11, then it never happens practically, but one and one can become more than two, many times in life All the factors are going on and in astrology, you call them as reasons, okay, reasons are that the direction is going, you understand what is happening very well and getting a date with a natural push of your parents, society, your own.  In which direction are you going, the person is lying down and the current is taking him along, then you should not swim too much in it, swimming against the current requires force, so that feeling comes when you first believe that  Brother, talent is necessary, hard work is necessary  It is there, without it there is nothing so I am not denying it, but brother if many people have talent and many people have hard work then what should we do now, what should we do now without talent and hard work then of course I am not going to do it either  I am not saying that talent and subject are not everything but brother when it is a country of 144 crore people then many people are hard working and many people are talented and this life is dozen through and opportunity comes in the future so its a simple solution is to cup your talent cup your  Hard work, don't let them go down, don't let the skill set go down and brother, play the game a lot, do a lot, do a lot, now people will say no, no, my focus will not remain, it will get diluted, you are the one who has a big game,  No one is stopping you from playing as much as you want but you are being told that brother, play some other games as well and at the same level because if you don't win then how will you gain confidence? You never played badminton, tennis or any other game in school.  did not win, did not reach the university, there is nothing in the university, did not play state, did not play national  It will not give you direct access to the Olympics, but you will have to maintain a minimum level, you know that yes, I am butter in this, I have won the game to this extent, you have some success behind you that brother, I have won in Group B Pass your exams, I want to become this, I want to become this, I will keep playing in the IPL till I am old, but brother, I am not like that I don't want to play in the Big Bash League, I have to achieve something, if not, then that pressure comes, you are a commercial cricketer, right?  He is not playing well right now, if he gets into the state after doing this, then he seems to be playing well, there is some story of his, if someone gets hurt, if anything happens, then there is a level to fall, it is not below that. That thing has come when you want to play everywhere, you are saying no I will play only international, and brother you did not score any runs in international and then you did not play national, neither did you play Duleep trophy, nor Ranji, nor any other game of your own, nor IPL  No, brother, just play some game then now I hope you understand that brother, consultation can be done both, expensive ones and cheap ones and also very cheap ones.  Webinar Workshop Small Channel Big Channel They call us dear, no business is small, what is the reason for that dialogue, date when you say nothing is smaller, so date that has become a movie dialogue, what can they learn, one trip is no less than Pune  It will be fine for you, you will have to do a lot in life, will have to play a lot of games and ultimately it is locked, I can tell you that those who conduct the group A exam, many of them will not be able to clear the group B exam, SBI PO examination is also a fact, so it is not like that  that he is an intelligence person, I know a lot of boys from IIT, girls are not in touch with the boys, for example, jeans, this time he could not clear CSAT, this one of his comes, he could not do it, how did it happen to him brother, we our  We will put it in the back command, what is happening is that we have to work hard alone, we are not talented alone, my luck is bad, you cannot call it luck, the more engagement you do in life, the luckier you will be if I made a video  If any video of mine went viral then one of my videos earned 15 lakhs when I  I was making it, I knew it was a video, now I am making this video, I know how much it will be, I do n't know, it might go viral, it might be good, time might flood, what is in my hand is to make videos, make more videos if I make only two.  So in chess, if I make five good videos, do I have the talent to make videos, do I work hard, do other people do it, but if there are a few of them, how many chances are you doing it, this means  Also don't make too many shops and their quality drops drastically and do it exactly like this, that is a different experiment and further you can play this single player game nicely I will band on this one if you want more videos and clarity on single player  A game so that brother I have nothing to do with what marks anyone is getting. I am giving my test, how many A's have I got. I have to get more than this, more than this or more marks, whatever parameter of life, I have to improve on this. So I did not look further to see how many views someone else got, who is sitting at how much, I looked at myself, I made my video  There are so many likes, so many good comments, how many more next time, what will I do by competing with someone else, that is a different matter, I came and told him that it is useless, he said that it is gone, okay my golgappas are better, my water is better.  I have mineral water, my account is good, my spices are good, business is fine but ultimately still there is huge competition from me in this other shop, they will judge that, they can claim but the water at your shop, which you are talking about, is good.  It is good and it is attracting people in its taste, so people will come to eat golgappas, so ultimately life is a single player game, I will explain it to you in detail in the next video, do tell me how you liked this one, if you have not subscribed to the channel yet  Subscribe, if you want to take membership then you can also take membership, thank you"

Many times people feel that if they tell that Tankha then people will  I wonder who has this much because the audience is connected everywhere, yet I take courage and accept it as a salary. In a city like Gurgaon, lakh rupees is a common salary. In other cities too, it can be Rs. 60-7 thousand. It goes up and down but lakhs of rupees are talked about by a 30 year old man who has been married for two years. Now what we are taught is to keep a lot of expenses in mind, so if you keep all the expenses in the bank.  If you are doing it from Rs., then what is the need to note down, you paid the rent exactly like this, after that you bought clothes, gave food to the maid, you also have Paytm-in lakhs of rupees and the expenses are around 1.25 lakhs and 1.5 lakhs. Brother, it is like this, you will have to save 10-20 thousand, otherwise what are you doing? You will have to save this much minimum, do SIP in mutual fund as much as you want to save, now you will say, if you want mutual fund then tell me.  I was not rich, so when did I say that I am rich from mutual funds, then I still did not say that mutual fund investing definitely helps you in not becoming poor. It will not make you rich but not investing anyway will definitely make you poor. Okay, so this.  You have to understand that you will not go up but if you don't do it then you can go down but what to do and what to understand and I will also explain its logic so on this  A lot of energy is being spent, a lot is shown to each other, there are fights between husband and wife, there are issues in the relationship, there are expenses to be made, many times the wives do not even know how much the husband is earning.  And everywhere else just put money in the account and spend the money from the account itself, you will understand automatically, don't waste energy on all this, in two to three months you will come to know what.  What is the maid's salary? Your expenses do not vary every month. You eat the same food, live in the same house, live in the same city, the distance is the same, you have the same petrol, the payment plans do not change. Energy is saved on things which will not be wasted and energy has to be put in earning money because one has to become rich through that. Why does the middle class never get rich by investing in mutual funds because whatever they are investing is 10 20.  Hajj, they also actually call it their savings but it is not savings, it is only money for future expenses, like buying a car, buying a house seems too big, then people said, remove the house, go on rent only, it is so big.  Then our life becomes miserable, it seems that we are not earning anything but the fact is that whatever 10, 15, 20 Hajj you are saving, whatever is yours.  You have earnings and these are your expenses, so whatever you are saving, these are also the expenses like painting the house, getting the child's school admission or going on outings or buying a car, these are the expenses between Rs 50000 to Rs 2 lakh.  It is only among these people that the piggy bank breaks. Which mutual fund owner's piggy bank does not break every two years? The one who calls himself middle class, the one who is slightly upper middle class etc. is that yes?  He will keep on running because he is focusing on increasing his income. He is saying that this piggy bank will not break. Today I save 10000, then I will save 20, then I will save 30, then I will save 40, maybe then I will not be able to save 50 but that much.  40 40 saved, but I will not break the 10 that I was saving and the piggy bank that I had opened earlier, otherwise they will earn money for a long time.  You will earn money in the long term but most of the piggy banks are breaking. Lehengas will break at the wedding. People are buying lehengas worth one lakh rupees. The hydraulic lift is coming. Such weddings will also take place. There will be a video on the wedding. Lehengas are coming on the hydraulic lift.  The dust is coming here, the joining is happening like this, the stage is being built, then they are getting up from somewhere like this, something is happening from behind and that means ask their money, it means weddings.  I for one am saying that there should be a trend in every marriage, Dhalla Dhun 's income should be disclosed without insulting the society. Society should know that brother, this Dhula's salary is 0000 and the bride's salary is 0000. Whatever it is, both of them earn 1200 and this  See how 60 lakh 50 lakh are being spent here because it is the parents who are spending it. Hey, not the parents, son, we have taken care of so many people, son, we will have to do it.  So this is also the truth of life, this is also the same thing that was being told about energy waste, that we will pay very close attention to our monthly expenses, throughout our life, we were taught by the same parents who will spend those four hours in four hours. People often say that the wedding expenses are so much, who is spending 40-50 lakhs on a middle class? Hey brother, give me a set of jewelery and that too the lehenga, everything will come in the cost of the wedding, whatever you are giving, that too.  so about marriage  The expense is only for food, I don't know how to eat even that much, although people have made the system very expensive, the whole system has become expensive, but the fact is that throughout your life you have kept track of fifty-four eighty-eighths, which is better than your wife.  You could have eaten, you could have sat, you could have experienced and then you came and did it like this, then why were you keeping track of it, why were you wasting so much energy, if you had to fly then you would have never done that in your life.  so it was in this Energy ji gives a mindset of scarcity. I am not at all saying that if it is worth Rs. 1 lakh, then if we do not pay attention to the expenses, then our expenses will become wasteful. How will that money become wasteful?  You can do this. If a person with a salary of Rs 1 lakh does not use a credit card, then how can he spend unnecessarily? Tell me, the money is being withdrawn from the bank itself, otherwise if it is not there, create an emergency fund, then do this.  Take and count your expenses, what is this, this is a very manipulative thing and unfortunately this has been going on for the last seven years, when it started in the beginning, we assumed that we should have financial literacy, this should happen, but tell me friend, any financial Look at the influencer, it is still the same thing, he will say what you should have, you should have a six months emergency fund, okay then you got to know, how many times will you tell me now?  Regarding this and in the emergency fund, if one's parents have an emergency fund, then what is the problem? If you have too much emergency fund, if your health is insured, you have life insurance, then you have an emergency fund for your living.  Luminati World, which runs this society, has done this to scare the people who are employed in the society by throwing them out of the jobs of Expenses. That is why this situation has happened. The latest thing happened is that a 45 year old woman died while working in HDFC, Lucknow.  What is happening inside now, that ca na subst, that was going on case but man 45 is also young only 45 ko so you can't say it is old 45 me woman working while finishing the bank off that taala talash picture kaun tha  C. Aamir Khan used to talk like this in Mumbai language, he has gone off, meaning people are getting off like this here, friend, they are getting off while walking, meaning I feel scared, who will go off when and who will be off at what time?  If this happens, then how much do I have to spend all my energy or I have to pay attention to how to earn more money. And it can be earned in many ways. I am one of the women who are earning money on their channels by doing unconventional things and doing conventional things.  It is the same in a way but people used to think that they were unconventional but gradually they will become conventional that by starting a small business from home one can easily earn lakhs, one and a half to two lakhs in every business these days. What is the listing and venture capital even before starting the children and I have to go here that how I will not become a billion dollars means people are not happy and satisfied that brother there is a job worth 70,800 thousand lakhs and 1.5 lakhs where people are sacrificing their lives.  It is better to do some work of your own and that work will never bring you Rs 2 crore, you will never get listing but you will earn more money than salary on a sustainable basis and it will increase.  If your salary will continue to increase more than what you were supposed to increase in a year, then it will be quite stress less and many people can start but they have to do one two by four, one two by four and after that then if that much is not happening then  Then I don't have to do it or I overleverage and then after that tension happens and then that work gets finished then please stop wasting your energy on this mutual fund because by doing SIP, you will get this much, you will get as much as you want. Do it once and then stop as soon as you get to know it, I do n't understand one thing that you have given the paper, you have given an exam, you have given the paper, the man comes and checks once or twice, everyone knows how many marks you will get.  It remains that friend, it is fun, it is my time, but one paper has second paper, the other has third paper and the other one has fourth paper, so I have to prepare for the next paper, keep checking in the same paper, how many marks will I get, that is the paper, the result has been given.  Whenever you are in a month or two  It will turn out that we will come to know that so many will come, so I am thinking that my 92 will come but somewhere 95 will come, let's see who will come, friend, it is a rough estimate, now prepare for the next paper, that is life, started SIP of mutual fund, now after making that 5000, if  By growing so much, it will become this much and after growing that much it will become that much and at how much it will become as much as it will become, it will become that, see are you happy with it right now that it will become this much, it will become that much, you will not be rich.  You know that you will have to work to earn money, if it becomes so much then it will become so much, it is the criteria which the middle class has in their dreams, so Mukesh Ambani's children do not need to work, they  The amount of money you will get in your SIP in 50 thousand years will be more than that by doing SIP and compounding in 500 years. So these people are already sitting on it. Do you know how much these 500 years are? Okay, so this is  Don't work because they have already done so much then why do they go to do this work Why people are you no financial influence means going on this route and people are still going that way I don't understand I am surprised  If you people are surprised then tell me in the comment section. You will find webinar info groups. You can take membership of the channel. I break a lot of misconceptions and take it to practical level. I claim this is more than me. I am not telling practical things, I keep asking you people again and again on Financial Channel, put it in the comment section, I am thinking of a new stand up comedy in the new year or winter, keep comedy stereo type, will abuse and speak dirty, and that's it. If someone like me does a sit down comedy like me, it will be a comedy that will abuse badly, then you do n't know that my separate channel will not work, however, if I do it on my normal channel, then people like it.  Either tell me brother because yes if I keep telling like this then you tell me there is no need to open a new channel because when I open a new one I will not leave the finance on such big things like Seven Mistakes I Did in My 20 Five Mistakes Too  Avoid in 30 I did this, you did this Hey, who are you, the God on whom one can walk on the feet, what a great work you have done in life, no, no, I have made mistakes, so what happens people, I have done many things.  If he makes mistakes then people think that he is teaching very well, he has made mistakes and if you have reached here after making so many mistakes then you can also reach here, this is me motivating you, you cannot reach, life was very forgiving, you are doing mistake Mr. Ankur.  Warik ji, his name has to be taken because he is the champion of making these mistakes and has misled 50 lakh 60 lakh people into the misconception that he You made mistakes, don't do them. Hey, you could have saved yourself by making mistakes because life was forgiving. I am not at all saying that you are lying. It is okay, but today 's war cannot learn anything from your mistakes. Today, you do not even have the opportunity to make mistakes at that time.  There was so much opportunity to make mistakes today, chach again this thing chach society you come from how your parents are, some are not allowing you to parent today, no one will ever get that answer motivation. I am telling you this and I do not use my personal example because there is no use if you learn anything from making mistakes. If you make more mistakes in life, you will lose all.  The confidence is all nonsense. The first mistake you made is that the money is lost. The second is lost and then there is no money. The third is that your friends are telling you that if your parents and people around you are telling you that you could not do it.  Munna could not actually become Munna is a fact. It feels good to hear these stories because we will hear the story of a survivalist who did it like this but the chances are still 99 but you cannot make too many mistakes. There is not much scope in your life.  If you want to perform somewhere in life then that is that if you want to go to the international cricketer level then you will make mistakes in the first 10 matches and then you will be out. Yes Ranji you will definitely.  You will pretend that you were talented and there you will suffer for your mistakes, that's fine but you will never go to the big league because life does give opportunity it gives at various times also but it never gives endless opportunity it seems to us like this  It seems that we have that self- confidence from within and that is not lost on everyone. If I make a video, if one of my videos gets spoiled, two of them get spoiled. Let it be three, I have a good past record, mine is good, but brother, if you ask Akshay Kumar ji how many hit pictures he has, his total hit pictures have earned 5-6 thousand crores, not close to a billion dollars, now see.  What is happening to them, they are saying that I will keep trying but brother, ask that Vashu Bhagnani whose office was sold, he got shaken in Chhote Miyan Bade Miyan, so this is something like we have too.  Understand that now let us watch the video, it goes from somewhere to somewhere, if you get stuck on the line, then so much of the content is explained in one, in one it is explained that its 50 lines are the life lines of making youtube0 but that would be like Kaun Banega Crorepati. One, two, two, three, four, everyone has one, but they are limited. If you are very lucky, there will be a little more, if you are unlucky, there will be a little less, and most of the average people are sitting there, but brother, there is a limit, not limitless, so it is okay.

    "content": "Hello friends, this I will use the word nuisance and nonsense should stop. If you are with me in this and agree then write agree in the comment section, if you disagree then keep disagreeing. Recently in Noida, we have seen a lot of things happening in Noida. I don't know if there is any issue with the dogs in the societies there, what is the problem with this child, again a video has come, what a very disturbing video and it keeps coming many times like this. All the dog lovers and keep dogs, it is a request to all of them that please use the stair case. Now, if you live on 40th floor, I know the stair case.  If you can't use case then please use passenger lift or if you can't use that too then I request all of you who are my subscribers that if you see a dog  Just don't go in that lift, just go that brother, you are a bastard, you go with the dog, I will come later because how will an animal behave in close spaces, that animal is an animal, very much human behavior, we cannot predict half the times.  These are such times, we don't know what is happening with the animal, what is going on in its mind, what is happening with you, many people think of you as a son or daughter, right, those who are dog lovers, I am in this.  I had made a video earlier also on the psychology of a dog lover. If you people want it again, I will tell you about that emptiness and what mental and those issues remain, they will be separated, Ketu and all is fine but here I am trying to be.  Like scientific, if it is okay, then please, this dog owner gets your dog slaughtered. How many injections does a child get? Nowadays, maybe it has reduced but it is a matter of so much pain, why do you do it, then what are those people?  They will say that the dog was registered, but today I don't understand that if any incident happens in India, then we will find out whether it was registered or not, as if registered people can be strictly controlled, that is, on everything.  This will happen: CCTV camera was installed, it will be visible through CCTV camera and you will sensitize it on news channel but say CCTV camera stop a dog from bytefence call out, RWS need of societies. To you know, do something about it, reduce it a little, friend, they do it in other countries also, oh brother, I have already told you this in those videos also, here the middle class is fond of dog rice, they are raising dogs and keeping dogs.  Not meant to be in confined spaces, buy a farm house, buy a big house, keep 50 dogs as you wish, you will live inside the flats and all your hobbies, the Nawab's pals are mine. I am a little emotionally hurt, that's why I have to use some strong words and some dog lovers may feel hurt, but more than their hurt, I am worried about that child's hurt and not about any other child or elderly person or  If anyone has any such reason for biting a young person, then there is less issue because anyone can panic, it is a child, a child can panic, sometimes what happens is the dog is coming to you normally.  He will not bite but if the child panics, he shouts something and does something so that the dog panics and he does something like this because like there are so many people who are dog lovers there are people who are dog haters also and they also  Aegist and they may not like it is like veg and nonveg thing happens na bhi late aar to bhaiya de every buddy aegist nobody can say or not this is the butt of food  Nobody wants to be in your face, it does not mean that even if you eat non-veg, nobody wants that, you open a butcher shop in front of your house, do you agree with what I am saying, those who also eat non-veg, brother, you don't.  Want means if you do it then that is the same thing brother I suppose if some buddy is not a dog lover now he has to live in this world he can't just say that brother  You can do everything to someone whose dogs mean that brother, he will not listen to his words, but he should also have some rights, not everyone will have some rights, just like a vegetarian will have rights, right, you went to a table like this one recently.  One came and this could be cultural issues, two were meeting, there was a merger going on, there was something on the table, one made non-veg, the other came, he was hurt that why didn't you ask, no, we do n't deal with you, so he was a different person.  It becomes a topic of discussion but what I am trying to say is that we have to respect everything in today's world if we have to coexist because these things will happen further, I believe again and again that man, I am saying that tomorrow I  So I will get the elephant, the baby elephant, now you will stop me at some stage or I will say no, I run horses, horses are not allowed in the society, I cannot keep horses, now Dwarka Express, a society is coming.  There will be horses also, I am telling you that it will be a horse farm and all this will be acreage, the society is very expensive, there are flats worth Rs. 10 crores, okay, where does it stop, can we keep lions, otherwise, dogs are the law.  What are you saying How long can you keep it Something needs to come I personally feel there should be a law What is wrong Where it is told that dogs cannot be kept by  So and so se less wala s in this less space means you can keep a dog in a one room house, 12 people and one dog also means think practically, some rule should come out, no dog if dog it is something like that if  If you don't have space to keep a car, then you will buy a car and keep it. Yes, then delay must be the law. Do you know how fights happen in Delhi? Do dogs also have rights outside the parking lot?  If there were human rights, there are also dog rights, so the dog rights people cannot say that if you keep it, then you are eating it. How much is this animal able to roam? Dog has been the great friend of human beings over a period of time.  This was denied, he used to go for hunting, it was for guarding, the cattle that you had and when those wild animals would come, then those dogs would wake up with their barks and then those men would get up and  It is historic, it is all that, no one can deny it but see the content and the spaces in which the dogs were bred and nowadays many exotic species are being created, many laws have come in foreign countries that you cannot do this, no.  Can you do that? Which is that dog which can't breathe? What is the breed? I do n't know the name, but it is found in Gurgaon and Delhi and here you ca n't breathe like that.  If you have kept it, then beyond that you are committing another sin, but no one will discuss this. Even dog lovers have some meaning, brother, you should also be towards the society, na der aar sam peop hu aar pag pag pag hota hota, perhaps se koi is right.  His name is there, there are some people and cigarette lovers, he is a cigarette lover, he smokes 10 drinks a day, he smokes only when he loves, otherwise why would he do such a thing with his lungs, then it became his law that brother, you should not smoke in public spaces.  It has become a law to smoke wherever you want. Okay, so can we do something here or not? There is no limit, anyone can keep any number of dogs, they can keep them anywhere, they can keep them anywhere. Can take them anywhere, can make them do anything, their meaning is that they keep spreading filth, keep picking them up in the lifts, keep picking them here, keep picking them there, don't care about anyone, they come out silently in the dark nights, they do n't even open their own eyes and they keep making them do it. And then silently they go away like a wet cat inside the entire society. You are giving them 12 12 Haj maintenance expenses. I mean brother, why late, there should be some checks and balances, I don't mean dogs and they come to fight like this.  I am saying that if you comment too much on someone's child, he will not fight but this dog lover has so much love for them, they do not love their children, you can say something to their children but you cannot say anything to the dog.  The dog which can bite you, which makes you feel tons and what is their worst thing, will say nothing, will say nothing, I have seen such women, now no one is gender shaming women, even children have seen some who themselves  He has no weight and no strength and his leash is held loosely and as soon as the dog does something, I can tell just by looking at it that it cannot be stopped, it cannot be stopped because he is a strong man and if he holds it then you  r like that  Well, just like they don't go to the police or those people who check, so you are like that man, that guy is also strong and in that way, he is holding her in such a lewd manner that she doesn't even come out of here with his leash like this.  She is held here, she is stuck like this and is held by the hand, then you still think that man, there is some check balance, they also know that these are dangerous ones, so they have got that here, there is nothing here, they are rotating like this.  And you will say sorry, your dog has bitten you in a minute, you will say sorry, this means in India the car will be reversed, you will touch it, then you will say sorry, after that you will say sorry, then he will shout and then he will say, why should I give up my life, will I be touched, sorry or take it.  00 Now take the same thing, what will you do with the dog's bat? Tell me, if your dog bites someone because of your negligence, because ultimately a dog is a dog, brother, that means that, that, call him Tommy.  Call it a dog, give it any good sexy name, it is a dog, I had to make such a big video because brother, it is not being discussed, it just comes in the newspaper, it is done like this, someone has done it, isn't it just an issue or a religious threat?  This one is in danger, that one is in danger, will the issue remain the same or can there be some other better issue that brother, humans are in danger, those dogs are the dogs, who manages them, so I am not talking about what the government does, who will go and tell the government? These are street dogs  They are stray dogs, their management is increasing, all this is your corporation and whoever is in charge, they are failing like anything but many times a man thinks that come on, the street dock is in the street, I am living in a condominium, I am living in a society.  I am living in a flat worth 5,10,20 crores. Am I not safe there too? I have accepted it outside, I do n't know what the government will do, but I am taking my co-lifter in one of my OCs.  Friend, the dogs are running away now, where should they run away, tell me, at least brother, this dog lover is not going to follow the rules because I am not telling you, there are some issues with dog lovers, if I say this much now, then I know that I will never teach you.  In the webinar I will give you what issues and what emotional issues are there and do you need someone to lick. Do you have any issues around your wife or children whose health is good? Today I will tell you openly, leave it and what will happen next.  By making commentary, remove the emotional issues. Children are not having it, they don't want to do it, children don't listen, it's loneliness, it's okay, you've accepted it, it's okay, it's not the responsibility of others to agree, is n't it a disease of the rest of the society? If you have so many issues, isn't it?  Live somewhere, there should be a society where it should be written that dogs are allowed or dogs are not allowed so that people can be clear before buying a house whether it will hit us here or not.  Don't buy a flat, there is a lot of choice of flats, you yourself, I am telling you this, when they go on leave, I am telling you one more thing, what torture happens to the dogs also, they leave them and go away, you tell this, a dog.  I have kept him in the flat, he has gone away for a day or two, he is barking and will also become ferocious, he has not gone out to urinate, has not gone out or is doing there or has not got food, has not got water now.  you gave him your  Kept in the premises, now he has so much brain that he has to bite his boss or bite the neighbor. They are also kept from behind and are in the same condition. Are they taken care of? Those who leave the children of human beings.  I do n't know what the condition is there, CCTV cameras are installed there or I don't know what oaths and promises have to be given and I don't know whether a man's heart beats there too or not. You can imagine what will happen with the dog, now you understand what I am saying, you have to go for 28 days, this is a menace to you, you have to discuss it in the society, you have to say, brother, what right do you have to keep a dog?  There should be something, if you have a draw license then you should know how to drive a car, there is a test if you cannot see with your eyes and if they give you a license, then before keeping the dog, someone will ask, where are you keeping it, someone is keeping four, someone is keeping two.  someone is keeping one  There should be a limit, there should be square footage, there should be premises and there should be some consent of other people because you will keep the dog, I will keep the lion cub, you tell me no, if you don't want to keep this lion, it will be too much, why who am I deciding which act is being imposed?  You can keep a horse, you can keep a donkey, you can also keep a small cute donkey, it means what is it and what I am saying, keep cats, keep parrots, these are all hobbies.  I am not refusing people, I have respect for them, but I am saying that you, this affordable housing has been built, it has a density of 150, the rest of the density is also increasing, if you keep this and that in it, there is no place for humans.  Because these people do not calculate, now I will become a state person, but still I tell you, the maids have also come, the hawkers have also come, the drivers have also come, there are many people, the crowd is very large, the lift went on like this.  The lift is going and is not available and then you put a dog in it. Now if I ever see a dog in the lift, I don't enter it. I am telling mine and I will also tell you that if you see a dog in the lift then you should get out.  And if someone is bringing it then tell him no no no again and again I am going out, I am not telling you that you don't mind, you are a dog lover, your time also has a lot of value, the truth came after adopting a dog, now you should know.  I'll do mine later  I will take it, you do it like this, you go first, I will take the next lift, I will go from the CDI, I am a better option because any dog ​​owner is on the key floor, I know that he cannot go from the CDI, but these people on the third floor are also not on the second floor.  Those people also go by lift, this one also has to take the lift only and this other one will not even go on the lift, because if you want to know the dogs, then what normal brother you have talked about and these classes, you have made meds.  For what ever reasons, I don't enter into it. I am not a classist, I am a practical man. For what ever security reasons, I have done the coming and going or what ever reasons, but the dog will come with the sir. Why is the dog no less than the sir? Tell me, raise the issue It's an issue and it needs to be resolved Every buddy has a right Like dog love has their right  But there is a limit to that right, it is not a free country but this free country is for everyone, it is not for you alone, it is for us too, it is for others also, so that is the responsibility, rules and regulations should be written for all the dogs which have to be checked. Whatever their system may be since I'm not too much into veterinary science I really don't know but whatever their system may be it should be this thing to complain about  Late friend, you tell me if someone hurts your child and goes away, Tom Deacon Harry, by mistake or knowing how big a person becomes, he will not come into the society, it will not happen like this, it will not happen and it should happen, I am saying it should happen too.  There is no big thing above the safety of the child, it is fine in life, but if the dog does something, then why nothing, brother, who will answer, what will be the loss, what will be the compensation, brother, tell me, the cost of car parking is Rs. 100 rupees in the mall.  go somewhere  So many times people hesitate, take money from them to keep the dog, you will give this much money if you keep the dog because your dirt will be more, you will pay more for maintenance, if I don't have a dog, you have a dog, I will accept the maintenance.  If I am giving you then you will give 110. Let's start with this. It is very practical advice. Make the degree of difficulty. Otherwise, the country is free. You can go anywhere you want, in Gurgaon and Noida.  Why do you have to live in flats and keep dogs? You are a dog lover, you go friend, the whole of Rajasthan is empty, the whole of Gujarat is empty, India feels so dense, population, population, you get everything in India, enjoy everything, there is some pain, that is why I have made this and Those who are resonating with this, I am saying sense, execution can be decided without being confused, run away, no no, discuss, discuss, discuss, discuss the breeds also, this  The dog is like this, it is like this, it is like this, because even the cute dogs come in different shapes, which one is okay, which one is not okay, let the discussion be late, it happens in civilized society, it happens in western countries, it happens in outside countries, rules are passed. What has been done in them, you write what is there in your knowledge because brother, that society is very much like that because there it is not only a human being but even a dog's full rights are protected there too, those who follow them only.  The countries in the countries, which we call like this, will be there, there is no need to be more people than the people, we just copy the rights of the people, that brother, this has been defined, there is only so much, there is more than this.  No, here we have to fight everyday, so please share the video, subscribe the channel, like it, thank you very much."

    "title": "Top Most Reason For Unhappiness In Youth ｜ A Big Secret Revealed [-W_DEjq4K6M].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, this is a very important and serious topic and it will liberate the youth, it will benefit you and youth can be people in their youth, even till 35-40, this is a very important topic for all of you, please watch and listen carefully. A biggest reason for unhappiness.  I am going to discuss the biggest cause of sadness in the life of youth and why I had to make this video because it is triggered by Diwali. It was Diwali.  It was Diwali on 31st, I was extremely busy, I was flooded with a lot of consultations and this and I was very busy doing that and now I felt that it is very important to tell this through a video and those patterns were seen earlier also, I tried to address.  I tried but did not say so openly, I did not say so openly that brother, this is the region, many people think that there is no population issue in India.  If people have become other wise, I don't know whether India would have become a happy country or the reason for our unhappiness is population or brother, it is pollution, now you have heard the video, I will tell you after a minute, just guess, it is pollution, it is corruption.  Because these are the irritants or traffic jams, okay unhappiness is happening boss job no no nono brother sir very amazing video is going to happen, I will do a little role for a couple of minutes  I will take it. If it is a thriller movie, I do n't tell you in the first scene that go to watch that secret movie. Someone like me, some friend of ours says Kajol is the killer, meaning the same finished movie is fine, it was a secret movie in 1998, watch Kajol is the killer. Go picture Bobby, don't give Kajal, now you guess who all are, what are the reasons for unhappiness, I have also told you four or five things, conflict over job, value of money.  No, understand, and I have become a hit on Diwali, and I will liberate you, and I will tell this, and the society has to tell this, and this has to be explained, and everyone has to share, do you agree with this, then that also has to be written in the comment section. Participate The biggest reason for unhappiness of youngsters and youth of India is their own parents Parents Indian parents of 1950's 1960's They are born unable to be happy, they are not happy with their life and they put everything on their children. The child took a plane from Bangalore and reached Delhi after pushing his way to Haldwani. And the parents were still not happy. Many fought. In the midst of a fight, I am one, now this is not an imaginary thing, I have done many things to many, I have done many things, but I could not do it because there is a limit of time, but the common pattern is that after Diwali, many of these losses have happened. Not happy with the son-in-law, not happy with the daughter, the daughter is angry, the gift is not right, people have accepted this much because I am an astrologer, also it is okay, many people are connected with me, good Guruji, I gave Lakshmi ji by doing this to Lakshmi ji.  He said, now omens should not be given like this, gifts should not be given. Those little Indians who are mothers have no knowledge of religion, neither of astrology nor of knowledge. They should ask everything about their next generation.  We have to love in life, whether it is son, daughter-in-law, son-in-law, and we will give them the will to come across, he is the champion, I am like that, we are professionals, we can call the bluff of any mother, sister, etc. in two minutes. Ok Bhai Saheb, you are the one with little knowledge. Madam, you have spread the raita. I am addressing all the mothers and mothers in loss. You have no knowledge in your family. I will test you. What should one do if one does not get 15 marks out of 100 in that test? It is a bad omen as soon as you say one, that is why these people have ruined this religion, these rituals and these things so much that the next generation will  Because of them, religion is in danger, what they say in politics, it is other people's religion in danger, it is because of them, religion is in danger, today I am making a video very openly, my feelings are coming out from within for the society.  I have affection from within, my business is going well, if the sorrows spread in the world, they will come to us only. What does it matter to the doctor that everyone has an upset stomach? He will prescribe medicine to everyone and take out a prescription. Eat bad food every day, have an upset stomach every day. Come.  And take it, stick it, stick it, we are consultants, what do we have but still we are also towards the society, I consider my self as a social, not only a social observer but a social.  The reformer was also Vidyasagar ji, Sir Ram Mohan Roy, everyone was whipped at that time and at that time, still I would say that it was easy for him because he was educated, people in the society were educated, those who I am saying today were even more educated than me.  There are people, you may not be knowledgeable but you are definitely educated and will say who are you, it is not easy because if you are roaming around a lot, then parents are causing you.  Unhappiness And I 'll Prove It To You And I'll Tell You What's Happening C Parents Are Supposed To Be Like Chargers Mobile Chargers The Battery Got Down You Took Charge From Them Who's The One Who Downs The Battery Your Boss Job Traffic Pollution Money Relationships Targets Goals That  So they are sucking, they are hitting, but you come and give accommodation to your parents somewhere like this in mother's pallu, father's in it like this.  Someone should sit after doing this, someone should give coolness to the country. Just imagine, friend, we have made Diwali so big that we should celebrate that festival together. And what are you going to memory lake? Do you know the ticket rates spent on an across the country flight? What would have happened to you?  How do people go in the train on Diwali The very fact Some buddy came to you from the other part of the country to meet you And Itna Itna Madam Itna Sir Ji Jo Baithe Hain Parents This is  How you failed, all such people do not happen like this, I am at 95, I am also telling you such numbers, if it is among your five, then brother, you are that other wise. The domestic conditions at that time were probably such that they had to become like this, the region too.  I am telling you, understand carefully, even if it is a little long video, it will liberate you. The generation born after 1947, their parents were slaves because of the country, if you are someone born in 48 or 52. Even at the age of 55, 60, 65, his father was born before, so perhaps there would not have been any father in the age of 47 to 18. Well, most like, those people were poor because the country itself was poor and they were not even educated, so this generation.  She might have been educated and had done relatively well by working hard but she did a lot of bossy on her parents and her parents tolerated it with a smile because by default setting she was more educated than them.  They were earning more money than them because the country was progressing because they were born in 1950 1960 they were working in 1980 90 when they started working and earning money they were better off then we all know this is how India progressed before liberalization 991  Before that the entire country was poor but now the children who were born later are not very poor.  Financially well off then their parents may be more educated, maybe even earn two rupees more but their parents do n't get impressed like this, don't teach us so soon, we have attitude in our attitude, this is Amitabh Bachchan of all the love.  They are there and they are acting like Amitabh Bachchan of Bagwaan that great injustice is being done to us, we have been exploited, we have been looted, we have done so much to our parents, oh so much to our parents.  Did it because you had the ability to do it and the country was poor, you had four paisa, so you did it, now what should your children do, you have money, you show us the opinion of money, we don't want money, then what do we want, we just want some respect and  I need just a little time, so you came to give me some time, poor Halwani, what happened next, madam, they are listening, so you came, you were a boy, you came to give time, you also brought a gift along with you, why did you bother, why are you angry about all these things?  Married life is full of toxins  Who are pouring it on the next generation And now they are united They were not united in their whole life They were struggling this generation to give due to them I don't paint anybody black And something they went through their struggles Like every generation before them has guns and  After They Have Guns And Even After Those Who Are Not Yet Born Will Also Go There is no one in the human race who has not struggled Those who were born at the time of World War, those who saw World War One, World War Two and all, what should they say? Poor, those who saw Faiman and saw everything, they will say that we have come in very dirty times, gray depression is happening in America.  Yes, there again, we saw World War One, we also saw two, we died, we grew old, we too lived, it's not such a great shakes, but it's okay, but the fact is that there is a lot of toxins in the relationships.  What needs to be addressed and called out am I right do you agree with me this is happening and we have to resolve because Indian parents especially middle class parents are causing so much of damage mental damage because what was there in their life good food fed mental  They did n't have any food in India, so feed them good food, brother, eat desi ghee, brother, eat churma, brother, eat dough.  I am talking about Haryana, eat fruits, someone in South India would say eat idli, eat anything, whatever healthy thing is spoken, nobody talks about mental food, mental health, that is being talked about now because we have crossed that roti. Kapda Makaanwala State as Status as a Country and We Need to Discuss True Things and These Things See Aapko Bahar Vaale To Chus Hi Lenge Can You Change the Traffic Can You Change the  Infrastructure Overnight Can You Change How Your Boss Is Going To Treat The only thing a person can wish for is their own parents who have created that brother, you listen to us, give us pause, give us coolness, you recharge the batteries so that the world can rob us.  The world is being looted outside, the parents are being looted, that is why the condition of the children is very bad, to the extent that we even hear these things, you know these things, I am tearing them apart in threads.  I will explain in my relationship course which will be my iconic starting on Saturday 7 PM 9 PM I want most of you who are dealing with true things and issues to join that course because I don't want because my consultation fee is more than the course  Fees and the course will be for 14 15 hours duration over Saturdays from Saturdays end  Recordings Will Also Be Given So That You Can You Know Your Life You Will Understand My Life What Happened Why Happened Because Lot Of People Have Not Sorted Out Their Trauma Did Trauma Only And They Do n't Even Know That It Is A Trauma Do All These Things With today's parents, tell today's parents, by doing something like this, today's parents, that is, the youngsters, should talk to these parents.  What is trauma? Trauma narcissism. What is narcissism? What is Pacific Race? What is that? Do you keep saying good, eat good, drink good, sleep. Oh brother, you have lived such a life, ate good, drank good, had good sex, now nothing is happening to anyone.  Neither getting married, nor having sex, nor having children, nothing is happening and you are responsible because then don't start the whole course on me here but I hope you.  Understand, there was a lot of emotion in me because I had a lot of experiences. After Diwali, many people came here, now you will see weddings, the wedding season will start now in India, you will not see it, even in weddings, people got angry, this does not end in any celebration in Indian settings.  This is the reason for misery and we are one of the unhappiest country in this world because if you see this on the Unhappy Indian Index, the number comes down, very angry.  It climbs, you tell me, a country like Norway, Denmark, there the sun comes out half the time, there is so much cold, I don't know anything there, I don't know that they are the happiest and we are here because we are in trouble, Pakistan is also above us, we should be ashamed of this and this is what I believe in.  This is that our number on the index has actually just been raised a little by someone and ours should go down a little further because what is actually sad and should not happen is that here all the four seasons are ultimate, there is not much here.  Whether it is winter or summer or rain, all the seasons are mountains, forests and waterfalls, we are a blessed country as far as geography and everything is concerned, God has been very kind on us, we have spread this within ourselves, nothing can be enjoyed from us like a function like a wedding. I want to ask today, before I stop this video, there will be weddings, have you also attended the wedding, who enjoys the wedding, the girl 's boy's song, his two friends, who are all, more than half of them?  Relatives are close, they are walking on egg shells, lest someone gets angry, someone might get into trouble, someone might become an issue, the sensitivity is such that one doesn't know what it might be, if it is a distant relative, they do n't come right these days.  Weddings are coming now Wedding season is coming It's better that you learn these things The disease has spread at the Padme level We require lots of people too  Help People Sort This Out This thing coming out of my tongue feels bitter, bitter gourd juice comes out, it's okay that you have put neem laddus in your mouth, but brother, this will clean the blood, do you sing agree with me  I am the first of all and it does not seem that I am insulting many people and many become personal that you are your parents, I am a Guruji as a person and I am a Guruji at home also. I am fine but I want to tell the rest of the society that this is a big problem because you people have not figured out what the actual issues are. People are extremely selfish these days especially the elders. The biggest people I see are Today 60 65 70 equally selfish 75 year old more selfish than 70 year old 80 year old more selfish like this  It seems that friend, how will you get salvation here, your behavior is your end, no one can call out, why can't I call out, some buddy has to come from a domain like me, some buddy says that I am Guruji ji, I am  So I would say, brother, but a child cannot speak, yes, how did you say that, you have bad values, how can you speak like this, this is this bluff, you will be called out, okay, just getting old does not make one wise, one does not become wise just because one's hair turns grey.  One does not become knowledgeable, one should be seen in the words, one should be seen in the impact, okay, if the impact is not good, then the intention has also gone, okay, many people run away from this, my intention is not right, I don't know what is your impact, and  Impact is what I felt if it is not ok you stop doing this erotic what ever you are doing your intention went to the stove but  Who will teach the people how to spend, water, come and learn for free, that comes from the newspaper for free, that also goes in the dustbin, understand one on one question recording in a structured way, wo n't there be any change in what is outside here and what is inside these two ears?  There is a war going on in between, only that has to be calmed, if it is calm then life is very good, you just have to go to understand it, then you people are in pain, then come and learn these things because I am tired of consultation.  Consultation fee is much more than course fee. I do consultation only for 40-45 minutes. So brother, better enjoy 15 hours and learn everything and then help people further. This is my message if you are interested in RC Relationship Course to the  Number given and register for that and thank you very much"

    "content": "Hello friends, a new excellent topic, Tu Badal To Nahi Jaega, there is going to be a lot of love topic, there is so much original content, there is no story on YouTube, today's era of cut copy paste, the ship of mutual fund has reached the youth, mutual fund is right now, Tendulkar and Dhoni ji too.  If you are coming and telling me, brother, it is absolutely fine, new content which will actually impact your life, please share, like and subscribe if you have not done so yet. Boys only on Applicable Same note Girls I bill tell you This video on Applicable for voice Girls also have to watch To awaken their awareness, Aware is not applicable for girls because girls are never told the dialogue 'Tu badal to nahi jaaye'  It is not said because it is non-fat, if the girl does not change then the creation itself will not work, the girl has to become a woman, she has to become a wife, she has to become a mother and the program goes ahead.  It will work but the boys are definitely told, who has to speak, why do you have to speak, what answer do you have to give, you do not have to change, because not changing is celebrated a lot, then you will get full clarity on how you are a channel for war. 18 19  If you are a 20 22 23 25 30 35 40 year old boy then please listen and forward the video to your parents and also to your friends because when the society says in totality  Only when someone learns and understands, he will move ahead and in the comment area below, you have to write only one thing in this video, nothing much, agree with your thesis or agree or this agree. If you can tell the reason for disagreement, then it is okay to write advice.  So that I can get votes, please find it in the comment area that it is not like I would have brought such a topic of my own, then let us start, who will be first, this will be your mother, never father.  You will say mummy will remain or some female relative will say baa uncle mummy or mummy and this will be an auction, there will be an engagement around your marriage and you will not go to Badal, this is a simple innocent statement, it causes huge problems in marriage, this much experience Marital Corner is telling if  Those mothers who are listening to you, please listen, I am also sir, you may not want this, but where is this psychology coming from, the loss of control, mother, you are here.  If he does n't change, he will remain juvenile, then how can he take responsibility in the future, he is getting married, it's n, it's n, Jai, it's n, celebration is on, Jai, that little baby of yours is now going to get married, he will become a father tomorrow, this is what you want.  Chuku baby is not for me, it is private for me, let her change, let her change, give her a dog even on Chhotu, the girl who has come, the girl who has become a woman and further she has become a wife and  In the future, when she becomes a mother, she is completely mature, which means that in the next party, she gives you completely mature material and you keep your raw raw. She also has to learn this language and also has to understand. To understand people, you have to change because she is very  Boys feel guilty that if she is my wife, then I will give her time, go out with her, then I have come back from honeymoon, now I am going to the mall again, then I want to see the movie, her mother and mother.  look at  If a boy is getting married then the boy is getting married at the age of 25, 26, 27, 28, 29. 17 to 25 or 28 years, until he got married, that 10 year period was giving him a lot of time.  If you were not doing anything to ensure that he gets a job, gets promoted and becomes responsible, then it is very wrong to say this at the time of marriage. Boys should not take any blame for this. You will have to change because there is a lot of difference. Those who are in the Juvenile State of Mind of the Mother, want to keep him in this state because only then he can be controlled and manipulated, Chotu can also be manipulated whose mind is like him, the man who is on your mind, you cannot manipulate him. Can do is a very big factor, now what is there in this, many of my videos become like this because speaking against many things in India is a big taboo, mother is smart respected because still the population there is less and Indians All the content here is ours, these are the creators of our content, Chuda 's knowledge remains in the middle, brother, we will have to give the original, who has to speak in English, who has to speak in English, some mother of English, Sunny, have you thought that if you just visualize, you will not go to Badal?  From the age of 17-16, the clouds go without asking and they give notes, this thing is our emotional baggage and emotional drama, this is the war, we are getting clarity in Ramayana.  Many people are liking, very good comments, there is a little request, subscribe a few people in your friend circle, big two, I will get fat in this video, after this video, my request is that every person will cross, I will tell only because he will like the dub. If caste is not a thing, then tell me who else would say such a thing to you, then it would not be bad, it would be some friend or relative who will have another auction that you have lost a big job or your story has been set or your story is of some romance.  Money has been withdrawn, such a scene has happened because they want to think, because they don't know that their relevance is going to reduce in your life, thoughts are the same, you don't have to stick with, I will tell you one thing and after seeing three points. First of all, I want to tell you that in our country, not changing is celebrated, this is the biggest mistake, changing has to be celebrated, it is a dynamic world, everyone is exactly me.  I am also going to give three tips as to how you should work on your mind, how successful you are, you have bill, you leave people home, you initially started, if you do not give, you bill not rice, if we have told it in movies or in normal, then it is selfish. It will happen, note it, it will grow, if he is your love so much and you are his love, then collect it, if someone is your friend, your relative or someone who wastes a lot of time, toxic negative cry.  Dhumal is a human being, so just because you used to waste time with him on a stage and after the stage, when success comes in your life, a purpose has come, you have to fulfill it and more relationships come in your life, then you will not give him any love.  If it remains then he will say like this, you have become a cloud, but is this a change, but is it a color or does it have to change, is it a right, he has to spend time with him, he does not know the story in life, he has nothing to do or maybe he is earning money from his story.  the rent is  There is rent for shops, there is something else of yours, there is nothing of yours, then it is said that change this n bed think, we have to remove youth from our mind, change it, good think, what you are three is back if you are exactly D  In whatever aspects you are not rich, where there is no growth happening, it does not make any sense that whatever you value for yourself, your value for humanity is fine. Those who are good, this is your door. Walls also go you in debt good position No one is saying to leave them No one is saying that you have to do complete 180° overall but certain things will change and they have you change if it is change it will give rise to stagnation Nothing ever gives me happiness and this is the problem that like when you retire, many people because they are youth on clarity but you also check their clarity. 5560 U Hit Doze Age and New Note Changing clouds are no more, similarly foolish people are doing less, mother, or your desire is not being satisfied and job is gone, money is gone, relevance is not there, that too is a problem, you will have to see or you will have to leave.  And now if Dhoni is such a great cricketer, now it is IPL, then his name is like everyone's favorite, if he was playing Ranji or before that in his locality, then that cricketer's name is  Being together can do that for you. You can have a progressive life ahead. You are going on a trip, you are going everywhere, you will talk sometime, you will talk nicely, you will not talk like this, you will also have food and drinks, love will also remain, memories will also remain.  But still you cannot be like him in his life anymore, this is the thing that many people who are not achievers are achievers inside and in the society there are more achievers inside because achievers are very less, not one person out of 100.  If you are doing it then the belief system of the remaining 99 remains the same and we do not have to change it because at least three people have come into your life and they have reached a big position in the story and from there you can fit their jugaad.  So you will go, neither should he change in this sense, nor should he change for you, but you have no control over what he is doing, he should not change for you, meaning brother, you used to reduce us like that, if you had given free time, then you too.  give this date note  Possible You Have You Released From You Wickham A Famous Doctor Name China Consultant Name China Lawyer Name Symbol Chart Account Brother Bill Lot of Your Circle Must Have Been in Your Circle Long Time Lot of Friends Relatives Everybody Bill Be Brother Rule Se Ki Yaar Yeh Mera Free Me Ko Ko  Give consultation, ok, he is my friend, give it to him friend, this is a very poor man, give it to him, if you have 50 people, everyone knows everything, then 50 of 50 become 50.  Everything in your life has happened, what achievements have happened in your life, then they will read those patterns of leaving you, just because you will be a successful story, then you cannot give a break to anyone, you will not give the same amount to everyone in life.  The messages could not have been relevant but you have relations with your boyfriend, your wife, your children, your parents and his siblings, you will still have to make an effort to find time for them but understand them too.  Brother, that issue does not remain and who has the most right in it? There will be a video made on that later. Ok brother, who has more right, who has the most right when a man goes to whom, in that, parents, wife, children. Brother-  Sister lives on Railways, there is also a merit list of them, if you want video, then someday you will become cloudy in future, you will have to change and there is no harm in changing, if you are not cloudy, then you keep on standing, it is not a great thing, every person has to come in shapes and sizes.  I also have to change the bill late.  D video with you three small examples only you doctor say this people take lot of pride in I am fit I am that young write it sounds good but if you are married and you are not attracted to women of opposite sex then You definitely don't need much to look so sexy, because you work hard, you look like a very young doctor and you are 40 years old, every patient who comes, I have been such a good person, I am openly telling you that I have been there before as well.  I have already given it in the hits but I am telling you that it is very beneficial. Okay, people consider you more than your age, but to attract the opposite sex, if you are going in a plane, there comes a pilot who is very thin and young, 25 26.  Of the year and the other one too, if it feels the same, then neither does it happen, nor does the second one happen, a little bit of the penis is sticking out, some hair is white, some hair is flying and a little bit of that experience is there on the face, it is also a little bit like a fat ball, but that.  You  That's it brother, in 150000 hours, it seems that he is behind me only this much and if two raw people go there by mistake, a pilot or the one who is fit goes to the gym, then the man feels that it is practical, you need a doctor, you need a lawyer.  You do not want any professional, nor do you need a little china on his face, now you have not changed for him, he looks the same as he did at 26, he looks the same at 40, so he is in his immediate friends circle.  So he will keep him bigger than Chaddha but professionally he will lose out. Practically he will lose out, a little bit will have to be changed, okay now he is strange, now Shahrukh Khan looks like the same as 25 years ago, 30 years ago, although all these actors are very maintained.  But still, on your even change and date change, it is very important to change or not to change, if you have a choice, then don't hesitate in changing or do basic things.  The belief systems that are of humanity are the good values ​​that a human being has, they are not fit for change, so there is no need to argue about it, but anything in everything else, because it is such a dynamic world, it is changing so quickly, the secret here has become artificial. Intelligence A Gaya Tag Technology What was there 15 years ago What was there 20 years ago There was no internet 20 years ago What to do now If you are not changing then you will have to change When the world is changing  Everything is changing, so why won't you change? If you ask this question next time, it will not change, if the clouds will not go, then please forward this video, it means change will have to be done and those are emotional issues, these are the ones with daughters-in-law. Coming here, I have to tell you clearly that the relationship does not break because of one coming and the other coming, but brother, time is 24 hours, so there is no big deal in it, everything has its time, the woman also has to see that when her husband also comes.  it was  His mother had also said the same. Yes, his mother had also said this and he used to do this half the time from here on out and with me, I am also like this. Look, women will have to have a big heart. If your husband is told, what will he do to his mother? You will not go to the clouds and spread the same relief in your life. If you want to spread the same relief in the life of your child, then it is your choice. You should tell your son, Son, now you go to the clouds, now the one who will lift your raw vest will not come like this, take responsibility.  Take it as yours, keep it, take it cleanly  Otherwise, the next one came and said that your mother taught Lakhan to Lakhan, Sudha, mother of the son, should be at the list when he is getting married, do some course on the dam, brother of one or two months, cooked a little food and drink.  Do n't have the trouble of being late, do it, keep your society, now honorable son, everything is done, as much as I had to serve slowly, it is done, now you will have to change, if she tells him on time, he will not change.

I am here to give clarity to the youth because no one gives it, not even political correctness, but someone has to give it here.

In the big part of leadership, leadership in the corporate world is only about coercing, motivating, fooling, giving you carrots, giving you less money and making you do more less.  You can go inside anything and then when you misuse and abuse it, when you don't keep the song like the song, you suck, such songs suck and someone said it's okay, normally people don't do it, but the people of Haryana will know what North India vs. song say, kiss the song.  Or what is this D advantage? Okay, they throw the song away like this. Okay, they throw it away like this, so many people don't want to make a song. Leadership will come, something or the other.  You will hear that it will be dynamic and full of energy, but that sir will benefit the institution and it will be beneficial for the shareholder if the company is listed. Who are you doing so hard? There are many such good banks which have given 15 to 18% interest rate for the last 18-17 years for 20 years.  If returns are given then they are darling of the share holders, it is okay but they mean keep life tight. Tell me which of the employees of private banks are in the government ones.  I have also kept a lot of my own, okay, all this is fine these days, the bank employees are so sad, I will make a separate video sometime, if you are listening then tell me, especially what is the meaning of the government bank, we, the public, feel that hey.  He is not doing anything, it is lunch break, so he doesn't do anything, his condition is very bad, I will make him in very bad condition and if you are doing something for the government bank then please do an award if it is okay.  come home from family to the big city and  If you have rich parents then it is okay to leave these jobs and now many times people say to me that my audience is different, I tell them again and again but now they come from a different level of people.  When he says, he treats us like this, he ca n't say that friend, you are very poor, you are my audience, he makes the latest sound, he does it to me himself, although I am not there, but I can't even make a video from anybody, you are the other big one.  There is also advice, those who are intelligent, those who have content, that is my tax audience, my audience is Datsun, I am the thumbnail, I am English, my audience is English speaking, English understanding audio, although I come inside and talk in Hindi, but I want the audience which is small, it is like that, but we  How much should I tell you, let's move ahead. Okay, in leadership, stories will be heard, you will be given motivation, but you should not follow any track, whenever you see someone's feeling for you.  If you are being reduced then see that you are being exploited. This feeling was a feeling. This reduction of country's wish is patriotism and one half is the department because they have stolen the saree from the military. In the military, all these things are just a necessity. Adverise, there is no necessity.  Because there is a match there, can you give some money to me one day, what is the value of human life, how much is it worth for the country, so all these things are needed there, Goodlas, do you come or come on you?  TURN AT YOU THE BEST EMPLOYEE YOU If your name is on the board of the best employee, then something like this is going to happen in your life, remember this thing, the next time whenever you are given leadership capsules or  If we are to be called a good leader, then that good leader is the one who can fool as many people as possible without releasing them. If they rely on you, then give them a note. You are a good leader. Now I know this, elder.  Because I also used to do all the corporate work, which I left because now I am batting like Musaddilal. Well, they are the big ones, because from their side, there are these stories too, watch the game, story is life story, listen to it.  A little bit, a little bit, I understood a little bit, I didn't understand it, some people liked it, some people liked it, life is a story, you are also a story, we are very fond of science students, all that scientific stuff is just a story, we don't know what is true.  what a lie  What are all the stories, some are going on with the mother, some are going on with the mother and there are many who listen to the stories, I too am going to listen to the stories, okay and the whole world is going to listen to the stories, you too are going to listen to the stories, Banna, more stories  I have to enjoy, there is no joy in the story, there is no logic, there is no peace, it is not sustainable and wherever in life, when it is necessary to do something, then remove from the environment that which is not necessary to do in life. because in the morning  Half of the people have become so concepted, first of all, it is okay in the bathroom, I am not making it with my mother and he is like this, then I have to say that, I am an astrologer, here it looks like this, friend, yours is sitting in the 8th house, yours is also not left, okay relax. Everyone is relaxed, now in my video I will bring so much relaxation and happiness that people themselves call me a detective, don't be addicted, friend, addictive note, these good words are fine, don't make me.  By activating the video, it is negative, this is my power, I am going to give clarity, the name of the channel is also based on clarity, I am giving you clarity that wherever you do this, where you do not get money directly, you tell me brother, give me money.  Give me respect, I do n't need it, it's okay, this useless respect, I put my name there, I will make you a trip, your company will go there, they fool you so much, they say in the corporate, it's okay, we will take you to Goa and there.  There will be a conference where they start in the morning and drink till the night, then at night they get free packs of liquor, those who drink liquor drink as much as they can, after getting up in the morning, the conference starts in the morning and those who drink a little  There are satvik taxes and neither did I get to go out nor see the sea. Do this from morning to evening. Select this slide and say this slide. If I wanted to play gray, I would play only in Gurgaon. Wherever there is a corporate office, I would  By doing this and that, people have gone to the world of desires, they have their clothes, this is this, you say this and how do you know all these inner details, it is a relief, that is why I say, I am number one brother, I know all the details of everyone, tell me all the details of everyone.  It does n't even happen with you that the leadership organizes that they will give CAT there, idiot, it's okay, there is a budget to reduce everything and as soon as they are told, they will sit there, they ca n't even run away, or go around the house, or anything else.  We will listen to them and we will juice them all there, do you think that my coming and going is free, I went to Goa, this conference is like this, it can even give a pain in the stomach, Shakti, I will go there and I will get a lot of benefits, no.  The advantage is that its message is right and the story is also being given a carrot, please release it inside the company, it is a practical company, like I tell you, they do less for Lal ji, which is not a very big company, it is not organized, that's it.  so much money  By the way, you see, the employees don't go there, that person has been working there for 20 years because brother, he does n't know how to do any Shobha ji, your salary is money and bring it, take it and take it and take it, and the responsibility is big and take it, this is a direct transaction of money.  You have done this by running around in the corporate. There are only 400 departments to spend hours. Advise, they have no role, they have done it well and they do this, you are the only one.  You are doing a job, you are doing so much for free, you see these hypocritical videos which are shown forcibly and that live, see the training which we are like me, my eighth brother avatar is fine, in future any stories you will see will be pale.  So that you can do their slavery better, okay, why have I done this? I laughed that Guruji, the employees are under a lot of stress, come and do them a little like this, you can bill them, you can't say date, friend, so that  You Hold them tighter when I say I will come, they will leave your jobs and run away. Don't call me because I am a cloud. Okay, I have come this way once, once I am mentally clear. I am a D employee, okay. Note cup increasing, otherwise.  Don't know, one trillion, you trillion, 3 trillion, do n't know how many trillion dollar market cap, there is no economy, companies stagnate, reduce, even fall, even end, so that means IT is of weight.  Going up is okay so I said friend, first you extract the juice from them then come and tell me that it adds juice to them so that they can extract more, I will not do this less because my advice is not temporary, my advice is permanent, company will also have reliance predicting.  No and you bill c n you people who are making my old predictions consistently, how am I coming right and articles come, one more prediction and I am telling you three.  After a year with this tax, the strength of these employees will be greatly reduced; people in the company will reduce their own tax, you will go in the structured way and do DK for 40 hours a week and they will do 160 hours a month, you will do only 30-40 hours, their tax will give you money.  You will get the same amount if you duplicate it in different companies and where there are 100 employees, there will be 12 14. These 12 14 will contact the remaining 88.  There won't be a system on rules, that bush laborer, say less, but everybody should be relaxed on the debt bill and they should move in this direction. Already I think, whatever consultation I am giving, I am giving it to the startups, this is what I am giving in this tent.  Follow the employment because if you get an employee, then I am not reducing it, for that you establish so many processes, dog, if you keep this pickle, keep it good.  It is not necessary to keep it less, they look at it less and tell that you have kept it less, you keep it in every house, you have to do it less than the plumber in the house, you have to do it less than the electrician, you have to do it less than the carpenter, then you have to do it less than the tile person, that every You come and say brother, look here, what is your rate for installing tiles ₹ 25 ₹ 30 ok ok, this much is done, how much will you paint 10 15 20 ok, this one is yours, it is like this, there will be a similar system.  This is good and whatever, the tax people are listening to me, your job is in danger brother. Okay, so after doing these 4 or 4, start learning some more things, your job will go first in the next 5 years because What you are doing is accounting, some software, some tax is imposed, some cleaning tax is imposed, less will come, there will be flood, the money will be accounted for by doing contractor content, it will be done, there is no need to do unnecessary motivation, pay the money of the one who is less, if there are 19 less taxes. 20  The one who made money for 20 is happy and the one who made 20 is happy, I gave the value of 21, it was less than 19, got the money for 20, gave the value of 21, reduced it so much, this is if the place changes and it bill changes.  IT Bill IT Bill Start Changing No I will always tell you that you will publish the article in three tax months which I have told you, when you will print it then tell me on the date you want. D first time hair and give it to me and you will enjoy that brother, how do you know before the original slap, blind tax wale charg, if whatever picky people have heard of me, then write it down so that I feel that yes, you have awakened someone, Jag Chowki. What will some of them do, what to do now, think like this, think that it is three-four years, you do not have any retirement, now you also know that you are passing the time in the same way, if your tension is not too much, then there is no pressure either. You know  The sales person is taking pressure, the marketing person is taking it, the rest are taking back hand people and are running away, you don't do anything about it, okay, you take more pressure from me, okay, then that time will come now, he is India head. They all roam around in such a way that they will not remain so retired, it means that even if the entire company has a thousand employees, then if 50 or 4 were misled, then 50 per bill will go down to 4, people will stop doing it. If there are thousands of employees on leave of 46 and they reduce the IT bill by thousands and also do the bill style by only a few employees who are doing other functions of the company, then this is the changing environment, you have to change, it will be dynamic if you do not change. With Times Give It Bill Less Ahead En Route Shop And You Have To Do What I Am Telling If You First Move To Economy Side  If you go, then it is very good, you are doing a project through the company, you are doing it to someone, then you are getting the attention, this is also like a small enterprise, I am the only one, mother, so friend, when is this the company's work?  To do the platform, you come and take my direct commission, why would I give so much money to it, if you are getting only ₹ 2 lakh, on top of the project, the charge is on the basis, it is okay, then the charge is on the family basis, so you are directly connected here. all clients clients Keep yours, 24 people, take out yours, you will start from 5 to 6 lines in the beginning and now those who have got these jobs know, now the employee who is roaming around, does not have a job, he will not understand the things about the present.  They are understanding what is the matter and that they are not able to find life balance, they are getting unhappy in life, I give them advice and they follow it directly, they say, it is absolutely right for me, so much.  Well, everyone is so happy with me, they are so happy with me, I have their number, so the company is bye bye Tata, this would be a betrayal, the name of the company is a corporate company which is working for its own profit and by opening your own company in your name alone, you can reduce your income.  If you want a wish then it is not treason, ok do n't take it from the story, it is normal corporate and capital world thank you very much"

Now you are a one-time person, what was the need to spoil one thing? Now you are showing it again. I never say anything about stocks, I am very invested in stocks and I came to stocks uninvested.  Wealth in stock can be created but really state is something very important. I am telling you that by choosing a good city, there are many benefits of living in the city like they come with stability, children's schools do not change, your maid.  Many things do not change, they become constant, due to which a lot of money is saved. When your wife got a job, you just got it, you said that but you will have to choose from the city, you say that whatever I am getting growth.  I am not getting a job, I will not change the city, I will stay in the real world, I mean, I used to do an advertisement long ago, that is why I am saying that I will stay in this place, even if I am getting 20% ​​increase there, I will not go.  I will stay here and want growth, I need money because we don't see compounding of other things. Compounding of relationships. Children go to the same school and do 1st to 12th in the same school setup. So many people compound their education.  There are government employees who come and go on postings a lot, they keep moving from here to there, they keep changing cities, their children are not able to reach the story. Today, if they settle down with a house and then the husband keeps roaming around, then it is a different matter. Adv.

What are you talking about? I will invest the money in the furniture. Youngster, okay, it is a relief. I am telling you as per the life situation, when you become a master and your wife is from the city.  This comfortable you comfortable parents comfortable family comfortable you know the people know the city know everything why many people in Delhi have progressed like this I know so many people in Delhi who have eaten the bread of living only in Delhi, the story has not gone only there. Today you kept doing something like this, you went here and there, went like this, talked like this, did networking, made their life very good with ease, ask them what they do, they can't tell you, we bought something from here, sent it, first I  I used to do less, then I found him, now it has changed, now Delhi has changed, now this has changed, I did it that way, then I did it that way, and the man who is moving from here to there to there, has nothing in his hands.  If you think then what happens after that? Interview Class Family IF YOU BELONG YOU SACH AND YOU ARE SACH YOU IDENTIFY WITH SACH FAMILIES Child has gone to study story Husband is doing story job Wife is not staying Second child is reading story And every one  compulsion of  The story is that if you can't live together, then the child will go. You live in a big city, you are building property assets there, you can see the rent, you can see and build everything, why would your child go? But for example, you are a North Indian.  If you live in Gurgaon, mother, or if you can, then if your child gets a job in the private sector, then why can't he get a job in Gurgaon? It is only a company here, no, why would he go to Bengaluru? Yes, the one whose court address is not there.  The story can also go to Bengaluru, it will also go to Pune, it can also go to California, it will also go to San Francisco, the story can go but whoever has his own base has tightened it, this is called selecting and base people, I do not know Rome, you match and are the ones who progress.  But nobody's bill, because of this, no one is benefited by telling you this. The more you move around, the more you are kept light, only then many things can be taken from you, power is there, remember, experiment, you definitely get this freedom, sister, it is your base.

You can also read the story. His mother works a lot in Mumbai, so his children can go. They will say, Papa, I don't want to stay here. Is it so great that Adani ji Ahmedabad?  It is very important that you have the best in your life, whether you are rich or poor. I have explained the equation of life very well in detail. You can take platinum membership. You can place it out and know how its compounding effect is achieved.  of  Your parents should also not go too far, your child is being delivered by your wife, we are with you, your relatives are nearby, your friend circle is your ecosystem or you have created an ecosystem and you are not leaving it.  They are living a good life, they are living from an old money family, they are living and giving a lot of money, middle classes will never be found because the middle class will be made to serve the society and not even the middle class itself.  So, isn't it those whose children will go here and there and will work for them? It is your children of all the businessmen of Lal ji who have to do it, either you will be fed this same thing or they are not going anywhere. You tell me where Amitabh Bachchan ji's son lives.  They live nearby, what little property do they have that they ca n't go to different places? Jain, it's okay, there is shooting in Mumbai, so we live there and that is the system, but look at the rest of the people, I told you the story of Mukesh ji too, World.

I will never consider the rich wrong.  That's fine, I have to say that brother, we have reached there, now if you don't want to learn after reaching there, then you can't declare him big. Those who understand what is there in India, they have to read very little. Singh is changing in India, you have become an idiot, now understand.  I repeat my point again, in India, it is a very difficult task to make this person understand that he has made you a fool by doing this, has he made you a fool by doing this? Will he agree or not? This is a very difficult task because when I told this thing, the middle class got so much trouble in this.  The system has given good training, which you yourself have given up to Rs. 1.5 thousand, it does not happen like this, why brother, why can't you live in Udaipur, why can't you live in Rohtak, or if you have changed the city, then stay there for 10-20 years.  A new system has not been created, it is okay, it is not working out, we are gone, whatever civilization we have done, we will do it like this, yes, Harappa civilization was Mohenjo Daro, Mayawati was destroyed somehow, something like this happened.  And people had to go but didn't happen every six months people went to the banks of Ganga, if it was so much because agriculture was dominant then only those cities should do it in time. Now again when an industrial person came, where there was industry but those cities were there.  Now this is yours and all this is gone, so these cities are going like this, so now they are yours, so whatever you want to do, you do that thing, I don't care whether I am big or I am you.  in small I have to come, I belong to this place, choose the land of your work, you will understand the government system there, you will be with the people there, you will become it, every time when you change, you have got adjusted, it will drop you off a lot of your mental energy.  Brain juice, it makes you irritable, man, take this when you go to Gujarat, you don't know how to drive there, people keep spitting, cars run away, it doesn't make a big deal, everyone shouts about this thing.  I am telling you and you will be outside, you will feel very strange, what happened, I did not come to reverse, I did not come to park, I just can't drive there, we drive slowly there and everyone does this to each other, now I am so  I am telling you a big thing but they don't make a big deal of it there like normal with the fact that it seems that North Indian does something, so I don't know how much noise he will try to create on this. Look here in Delhi, what would they do if something happens. yes every time  When you change your place it bill you out of lot of energy and start from scratch in life then find someone then say hello to someone then make something it's not I think bill not need you else where you people will say no no  This way is the bill, you don't know, learn color, I am very like me, this is also very widely, I have travel time, even after travelling, I get color, brother, it should be from low base, right? Who said that no, whatever months, months, whatever should be from your base, you should have a house, which should be a city, whatever is your base, your base is called headquarters, like after that, you should visit the foreign country, visit South India, see the temples, see the business, see the colors, see the food.  Eat, meet people, do less, but it is necessary to survive by getting up and down. You can do all the less anyway, so this was given in a new perspective. This was given in great detail in the happiness course.  It is given that if you want to go and see it, then you can also become a consultant from him and there is no need to give any stipulation in the Happiness Course because it is Ultimate, you will not get any such old knowledge in it that you should do it like this, however, it is not like that. Okay, so you can watch that too. How did you like this video? Please share it. Thank you."

This is what the middle class is unable to understand because the middle class forces morality into everything. Today I will explain this thing with three excellent examples.  I am going to understand your life because this question is asked many times on my content and if you do not understand this thing then you will be deprived of the high level knowledge of life and will roam around confused in life. So the name of the channel is Clarity.

Don't do it, don't waste your life in UPSC, it is a useless thing. Chase is less and there is no benefit and even if you become it, there is no such thing. I have to say that you all should prepare for this by taking the form to clear Prelims. Even if you are not clear in Mains, you have become an expert in Prelims. You can neither solve big answers nor check them, but you have become a master of Prelims. Now you are training others in Prelims and earning a lot of money.  Yes, why are you bringing morality because Bhai Saheb, you were saying, Sir Guruji, you were saying that not to do it, now why are you saying this, you are preparing for the people, oh brother, this is life, this is life, this is our life.  By doing it with brain and intelligence, by doing it with discretion and conscious mind, please see for yourself what is easier, staying at one place in Delhi, giving coaching, making your own YouTube channel, giving knowledge to people, solving prelims papers and you are the master of that.  You Paisa Kuto, marry such a girl, hers is a different subject, yours is a different subject, the colors of the sherbets, the water of the sweet ghat, the sherbet is completely ready, water and sherbet, you are comfortable, this is shakha life and this is what I give concentration in real life.

Yes, but you are being constant, it is teaching you, so you can give this thing to others and charge them, the ultimate team is there too, so for this I am telling you like this one.  The thing is that stability is very very important, so both the advices can be given. The consultant is giving the best advice to the one who is sitting ahead, that if I have the scenery management sitting next to me then I will give him the best advice.  I give you advice on how to suck the blood of people below you. Hey brother, he is sitting there, he is the boss, he is having his consultation and after 2 hours of this, there is a harassed employee from the bus, which is called consultation, he is told how not to suck blood, how to save you.  This advice is to start understanding the meaning of morality and understand yourself that life is a game, there are players in the game and you should come to play the game. If you are a coach then you can help someone now.  Joe McCullum, who is a resident of New Zealand, is coaching England on how his father kept winning the test matches by hitting sixes. Hey, you are from New Delhi, now I am in a test match. There is a test match between England and New Zealand. You don't have to do that, you have to give your devices, this is the second advice for you, I always tell and that should be honey, boy- girl marriage, you know, merit corner in marriage is fine, marriage resolves the troubles in marriage. Please, many people think of me as brother, please get our daughter married, I don't know what kind of marriage you are, but yes, I am not that person, that is okay, I advise people, it is okay for a boy to marry a boy, I have to tell him too.  You marry a girl who [ __ ] because you know that she will [ __ ]. This is my second example because you will understand on multiple levels because wherever you say, the brain starts conflicting and starts switching off even though it Great knowledge is being gained by resolving the conflict a little. A little late video is being made here. Stay connected here. What have you ever said? Listen, you are facing a conflicting thing. You can be any party, you have to understand what it is.  Because what does he want for the next party, what training has he got, it will help you, otherwise everyone is getting training, in this world people at every level are bringing knowledge, so the advice to the boy is that you are a brother and a girl.  Marry someone who works and earns money. If she doesn't work, then she earns money in some other way. She should have talent because there is no other noise that how will she live in the house, will she contribute anything or not, but this thing is noise.  Is it true that if you earn money then you may not ask for your lipstick and polish, it will be beneficial even if you don't give something directly, it will be beneficial at least you should understand what a color is. It is difficult to earn money and girls.  I advise you that you are like this, I am a luxurious boy, I married her, why do you want to do less, then find such salvation, then find such a place where father-in-law is fine and lives away either. I don't think both of them should have different advice, power is there, the girl can be told to marry someone who keeps you in her hands, keep you in her hands, keep someone in your in-laws who keeps you in her hands, what is the problem and tell them that you are absolutely in her hands.  don't keep  What is the problem, then both of them have advice for different parties, so what is the problem brother, the girl's side, now am I pro girls or pro boy, why brother, boys will be told, you find such girls, such girls are good, told girls.  If you go then find such boys, they are good, this is the only advice, now those good boys, find good girls, good boys, find stupid girls, good girls, stupid boys, that combination will keep on going but advice.  It is conflicting but it is best for both the animals, so the boys still have to see that if they feel that they will be misused like this and everything for me will happen like this, then it will happen, then you should marry a working woman or a simple one.  It's such a thing and tell her brother, no matter how much my salary gets, you will do this, now how will the house be run, we will figure it out differently, okay and how will you do it then you will follow your mother's third example, I would have given this to you many times.  And in this you people will realize that this is not possible. If you apply your mind then I give advice. Meet these people who are more intelligent than you, more mature and more successful and do not interact with losers. Then the advice is very good to hear.  But is it so easily practical because this advice is for everyone, but for example, you are here and your friend is a loser in the circle, then it is okay or time.  Waste is famine, less is mature, does not mean they do bullying, okay, so what I am saying is that you should not interact with them, you should do with your butter, now for the butter that is yours, you have become lower, why is that with you. Will understand that you don't want to do it because you want something from yourself, then this one would also want this so because give it also getting something you understand so whenever you are getting you pay up and give something to you some physical Seminar Wegner Online Teaching Coaching Mentorship A wise man, because a wise man also becomes equal only when he too has a Zen, so we have to leave them, we have to leave them, we have to leave the lazy people, we have to leave time waste, we don't have to leave the whiners, we have to leave them.  Have to leave only those who are like this in the relationship Rakhi and come to you for relationship advice Do nothing Leave came with great pride Bill help you my friend no I  I am a consultant and I bill just Rs 5000, whatever your defending is on, I have a special rate, okay, I too, you can start from the bottom after learning, so the one who has a genuine problem and you had to be considered a genuine intelligent and then you have to pay the money.  Will give, they come to distribute fukra, don't you just give 50 knowledge to them, don't follow them and you have to be the same again, there are many such friends, relatives and circle. Take them out, take them out from a distance, you speak directly, as soon as you come, you are a friend, you are an acquaintance, you are a relative, you will go away automatically like this, then you move forward in your life, then this is a cycle, in this you become selfish like this.  So, this is the biggest cry of all, don't be selfish, those who are not worth anything, tell the same stories themselves, brother, four, do it like this and waste your time, and even if he does less of his own business, he will come and waste your time.  as soon as it happens  If it doesn't happen, tell me what I am telling you, then I used these three things as an example of how you can live with the advice that is contradictory. This is the consultant, what happens in situations like this and sometimes, I have given my knowledge to which America  You gave your weapons to other countries, you had to fight with them too, this also happens sometimes, the country to which you sold weapons does the same to you, but the person who produced them  He knows what his cat is. He is a guru who is a consultant who knows things at a high level. He knows everything. What is that cat? She is an aunt. She did not teach the fox to climb. He taught everything. It is the cat who taught everything.  But when the fox came to attack the cat to eat it, the aunt asked the cat climbed the tree, did he not teach this, did he not show the whole thing, is the caste correct, so this is the advice flow to you.  From de real people de bill say this think this time this think you have absorbed ki yaar for me which team do I belong to but this is the advice he is giving now now I have to say don't do government job these people are in government  We have to prepare for the job because if we lose the opportunity to get a government job, then this coaching will also end. All of them are saying, become a tea seller, become a tea seller, become a tea seller, whether it is hey brother or drinking tea from the tea seller.  took this  There are people who are preparing for their competition even at 3:00 to 4:00 in the morning, their papers are being checked, test papers are being shown on YouTube, the paper is being prepared at 4:00, so when  If there is preparation for the paper, then the ready person is standing outside, so he will come after completing the paper, so even if you are next to him, there is one who will give him egg bread, that sir, a system is also going on, now if those tea sellers become egg bread sellers, then brother, it will be fine for them.  how come this too  So these preparations are needed, that's why the tea seller and all the programs are going on, so every friend is necessary, every friend has an advice, then nothing will ever happen to the band, but we will keep giving advice, like this, it's okay sir day.  All the tea vendors have become tea bags, the whole world, if the world wants, then who will come to drink? If I give advice, everyone has become on YouTube, then all have become YouTube, who will come to listen to us, okay now we understand, but it never happens like this, okay then advice.  Always  It will be given, I will not tell you, if you have to open YouTube also, then I will teach you all these things further which are done practically. If you enjoy anything else than my videos, then I feel free to write that if someone has enjoyed something like this.  Hey, this is a fight, it is not going to make you the king of a startup in an instant, it will get ₹ 12 crores by shipping it to you in 30 years for 10000 rupees in 30 years, there is nothing like that, the story is not going to come, wait and see. Keep that in the economy which you will never get, if you get 12% then you can get 15%, you will get it for 20 years also, I don't do anything like this, I know what is cold coffee and what is milk, ok, many people are content with cold coffee.  I want to know that you have taken this much milk, you have added coffee to it, you have turned it into a mixer, now that milk has become this much, that milk is not big, it is only this much that is awake, so when we drink it, we will turn into mustaches, but after drinking that, we will know about mine.  If I am successful then please type if I am successful then please type if I am successful or if I go to mug these are the things if you write then this kind of thing will give you more public recognition and gold. You will know what to think and how to think.  I am telling you how and what to think, it is hard, but when the reality of this hard has come, then I am asking to hear very good comments, that is why I am a tree consultant and tree seller. I do it in that  I started taking out things from it, it's okay, take it, okay and like the video, thank you very much."

    "title": "Understanding Stock Price , EPS And P⧸E Ratio [r_tqlUSpccE].en",
    "content": "That Hello friends, the next class of Stock Market, today we will understand Sher Antivirus on Stock Price Farming, by just doing this absolutely true, all the terminology will be reduced to half. Stock Price was a pimple, it looks as if you will buy someone in the limit, this bike does its code, it comes NSC. On the website of National Stock Exchange, the name of the company is its price on the Bombay Stock Exchange. It is seen that the share is worth this much. Okay, now it includes something good morning but noise and running but body. Very simple.  Things: How much profit did the company earn last year? Divided by number of settings. Videos We have already learned what is the market cap of a company. Stock price in total number of shares. The number of shares of a company can be any number. It can be as much as.  The promoter wants that I have a company worth 1000 crores and I am definitely sharing one like. This is 10 lakhs rock. If you start less, if you start less, the price will be higher. If you share more, it will be less.  Let's get simple, so we have understood the price, there is nothing much to understand about it, now on the earnings six which are GPS and how much time I made profit and how much was left, so if in the cases I earned profit of Rs 1 lakh and  Mere sher hai hazaar to GPS ho gaya fennel ki profit divide net profit different number options, now nine ips we have come to know and I am on the share and this is a running per share option according to the share.  You can calculate this trail in twelve months, if you can then you will get it very easily, you will get it very easily from all the apps that are available and from all the sides of your friends, but you should know this. That this is the thing, now this piece is nothing in the dream, GPS has come to know, even the price is nothing in itself, but Dubai Begum is something important, so what is the meaning of price to earning, if a lion of ₹ 100 And it has a running price of ₹ 10 years, so Hundred Divided Best Antivirus Vikram Stand, now on the new generation show, people say that if there are less trees then it is a good thing, if there are more of them then it is a bad thing, by doing this they removed the black tea spoon, it is not so simple that things  Understanding that less is good and more is good in bed or more is a commitment, it is not so that you have understood that 1 minute is 1 matriculation, you have a world, there is a lot more to take from this, then company rain and whatever is there can also be that.  Arvind, not much, the price is also low and the price can be reduced, even in Bigg Boss, there are some issues of corporate government and the GPS was introduced last year, but now something like this is coming in the system in the next 12 months.  If this will not be good then the market is going to bring down its price, then there will be many new investors in it who will memorize the next P virus of C. If the time is right then I will take it, so there will be a pressure in it.  And it gets added to the G federations, Pinjio drinking technique is pegged, in this there is growth forward and backward, so how much is the growth of the company? If the PY of a company is 20 and its growth is cent at 20, then 20020 is one copy of this dam.  Guru, this is also considered if daily employment is good or less then it will reduce but if there is growth, if there is a show on TV, if its frequency is 20 and  If its growth is decreasing, then you are your favorite, if it is getting corrupt, then it has become Bigg Boss. Being more is not a thing in itself, we want growth, so now we have added the flavor of growth to it. Now whenever generations are compared,  If you have to run two companies, then two companies should be in the same sector. Otherwise, is there any comparison? If you are running a commodity type business, you will get every single digit company, steel company, iron company.  Another company took out iron and quality, made it a little cheese, made a little more batter, but you cannot do it at less than SMC, you cannot do it at less than paint, now back in Enfield, its marriage line will give you 50 60 70 80 90 always.  It is the same and you have to do it at less than the rest. If you are given to the bank at book value, I will tell you that value separately. Friends, I have described the situations as if we were our gods. Let's take the name book value, what is that aspect of the price, when I cover that sector completely, I will tell you, but you, this is the tiles of SIM sector, so in the tiles, one is Kajaria Ceramics Kishore and one is Somani Ceramics Hair.  Now when I do PY on less, I do it in the same sector, in which sector, how much is the average of the leader, now I will know, more is less, this is the biggest thing, very important text in the car.  Maker's comparison cannot be done in class. This page will be perplexed after seeing the marriage yacht of Industries. Look at this amazing demand. So whenever we have to use Bigg Boss, we have to see its historical key also.  Of the same stock as his historical PC from Asian Paint is so much so now he is trading above this historical speech on average for so many years and is completing will give some  The idea is that there is only one matriculation in itself, there is only one risk, only hold the tail and put the filter of marriage lines that in dieting, you people will get all these things, now I will teach you all the languages ​​as if it is a new thing. Actually, I am talking in Hindi and English but when you will know about this thing then only by visiting that site you will understand what to do, gradually as you watch the video, you will get everything for sure. I will tell you from my side.  computer laptop and it not from top to bottom  It is falling because it wants you to work hard. According to the old Indian Guru Ji, Money Gyandev, nowadays everything is found in the group and how to structure the thought process, what mistakes are being made, how to approach it, I will tell you step by step.  So today we learned that Pira this source is important now the price of the share is the price and is the pace. I told you that the team has given this rough smoothing and the final thing to the bike. This is the only thing. It may be more than that for some reason. For some reason.  The leaf can also reduce, you know like we reduce the BP, the unity of happy BP increases, it reduces but every person changes now, so he is also an example like this, okay, you have one, everything is on that bridge.  There can be no treatment, you will have to learn other things, then after drinking the good thing, put a pad also, see the growth, you will get only this much link, for that you will have to work a little, you will get the PY very easily.  Growth you put and calculate your that view is your one above below this it is always above if in some company is always above many times what is for a twenty per cent growth in HDFC bank marketers willing to pay a premium student to that  If they do not know about Kotak Mahindra Bank PSU Bank UPSC Bank, it will pay a premium, then there will be a separate topic about banks, I will tell about it later. Let us take the example of Asian Paints.  So Asian Paints will always be commander happy because of being an industry and is market cap and rest of the people will be there but their speed will be less because the price increases with the brand too.  In this way you have to understand that if p10 then it means that I have invested my money and will withdraw it from sleep in 10 years, then the market will give him the profit of 10 years, that is according to the trend of his market.  It's been 10 years, I have slept at many places, many times, which were not listed, towards the heroes etc., they had got more than a thousand rupees, then there you should get the idea, and thousand years means you, they are doing so much, then they When there is so much exaggeration then why try this secretly, Inspector Darshan Singh like to aaye ho paye been able to explain is different in his head to all of you, there are further videos also in this  There will be different types of resources and we will do different resources. If you guys are enjoying then write MB GB that yes sir, if you are also finding it difficult then check out the difficulty. I will try to explain all the things slowly and easily.  I am trying to tell you guys that Anees is a journey, he should also watch his old videos, he will jump exactly like this, then it will be a little difficult further, if you watch it in the order, it will be very good, thank you Hey A"

    "title": "UPSC Results And A Reality Check For Youth ｜ Must Watch For UPSC Aspirants [sIamKwWoKa8].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, great topic, UPSC result has come and there is big clarity, you are youth, very good video, keep watching till now, what is going wrong in it, we will discuss it on the ecosystem, what strategy should you adopt, we will discuss it, future of UPSC.  But we will discuss and I will tell him one more thing, I will not tell him the truth tomorrow but such a secret which no one has told you till date, no one has told you about this UPSC and whatever is the preparation for all this, there is such a truth in it which  India needs you, do it like this, then tell those who are preparing for UPSC, in whose house you are doing it, whether you did it or not, it was this, even if you are not doing it, then this will be a big topic of journal knowledge, it can be an issue for discussion.  Please do spread this in the group and it is a request to the subscribers to please subscribe and those who are rational, if they like what Vijay says, then subscribe to the channel and those who find it a little problematic should subscribe.  Those people please write in details. You used to prepare for UPSC. If you want to write long question answers, then we can also write this line by doing a little and here I will discuss a little about Vikas Divya Kriti ji and also about Avadh Ojha ji.  I will discuss, I will discuss on both of them, they also have some important things which I will tell, so let's start with the first 4 women from which some pattern is seen and some conclusions can be drawn, we will discuss that later when I will be in UPSC. If I talk about the future, we will talk about it. A lot of parades are being held. Do you understand the parade? How did you get through the parade? I got UPSC, I got passed in 8th, which arrow was uprooted, what a big thing you have reduced, so much congratulations, India's war youth is getting wasted, GDP journey.  He is doing it because Sir, there is a parade here, you are going to the Chowk, no matter how top you are, the girl should not pass the prelims twice, just look at the beauty of the straight exam, you will do it twice.  Appeared in prelims and then it was Tina Dabi ji. If you know, earlier her name was quite famous. This exam was conducted for her too, when she got the head of reservation in prelims, after that she topped and after that she topped absolutely clean.  If you take support there at the top, then this is the pattern and there are many things in the exam which are not under control, I will tell you what should be the strategy on this, but I want to tell you what is going wrong, IPS is everywhere on social media. They have spread so much on social media like arrows have become in a pumpkin, so much has been spread, department action should be taken against them, there is a woman wearing a saree, she is getting out of the car, an officer is going fast with the file, show him the meeting like this.  The biggest bureaucrat of our country is getting late for Anonymity. Even the Prime Minister says that he is a government servant and keeps his fingers and lips quiet. Reduce the dream. Well, reduce it and whatever the media has to do, it has to be done by Twitter. In that, government policies, government programs or whatever information you want to convey to the people, do it for that and not to promote yourself. You have to promote yourself for the sake of promoting yourself. You are so fond of making it on YouTube that you give up sitting on the rod. Hello friends.  Let's start, who is believing that this fame of force is being taught by these children, you will never see a very senior officer and an experienced officer doing this small thing, but no, I have some suggestions in this.  I will also give you some idea in the election, I don't know. If you get an idea, look at this. It is being told that she was an IPS officer and then she got coaching from here. Now this is a big question. I have to ask a question. If you have joined IPS then you have to give this exam. Why is it being given? Listen, what is wrong? The video is going to be very good and questions from UPSC people should come. Whatever I am saying should be asked in the form of questions. You have given the exam, you are an IPS.  Gone or IRS went down and went down to A-light and then you go to the job and then you are just preparing, there cannot be such a person who can do the job perfectly and then get cleared. How many people are there?  The lower group also appears in Group C and then they keep on preparing. D. Government has to be very clear, so when I got hold of Government, then I got hold of it. If you think that you have more talent, then you give too much to the competition. If you look carefully at all the people who came and take out a list of them, how many were engaged in the old government service, this is not even a story, they are not being trained here, they are not getting any job in corporate, they are in government service.  Whoever or whatever you want to train in your home, it takes time to understand him also, brother, this is less for you to do like this, here you are making him understand less, he is preparing for his coaching and then he will die in two years.  Tata bye bye I don't know why this is being allowed. If you have become an ISC, then who has accepted that you should become one, but while you are in a government job in some other job, this is a big thing. Now people will say in this, this is a fundamental right, this is the law, the same article 15.  And whoever comes, it is the government, the government is all cloud power, if you want then you can put a cap on it, it is power, first of all, please limit the number of attempts, please do it thrice, brother, I am enjoying this together eight times because youth is busy. Because the one who is not directly learning youth employment and is preparing, he is a BG, he will come and do something, otherwise it is okay for 22 to 37 years, now the Indian economy is going different, now this is the time to keep them so stupid.  If it is necessary then this is something very important if you see others promoting on social media then you have to complain further if Prime Minister [ __ ] Politicians do all this then  It is absolutely right, he has to contest the election, brother, if he has to be re-elected in 5 years, then he is not lukewarm to himself, he will not go, who will vote for you, tell me, we have done this, we have done that, so this is their loss, how can you cook their loss?  It seems like you are a government servant, don't do that to the government system. Since when have you been famous for yourself and have you wanted to contest vote elections, is this too big, what happened to this line, were social media told to allow handles, do this?  Advise, you should not be loud at all, you are privately on your WhatsApp, on Facebook with your private family, is anyone of yours like this, because people have said that because if he has become narcissistic then he has said for less, in doing this for the government's nation.  He had said that it is fun to get one's photo taken everywhere and to glorify oneself and Sir, all these young officers are doing it like others and others are kissing some drivers, some do not do it themselves, one half of them is kept by some.  Now this thing is going on that if someone makes a video doc of these then they will say yes, what can we do, tell me, Dum Sahib or Dum Sahib, are they reducing the story a bit and if someone is bitten by them, then do they want to show the scenes from the movie? You mean like the collector shown in the movies, sir, I will also tell you about such a collector in more detail, which no one has told you till now, and you all must see it, so what should be the streets, what should be the streets.  If you want to prepare for UPSC, definitely do it well for 2 years, take nights, after that start your work and keep giving exams and that too after one stage, if it is done then it is good and if not, it is very good. Do it continuously for 8 years 10.  Don't make it a thing of the year, I am going to tell you about its future in UPSC, if you check the data very carefully, Vikas Divya Kriti ji also just told that 54 Hindi medium students have been selected from there. Being selected does not mean that Hindi medium people have become intelligent, it means that now more people from other strata of society have started coming and some other strata of society have started getting disillusioned, not even giving the exam is very good. This is very good, this UPSC should be on the lower level, those poor people who suddenly get selected, that they will also know and when they will know, they did not tell me anything, I request with folded hands that today I never  Don't speak in any video because you have to tell me the thing and watch the video only after listening to it completely you will understand what I am saying, what is there to say, what is there to say, what is there to say, the coming of women, I am happy, the future which I had told.  Future of UPSC: In the times to come, more women and girls will come, it is not that they have become intelligent, it is not that they have become intelligent, I am saying that Handwriting Divya Kriti ji said the selection of girls.  This has happened more because the handwriting is good. Hey, their handwriting will be good last night. Handwriting of girls is always good. Compare, you boy, the date is agreeable but will you be good in this exam, that is why after getting selected, everything was bad in the previous one. Talk on logic.  I base 90% of the things on Divya Kriti ji, but those 10% issues are the same as anyone else's, because she can talk very well in very short spoken lines. But later on in the middle they talk like this, if nothing happens then it will be translated, if you continue for 10 years, if you do not become anything, then story or story, you will definitely become something good, this is a big deception, story will become nothing, you will become maximum story master ji, you will become someone else.  Also, the job which is not available in the government is a big problem. Tell me, this is wrong. Tell me, if one trades in futures and options, then it is so big. Those who do not sign anything, they have demat accounts and directly agree to it.  It is written in it that how will you get it, will your husband go, what are the rest ratios, do your intelligence, they are to be written, they are different things, not to be read, everyone scrolls like this, they come with the terms and conditions and then press submit, but why are they not telling this here?  Why are they not telling that IT is very risky, think risk reward ratio is like this, no one is going to become an arrow in the pumpkin, no one told me about those things, I will tell you Awadh Ojha ji is like that, he is a star artist type and he is a star teacher type. Many people in Patna had written in the comment area of ​​one of my videos that he studies a lot, does well, has nothing to do with studies, he speaks on his own.  That sometimes it was less here, sometimes it was yes, sometimes it was yes and again and again, it is good that if you got more money, then learn from them, learn from them that UPSC is a gambling and the losers continue to earn more money because they are attracting new people to gamble.  I am teaching you to understand what I am saying Vikas was engaged, why didn't he leave them and come, the appointment has been made and that's what I will tell you while parading and saying to a girl that what do you say now that in 258, the secretary will become cabinet secretary, how can you say, what is the ratio, what is the chase.  And if it happens, what will happen? 23 out of 58 are going on. In the middle, everyone forgets the struggle in between. Posting at a small place, posting from here in three months, posting from here, posting to children 10 times.  Changing school, this whole package is not even told. Brother, why is this package not told? Why is only a small package told? And you will get such a big house, you will get a big house, for how many days will you be here? 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, 18 months. A scandal has happened.  So you will be fired in 6 months, for this you want to become one of the small lions. Who has seen you say peacock dance in the jungle? Don't glamorize it so much. It is a job, it is a job. In the coming time, you will be in lower class.  People will come, people of poor people will come, then you Bablu, what problem are you facing, I am not facing any problem, it is a very good thing, I am predicting in the future that this will happen in the future, now you see many boys of rickshaw pullers will become girls.  And there will be more girls because girls have the power to wait, now boys don't have the patience to start, so what is a girl if she doesn't prepare for it, does n't do it even 10 times.  If she becomes a housewife, then what is her time? Do you know how many women there are in the middle class in India? 9% of the women work less than 91, so less manage the house at home, so either try to manage the district.  Otherwise, there is a house to manage, there is something like this that girls used to do Vikas Devi, girls are very good, they will be selected because they will manage the district, because which girl can manage the house too. Which brother, 23, 24, 25 year old, which girl manages? Girls don't do anything, they raise their heads every day, we know that you watch all my videos, I am not there, I give the balance to someone who is my old friend, they know in some Write dog HPA, write something in dog, but let me tell you why this is being said, girls, if you do good at home, you will manage the district well. If you manage the district well, then the country will also be good.  If he manages then he becomes the Prime Minister then not everyone is like this, isn't he? This logic means he is so soft spoken, he talks so lovingly and so well, then it seems that he is getting everything right because no man can do such logical things from here to here.  Then there is no one here to talk nonsense because everyone will catch hold of it and say, look at this, this is excellent, there is clapping for it, when in the exam, you are also the teacher, if the question is correct then you will get marks for it.  If you go for the wrong question then you will not get marks. If you go for the wrong question then you will get deducted. What is there in this thing? Now the children come to Brahma and give them development. They are also doing a very good job by coaching those who cannot crack the question.  We will do it but there is a catch in that, tell me that the boy who has cleared PCS is a girl who also has to take the interest test, if she has cleared prelims, then it means the date day after tomorrow, this groomed fear definitely needs a little polishing, then it will be good for you and you. It is an investment, your result will definitely be good because you have taken the good one, are you doing it wrong, are you doing it very well, but you have to understand it completely, you took those people and then the result from them became good, the result is good.  If it happens, these people are not being given any subsidy since then, brother, if someone is working for ₹ 100, then this ₹ 20 will be spent here, so for that, they have to earn 100 from someone, now they have to earn 100 from someone.  But if Question Academy is a model ground and which is also the model ground of Vikas ji or Awadh Ojha ji, then they cannot say that children, after the third time, we will not take only three attempts, will you just make these people go?  Can't say, everyone's taste is the same, 10-10-15, keep attending or keep coming again and again, repeat match, repeat match, repeat match, repeat match, no, this time we missed number two, oh so much.  There is competition, everyone stays with only two marks. There will be very few people like this in the exam in Prelims because those who are so incompetent are not going to give it. You will not see this in Prelims. If someone gets 12 marks then everyone will get 9395 97 105.  Topic of 110 and then your general category in it, this category is getting the curd of mind only in 15-20 marks, everyone knows this and  UPSC also does Marks Plus like this and it looks like this and every time the paper changes, your pattern will change in two-four years, then again tweet in the story, then you have endured the pattern, only then I have been there for two-three years.  You have come out of this think, you became an expert in it, you saw everything, something changed from fat, someone else became it and most of those who are already officers, keep it at level A because they have a sense of despair, I am employed.  An IPS officer is already familiar with this, Sir, he feels a little relieved. He has done zero notes on the job. His personality has improved. An IPS officer is sitting in the interview. Now you have to give her number. All ready.  If you are an IPS then what is the number dog? You have already been selected as IPS. Now she will become an IC. Keep playing this. What is the purpose of the whole country? To prepare the people. If Puri says it is worth Rs 40 thousand crores.  This is the only good thing in the economy, what is not good in productivity, there is also alcohol in it too, there is a government committee which makes a lot of money, the good thing is that these fantasy cricket people, dream11, this, 11, this, that, this is a very good thing, they also earn money.  This means that they should be promoted for the country's productivity and also for war. There is a thing called 'I Bill and With' which I had said in 'Which Nobody Bill Tells You' and this is because I opened up a bit.  I can speak because I know that in so many 19 minutes my patience will be less but those who came here and listened and understood then please type, I heard it in mains and if I understood it then it is S and those who enjoyed it after this then MG Listen carefully, in childhood, we used to play games. All the children of you people had to play games, in which the elder children used to play with the younger children. Some kind of system was called, if you remember, remember the word, small child, when it came to the elder children.  I told him to play in the middle of  I used to go, its raw, so the cup was small child in good humor, he will neither get ice nor his pick, ok no he will be out, nor will he be in, neither his numbers will be counted, nor runs will be counted, nothing, nothing will be counted, he would play.  He will keep playing or she will keep playing and he is singing this fear, it was raw, like this, now inside this system, when I will call these women, women, I will account in the previous tabla, irrespective, you belong to any caste, women are anything, women are behind.  hee money  Caste is what brings them forward and the rest are those who are behind, whatever categories are running for you and those who are poor from Tabla are also coming inside Sony, there is no reservation, nothing will be yours, you are raw.  Bill less and relaxing five years, this has been cut but very big and big people know this thing and do it with a big base, see there is no one to tell the thing because no one will tell, I will create a platform in the coming time if you all support me.  where this truth is revealed  It will happen and God will say that if any officer himself comes and says that brother, there is nothing here as you are thinking, there are less jobs due to which everyone is less, the country is less and no one is so great, now no one is so great, no.  But he makes the country, hey brother, he goes in 35-40 years and you, Babu, do less harm. The politician makes the country and runs it and it is the people who select him, this is just a policy and makes tomorrow this chaat secret too.  tax power  Artificial Intelligence is also tax power. If it becomes everyone's base then we will become the head of the government. We outsource less. DC will remain as data collector. DC will remain as DC Bill Note B. District Collector but Data Collector will monitor who got the benefit in the government's schemes and how much benefit did not happen.  There is no input from him, zero creativity, you see these people, who is taken, how people are taken, who will look big in speaking donkey like a donkey for 15 16 less hours.  Vishakha Nandan can do it by saying 'Lay Shabd'. Like Vishakha Nandan, one can slouch for 15-16 hours without losing one's mind. This happened in Haldighati on 20th June in 1576. So what will we tear apart in the future by parroting all the rattas of the country so that one's mind can be destroyed?  Don't think, listen, we want such a man, here you want to become such a man, zero creativity, nothing, you can't implement it from your side, it doesn't mean much.  Not only that, everything is being done by outside consultants, the consultants are doing it, our consultants also have a lobby, there is an ecosystem and you know, some 15 lakhs, 2 crores, 3 crores, I am telling you, this is the best time to be a consultant in India. LEARN D TRICK OF D TRADE NOVA SKILL SET NO SOMETHING IS REQUIRED ON THE FOREHEAD NO DEGREE IS REQUIRED YOU SHOULD COME DOWN AND YOU WILL BE SORTED AND THIS IS MONEY WORK  Dhaba's government is running all over the place on consultants, hold some department, all the constructors are a good thing, not doing evil is a good thing for the government because they have the knowledge, they were selecting the car, they have nothing, relieved, I am telling.  If you have heard the PM's speech, if you have heard it inside the Parliament, what more can he say, then you will run, if you hear it, then Google it, Nobody is happy and impressed with. Bureaucrats in this system become eyes of politicians but everyone becomes something, nothing happens in actual, then decision comes, only two are less, either try to point towards corruption or else be completely cool, you have seen it.  Is real serving is and starting coaching by resigning who is Gaurav hai who is one type please serving is my ko nahi karni aur d he wants you to make a big deal out of it which he should  But I have made a lot of sacrifices for Haj benefit, you don't have it because there is no shortage of disappointment in the job, but brother, you came thinking that if you got it, now it is a disappointment or else continue here, keep fooling yourself, keep appearing like this to the world,  He is a week student who can only memorize, his creativity is zero and on top of that, his parents do not have the money to do some business or study great things in life.  Do this, this is a service for those people, now all UPSC and government jobs are available, now people say no, middle class is not for middle class, middle class is still four-five percent in India, what are you talking about, you earn 50 thousand.  If you are middle class then don't consider yourself why do you stress yourself brother, how many will come below 5 lakhs? So you have, you understand that no one will have the power of oil and that power is concentrated even today.  It will remain at a higher level and I cannot tell you more openly than this. I will tell you after 6 months how the Illuminati is, they have just made you, you are raw to reduce them and you will keep roaming from here to here, and they belong to some people and they have always been there.  We have been following the same system, we are following the same system, check the full names of all the scenery officers, I am just giving you a hint, I am just running all the tricks and there you will become like this here, till then the country is far away. Such  Will progress from 3 trillion to 10 trillion in 15 20 years, so much money, so much everything is to come, you will just keep getting irritated on this job, you will keep watching from the witness that we were the calmest intelligent and this money has been useful, this money has been useful, it will be set.  I will make a king, I will make a king, Awadh ji should say that a king is not being made, there is no king, there is no king, an old time clerk level British clerk, think something.  It is not in his hands, there is no power in his Kalam, there is no power inside his Kalam, what will be said is the king, the one who is a politician is the real king, he is the one who will speak, if he does like this then the Kalam will work as he will say, whatever he will think, the Kalam will be like that.  Only if it works, it will be at its best, the one who should not write a copy shot, the secretary will write just that much tomorrow, this less artificial tax power will be given in 5 years 2029 because of this which is now the dispensation, next time I feel like this They will win the next election too and next time the system and this one will be made such that sweets will not be distributed on this ban in 2030, this is my prediction, what are you talking nonsense, sweets will not be distributed in 2030, normal things will be distributed, it is okay here.  Gai chal ok very good nobody bill best nobody bill do de clapping and de cut off andar prediction bill also note ko very hi he and keep coming either If you make the paper easy then it will be removed. If the standard of the paper remains the same as it is now, which is very high standard, it is difficult, it is difficult, it is okay, then there will be a difference in the quality of that thing. If you have to analyze every year, then cut off. Do a square analysis when the people of Hindi literature will start coming into this i.e. why can't the people of Hindi literature come, then see that when the Hindi literature people come then they will not be made to run anything, look at the system because there was a system, many years will pass for the IIT people.  a little something  They used to go and share a headline of 'I am' that a man left Rs 30 lakhs and he came just to listen to that one news so that I am explaining to people an argument like mine, so people can forward the article to him. Look brother, this is  Chhath worth Rs 35 lakh has been spent or is it just mud for that, based on the data, how many women will pass the total in the coming time, now this is a good thing, a good thing, a good thing, do it, but they will not have anything, I am telling you carefully.  What  There is no article written, no one has told me this, raising this matter somewhere, sitting, coming, getting to know each other, a lot of honesty, people are very close, extremely close, they speak the truth, now I cannot speak by taking their name, but one day my feeling is this because  Regretfully, whatever I say, people can say in any way, we have to bring them together on a platform and tell them the truth, government jobs are not out of the country, government jobs are on the 10th.  The first job after 10th number will be of a banker or someone in finance, third, fourth or fifth, the job that comes after 10th or 11th number will be there, you don't know here, this is the caste of the country, even 75 years ago Indian Civil  Service is the biggest, even today it is the biggest, so the progress of the country is not something to be happy about and whoever is making it has got a job, minimize tomorrow, make achievements, do something practical to take the country forward.  Show me Shivay, what is there in not doing what you do, it is like doing it, the one who is fooled here, you know that I am the champion of Gurgaon real estate, water here, India, put the motor here and come out, here it has fallen, take out the motor and take out the water.  Your achievement is this, you have to humiliate me every time, meaning I have taken out water, I can roast as per my wish, I think, do you CD performance, I do n't know any music, there is no editing, there is nothing in me.  so if this  If everything goes, then I don't know where to go but there is no more, I am this, then that, I am in this, I will get stuck in this, one people, bill, come, am, this is not, you attract, subscriber image of alloy, you attract subscribe is doing absolutely right and the child It tastes so good that if you are looking for a son, if you are getting married, then you are preparing for it, but it does not mean that you should keep waiting for yourself for 10 years. It does not mean that if you  If you get married, your husband will tear into your book. Keep preparing but on time, I will request you all, ladies, do not leave your normal life and he will spend your time sitting on the table and chair while preparing for this exam. There is nothing brother, neither money nor power nor respect. If I had all the three then would I ask a stupid question. Do n't tell me who told me further that brother, the salary is in coaching.  15 More money is used for double the work than what is given to the children. Well, it is not for the money. Yes, it is not for the money. I also know, then who is there for power and respect? Now tell me, power, respect and money are these three things.  If it is not there, then for whom will we give money, respect is not there, performance is not in your hands, you can never come and say that it did not happen because of me, because actually it is not because of you, there is no power, policy and if something goes wrong.  If the clipping is there, then you don't even care, you don't even know, and half of it is not there, your respect is very pleasant, the rest of the place is also like this, for the one who got trapped on the spot, the police is very helpful.  It becomes a big thing that the one who has gone fancy and whose challan is being deducted, if some scandal is going to happen, then if you get trapped, then even the doctor becomes God, if he has done the same for you and he is the doctor and you have a waiting list, laugh.  That person grows up in me And the small people in the rest of the department are respected a lot, compare them with this, the train that runs is neither in their signal nor in its signal, I don't know how many people's lives are in their hands when they change the track of the train and this  Railways will not even know about this, what do people do in the planes that fly, they have to sit in ATC, the people who give such short 150 planes and different flight levels and give different directions and they stall them in. For landing and so on, you see planes flying and landing in every dead minute, but you don't even know it because they have three nanny's, right now they are making fun of them.  Let's show that he is sitting from behind. In the controlling de lines of so, people, every one literally takes it, it is not on the cusp of it, no one keeps it on a live stick, he is tormented with the comfort of it, he sits and picks up his.  If he does less or does less, then he is not criticized, then this video will be one of the other incidents which is true and all these coaching people who have fooled him because YouTube, social media is a very powerful thing.  This is a very powerful thing, you can influence him in any way and there is no one to do it like this because he will say that he will be on financial YouTube, why should I mess with him, anyone will say, I can also make contacts.  I too have the content of my daughter-in-law, I have the content of astrology, I too have the content of real estate, now tease me AK, there will be a fight here, he said, everyone will share together and eat what is mine, become everyone's guest, whose country it is.  It is free, it is democracy, everyone is sitting openly, tell me, your sweets are useless, my good, your good, you will have to give clarity, all of them here are like side effects, they are also going behind like a rat.  I do n't know when 10 years will pass, I get 25 WhatsApp messages every day, I have been preparing for 12 years, nothing has happened, you Baba, tell me what to do, ask the one who was training you, my  Our brothers were inspiring us for the last 10 years that either I will become a kid, he will do it, and if nothing else happens then there will be experience and then what will happen to him through experience, what will you do after gaining experience.  72 There are many people sitting here, what will you do? Tomorrow is the war. Please, if you do not wake up now, then you will not be a partner in the ecosystem that will create a lot of wealth in 15 years. Whether you get selected or not,  If yes, then it is good if you cool down and reduce your losses in a hurry, but if it continues for 10 to 12 years, then brother will not be part of the story and if mother also goes, which is 0001%. Even then there is no arrow in the pumpkin, despite this D message being made, nothing is happening, the videos will remain like this in the future, if you want, take out the thing inside then tell me the loan and if you want, some officer can also take it. Also tell me, only then Shanti will go to the post, then Google his name and check that he is the right person, first then that right person will say that yes, you are speaking Tiki and people should check themselves, nowadays these people are also like us.  Due to the pressure of the video, you will be on plane B. He has gone to talk about all the coaching staff, thankfully at least one achievement has been achieved by Allah, at least he has now gone to tell his students to look at their plane B also there is a plane too.  If there is no plane then it is not there, if it is not made then what will you become then B. Now look at that saying that if you don't do one then you will be expelled from PCS. Hey brother, in PCS, your question is asked something else, the PCS of Rajasthan is saying wrong.  You will emerge as a local person from Rajasthan. I have read all the exams and have prepared them, that's why I am telling you right now that he will ask for the exam from Rajasthan. The one from Haryana cannot take out the PCS from Gujarat, because he also wants to set his people in the same manner.  Yes, there will be tweet in the paper, what you are studying in UPSC, friend, after reading the pattern of UPSC, if they tell you that you can remove PCS with confidence, not a dog, because PCS people have beaten their fathers to remove them in questions.  If he doesn't know about it, then he might have to pay state tax, so for those suits you will have to study separately, it is not so easy, put South Indians behind and show North Indians ahead, they have kept their local language as compulsory tax in many places.  So there is some mandatory paper or question or its customs, color, tradition, if their questions are asked, my history is so good, but I have also gone and picked up their papers and seen that the story is such a local history, this is what we have never seen.  If you haven't read these kings, then haven't you heard that the people there know about the studies done by their state government, which is their state government board, but I have explained this whole thing in detail, please watch this thing because you can watch even a 40 minute video.  Even if it is, share it and tell someone, brother, you should watch it completely, only then you will get clarity because it is not big to hear the counter perspective in 40 minutes after taking 10 years. Thank you while walking.  very match"

Today I am going to tell you a very deep secret, play with human mind or which is my experience, practical experience of doing so match of consultations, many people say Those days of childhood take a lot of risks and you are like some times. Okay, what was it like in childhood? If you like your childhood very much or would you have done it further that your time has passed.  If you feel very good, then you may be in depression right now. The past should never feel very good. Memory is good. Okay, this is one thing. Bed childhood is one thing. But you have to say that it was the best time.  That one thing must have come, childhood was average, good parents but decent, everything is God, sometimes I used to have teeth, parents used to fight, there were spices like it happens in homes, there was nothing like that I have trauma, there was nothing like that that I knew about  No, how messed up the youth are, I am relieved in this childhood, you have seen that picture, which one was this one with Manjulika, Bulbulayya with Akshay Kumar, the issues of childhood issues are relieved.

Maybe this is happening with your ₹ 700, I have seen many women like this, 65 years of childhood, there is caste in acquaintance, friend circle, relatives, everything is in the form of consultation and I am like yours. 66 Air Road In 12 years, you had happiness, not in between, there was no happiness in 12 years, 13 years, 14 years. What about your 24 years, 30 35 BK, child duty was best before mother, then you have to do something then childhood.  If your present sends this note simple date your future has to be better then your present date should be  The goal of which human beings you strive is, you know butter, peace, clarity, peace, meaning, you tell me when you did not know how big the world was, that period was your best, now you have gained wisdom in life, you have gained money, you also have clarity, you have control.  What control do any child have in the life of 14 years, 12 years, 11 years and 10 years? Parents send money to school, they have to go there, then they wear the clothes given to them and take the food that is prepared for them. She has some control in her life, it's okay, she does n't have to worry too much about Giri, who is worldly, but looking at her life in one way, it is helpless, everything is going according to her parents, today she has relatives.  If you want to go to a wedding, then let the child also go. If you want to go to a party today, then go to a movie. If you want to go to this one, then it means that the mother of the child is not always like this. Okay, sometimes when it is the parents' birthday, then they give something like this, but  The teacher in school is like this, homework has to be done  You will have to study, that is, okay, childhood is this okay but you have to enter it in childhood. According to me, childhood is such a thing if you look at it, especially in teenage years, like you see, there are teeth here, yes there are teeth, sit up and sit as far behind your parents and in the world. No one in your life ever suffers as much as you read in teenage. When you grow up but you are still having a good period, that means you are in a good condition, actually a good condition and you can please change this bad condition.  Accept it, discuss it, discuss it with people, it is very very important India, look at the topic I am running, you are seeing all the unique topics, you will not find the story on the whole YouTube, please, for this it is probably called clapping from 10. Please give likes and please spread awareness in your friend circle. You should also do a little social work and also forward it. It is okay that nowadays you know how the atmosphere is on WhatsApp.  How has it been and how will it be in the future? Moving in these elections, leave that thing behind, don't you, this is a lesser thing, do this also a shortcut, it is yours, which is like this in the family, in childhood, perhaps in the days of your youth, perhaps in the days of your employment, many elderly people are like this.  He is busy in his job Venice is childhood what time and basically was in your past so it is possible date you are 60 years old and no you are saying when  I was 40 when I was there al Adhikari one I by the way fear this is a different syndrome was date and whenever syndrome please uncle ji kindly come out of date you no anchor date your life is very nice today also that you have achieved no interest  No one is listening to what I want you tell the world is and what is me subscribers is this brother nobody is interested what was yours good you have to make your present good and that Smiling will be visible on your face. It will be visible on your face that how is your present now and how is your present now. Your future is formed by your actions. Stay in this paste. Don't be depressed. Never look at old albums. Sometimes look behind photographs and these things.  Don't run behind so much, in making memories in life, we become so much that these are just these happiness, beyond this, I will never be happy again. Take 150 photos now and then keep them, they never develop.  That and then he crushes the phone, crushes the mobile, destroys the hard disk, does not keep a backup, does not have photos. Earlier, we used to take 36 trains and used to take photos and those photos became stories. Today, we are 36000.  Take a photo and we don't see it in reality. A separate video can be made on this also. You have to always remain hopeful for the future and if the present is not good then first of all accept it, right now.  So because sir time, I also don't know the same, but the current fox, keep it now, do n't step, you had good food in lunch, we have to arrange dinner also, dinner is Khichdi, but you are not very antis in Khichdi, but Khichdi. Add a little tadka to it, make it good, take papad, chop some onion, chop green chillies, take some lemon etc. Take one spoon gram of desi dal, then that is khichdi. I am telling you on the basis of example, okay.  Hope you are understanding that khichdi also looks a little good. G caste works hard, first dish was very good, there were many dishes, ok, now you are getting khichdi, ok, so this can also be cherished, date it de most again and again.  I don't need to remember it and that one was good, it was gram, it was that maybe your teeth and teeth will remain the same, okay, so make it exciting in life, make khichdi exciting, maybe in the future, you will get porridge, okay then porridge. Put something interesting in it. Ok and check out its recipe and smile. Ok because this is very important. It is very important to have fun in life. The aim of the channel is that I ask everyone, I am having fun, it is fun, these people are having a lot of fun.  It is said that if you are enjoying your life, if you are having fun, then you are doing something wrong, it is okay because that money should come, the pleasure and enjoyment should not come just from the fact that I am seeing the release, that is dopamine.  Because happiness is your sustainability  It should not be that I drank alcohol and enjoyed it. I drank alcohol and talked to my friends about the pleasure. For that I need alcohol again and it is possible that I may not get both from friends and when I don't get it then my pleasure is a default setting state honey.  You just need to know the things and left and right people are becoming mockers, they are running away, they are getting sad, these things are happening and you are seeing this, there is a joy in it too that you are telling others and  He is still not a mother and he  The idiot is declaring that you don't know anything and you are doing it in his name, then in all these things, next time please, when it comes to childhood, remember this thing and tomorrow's match, this is also a note, best welcome, this should be kept in life.  Live in such a way that the last breath you exhale is your best time, your state of happiness in that time is a constant strike, if you step back then you will not get salvation, then I will be here, I did not go with the ultimate.  When the ultimate is said that brother, this is the best, then there is no need to come again, here this time is saved, I will play the reset game again. Okay, so I am not making this Sangolese formula, I will pay it to youth on clarity.  Because if I go further, then those things will become related to conscious intellect and discretion and they will become a little difficult. Okay, I am a little wary, this is more modern, so I will not talk much about these things, but I definitely gave you a hint. A smile appeared on my face.  Tell me, is it okay and it is like childhood, I hope from you my audience again, childhood is not the best, those who were saying that no, childhood is very best, it was the best, those are the best days, no no, children's.  Time is not wasted. It is okay in the life of a healthy individual. A child's life can't be. B. D. Best time it can be a good time but not. D. Best time. Pest time to aana baccha hai I hope.  You people will agree, I am talking about the best time. Childhood can be a good time and it should also be there. Periods should be ensured that the childhood of their children is not only good but it becomes the best, that is, then their future is over.  Meaning, if what you did i.e. when your parents were living, you were under the control of your parents and the life they were living was the best, when you got the reins of your life, it was not the best, then it means no story.  Is it a failure? Parents as well as you have to understand it like this. Hope you all enjoy such videos and can understand. If you can understand and enjoy then please write one complete word A N K O A. I will not speak code.  If I enjoy, then I tell him that the creator says, yes man, if you understand this and enjoy it, then we will make more, ok, thank you very much."

It is said that the woman turns her relations more towards those who have children, they are more likely to come and go and meet and greet, which is a relief and the one who is at her husband's house is not 100 out of 100 in all the houses. Such stories do happen, so if this is not happening in any house, then you should not spoil it so quickly, it is the base rate effect. For example, if I make a separate video for any advice, then what is there in it that if uncle ji and you ji are okay?  Is it true or ba-ji type or does she not marry those who are her husband's family, but if there are reasons, then I am telling you what the consequences are being borne, even though the Supreme Court has said that women have the right in property, but especially in many houses.  in North India Where women want property, it is okay, then they say, brother, you took it from the Supreme Court, then go and take it from him, what am I saying about this, I am saying that it is good for women to have relationships, one take one, give one, give everything to the brother.  You will get uncle ji, respect is there, there is a relation, otherwise they will all like you, now the property here, I have to come from it, uncle ji, you are who you are and grandfather ji and that property has to be accounted for, here you have made your differences, now the differences are there.  to do  What if there is only one uncle, there is only one person, his heart never beats for his nephew, for his niece, there is no love, there is no respect, there is no respect, then tomorrow it will cost my life to fight for my rights, you understand my point.  What can I tell you, I have been trying to build this relationship from the beginning for years. If you can't make many songs then at least don't get spoiled and these women are doing it and they are not getting any benefit. I am benefiting them because ultimately.  So their relationships are for benefits, disadvantages, benefits and disadvantages. What else are my relationships like? You have maintained them in your home, like maternal grandparents, towards maternal grandparents, towards maternal uncles, my own, my love, love, have you ever got a suit? North Indian, this has been a lot of trouble, I mean you think this is so true, tell me and forward the video, I got a tax suit, sometimes you got 500, 1000, 3000, sometimes I got half a shine, got some. Sometimes I come and get something on Rakshabandhan, this is a normal thing, shouldn't I get blessings? Ask for mangoes and bananas and then see what you get. Here you are here, you mean, you are creating poison type relationships. Women are doing this to women many times. What happens is that I sound anti-women, sometimes I sound a little pro, sometimes I am the last one, I am the mirror of the society and there is no point in mirroring it, here it is clear cut, you come for a walk, talk on the phone, say happy birthday, do this.  Happy Diwali  You see this and especially when people live separately, many times they do not live in a joint family, do they have a job, this is the house of the in-laws in which I have an asset and one brother is reducing where else he is doing the union here and that.  Do not make any effort to come closer, good relationships are formed only when the woman wants, this is also a fact, man cannot decide, he can cry, can show bullying, can shout, can make noise but cannot make noise because the children. Of  There will be an orientation, when the mother will cry in the name of her mother, then the children will not love the grandmother. They will say, 'Grandma has troubled my mother, she must have done the same, I am not saying this is fine but how much has she done? How are you doing, you are my uncle, I am my father, I am telling you that these relationships are from this side, if their elder brother will not talk to them, some will not like him and the relations will go away, should they know that I am of this side that the cost is  See if you have to invest. So why is it made this versus this because then what happens to someone because why does one cry because I do a very deep deep analysis, some woman is 62-63 years old and her husband is gone, right, she is a widow and has a child.  Is she okay or does she have two children and now she is being harassed by her in-laws regarding the property that we are not getting, this is on the face off and is very sympathetic because yes, the woman.  When a woman's husband leaves, the society gives her the property on the default setting that she doesn't have a husband, it's okay, but when you give her the whole and the whole two and the whole two and the whole because that's why this happened, that's why you reached here.  If yes, then I have come to know that Parini is not such an innocent person, I had never thought like this, so today I am telling this to the young women that today Guruji is telling you that maybe after 30 years or 40 years, do not do this. Brijesh I am not this  Why is it that it is very Dhanesh and at all this is not possible many times, it is not possible, there is no divided attitude among sister-in-laws, you are beautiful, I am beautiful, I am from a rich house, you are from a rich house, the attitude is relief, just like there is no divided attitude between saints and sages, you know relationships.  Some people are like this, it's okay, but you can keep a cutie, what is the need to keep enmity, it is necessary to spoil her so much, this is my message to you, now I have never believed that a woman is like me.  She will feel the same in the elders of the family as she will feel in her husband's family. This cannot happen, cannot happen, nor should it happen because it cannot happen. I am not even from this story, but I am from this story. Brother, you told him this.  90 and 200 have been given, the number has been given, please make it 40 here also, make it 40, but don't do 40 on this side because if you do 10, your children will get out, so I don't have anything to do with it, as much as you want from here.  It will take 20-30 more years in India for boys and girls to get equality on default setting. It is not there yet, certainly not in 2023. If there is a married woman of 40 years or 45 years and she has a brother, then you should see and  You are in North Indian setting, it is okay, then you see what is your status, then blindly women are told, in Bihar, eat roti of in-laws' Ganga, make your own tashan and in-laws's gun.  To show this bad attitude, to show Nisha to the in-laws, to control or excess, that too, all politics goes on, but it is dynamic, my father, my brother, I am fine with this, this is yours, ultimately, many people like this.  You will feel sexist further brother, my caste associated with my surname will be caught and pulsed. The Khapa Panchayat person is talking, no, I don't even consider him a big person in the Khap Panchayat, the story is fine, you told him.  But anyway, I am trying to make you understand that it is a 30-35 year journey of money because you don't know where your in- laws were going, when the highway was built from where, where the value of which land went, which acquisition.  I do n't know where the life will be, whatever story it may be, you were not giving them the feeling of two, then look if not when not ready without you, not ready in the consequences consequences, then it has to happen if  The problem is that when I was young, I became a hero a lot, then keep being so, then say that brother, we are the kings and in reality, my father is the king of the royal family, the king is our family, so I am nothing, then be very clear, don't cry, then 62.  Do n't show sympathy again at the age of 63, because what have you done for 35 years, you will have to suffer that, then whatever the court does, keep fighting for 20 more years because the decision is here.  Do you know how it is in India and then whether your children will get married or not because at home, uncle, you have to go to the court, there are issues in the marriage of children there, you know India, many people want to get their children married.  If we do so, then how will the court be held so that it does not happen to the next one, because that person will be considered bigger. When how are courts run between brothers? How are courts run between brothers and sisters? That thing will be considered bigger because why is that thing considered bigger?  What is his logic? His logic is that  Friend, these people have no shame in fighting among themselves in the court, due to blood relations, our guests will also go to area 498, which area is this, because what shame do they have, they have the number of a lawyer, they will fight against us in 2 minutes.  Will give money whenever it is not our own, then that thing is very serious. In marriage, in India, the first thing that is seen is that it is divided among themselves, where will they earn from us, there are so many lies of brothers in the house. Rakhi is not even a matter of sister-in-law or brother-sister-in-law, because some fights do happen but they remain within the family, until the society did not find out, everything is okay, but when there is a caste in the society, please find out a little.  Do the same among yourselves, even if you are adopting a surname, even if you are not adopting it, you are a member of his family, your children have some similarity with that family, you may understand it as kingdom type or whatever.  Chotusa, whatever is his account will be there because when that pumpkin will be cut and not distributed properly, then he will cry a lot, either check that there is no pumpkin, then we pamper him, he is poor, then it is okay, then it is okay, then advice.  K will not give you always something, my friend, it is the knight of humanity, this much means okay, this is the scale, this pan will remain heavy in your family, everyone understands that you are a husband and if 2 K is inserted here, then  Here, add 1 a, that's all I am of, I am not of this, that by picking up the celebrity, it is happening in two and then when tragedy hits, it happens in the homes, I have seen the girl's brothers helping so much.  Don't do it, it is a fact, if you want to write the story in capital letters then write it because it will come into the society and will be spoken by mouth, don't take further blood relations because when you talk like this, you run the rescue just like anything, nowadays children are very mean.  please sort it out quickly Because yes society is modern, society is modern when scandals happen, society goes on the old route, it is your society that changes night after night, if something goes wrong in life, then it becomes very rude, suddenly it is like this. Very stylish one, then understand this how good relations are with your husband's family if you can't have good relations, have functional relations, what is functional relation, Namaste ji, Namaste dear Panaji.  Happy Birthday, yes yes, it is a functional relationship, it is okay brother, if there is some conversation, then that too can be done tomorrow, you too can do it tomorrow, there is no loyalty but there is a relationship, do not break the relationship in this D message, I hope I have been clear in understanding this.  It is okay for the people, please share this thing, these issues are happening and the men who have two wives who are looking after their wives, please because the mistake is being made by you and in how many houses it happened, see now the big people.  Check yourself, what did your mother say and how are your current relations? There is a fact from father's family that many people are estranged. How many people identify with you? Please tell me. Thank you."

    "content": "Hello friends, this is a very special video with a special message, you are the young mother out there, I have a very big audience, the name of the youth channel is on Clarity and normally Kaif, many times I make the boys angry because they feel  He is a big feminist, talks about women, today I am going to tell you a truth and this is a huge deficiency in your young mothers, there is no one to guide them, so today watch this video.  It will not be very long to watch but it will change your perspective of the story. Listen carefully every parent because it is for men only, it is for boys only, but if you are a woman listening then also listen to what Guruji is going to tell the boys in the story.  If you are not telling anything like this then it is okay to comment. Mothers are watching, women are watching, girls are watching, I am almost watching and if elders are also watching then tell your children also. I am going to tell you about these things.  It is important to listen carefully. Father, every wife needs a strong husband. Mother does not have a choice other than being strong. This is in the pursuit of equality. Women are ahead in competition. They should have the right. Those who are in the world are out there and women are not equal in this.  I will not say that you are good or women are good, it will not be discussed that I and women are different understand the world and no one can.  No they are not different they are different and they bill not get in here batting in you I am very troubled because of butter my wife will be yours if I am there then tell me who wants to marry Anam no matter what  Anyhow, anyhow, I import from Everybody Wants Every Girl Bill, so this is a big big difference, there is a very big difference, in the second thing I want to tell, this thing is not a story, people know that my  To show strength, what mistake are you making now and what is that one emotion which is missing a lot in the youth now, I will tell you about that also, so stay connected, I am not going to make a very long video, but listen to it carefully, it is a very deep thing, men.  She knows that I have to remain strong, it is okay, her concept seems to be that it is right to insult women and sarees are useless, this will also happen in the western world, it will happen in India, but now no one has seen her like this.  So, if there is such a big sample in it, take this sample only and take it as the truth, then I cannot explain it to you guys in the audience, but what is wrong, now listen carefully, strength, the man wants to show that he is strong.  I am but never show is not explained in Hindi date strength notes also son if your showing strength it is not strength strength is felt heavy lagin repeat strength is felt  Bye de wife strength of character preservation He is seeing what the youngsters are doing, these songs are coming in badi-badi gaadi mein chal aur yudi songs aaye hai bhai tera dollar ki gaadi hai yeh woh aise karke kuch nahi strength nahi hai No, it's all nonsense, they bring the car on hire or for 20-30 days, look at the registration number, there is nothing, they have good Puri show and they have relaxation in it.  I have done this that we will become stronger, we will write something on it, 50 boys are running around, so just by adding two leaders in it, it became like this, they did not make anything of their own, they also made some songs of their own strength, this is very great.  And it is visible like this, you are also seeing it on social media and there are a lot of them, they do not have any strength, this is not that being strong can be if it has glasses, woman has the strength of a woman, other regions on the highway headache, you can understand.  What are all the reasons of a man, I am not in the mood today, I will not earn money, an auto rickshaw driver, I will not go to the doctor, he does not know that he will not get money, even a laborer cannot speak, you do less in IT, we do something else, you are more unwell.  You men can't do this, you wish for money, women every day, power to go that I am going like this, I am going like this, mine is that, mine is this, men do not have a choice, now if you are born a man then learn to live it.  Don't run, don't cry, I will teach him a lesson, I will teach this, I will teach him, being a man is a lot of responsibility. Running has not been given as much as others and is being given now and will be given in future. Ladies, do not put one thing in competition. One thing is very good.  You have to understand that you are different and money, you will have to wish and woman bill always want you my up d social channel social letter you are here then this woman you should do mine that you want to do it, you should not do it then cry  Don't If you don't like this one, then increase your level. In the process of increasing the level, the train is also a Chhath caste. Remember this too, the level kept increasing, till the age of 33-34 years, all those girls who were fine went away.  Same thing is happening with Airtel too, I will tell a separate topic for them sometime. This one is for men in messaging. Sometimes you just get the one. I go with you when you are Airtel don't. Livers become successful, this also used to happen for the second one, if you come from contribution also, then that girl will be more joyful for you and in that, if you reach a higher level and go a little further down, then again every man comes because every man hits the pick sometimes or the other. After that it comes down a little, it will not make much difference to the woman, but if you think of changing the pick again, then it has come as per the PK and is the same high value mother always flowers in the relationship become richer and her  Attract on the basis of money. Attract on the basis of money. In your fortis, that relationship does not last because those women came into your life always for money. Women are always there. We will know on the next episode or if you want what is this high value woman, this is such a woman.  Who is she and you have to go after a high value woman? How will you define her? What will happen and whom should you marry? I will keep adding it in my videos. It is a very big subject, there can be 25 videos in it. So today there is one emotion that I had to tell you guys and that emotion is locking inside the war and boys have that emotion, yes, can you gas, is n't that strength, is there anything else, can you gas?  So pause, if something gets right then be very happy, don't cheat because I will tell you in 15 to 10 seconds, pause now, what is the one thing missing in boys? What is the thing in young boys?  What is missing in today's family and what should not happen is that you write down that you have attended and I will tell you after seeing that you do not have the power in you. All these things that I see today are the lamps that have passed on me or the lamps that are about to be extinguished.  The finished lamps are visible. I also reduce the amount of oil. Motivation is a different thing. This motivation is not motivation. There is clarity here. You are clearly told that you are not motivated. 84 lakh children have been born. Birth is achieved after vaginas. Okay, now I will not make astrology, but if you look at it anyway, you are a winner anyway. There is no need for any motivation for this. If a human being is born then there is no need for more motivation than this to eliminate everything.  For this, I stay for the parents of the previous generation, if you catch a child of any four-five-seven years of age, there is a lot of GST, drive them away here, don't do this, don't do that, don't do that, this is not right, that is not right, don't do this, this  What will happen, what will become, this will happen, while doing this for 20 years, everything is taken away, there is no life on the face, they live for two-three years, what were they doing for three-four years, after that you will ask what should I do, should I look for a job again?  I should apply, you many people tell me you tell me there is a lot to do but he won't find you sexy because you want something sexy and he eats his momos, drinks tea and whatever is ok so I hope Bill Wickham more you find a date  I am finding a new channel of mine, if you guys have not subscribed then please do Guruji from Gurugram, it is a very good channel and the response is new, there are some channels, subscribe, find them or I will try to put them in the link. Story.  If you see it then do it, otherwise find it. Guruji from Gurugram is great, it is good, different topics have flavours, if you have n't done it yet then do request me, that means if this is the one then it is different flavours.  You should be excited about something, there is something to be done, there is something to be done, you will make a face like Suman, just about things which will take you to place in life, the more you have the ability to add value to the lives of others, the more money and recognition you get.  You do n't want to hang on to anyone, you should have the ability to add value. Like the share video.

    "title": "What Is The Single Most Important Thing We Need To Protect As Society ？ [Kbl-uE-Gqt0].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, what is the single most important think which you need to protest, I am giving clarity to the war from among you, this clarity should spread all over India, it is very pragmatic, very good video, it is going to be a good video and you must watch this one.  I have to share some videos, don't do it and do it. How much do you agree? You enjoyed it, you liked it, you got clarity. Please do mention it if you see an attack in the society today.  If you look at the Indian society and the Indian system, what is happening? This has happened in the West also and their Raita has failed. Now that thing is coming here and I will tell you very clearly what that one thing is.  If you can do gas then you can still write what we have to protest which is in our hands, for this we should not depend on anyone, neither on the government nor on any external thing, we have to depend only on ourselves. If you are today If you look carefully, this is extreme  Feminism, this is something ingrained, you know, the youngster would know everything, I demand that the movement has launched a huge attack on the institution of marriage within the society, first it was from the country, India, Pakistan, then Thai, it is from both.  Okay, then divide in the name of religion, after that in your community, divide on caste, you know, political party has grown, power has come, power is caste ever since it came.  You already know that politics after Mandal Commission. Okay, so divide on country, divide on religion, divide on community, cast etc., after that, now the most dangerous thing was that, but this one is the most dangerous, divide on gender, boy, girl, man.  And woman, man, woman, boy, girl, by girl will do area 498. Hey, this marriage should not be done, no, what is the benefit of doing this, tell me, when the most important thing for you is your family, which you should produce.  It comes out of the institution of the family. It's okay, until the family is broken, nothing can be taken out of you. There is some institution of elderly women, you tell me which one, until those elderly women are disillusioned.  Well, till then we cannot invite them to their family, where they are theirs, then by inviting them there, slowly and gradually, they get everyone accepted there because it is a decision-making woman who has to be separated from the family. So called respect, relevance and all those feelings are not available. If his heart gets broken then first break that heart. Many have been targeted in the war. What have your parents achieved? Parents do not let you live inside the house, so what now?  If you do, then you should remove them from the family, the family itself has to understand that to remove you, there are many people who are sitting aside to instigate the children in order to remove the woman who is the elder of the house, all these are meant to instigate the men. Corporate command is also successful till the end, corner office, come on get de promotion, come tu de, those who are engaged in their own, are struggling with midlife crisis, keep taking the money, are withdrawing money on Harley Davidson, will do something for the public, so that you can do something for yourself.  It's okay to have fun, mom, you are enjoying yourself, the children will use their conscious mind and discretion, all of you, don't marry, we have to live our own life, we have freedom. The boy says that if we get married, then it is 498. The girl says, \"I am.\"  If I go then I am bound to be tortured. Hey, someone is having fun in this society, this is what I am telling you, there is some party who is having fun and everyone is making everyone an expert. Okay, so brother, there must be someone like that. Yes I am D King, I am having fun, everyone has come to rule the family by breaking the family, because where the family was doing well, I will tell the reason for the importance of the family and you guys tell me that you  Whether you understand this thing properly or not, it is going to be a very deep thing. Chapati is living in a normal healthy family where the relationship with your wife is fine, with the parents it is fine. I want to tell you to always stay close to the parents so that it is clear.  It doesn't go away and then after a while they go away, so when your father, mother and wife are nearby, then you go to make stupid investments. Someone wants to take money from you in anything.  If there is guidance, then the guiding force is the wife, who can easily tell, why is the wife so important? Why is the husband important in the life of the wife, because if someone else is making a hole in the boat, then he will also drown.  So the screen is in this game, that partnership is not yours with anyone, when I am a mother, I am like this because I am a family mother, after 5 years, India bill no me is very popular today, I can be a family mother of India.  The government should also give me an award, although I am not greedy to take awards, but I am telling you my potential, my variety comes from, it is okay and what I want you to create, it is okay, no one in the family is talking about it in India because they  It is like at Breakfast King, if you don't call him King, then there is that conflict between them and who will eat all those flakes? The Englishman told everyone to eat this normal food as well.  If you take this from them, then all this is because of caste, why is the family broken, because if you want to take me under your wing, then first of all you will have to cut off your connections, if you want to make me a cult or make money for yourself.  Or if I have to do something, then I say here, I am a consultant, I am late, I have money in the membership of my channel, I am not a charity, I am not late, my purpose is also very noble and good.  I alone am enough in that and if I need support in that, I will take the money, but I will take it from the South, I will not show it for any great social purpose, only then that thing will happen, but what many people have done is to make it such a system.  If any human advice takes you away from your family, then your enemy should stand up and if any man tells you to stay away from your parents, you too should not ask to live together.  No, I want to stay close so that  To stay close to everyone, the country gets clouded, they go to Canada or to Bengaluru. I have seen devotees going to North India under the pressure of their parents. In Bengaluru, your daughter-in-law suddenly gets a job. In Bengaluru, you get a job and then go away quietly.  If so, he is not like that, he does not want to be with you, that is why I say that staying close does not take me away from the family. The one who takes you away from the family is the villain of your life and should be the one who takes you away from your wife, away from your children.  go or many  Why should you have children? Because if you don't do this then only you will get money and freedom. Money is useful for me. Do n't get married. Don't have children. If you have ₹ 2 lakh, then what should you do? Put it in a mutual fund, it will serve you in old age, children.  What does one do, what is the right thing to do, there is no greater experience than that, how many places, take a push, story, photo, got a life partner, this is not the only happiness, apart from that, there is a lot of peace, brother, who has not got that happiness like me, he is a bachelor.  was also like me  So, if you are married then I can bat from both the sides, only the one who has eaten Gulab Jamun and Rasgulla can tell, now the one who sits only on Gulab Jamun and Rasgulla is like this, brother, you are sitting after eating, okay here.  There were also here also Nobody can get married without being bachelors 2018 Why how many vowels were there in it and how many tastes were there after that The problem is that the person who gets married does not tell whose  You are doing a little well or are you having a lot of fun? Only the ones with problems have been found out. The good ones have not been found out. Now your divorce is going on in the court, only then the world is coming to know that the marriage is not going well.  The one who is doing well is going to court and giving affiliates. I am enjoying a lot. Please count me till date. Very satisfied user. They say this, they give testimonials, so testimonials are not given.  The family is being broken. You can break the impotence of the family. You can make your country a cloud. Neither the public is changing nor the public is yours. How many crores of Indians have gone. The country is going to be clouded. Religion is in danger. Even after doing this, he is going to tell you how he is involved in politics, vote bank politics and what you see. Hey family is in danger, brother, this religion has been going on for 15000 years. You will continue to move forward, you are the sky, your family, Waluj, family and life are in danger, nothing is happening to the country, that too for thousands of years, it will remain like this, nothing is happening there too, no one is coming to tell the family because there is no benefit. Everyone benefits only by breaking the family. Take politics, take politicians, no matter which element of the society you take. When the family stands apart from the caste, then the diseases of a person are reduced. If there is an illness, someone is going to take care of it, do something for yourself. Mother tries to take care of practical things for herself, should I build a house and live in the house, if all that is not there, then roam around, then enjoy, then spend, slave of a very good room, slave, twelve, your Ramzan is coming out, then 20,000 dogs, 40 dogs, 50 dogs and then there are more.  If you don't get it then you will keep wandering in the forests and mountains and then in old age you will need treatment and everything. I am telling this to the bachelors on the institution of family.  It is an attack, you have to save your family only, it is the single most reason, Sir, the country is like India, isn't India 140 crore people, not 140 crore, and 20 crore big families, 35 crore small families, if all the families take care of their own, then that of the country. GDP growth should be 11%, power is fighting among themselves, in the society, it means at home, people are not understanding what is happening and outside they are pampering to save. That I will fight him here, I will fight him here, that division is very widespread, my only hope is that you give clarity on this, if there is no clarity on the war itself, because the youth is more troubled, what I have seen is that when my parents did this, then there is no happiness, then sometimes.  People attack marriage, but instead of putting more effort and love into it, instead of giving more love and effort to the opposite gender, which is for the husband, for the wife, you are running away from it and putting in that much effort.  If  If you follow him then life will be blessed. Relationships are sweet in a family like yours, where even one person is going to talk wisely. In any family, five is 10. Whatever is big, one person is enough. One person is enough. One person is enough.  Even if this is enough, one thing happens in life and it becomes fun to sit with each other, eat pakodas, talk, go, we get safety because the family stands together, we have seen even in Covid, when people raised all their hands.  Are So family lives and protection in this world Harpita should take responsibility of her family and stop this disintegration where it is happening and should stand up and not let it happen, if she who is your woman continues to get angry then she should  In the institution where they are just telling you some stories, the woman has to stop them, you have to speak, brother, we will listen, we have tortured you a lot, you have done good work at home, we have  We did not give value, we did not give respect, forgive us, please leave us now, do not talk to those who are not speaking, everyone is speaking selfishly, some are acting in their own way, because influence is being done in this way, everyone is being influenced.

Then remove the wife because no mother can live without children. If her children move here and there, then she has nothing to do with her husband. The husband did not give her any such happiness for 40 years.  She is going to the wedding again with her story.

    "title": "What To Do If You Do Not Get Credit At Workplace ？ [odyJX7w4Glo].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, this question is asked to me a lot and this question is a major reason for workplace stress that you do not get credit for the work you do, in fact someone steals the credit from you and your ideas are stolen.  Or you are not getting that much respect or you are not able to increase your stress that much and someone else is taking the fun. How many people are there in your life who have been like me and you have identified that this is happening to you for many years.  It has happened while working and this is what you are feeling so I will try to answer that if it is so then the reason for this is one thing that you are intelligent definitely you are intelligent and you think that you are intelligent only then  You feel as if someone has taken away something from you and you were due something and you should have got it and you did not get it. Otherwise, there is no reason if you are worthless, nothing happens to you, you don't have anything.  If you don't have real talent, not skill set, then you wo n't have this complaint, because there are only such people who are trying to move ahead with you. So brothers and sisters, listen, what to do if you are actually so talented?  If you are good then you have to start private work in your life silently on pilot base project basis and if you are so good then leave this job and start doing your own work and if you cannot do it then you were not good before. This place you  There was a misconception that you are good because what you are good is in an organization setup where there are many platforms mixed, a lot of cooked food is mixed, it is something like that you have become a great chef or someone has chopped the vegetables.  The menu has been placed, someone has made all the orders, someone has brought the food, the client is sitting to eat, the customer is sitting, he has brought something else, the branding has been done by someone, the marketing has been done by someone, you have come like a lot of snakes.  You are adding some spice and guiding a young one that yes, do it like this and then you will feel that this is a very great masala recipe that I have posted, because of this, I am a great chef and I should be respected a lot, this is going to be appreciated by many people. You have a misconception that you are just a spoke in the wheel. You are not the hub. Most like, first of all, remove your misconception that you are very good. If you were very good, you would get respect.  Had you been indispensable, you would have been getting it. You would have been getting it. You would have disappeared, you would have disappeared, you would have left the job, you would have been replaced by something bigger and even better at a lesser cost. Many people have misconceptions, that is why people do not say this.  They keep asking, the subconscious mind inside knows, look, people will come and think that friend, you were the one who was going to give us motivation and were the one who was going to heal our wounds, if anyone has written the ID then he is here.  Kured Ra is humiliating us, what is this channel, I will unsubscribe, no no no, don't unsubscribe, I am the only one giving clarity, I am a mirror, my face is not looking good in the mirror, so I will have to look at my face a little, right?  If there is dust on the face, then the dust on the face will have to be cleaned. The mirror is already clean. How long will it take you to clean the mirror? What will be the benefit of breaking the mirror? Some people are always asking me this. I should leave the job, I should leave the job, I want to do something for myself, then it means that there is a problem in the job and somewhere there is some confidence that yes, I am capable of doing something, these are two things, only then a person wants to leave the job, which  There is no problem in the job, who knows that brother, I have got this job with great difficulty, I am making a living, there is nothing in my control, he is happy in the job, the one who thinks that he doesn't know anything much. in me  There is not much talent and that too is going on in the job. The problem is with those people who want something in the job but are not getting it and there may be some misconception or there may be a right understanding but I am saying that if you really want it then  Right, if you actually have talent then you will leave. Ask the very fact. I ask you this question that if I leave the job, I always say this thing. Lovers are never afraid. Those who are afraid do not love, similarly those who leave their jobs never ask, those who ask do not leave their jobs because you think you are good, you are there but you still can't manage because I told you, you know how to add spice, right?  If you bring the spices here, you will get the precious spices. You can leave one job and do another job because the whole system is 360 degree system, bringing the product to the customer, telling the product, managing everything yourself and  Giving it and earning money and taking it in the bank, earning profit is not easy making platform is not easy a dozen also means that it is not possible and it is very difficult but then you have to have your this one should be wise not yes I  I want to do it but it's not like I know everything, so who knows how to interact with those people, take consultation, find out, meet those people, check. It is never easy to make a team, just like it is not easy for your boss to make you work, similarly it is not going to be easy for you and yet your boss has still got talent like you because he is in an institution space, he has money.  The ability to give is very high but if you don't even have that then you will get people like this, it is not possible to get work done from them and the children of Janji who are coming now is a dreamy idea in itself.  They will give you 100 reasons why they do n't want to do any work, what will be the benefit to them, why are they doing it boss, they are not getting any salary, no no, you do it quietly, don't put your mind to it, I will not make any effort to start up.  People 's hair has been torn out, it has flown, it does not turn white, they just leave, this is the condition they have become after doing the work of poor startup people, it means that they have something different, it is cool, I like it very much, Generation, that is a different thing, okay?  I will make a video on this also sometime, I like it very much, it's okay, but brother, this is not fit for the kind of work we do, so whenever you are feeling that you are not being respected, then don't be too sad.  No one is being respected, someone is taking the credit for knowledge, then if it was your knowledge credit, then your boss is not so stupid that he does not know, sit down and talk to him, friend, he is taking my credit.  My  There is a lot of pain in my heart, I do not intend to work, then it is possible that you may be told that the amount of credit you were thinking is not available in that situation and someone should explain to you and also your misunderstanding.  Go away because in many cases I also see that you remain in your mind that I did not get the credit even though it was not yours but you thought it was yours. Now what should be the treatment for this because tell this thing to your boss and that way you  Will get a feedback you  You will come to know that your boss does n't like you and you don't have much future, so kick the hell out of such a job, you have taken a few rounds here, you leave after taking a few rounds, these days people leave marriages early, wives leave early.  They give, husband leaves early, keeps asking while leaving the job, brother, the wife was not asking that much before leaving as much as she is asking for the job, then the reason you see is that there is a mismatch in yours.  Desires What you want to be and what you know It is the same dialogue that comes to mind again and again. Your body is writing checks that your body cannot cash. Your ego is writing checks that your body does not have the capacity to cash.  If you want to encash, then please, as many people are feeling like this, first of all take an audit of yourself. If you feel like this, then I am very good.  And it is good on a consistent basis and I am not getting much value, then what is the compulsion that you have to work there? Even if you are not able to do your work then at least leave that job. This is the biggest reason for leaving the job.  If you are not getting credit then it is due for a long time, it is possible that one or two such situations may arise in two-three months but you should cross verify it with the boss."

    "title": "What To Do If Your Own Family Members Criticise You ？ [VH99HBgfyKw].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, it is a very practically relevant topic of today's time. There is a lot of clarity for the war. If you are a parent yourself then listen to it because it affects you too because you will emerge as the character in this video and the direct youth is 15-20 35.  The name of the year's please listen topic is what do you do if you are on family criticizes you on a constant basis and you face a lot of criticism. This is happening a lot in this family and many people are worried about it, so I will try to give some clarity on this. Okay, you have to see if criticism is happening with you and if you are a parent then also you should listen.  If both of you get some benefits then just see where this criticism is coming from. Is your choice of subject being criticized? Is your job being criticized? Is your boy or girl being criticized?  What is being criticized about who will choose for marriage? Is your daily routine from the time you wake up till you go to sleep at night and the way you like semen, what is being criticized is it coming from a genuine concern of the parents or science.  Parents, they don't know what you are doing, it is not correct, it is not wrong, it is absolutely right, you have to see what should I do, what should I do, do anything, you have to look simple, I have a lot Cases come for consultation that yes parents do like this, they do like that, they are very upset, we don't understand this, we are treated like this, they do like this, age is so fast, 24 graduations are over, it's ok, we have been facing such pressure for last 2 years.  If you are not doing anything, then I say, friend, why are you in so much trouble, why do you live in your parents' house, then you are completely silent, what is your sense of entitlement? If the talk is giving good results, you will have to say clearly that you  You will feed, feed, give birth to children, see, your duty is till 21 years, do 12th till 18 years, do graduation till 21 years, spend 22 more years, do competition or some exams etc. after that it is not your duty, after that it is a favor, you should also do a favor, children.  But the child who seems to be the one who wakes up in the morning, the child who does not wake up on time in the morning, who does not have a daily routine, who has only direct friends, then when  If you are facing criticism, then check the quality of your friends. Are they good friends or are those friends with whom you can move ahead in life by doing some education or doing some small business? Are there any friends with positive influence? Parents have full right, full right hand is theirs, it is not about criticism, where it is not cutting date, we are called aage un parent, tu ek stage pe karni padegi aapko bol bhai tu  Rent a room and go. If you don't have the money to pay that rent, then at least take it from us. We will do some bathing, cleaning, cleaning, eating and drinking in our house, so how to do it now, I mean, now I can't say.  That I will not give you bread, then you said it yourself or I will not wear your simple clothes because it seems to him that she will pick it up and put it in the washing machine, so if you look at the criticism here, where are you coming from, if the criticism is new. Due to the generation not knowing about the new things from their parents, they are trying to get into new jobs and they are trying to do well but the previous generation has taken the things which you have understood you.  The child is doing this, what is the source of knowledge and whom is he seeing? Do you understand his language and his aspirations and what he is doing? Try to understand.  If you want or you have made your own name plate, if any relative or child of your brother-in-law, brother-in-law, uncle is doing this, then you should also do the same to him and he had done this at least 6 years ago, on this day, every year, 12  The market place is changing very visibly in a month and in 6 months, the market is changing so dynamically that perhaps you such a parent does not know what is happening, well he knows what is happening to the next generation but what to do.  If they don't know, then this is a tricky situation where the whole family will have to come to terms, they cannot criticize each other. Look, the children who are becoming completely useless and are hanging around, then they need visual treatment. This is the American treatment of the parents. No, they pass out in 15, 16 and 17, then they keep taking education loans and stay outside, we have made you till 23, so make the cut off lower than 23.  At the age of less than 23 years, if the child is unruly and doesn't do anything, and you don't feel that he is going to do anything, then first of all get him out of the house. Even after leaving the house, you yourself are free, you yourself are suffering at home too.  He is good for your health and for him and if you have this brother who knows what will happen and what he will do, then you will see him getting ruined in front of you too. There is a chance that if the situation gets his way then you have it's very Indian parents.  Of Did a lot of tricks because ours actually beats us for a long time. This is not the same but you have the gift system for the children and if the parents are criticizing the things which they are not able to understand then please try to understand them, this is how the job is.  This is the future in this, this is how growth can happen in this, this is my plan, this is the message, I am thinking, I need your help here, you will understand communication, but understand that and parents also need your  Are you getting tension that what do you mean by your source of wisdom, where is the copy coming from? For you, you criticize this. If you are finding it too burdensome, then tell me in clear cut, you live in the house, I die every day.  Or if there is a need, tell me brother, we can't raise you, we don't have you in our life because I have seen that the heart keeps beating like a man, the father gets eliminated a lot for the child and the father becomes such a villain. That boys are special, girls have a slightly different system in India, that's why I am not giving the example of many girls, but this happens to boys, the father becomes their enemy and that is very bad for me because the father has very genuine concerns.  Yes, but he is not able to tell and explain and his manner ranges from rudeness to ignorance. Dad, if it is okay, then the same dad is listening. If you are listening, you can send the video to each other. Depending on, then you have updated.  On what is happening you just can't dissonance person child like you do it see it do it yourself without if you have not told him anything you have told him everything you have done everything he is the one who is useless some new which are rare cases such children are  But it is 5%, which means they may not have clarity in anything or they may not know what to do or above, please open, you are listening, you have some good suggestion, brother, do it like this, please open, you are fine.  If you have any, then please think about these things which I have told in this video, please write on the comment section and communicate with some love and love, then this is the best way with this family date, this is the largest thank you."

    "title": "What To Do If Your Parents Keep Fighting ？ Clarity For Youth [daeQwjG9CNA].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today I am going to give clarity to the youth on one such thing due to which the youth is very confused and troubled, especially the young couples or young even unmarried children who are adults, that is what to do if your parents are fighting constantly.  Parents are not your young parents. Your father has retired at the age of 60 and he keeps fighting. Your father said this.  Look at what you have seen, they keep inviting you to the Panchayat, whatever is happening with everyone today, because I am the number one consultant because I am the number one consultant, there are paid consultations on all these issues but some ideas are available for free.  I also have to tell that I cannot pay for everyone, so it is very important that I am telling the pain of my paid consultation to the society, so please share this video, everyone share. Do it, watch it, put it on groups, they will also understand that you cannot talk to parents, if not then the parents themselves are watching this video, then they themselves will get something but I am putting it on Clarity for Youth because whose pain is this?  The youth is getting it, the youngsters are getting it. Who are the parents? So let's start. You have to see if your father is the mother's endless fight and he grows up once the father  They retire and are in their early 60s, that is because they both have many unresolved issues among themselves, both of them lived a long life, in that life, father was busy in work, mother was busy in raising children at home, so life  A lot of things were going wrong from father's side as well, it was being a brush side, mother was also there and sometimes if you remember your childhood, her frustration used to come out on you that you did not study.  Kari, you are fighting because of you, what will you become? Because of you, we are in tension. Many parents brush off the fights in their relationship like this and show it to the next generation. And in many cases, what happens if one of the spouses  Or if the parents, father or mother, are more domineering type or narcissistic type, then the other person plays the victim a lot and you feel like a victim, but it is not necessary that he is there, it is that pain in front of you.  No one will ever know in life what is the actual issue of my wife, only the couple knows what the actual issues are, but I want to tell you what happens in many cases when the daughter-in-law comes.  So it turns out that this is also one thing that she has come, now she is not giving us happiness, in many cases the daughter-in-law also runs away, the husband also goes away, the son also goes away but phone calls come from far away, today are you ever feeling well?  If you call your mother to ask, you will feel sad for your father. If you call your father, you will feel sad for your mother. You are not getting the happiness of realizing that your parents are living well and they are your youngsters in your life.  You have so many troubles, if this is happening in your life and you have to hear this continuously again and again, then you have to say one thing clearly to your parents, you ca n't bear it, then get a divorce from both of you, now what will you say?  They  If you speak in the same way, then what nonsense do you do now, get divorced, take it, leave your panda, leave you, every time they fight and they tell you, tell your mother, momma, leave put, I give the lawyer's number, leave the father or the father.  Tell them not to leave you because when they drink tea comfortably, they bring vegetables, father and mother are still cooking, your wife does not cook, you in 20-30.  Your mother is a man, she is doing all the work of her husband, everything is happening to him, first class is going well but still you are crying, nothing is happening in your life and you have become his Panchayat.  If you think that I will resolve the issue, your own issues are arising, then the biggest thing is to see whether it is appropriate to expect that the child will resolve it as a child as a child. Next Generation as a Youngster as a Child is not your responsibility. Tell the parents that brother, take separate rooms. If you can't get separate rooms, then take separate floors or separate. Never offer one to the parent.  Those who make a lot of mistakes, two fighting parents, the mother feels like this, the mother feels like a victim, the heart beats a lot and someone calls mom, your life will become hell, you will not know further, do n't invite me to your house.  Take two, fight and say, both are equal, both come, both stay, eat and drink, I will not do this with one, and tell mom, this is my father, you don't like it, no problem, I like it very much, and tell this to father also.  This is your wife, you may not like it but I like it very much, this is something that you people have to do and basically this is the poison of parents' anger, the poison that is coming out, this is not to be turned on youngsters. And you don't want to drink, you have to refuse because it can never be resolved because it has been created. In the 35 years of your married life, your father met his mother and what torture should he do to your mother 33 years ago?  You can't do that, they happened and what expectations did your mother have, what didn't happen or what atrocities she committed, that's for them to resolve. You can't go there and do anything, many children take the side of one parent and become enemies of the other. What happens many times is that parents fight, one fights, the other fights, one says something, then both become one, in the same way no one should be involved in the fight between mother and wife, this is what I am giving open knowledge to the world. Yes, it is a different matter if there is a scuffle and bloodshed and police work is done, then we have to come and do it like the society, but other than this, there is no need to enter, say brother, move away, move away, someone should fight, move away.  If no one fights, then everything will not be like this by force. When sides are taken then the other's pain gets relieved. Say brother, resolve yourself friend. If it doesn't happen then we are not in our control. 50 mistakes in our life that the youngsters have to tell.  This and say, 'Mummy or whoever is Papa, whenever we call you and you take this and sit down, we give you a solution. Many times mummy says this somewhere.  I don't take him, I get trapped, I don't go, this is nothing, do n't say, take a driver, you don't need a driver, because then how will you be happy if the driver takes you somewhere, if your work is done, then why did you cry, the main job is to cry because old age has come.  You have to pay attention to your children, there is nothing to do in life except fighting. Earlier, in the name of children, the pot used to burst because of you, then if the daughter-in-law will be with you in the marriage or in the houses where she lives, then it bursts because of you.  If not because of this then we  So the elders live great, that sister has also gone, the son has also gone or the daughter is not coming or the son-in-law is not there, you are living alone, if you are living alone then brother, you will have to live with him, you will have to survive with food otherwise see.  If you meet someone new at this age and stage, then see, there is no use in crying, tell this to your parents and give a message to your parents that you give this money to your life because what do you show to your parents that we are more important than our parents?  Why don't they even spend time?  I do n't know how many years we have to live and then they show that we will give you the money and since we are not able to spend this money, due to this we are feeling miserable in our life, so you will have to listen to the pain of this misery on the call.  So tell him right there that brother, it is your money, hire a driver, hire a cook, hire a masseur, hire a nurse, go to the doctor and sell that plot also, get an FD made for it and own it and so on until it is finished, and absolutely.  not be zero  Till then do n't tell us because sometimes parents can ruin your life from 25 years to 45 years to 50 years because when they were 50 years old, you were 25 years old and they were 50 years old.  You are 25, suppose they have started the program, they are not going anywhere, they are definitely getting old, it seems that they will go away, they are worried, you say this and every time the parents cry, how many are we? These are just a few days, many parents turn 40 years old, many parents turn 53 to 93 and the child they have, the one they have at 30 or 25, the one at 65, so it is clear.  Our clear message right now is that I am not saying this to disrespect, this disrespect is nothing, avoiding bitterness, avoiding bitterness is not another, I am not teaching anything wrong, I said.  You are teaching bullying, not teaching to respect the parents, those who keep fighting among themselves, who will respect them after a stage, this is also a fact, people don't do that, the wife does not respect her husband for some reason, that husband too.  There will be no respect for that wife, this is the truth of life. No matter how much wealth you collect, do not give it to anyone after a limit. Only the husband will be useful to the wife and only the wife will be useful to the husband. These things are very beautifully done. In detail, Happiness course to me is starting in the end of November. Those of you who want to register, it is an iconic course. Happiness course is held once a year. There are five classes. There will be a weekly class of two hours. You can join this winter.  You will get a lot of perspective, you will become a consultant in it and first absorb all this knowledge, you will get life long access to video recording, the fee for video recordings is only ₹ 500, so please register for that. Do h2s and all these things will be resolved because the pain that you get after taking so much BP medicine and permanent pain comes, tease these topics and articulate them and explain them in language because this pain that fails to face.  To whom should the youth go that only their parents give them pain? Which song is that? It is Rajesh Khanna's song Jab vo jo boat kya bolete storm dole to us majhi paar paale jo.  Naav Majhi Duboi Ushe Kaun Bachaye Amar Prem's song Which is the song Naav Majhi Duboi Ushe Who Bachaye Parents only come meaning conflict with you Parents support to be protective Stay coolness Comfort to some big has to rise in the society Talk these things otherwise  You should know whom you will go to, and it is happening in the lives of many people, even though I may not have dreams, I am a common person in consultation, facing the issue.  The people are facing this issue as I get to know and this pattern is very much visible that where the youngsters are not fighting, the parents are doing it and the parents are seeing that this son and sister are also going to be diverse but  We will still cry our sorrow, we will cry so much that our existence becomes theirs, this is also happening, son and sister have their own battle going on in their troubles, just as in every family, in every married life, something or the other goes on with the parents.  Yours is going well, you take care of your own, everything is fine, parents are supposed to come and do the Panchayat not the children vice versa. If things go wrong then please share this video, like, subscribe to the channel and those of the society who like this.  There are different types of topics that I bring, no one is making it, okay, I hope you guys like it very much, please, it will come out very bitter and frustrating and make it a topic of discussion, friend, this thing which  If it is said then it is right, friend, every time, any of the parents talks bitter about the other parent, just cut the phone, say, my two are the same as you say, we are two siblings, so be it, both the hands are the same, the love is the same, both the eyes are the same.  Tell me, you have my two hands and two eyes, which one is right, speak directly, tell me, if you talk well, if you do it with love, then we will talk, otherwise we will not, I am telling them that they too will be free, you too will be and  Rest, what is the process behind this, what is the software, you will get to know in Happiness Course Two, you will have the best five iconic classes. Thank you very much."

In 70 days, people like us are sitting in front of the marital consultant, the marriage is breaking, many people tell me many times, oh brother, you are selling the house, so I do the consultation too, if it goes well then you earn money, not good.  If the house is running, then we earn. If you buy the house, we earn. If you don't buy, then you earn. Do whatever you want, so I am Mukesh Ambani ji. Anyway, Adani ji is not going to happen. If you are not there, then neither am I Mukesh.  If you don't know about Ambani, then what is the jealousy of this thing? Try to understand what I am telling again, because of so much financial influence and they have created so much chaos, no, this is not right, take mutual funds, do this, do that.  Be it a girl's parents or a boy's, who bought us? Hey, your times were different, now the times are different, but what will happen to a one BH or small two BH couple? Hey, if those parents  We are living together with mother-in-law and father-in-law, it is difficult to tell who gets two rooms, we get one room, we get one toilet, the kitchen is common, only the drawing is in the dining room, the father-in-law keeps drinking tea with a newspaper with his feet raised, no one gives you any sense.  Your friends can't come, nothing can be done, only their relatives will come, the daughter-in-law will have to say Namaste every time, she will have to come and go, she ca n't wear clothes as per her own, can't get up, ca n't sleep, the elderly suffer a lot, one can see a young  Couple getting late Getting up late Specially Saturday Sunday Fire catches fire Maid comes and is not cleaning She is being shameless Honeymoon period has passed One year has passed since marriage with them Why else do you have to live with these people But why do you have to live with these people because you  These ones should not work. You have not bought a house because you are a mutual fund. Mutual fund cannot give you happiness in life. House can give you happiness and your rent in the house is saved. That rent is  Investing in mutual funds or sponsoring your EMIs with it, the rent was falling into the pit, you get income tax rebate, interest rates are low, you also have to pay the EMI, otherwise if you rent like this, the rental in India is only Rs 3.  It is also on 6 and 7 in India and I will make many videos Sango Real Estate is my channel, go watch the rental videos there on 6 to 7 and more will come in future too Sango  Real Estate: If you have not subscribed to that channel, then please subscribe to it. You guys will get it. My request is, but the fact is that you should buy it as soon as possible, there are many people who are in government jobs.  There are many people who do not know where to live, the same advice for you all is that if you do n't know then buy wherever you want, what if you don't live there, the rent that will come from there will be the rent from where you live.  If you give that subsidy then you will have the option. Suppose you live in Gurgaon or anywhere in Delhi and you do not want to shift to your parents' house on rent and you do not have the capacity to buy property there because  Brother, it is worth 2-3-6-7 crores, so buy it wherever it is worth 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 lakhs, but what is the problem, parents are not giving money, parents say no.  We will definitely get married, we will spend the money, there are too many problems in the air during a four-hour wedding and this should not be done at all and the boys should not make the girls spend even a single penny, I am giving this hint more. Here, I am India's number one marital consultant. I give practical tips. I don't allow the girl's family to spend the money. The girl's family will spend Rs 80 lakh unnecessarily, which you did not want to do, it is not that it is in your pocket.  I entered because he had blown up the hydraulic lift. Instead of marigold flowers, there were lily flowers. Instead of 10 dishes, there were 50 dishes. Instead of 100 people, 500 people had been invited. Now that marriage will not work. The girl's father will file a case against you.  Will take the money because he had invested 80 lakhs, now you will say no, no, I did not meet him, this was a marriage, where did I come from, you tell me no, I did do it, and the marriage lasts only if people are born in separate houses.  Go and those parents of the boy who are listening to me, you are still young, no one at the age of 70 or 75 gets their child married. Normally, this generation produces children on time but the problem is that they do not let it last. Like in those cycles, take more house, let them take it, you will benefit only if that daughter-in-law does not stay with you, my very super hit video is Sango Life Soot Pe Five Reasons why son should not stay with parents in  Loss is a super hit, earlier I was accused that you are destroying houses, creating chaos, doing divisions like people do, now times are changing, now people are understanding more when those three  When the video was made a year or four years ago, the sensibilities were different. Now people are praising that video a lot. That video has become a hit. It is slowly and steadily getting many views every month. It is giving a lot of clarity to many people if that video.  If you want a link to  I will try to put it in the comment section, you can see that it is there, you can also go and see it, I have given many reasons in it, so when should you buy a house, you should buy a house as soon as possible, after doing some quick calculations, I will tell you.  If there is a house worth Rs 90 lakh or Rs 80 lakh, then you have to put your money in it, the rest you have taken a loan, you have taken a loan from Lettuce, brothers and sisters, you have got interest on Rs 70 lakh of Rs 70 lakh.  It will go out at Rs 85, which will come to around ₹ lakh. Okay, you can take income tax rebate of Rs 2 lakh for your wife, which will save you Rs 11 to 12000 per month in income tax, then you can take rent from her. In real estate I'm here workshops and webinars 35 35000 of properties are coming and once you have taken then after that if if in this then this is when the parents Mother-in-law did not give ₹ 1. Father-in-law did not give ₹. Boy and girl bought it on their own. If parents give ₹ 10 lakh to the boy and ₹ lakh to the girl, they will have to take a loan of only ₹ 50 lakh. In cash flow positive case, something will be left out of pocket. Nothing will go out of the pocket, nothing will come out of the pocket, the property will automatically become only 1010 lakhs. Nowadays, they make a set of 8-10 tolas, the girl wears it with the lehenga, all that they carry around is this, instead of giving that to the house.  Give it and I am telling you people again and again I have to say India 's number one to show that it has weightage. In my words, whenever husband and wife buy a separate house at the beginning of marriage, take a loan and pay EMI.  There are income tax benefits, they don't get divorced, I have done my own internal survey, that insecurity goes away, the flat is in the girl's name too, it is in the boy's name too, both of them have taken a loan.  Both of them have parents who had also helped. This is a very good thing. Spread this video for the society. Spread this idea. Those who have got married and now those parents had invested a lot of money, so now brother.  Also, if it is to be given to them and by your giving 10 lakhs to the girl's father or the boy's father, I am not talking about any dowry here, it is in the name of your daughter, it is in the name of your son only.  is also giving  Girl, you can give Rs 5 lakh as per your capacity, if it is your grand child's first birthday, then their car will start pushing if someone gives Rs lakh, because today even a car is not available for Rs 10 lakh, it is very good.  It is great that if they pay so much, they can buy a house by taking a little loan, withdrawing a little from their savings and sometimes what happens is that the payment plan is also easy to get, sometimes what happens is that the money is to be withdrawn in 4 years, the money is to be withdrawn in 3 years.  there are three more  The money has to be withdrawn in 4 years. If you get the initial money and then some good system is in place, then you can easily buy a house. If anyone will not buy a house now, in four years, he will feel price doubt in big cities.  If you are not going to get it, then the same question comes again, its answer is very simple, when should you buy a house as early as possible, do not go by these influencers, these people have sold you mutual funds, painted houses, villas and plots and  Air BnB has taken everything, all the financial influencers are there, they are from Raipur, they are from Goa, they are from Faridabad, all the people, whatever they are, they have suppressed and bought everything and to you, mutual fund is correct, by saying mutual fund.  It is also right, who is forbidding, but first buy a house, save the rent from it, put the rent in mutual fund, put it later, buy the house first, the government is giving ration of 5 kg.  If you become your own house, if some emergency comes into your life, life will be fine, the biggest problem is to pay the rent. I hope you all enjoyed it, please share it, like it, thank you very much."

    "title": "Which Career You Should Choose ？ ｜ Career Talk Zara Hatke [hz748MBQhlI].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today's topic is which career do you choose? I get many questions. Father, tell me which career thing should we do. If we choose career, then career is okay. If we discuss about choosing, then it is very important for the war. Those who are looking for it. You ask this question for your children, which line to go, then we will analyze it and will give you the best market advice as per 2023. Assam is a big career counseling also, I am nine, I am doing baby naz.  Also on detail these things if you want to attend detail to d number given below so wherever it is there you can get d notification so let's start before that let's talk about some statistics Higher education graduation in India is about 1 crore in a year  People are estimating the figure to be approximately one crore, out of this you can remove 15 lakhs, which are engineers, doctors or lawyer types, who are reducing 15 lakhs, why did I remove them?  Said because normally a lawyer or a doctor will not ask which career should I take, he has defined the rest of the 85 lakhs which you are doing, you are doing B.Sc, you are doing B.Sc and such courses.  In this way, out of these 85 lakhs, the salary of ₹ 5 lakh per year i.e. 42000 per month is being paid to only 12000 people, which means one percent of 85 lakhs.  It is 85000 and it is 21000 Chapter 5% If you are looking for a job of ₹ 40000 then what time telling people through this video and in future also there will be full detail video, we will discuss that brother, it is not by choice, you have a formal program, so you are asking like this. Brother, which one should I do? There are so many people standing in the queue, you remove IIT IIM, remove some more 10 15 20 colleges.  These are from the top, remove them, no one is asking anyway, no one says there is no choice, it is okay, you have a famine, if you can take orders, you can do something, then go ahead and these too are not giving anything above Rs 250,000, there are very few government jobs anyway. Why should you not do jobs? I have made some videos, I will make them in the future as well and anyway, do you know how many people are getting selected, so in the age of 21 to 30 years, either get into a government job and then find some career path or  Start doing something from the age of 22. The most important advice I would give to the youth is to stop sitting at home, go out, what to do, figure out, money is a wish, the big economy is going on, when you go out, you will automatically open your eyes, what else to do.  It should be done because it is a question of the middle class only, those who are rich, those who are rich, they know what to do, they have to do it from the age of 14 years, 13 years, 12 years, father.  This is ji's business, this is the setup, we have to go here, take his skill set and go according to him, Rich is very clear, this is also very clear, brother, whatever happens, will we run an auto rickshaw, will we drive the auto or will we drive this one, will we drive the house.  He will reduce his salary, he will become a delivery boy, he has 1.5 crore choice of jobs, he has 1.5 crore jobs and he also takes different wages three times a day, which means he has no helper, meaning that one person said in the morning, if he could drive it. No one is going to do this even in the evening, it's its children, it's its children, if you want to give an example, the jobs which used to cost Rs 2.5 lakh in 2012, will be available in 10 years in 2022, with difficulty - 3:30  Lakh means it has increased and look at the salary of their CEO, that 100 crore, 180 crore, 70 crore annual salary is on his budget.  So there is no point in going down there and becoming a lower servant, one day I will also become one, where will you become a brother, how will you become a normal college degree, no one will even say hello to you, be very clear, stop asking these questions.  Many people say that fashion is not the only place where I will enjoy. Today I will tell people the truth that money comes from nothing and good money comes no matter how much honorarium it is, it may be useless or you may not like it. I don't feel good even telling this, but when big money comes, money automatically goes away, it is also the opposite, take this, no one will teach you this thing, people will say that it is a fashion, reduce it there, reduce it there, if you don't get Rs.  Till then there will be fashion, eat money, don't run after money, what movie have you made on your Excel 3, brother, it was a copy of IIT, it is Chetan Bhagat's book, you all know the one on which the picture is made and that was a fictitious college, wasn't it of IIT?  It's a replica, she'll come back with a bang and you brother, all those kids are friends, she's intelligent, she's doing junk like the picture, she liked it very much on time in 2009, no one is capable in you, no one is in college, you are her Work on yourself at this level, success will come in a jiffy, nothing will come, success is not coming anywhere and there is no need for success because everyone's definition of success is the same.  It is different, the money should come 10000, 2030, then later, 40, 50, 60, then 60, 70, 80, 110, 120, 140,000. This is the path to follow, this fashion, this excellence, whether it is less or now, it will come in a jiffy, motivate me, that is on YouTube.  I do consultation webinars many times, I keep watching so many motivational videos, I feel so happy, so confident in myself. What do you believe in, what do you believe in? It is not possible for you to wake me up in the morning. I have full faith in myself that I will not be able to wake you up in the morning. I will keep looking at me at night. I will keep wasting my life making some preparations.  Believe that one day you will be successful. All the coaching academies are working on this. If someone's faith is broken that after 2 years I will stop trying and start doing less, then these are the steps of the coaching academy again and again.  Today I am giving a very good fight to the war  I am giving advice to the government service people, listen, take the complete syllabus for two years, attend it twice at night and after that I start my work, now you have to do revision, even if you keep giving papers for 30 years, do not prepare sitting at home. Who is this?  You are getting prepared for this also, you are getting prepared for this also, preparation for 22nd year, preparation for 23rd year, preparation for 24th year, preparation for 25th year, you mean, from first to 12th, you mean in 12 years.  You are scared and left after integration, here again in 12 years you have to study so much, there is so much syllabus, brother, study hard for one and a half year more, start studying from the second year of your graduation and after completing graduation, do one more year or two or three.  Study for a year, from the age of 20 to 22, study the whole syllabus for two and a half years, take the night, make notes and give the exam. If you pass then it is very good, if you have got it then it is good if you have not got it. What's the point in playing exams, keep giving and those who earn their money should go away, come for two-three hours and revise the base that you have made and most of the people who are doing this are looking for more jobs. Instead of sitting at home and lowering your self steam and saying on a stage because if you are a boy then the patient meter of your parents starts running high and the hero starts wondering what is he doing, what is he doing, they will give you the money that you will go home.  me too  Girls can't live like that even today, they don't think that they are 22 years old, if something happens to them then they will get married, they also keep wasting their time for some 5-6 years, reduce the actual from here and  Earn actual money because the money you earn will automatically make you understand what to do and in the future, people are not only in the job market, they are not coming out of the house, people are lying inside the house worth crores of rupees. At home, my mother prepares parathas and gives them to me and then sits down because sometimes people enjoy reading so much because it means you don't have to go anywhere, don't do anything, just open the book, you are getting tea, you are getting this, then you become a friend.  Then we pass the time by smoking beedis and drinking liquor and we are consuming it in the environment, there is no growth anywhere, then what career should we do? Hey, why are you asking about career, the same thing is happening again and again, what choice are you giving to yours? John C should be installed in India  Get it as soon as you get it, get it once, after that take a breath, who said that if you hold one job at 24, if you hold less then you can't leave it at 25, do n't leave it at 26, don't leave it at 27 months.  If you can find it in the right market, I hope you people who are employed and are not very satisfied do not enjoy this message. 26 27 28 30 24 35  Here brother, keep your left and right eyes open and keep doing something else, their religion is that they will give you 30-40 thousand and take your soul as mortgage, they will try to fulfill their religion and you can still do something.  Be it someone in someone's house who is not coming late at 8:00 and under related, you can reduce a lot, you can do a lot, reduce at least 14 hours a day in your 20s, reduce anything, do 14 hours, you will get a lot of money.  The rest of the details will start coming, I understand that, I will definitely tell you that it will be a very long video in one, if you hold it and start telling it because it has non- sir and questions also, here through this video you will not ask questions. Can't and I can't answer the majority, ok please type and whenever it happens you will get notification and you can attend so date you get clarity on that, you get clarity as to what I have to do or what is good for me.  Seems like Haj Gan Nothing you do with what is the right thing these days and the situation is so dynamic, things are changing very quickly, you can no longer be like your father that you joined, then you are here, then you will get promotion, then this is my structure.  Then whether my salary is coming or is coming, it is not so and in such a situation, call the people who have been hanged and ask them how happy they are, they must be a little older than you or maybe you too should like him in the situation.  If you are in India, there are a lot of opportunities. Fight with 3 trillion dollars. Indian dollar's journey is going on. Economy is going on. India is the best performing in the world. Check how much recession is there. Mount Everest of GDP is going to be around 2%. India will always be historically high at 3%.  So, no matter how much the economy goes down, we will remain above 5:30%. It is okay that in the worst of the cases we can even go up to 6-7%.  Can and there is a lot in it, provided, you are not sitting at home, provided, if you are playing a match, the bat is in your hand, then runs will be scored, but you are just preparing, if you are preparing, then brother, no, the matter is going on, stop preparing.  Two, jump, jump and that is too much, this marriage market and this of the parents and the society that I am sitting at this level, my son, will you lower this level, first of all, father, you did not sit at this level on the first day.  I am telling my children  Do you guide or miss guide? You did not come here for the first time. Secondly, you had given competition. 25 30 35 Earlier, the competition was less, then if you had a book, then you had some money from your father. You went to school.  You had an inherent advantage because the children of the poor and the poor did not come into the competition. Whatever has happened to education and competition is due to this mobile, data has become so cheap.  These days, even a child of a poor person is out of lakhs, even if I calculate the ratio even in 5 lakhs, he will still eat all the vacancies because he is so poor, even in 500,000, even if that one child comes out, it is so low because it is a show.  If you have more access, then your father, who is yours, if you say that the seat of three has been fixed, then what have you become tomorrow, your child is not going to get it because the jobs are the same, if you see, the government jobs are the same, it is not big, you check.  Tax  Now this makes 180, just check how many vacancies would have been created 10-15 years ago. Most of all, the vacancies of all the governments are definitely decreasing. If you look carefully, there is no shortage left, then if the population is 70, 80 crores, it will be 140 crores in the past. Population will double in 25-30 years and the story of the poor then in India has reduced as power vilopowerty line overload last 20-30 years.  What is reduced is the inherent advantage that the middle class children had. The advantage that the middle class children had 25-30 years ago was that they went to school, went to some non-government schools, spoke some English and got books.  Had I got the money for tuition, I had a lot of advantage over other children, so there was more selection in this field, now this bridge has increased, it has become such a big bridge, now out of so many pools, there is selection from here also.  If this happens then the people here will have to do something else, I am telling you this and if you have to do it then keep asking again and again which career should I do, this question itself is wrong, you should not choose a career, you should earn money if your bank account is full.  Take the extreme example of ₹5 crore, then you will ask which career should I do? Whoever is a rich person, he has more money and desires for money, he knows only this, what should I do with 10 punches, what career should I do?  not able to do  Then comes 10, 10 becomes 20, how to do it, how quickly to do it, how can you do it, then focus towards it, focus towards it, add end, end to all the children of 17-18-19-20 years of age.  Add them also because in this I will also include communication skills, personality and everything else because it is very important to reach today, to come and know, how are the jobs available today, I will tell that.  The one who doesn't come to your house is not the one who comes like this. There are college placements in the college. Apart from that, there is a lot more in the college placement. Then the standard of the college is also required and if you are not in a standard college then where is the placement.  No one is coming to you, this is the most important thing, thank you very much."

And the sculpture done through pen does n't give much but you understand that unless you have this pen then you can propose, then we don't know what to do right now, I have seen that children make tattoos, it is okay on that.  also different  A psychology will come from this, there is a pen too, we have made a hole in it, we have done it here, we have done it there, we have done anything, but brother, if this pen was not there then I do n't know what all the people go around doing, because it is a pen, that is why we are afraid of this pen. People will stop at something, when the police roam around with lathi and someone is doing wrong, then the pen which is there with the lathi, but he is under control according to the paint, you understand that the pen is very important to remove this.  give us for  More emotions are needed and in retirement and in the world, two things are very lacking, that is love and truth, where truth will come, where there is love, there will be compassion, there pain will go away. We all are in a lot of pain, we are in different types of pain, we cannot understand.  The truth is not being spoken to us, the truth is not being heard, no one loves us because there is a huge shortage of two things, love and truth, the shortage of love and truth in this world is causing pain.  been on pen  Pain is real, you cannot do it in the world. Component of love and truth. You know that these become very intense videos. Sometimes energy starts coming and you cannot continue more than that. You know, there is a lot to tell and understand and that is June 1.  You go to it like you have to come to the creator workshop, you have to understand it deeply, you can take membership of the channel [Music] That part of yours does not reduce, your hand cannot lift up, your hand has to be operated, there has to be a story of the stomach, there has to be a story.  Give  Given journalist or body is not available, they want you to be in date state in life, you say pain, when that operation happens, it is necessary, it is procedure, but you want you award, little beat pain or pain in life, in your family, in your friend circle. In your situation, if you are working in a place where there is no respect, no truth is spoken, no love, or you are with such people from morning to evening who are liars, you are also a liar, this note means by lying.  If he has taken something from you, first of all it is a lie, second lie is a general lie, meaning his belief system itself is a lie, everything is a lie, his saree and you know it, but you say there is some compulsion on my part to make it, that is why people are in painful situations. As we grow, life is very good, very beautiful, beautiful, relaxed, I am the one who has become the caste of love, it takes a big time for the truth too, I have come to know that there was no encouragement, his truth was mine, it was the truth of both of them, love truth on the third day.  One should remember this and this is a pen and this is the treatment. You find out the treatment for the pain because when something was happening to him, you were jumping and taking his pen. Everyone is traveling with their pen but you are the one in the society to see it.  Are you giving power to love and truth or are you giving power to lies? Then pain gets flooded in life. Pain gets flooded in the world. Or did you enjoy it or did something ignite a little bit of this thought process? The rest is awake, Rahu is fine.  The rest is something different, you will not understand it, Maya.  It is also okay, you will not find it lying with your hand, you are okay with pain, don't underestimate the fear of pain, purchase good cups, your life becomes painful, it becomes painful just like that, if something hurts, then it does not go to the hand or there, if not.  If the hand itself gets burnt, if this hand holds a gram of something, then it happens like this, now the feeling of pain is not there and it is real, so the hand did not even know about it, the brain did not know about it, it happens to many people. who don't even realize that  What will happen if many people, like children, do not realize that doing something will hurt or cause pain, like he only gets hurt, falls, gets steadied, grows up, gets dependent [laughter] on his own pain, on the pain of others.  It is definitely not necessary for everyone to go into everyone's pain. It is okay to go into the pain of relationships to understand relationships. To understand something, it is okay to go into physical pain and to understand something, all this has come, I will be never you, it was fun to write in the comment area. thank you very match"

    "title": "Who Should And Who Should Not Apply For Government Jobs ？ [5VhdKDGi_sc].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, this is a very important topic for the youth, it will give you a lot of clarity, you should understand very well, I should apply for government job, recently a picture was released 12th failed and it's done very well so it struck with a lot of people so today I Very clear, I want to give it to my audience, what will happen to me from this, one benefit will be that my audience will be defined, my audience  People will also know whose mentor I am and which audience I am targeting. They may judge a mismatch and many people will get clarity. So watch carefully and watch the video with pleasure. If you are feeling pain due to some reason. So write in the comment section if you enjoyed it then write AG if you enjoyed it then write MG if you enjoyed it, I said something and you liked it very much temporary and Anand means you feel it.  Sustainable, that happiness has given, let's start by listening carefully, whether you get reservation or not, what is the reservation, now they will say that there is a separate topic on that, you tell me brother, if you are getting reservation then definitely try us, I am not a moral science teacher for anyone.  No, you do not need to become one, it is not ours, you stop this discussion, do not discuss this, this discussion has been happening for many years, it will continue for many years, you have the support of reservation key, by all means, try to avail its benefits, if you are getting reservation.  Is  Those who reached the creamy layer etc. and crossed the OBC figure of 8 lakhs, I would like to tell that if the money in your family is good then do not join a government job, it is a very good thing for the poor in small towns.  Small village life, I don't understand anything. Going to a big city means you will become a Swiggy Zomato person. It's okay if you go and want something like yours or not. Why should I become a Swiggy Zomato person, although Sugi Zomato is  I am not showing below at all that there should be a lot of dignity of labour, but many people do not think that brother, it is right to speak clearly and speak clearly, it is right for an Indian to talk bluntly, the day is not going well here, even by talking bluntly, you should do it straight.  If you want to talk, then if you feel like this then why are you telling me because by the way you will earn 40 Haj by doing all those works and if you work more then you can earn 809 Haj also but you think that not me.  There is something to be done here and if you have reservation then try by all means but have a cut off. Have a cut off. Two to three to four to five times. After that don't do that because the rest of your things that can be done will not be done. Family  If your money is not much then definitely try because you can neither do any business nor you have exposure but those who live in big cities, middle class children and some upper middle class children can leave all this, but you could not do it Munna.  no hey you us  He is demotivating, at least someone will leave, he will leave, but you will not enjoy even going there, you will not get the sense of achievement. Today, even if you become an officer in the government, that is, a group officer, there is nothing above that, then the basic pay is Rs 56000.  DA is 50, it will be fine now, so add 28000 more, you mostly meet rotten people throughout the house, it hurts to say this, but  The truth is the truth, no, no, ours are good in Delhi and mine are good there, 5 are good but 95 are good, but that is what I am telling, it is very good, Government amendment in India in Delhi is also good, now that is a different thing, if you like it, then its  There is no cure because now you have not taken advantage of Jaguar's taps or Grohe's or Kohler's or the milky water that comes from them because they are your equivalents who are working in corporate. They are taking that life. Who saw the peacock dancing in the forest? I want to tell the government officials. Many people feel that the peacock is dancing in the forest. They like it. No one is watching. No one is coming. I know very sad government people.  Because what is the reason, why am I telling this video, why am I telling it for clarity, why am I making it for all the youth, that friend, you will come now in 2000 24, when you have to watch up to 60 programs in the market, then some  That is not changing. Living in 40-50 year old houses, the page doors and windows in government houses are such that I am in pain, people have to get up and sit a lot in consultation, they make fun of friends and relatives and say, this is how it is in government houses.  If the window is closed then it will not open and the one which is open does not close, this is the situation, how many identifications are you like Maheshwari ji or am I this scam, why should I kick you in the stomach like this?  So in fact I tell people, the losers are earning more money. Who are the losers here? Those who did not pass their exams themselves, but brother, what exams did they give, what did they play, how many exams did they give, did they prepare for the competition and now they teach preparation to the people.  Of all the things they teach, 90 did not happen, out of which 90 did not become 95, 98 did not happen, and those who left something behind came back.  Keep it Divya Kriti ji, even if you did not have that rank, what does that mean at that time, you had taken the exam, if you were not an IAS then what happened, people think you were an IAS and you clear it two or four times, how many times and many people, I too. It seems that it is okay to do something with the pastime, I am an astrologer, okay, I am a marital counselor, I am okay, so there is nothing for the people who have houses in big cities, if India's top 30 cities 30 cities  It becomes enough in which metropolitan and all these things have come together in the top 3035 cities. If you have a house in 3035 cities then you do not have to go for a government job. It is not worth getting pushed from here to there. Your wife will be able to get a job because if  You are a man, you will keep going from here to here and if you accidentally marry a government employee girl and you are also a government employee, then you will keep writing letters about the location for the whole life, which I see referred to my acquaintances.  Letter Government of India September 2008 which is the policy of colocation that I am in Central Government, Wife in State Government or Husband, Wife both in Central or Central State or Wife in PSU or Husband country, you will be done, Government has to do it for you like this.  Husband-wife 150 km apart, colocation has been done from their side, so why not go and meet on weekends?  The problem is that you will get into trouble day after day, you are a poor people, I am saying that in a government job, it is very good in the beginning, it is such a job that the first five-seven years are very good, what is the basic thing about people?  There are four or five things in it to know, some say openly and shamelessly that there is corruption, it is not as much as it seems, it is not as much as it seems, it was there earlier, it is not there, now it is not there, in the coming time it will be reduced further and it is too much to go for corruption.  It breaks a lot and not everyone gets the opportunity and it is not so easy and it also has many shortcomings. Okay, there are many big officials who are doing very hard work. Well, one thing is this, and this is a very mean world of pain.  I mean, I get disturbed by such things, although it does not happen, but I mean, man, do you know how much man can go for this? Man, I don't think that the youth of my country are not that bad that they will prepare so much for corruption.  It means that people become corrupt by mistake, out of compulsion, I saw or I don't know for what reason, but I think how many of those who are burning night oil will do corruption, I really don't know, what is your take, tell me first of all.  So I killed him, okay, this is a useless thing, we should not talk like this, it is okay in our country, there is a lot of money to earn here, more opportunities will come, second thing, what do you call a job, it is very secure here.  Yes, the job is secured but perhaps it puts you in a comfort zone and it is stable. Only the job is stable. Well, there is no stability. You can't get up from here or there. No, we know that our Delhiites in the Central Secretariat are those again.  Friend, it is not about government jobs at 5, whenever a video is made, a video is made for 90, for 80 or 90, for 10 or 20, there is someone or the other.  There will be misconceptions as to who is forbidding you to go to the railways. If everyone starts thinking like this then hey, everyone does n't think like this. Neither did I say, nor did I say, who will go from a poor family, they are getting reservation, there is something else in the society.  I do n't understand what to do, your class is such that no one listens to you and there is no other way to establish yourself in the society, so you have to go to the off course, but you are sitting at a good place because what is there next, is n't it?  Will Not Words  Use of the word of nuisance sounds a bit bad but over a period of time, if you look at the government, now again the word nuisance is coming out or as much as I say it, call it power, it was okay that of the government people, it is decreasing the most.  First of all, the big thing is that you have taken this lamp, it is okay which used to intimidate the common man, the Prime Minister said, I will not put it on, I will not put it on, so how can you also put it on, so many things, it means a lot of things, you see, right?  203 years old culture is still ingrained in the minds of parents. Firstly, Indians are saying that why is the love of Indians so much subconsciously? I would like to tell you, tell me, do you think it is right, no friend, during the British time, the one who used to beat Indians with batons was the government official.  It used to happen everywhere that the British did not beat, that is, the British were not so numerous that they would beat the Indians with the same sticks, so one of our Indian brothers is fine in any form.  When I used to beat people with batons and was a government official, my mind saw from within that if you don't want to be beaten with batons, then become your government man and go into the system. Such a system was created that this is a fort, this is a fort, a CD was installed at the place of the fort.  Many times no one likes those who have entered here, but everyone has to go individually. Individually, people will say wrong things, but everyone wants to send their own people. They will say, hey, he is from the government, he is like this, I am like this.  I want to tell you that government employees are not even getting respect, they have to do a lot of work, many people think that there is no work, I am talking about today's day when the video is being made in the early winter of 2024. Friend, a lot of work has been done in this time, how can one lose one's life just by looking at the elections? Sir, a government man, as per your wish, you are a teacher, you are a Patwari or a Tehsildar, as per your wish, you mean Tantra Hill, which is the Big Elephant of India.  When that works, then people go and get the work done, people say to the poor government people during Covid, why are the private people sitting at home with their laptops open, the government people should know that whatever happened to them at the cremation grounds, it was the government who did it, not the government people.  I can say, I have a headache, am I okay or am I having a stomach ache, there is a law where the government says, if I don't want to go, I have to go, they tell me to leave the job, even after doing this work, they will not let me leave. Don't take a government job so easy. What am I doing here? I am not demotivating here, I am motivating, I am giving clarity. I am the one who, when a man enters into a marriage, enters into a relationship, he should be a little bit mature and  Don't understand why you are signing up for what marriage is, what it is, what it means, wife and children, and what should you know about a job because what is a government job? It's like riding a tiger.  It feels good but I feel scared while getting down, I feel scared while leaving, it will be eaten by the tiger, it is not easy, there is pain, please go and meet people in government jobs, whose age is above 3540 or service is there, you will get the right picture only just.  I am speaking to the youth, a particular section, you understand, that is my core audience, middle class and upper middle class also rich. If you are preparing for a government job then  You are not my audience, today I am telling you clearly because I will not be able to help you, I will be your friend, my wishes will be best for you, God bless you and be happy in getting a government job, but only the one who is coming from the bottom will be happy in a government job.  He would also like the page from home because there was a kutcha roof at his house and the bathroom at his house was 1 km away or was not there at all or was sharing with 10 family members.  For the family members, everything is good for them, but if anyone is living decently then some people do not talk about this and they become like, am I being class conscious or am I making people look like this? I am making many people look like this.  There is also pain that when we become, we will be raw because when there was power, there was a particular class that used to rule or used to rule then there were big uncles, now when we come then yes, this is also a fact, this is also a pain.  I am working harder on the subject now, 20 years ago the competition was less, 40 years ago it was even less because the one who used to study earlier, what was it 40 years ago, the one whose father gets him the book, gets him a book in the school, gets him some coaching.  The child used to pass out because the number of people reaching this state in India was very less. Nowadays, mobile phones have come. Now the people with research centers equipped with mines are doing the same in UPSC, some are doing it for so much, some are doing it for so much.  some child is doing it  If you are reading then everyone will remove you, democratization of education has happened which is a good thing, I am not saying that it is bad but because of this, I am making this video that brother, many sections of your parents have enjoyed that.  I have done it, children of those who are government officials should not join. Brother, you have enjoyed. Who would want that like you? Would anyone like this? My father, grandfather also used to take ration rice from the government, we also take it. What progress have you made, then if you are a government employee and your child also became a government employee, then have you shot an arrow in the pumpkin, leave it for someone else, where no one from the family has come, someone else will do it and in the region  I am saying to leave because the first thing is that it will not come out of your child, this is also a fact, by the way, no one leaves, if it happens and I said that you get reservation, you get it by taking its help, then take it, who has forbidden it, take it.  had been  You are doing it, but those from reservation people are arriving with what they are bringing. Those from middle class families are also not happy because there is no growth visible from within, increments have to be given at the same 3, do good work, do wasteful work, do this without taking up some meaningful challenge. Put it here, pick it up and put it there, you don't have to do the work according to your intellect and you have to do it that way only, most of the time, this is how it works, how can everyone apply their brain, it is the government system, above all Babu only.  Brain will apply, Politician will apply, then Babu will do a little bit, then the people below here ca n't say I have a better idea because then the work is done, everyone is roaming around with ideas, so there will always be more executioners.  Those who are planning at 99 will remain at 1. Those who are planning are happy because they feel from within that we are changing. Those at the bottom have a misconception that we should go to the country.  Will you change? Yes, you change. After 40 years, after 35 years, if you become Cabinet Secretary, you become Finance Secretary, you become this, but that brother, that one, that is not even half percent of the people, it is % of the people and even in that you do not change that much, only the politicians.  Tells and the politician tells after seeing the public then you have more in your hands otherwise you will remain unhappy then you can bypass it and a lot of things are as hard as you are working, I am saying that if the amount of hard work is not a joke to me  It seems serious because with that much you can become a politician, those who have been preparing for the exam for 10 years, raise this flag and roam around somewhere and connect genuinely with the people, understand the compulsions of the people and raise some voice and intelligently. Use social media and become an influence. If you become this in so many years then yes I am telling you that in 10 years of hard work you will become such a well-known influence.  You can maybe become an MLA because you look at me friend, how many MLAs are there in India, I think there are 8-10 thousand, like there will be 400 plus in UP, there are 90 in Haryana, there are 70 in Delhi, there are probably 120 in Punjab, you start counting like this.  Two from the whole of India, okay, how many are there? Like, 23 in Bihar, count all the states like this, friend, that makes 180, so now see for yourself that it is easy to become an MLA, it is easy if  If you try then it is possible. If you look at the chance of probability, then I think it is possible. You see this, 10 lakh children want to become IS, but how many lakh people want to become MLA every year, no survey has been done, no, they are workers, this is all I understand. But how serious are you actually, so I am speaking as you can do it, you can serve the country in any way, so depending on what else is there, what is it only? Now people will say, no, no, sir, sir, sir, sir, you are not even in a government job, and if you got fired from a government job, if you became a Group D student, then who became an arrow in the pumpkin, if you were from a good family.  Why are you becoming like a shell? You are from such a family where brothers are not able to earn their living and the condition is absolutely bad. So if you become like that then your family will cherish and that family will cherish the thing.  Cherishes, happiness comes from the place where the family gets benefited that my child, let's go, yes let's go, Munni's father has just got a job, it is okay in the fifth and sixth attempt, they do it, now many of you will go like this, mostly like this People are coming, then there is a class difference feeling there too and then if I go further, I will go a little into the dark zone, I leave the video in gray and turn it off, then many times, what has gone wrong in the system these days that you  He came from this class, he came from this class, it is good because the government is giving opportunity to everyone, but now he came earlier, so he sat here, but he is a victim of it, this reverse discrimination is also happening, this discrimination has been going on for 5000 years.  This has been going on, I don't refuse you, you also know but now reverse discrimination is also going on that if you are sitting here now, then this person's soul is also in pain, then someone will say, brother, why did you go then? Why did I curse you? He is having fun doing it. He is having fun doing it. You are in pain. He is having fun seeing you in pain. All these are not normal videos. No one is making them and I am also making them. Someone is very wrong.  I am not trying to give any message, I am just trying to give the message that friend, leave the government job, if you are of this profile and if you are of that profile then go for sure, go for sure, try because in many places, the government  She is giving you a chance for 37 years, give unlimited ATM for 37 years, give her some work for 15 years, hold on to your work and keep giving exam after exam, that too is an addiction of people, I enjoy it a lot.  I also gave many exams as an amateur and cleared a lot, meaning just to test whether I consider myself such a knowledgeable person or just enjoy it, sometimes it becomes an addiction. In K, especially in CAT, it is a lot of fun, it is okay to attempt, look at the percentile, even if you don't want to join, it is still a lot of fun, there are many good exams, they challenge you, okay, it is fun, but it is just a stage. After this, you should leave them because this is a big addiction, the prelims of Kadi, B-four have also passed, and you will pass the examination, those who enter it, if they are not able to pass, then there is no big heaven ahead because heaven is  If you would have looked happy, just in India, if you find any senior employee under 40, whether he is a senior or a top bureaucrat of India, if you would have looked happy, do this exercise for the next 10 days, then tell me in the comment section by writing your name.  There is no need to tell him I met 45 year old 43 year old 49 year olds he is very happy This is a class which is not happy at all but the soul has been sucked  What about these people and the private people and those who are employed outside, think that the government people are having fun, they are not having fun, because if they were having fun then it would be visible on the face, or it would not be visible on the face, you will write in the comment section, thank you."

    "title": "Who Will Be Your Mentor ？ A Practical Tip For The Youth [SsJ-hQK5ecI].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, there is a lot of message for the youth, I will be your mentor, who will give you mentorship, a lot of youth is looking after people to mentor them, I also have elders, give us knowledge, give us like this, and you will be looking for it anywhere else too, The Fact is Mentorship.  Will Come at a Great Cost If It Comes from a Good Mentor Will Come at a Great Cost If It Comes from a Good Mentor Will Come at a Great Cost I suppose you are someone you are listening to me you are in your college and early part of your career you have got a new job and your age is between 18 to 25 27 and you want to figure out a lot of things you  Got a lot of questions, please go and surround yourself with professionals who are in that field and flatter them a little, give them a feel for their dosa.  They are feeding you tea and coffee, brother, brother, brother, sir, sir, they will also tell you a lot because they have already entered the place where you are about to enter, they know, as if they are not senior, about the exam, who has just appeared for the exam last time.  Gave it two years ago, he knows more about the strategy, instead of going to some great white people and paying big money for a strategic consultation at a different senior level. End vision and are taking money according to that, they cannot come to your level and take you, they cannot even guide you. Most of it is something like if there is a child of LKG first second third fourth, then the professor who is teaching PhD. Sir, go to him and take some tuition, he will not only entertain you but you like him because he is famous, he is influential, he has good looks, brother, he will take notes and if he explains then you will understand.  He will not come, in fact he will not explain to you, he is from the first, then he will say something to you, you will feel bad, then you will think of speaking bad to him or will you do it? You should catch hold of a sixth and a little of the seventh. If the person in front of you is the sixth and seventh, then it is  If you are from 9th or 10th, then 11 are from 12th. If you are from 11th or 12th, then some mentorship is from a college student who is 3 to 5 years senior to you. Do what the younger brother does, do it with the elder brother's friend or elder brother or at that level only, only from there you will get the real one and that will be good enough. If not the best advice, it will be decent enough. He will tell that in the lawyer.  So you have to do this, if your father is not there then you will have to struggle here, talk to him, do it like this, give tea and water to some people, give them respect, there are many youngsters from whom no one can take knowledge from them.  In the beginning, unless you have become a professional Gyan Gyani Baba and started giving knowledge, in the beginning you enjoy giving it for free to everyone and in India, many people enjoy giving knowledge for free, so that much. You don't have to struggle You have to just find the right person What I see a lot of people is they spend too much time with their peers Butch, you don't know, I don't know, we are doing some figure out among ourselves, some times there is one smart friend, who knows, who knows, if it is like this in your circle, then it is good, okay, but ideally speaking  So everyone's fathers, if you are listening to me or are parents, they should know that parents cannot be mentors because they are not specialists but parents have a big network and circle so parents can  Also come and help in this situation and they can connect their child with the right once some times and then parents also have to apply the same formula that this will not come at a free cost if the advice has any validity, gyan asli hai to itna free  Even though you will not find it in me, you can still ask, how did you like the idea that you can connect with that child who is two, three, four or five years ahead of your child?

    "title": "Whom Should You Marry ？ Aap Shaadi Kisse Karein [zrv5nqOnaEU].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, should I marry you, this is the topic but I will answer it in a very different way so that you will get complete clarity in it because no one is able to give this answer properly and Acharya ji is a very popular YouTube, he is getting close to four crore subscribers.  And by doing this, I feel scared of all his drivers. By doing this, I am scared, but still I am telling you, he has created a lot of confusion, it is okay here, earlier he was very against it, okay.  After marriage, I made a lot of videos, okay, and then through my videos, I am sure that he changed his view a little, no, I am not against marriage, then he said, I want you to get married consciously, that.  It's one second, marry the one who takes you up and that's the change. Now many people will say, you are a small idiot, he doesn't have 2 lakh subscribers, he is sitting at 4 crores. When I made that video, he also had one crore, okay.  My 1 lakh has gone from 1 lakh to 2 lakh, theirs has also probably doubled, okay, otherwise you, yes, brothers and sisters, no matter how much bigger the balloon is than yours, no matter how much air is in the balloon, this much needle is enough, okay? Now I am not going to vent again to them, to their subscribers, to their followers, I am also Guruji, it is okay without any organization, who made you Guruji, who made me, I have made myself, I can make myself too, Guruji.  From Gurugram, okay, so I have also done my branding as I am Guruji, many of my fans call me Guruji and I also like it, okay, so I am self-styled Guruji, okay, why in these times, I am afraid to say this, but I  I do n't feel scared because I have never had any physical interaction with anyone, so I am someone like that Guruji is fake Guruji and I am not going to go into that category where there is something happening, I just listen to YouTube2 for four minutes, after that you will  Whatever you want to write, write it and whatever my family listens to, you tell me that if your family felt happy after hearing it, then write it as AG, then after setting the role, I will try only with the theory given by my Acharya Prashant ji.  There is only one protest that friend, this person is this person, this person is a theory, we see, everyone is a modern philosopher, they are speaking their own, I am speaking mine, 17th century, 16th century and 10th century.  Something like this has happened in the century too, Aristotle Socrates Chariot, there is no one these days, otherwise we are like this in today's world, if you think about it then there is a theory, you should enjoy his words, enjoy my words too.  And nothing is ever personal. Whatever is discussed should not be given importance. We should not give importance to what is being said. We have to increase dialogue, not controversy, not argument. Hey, what a wonderful thing you have teased us about the dialogue. Acharya ji has also teased me, I am my bread and butter, this is my bread and butter, so I have teased them too, because this youth, after listening to all the videos, goes to ask them questions.  So call me somewhere and record it, otherwise I will attempt it. What do I find wrong in their theory that this is a human being, he has to marry, he has to marry the one who can take him to the top.  Then the problem is that we marry only one person, it is not that I married him, he married her and she married him, if this was the case then the theory was correct that if I married this man then he married her, then it is okay.  Now this one cannot get up because he was fallen, he lifted up the fallen one, now if he marries this one, this will raise him up, now if he does this to her then this theory does not work mathematically or scientifically or logically.  It is not practical, isn't it, this is this, marry me, I will not use my word, meaning two, Rohit, Neha, okay, okay, now Rohit wants to marry Neha, my favorite characters, okay, Rohit wants to marry Neha, Neha is here, Rohit feels that Neha is him.  But Neha will take you here. Neha says to Rohit and Will says to Rohit. Rohit will be worried about why should I do your work, what is your consciousness?  I have to awaken my intellect and conscience, which means I have to take you up. I am looking here, so my answer is that what you need to do is you have to become the person you have to become the person who is yours.  The potential spouse that you have made a demanding program in your mind will be looking and seeking. Now I have spoken in English, it becomes difficult to translate it in Hindi.  I am attempting neither my English is good nor my Hindi is good because when my mind works like Chacha Chaudhary's then it is difficult to explain, so I attempt again because these videos are made from emotions, they are not made from paper like this and I love.  Acharya Prashant ji for this he also tells with emotions that nothing is scripted, so in that way we would have been friends, I and Acharya Prashant would have been very good friends, if he had removed the marriage thing, I would have agreed with all the rest of his things. I am fine, everything is fine I agree, I have no problem with anyone, only this one, so what to do now, now they will not change, I too cannot do that, if they remove one thing, then I will give their organization wisdom, intelligence and consciousness. I too will join the campaign with a motorcycle and a little behind. It should be changed, if they are watching this video of mine, any of their friends or forward it, everyone has time, no matter how popular someone is, everyone sees it, okay, so I ask them to change this a little and take a little more on this one.  Look, you have changed a little.  It is very good, do a little more in this, everything else is 100 by 100 in this because sometimes what happens is that one small thing goes wrong and then your entire program gets spoiled and then it goes astray, so try again.  Let me explain again what I explained in the beginning, that brother, you look at this, understand, apply your mind, he is Rohit, he wants to look like he does in the world, but to attract attraction, he also has to become attractive.  Will he say that it will be necessary or not, friend, I am not, this cannot happen because sometimes your face is such that you cannot change it because of the face of your parents, now I am going to explain it very clearly by doing examples for example.  Only then will you understand that theory, so much has been told, now you have to explain it too, then you too become beautiful, make abs and boobs, broaden your personality, broaden your shoulders, bike, bike, dole, sholay waadi. Do whatever because now you are seeking this personality. Now brother, you bring a sense of humor, maybe Neha can do with something less sexy, but she has a sense of humor because even ask girls what they want, they say something like this. Sense of humor should be B grade, that means one should be a stand up comedian, but there are issues in the marriages of stand up comedians too, then what is it, then you will have to become rich, but how to become rich at 24, okay Neha is 23, you are 24. How can one become rich? Right now, I am not employed, I am preparing for the exam, or if I have got a job, it is worth Rs 40,000. Neha has a choice, right? 28  From 23rd person to 30th person to 32nd person, there is a choice over that, anyone can do it and when you start doing that then it is getting even more painful that now I don't want to say that, otherwise the video will go here and there.  Beyond that, a separate video will be made on how girls are also losing it in terms of what ever the way they are conducting, it is okay, I call it high value women, I am okay with it.  I do n't have to make a relationship webinar on this because here neither from the position of time nor when I am making the video, nor like this 8 minutes 52 seconds 8 minutes 54 seconds youth does not watch 12 minute videos, people watch only 810 minutes.  This pressure is not on the screen, such a creator looks very bad, there is so much to say, that way I love Acharya ji, that way, at slow speed, as comfortably as Atal Bihari Vajpayee.  They speak calmly and if they are having genuine interaction then they can do it, but if someone else is making their video, then there is no pressure on them, okay, we have pressure here, so I also want to do a webinar on this, I am free.  Should I do it or not do it for free, maybe I want to do a webinar by charging a fee of Rs. 00. You want to attend, I will tell you all these concepts, now you see this if you are seeking a very intellectual.  I am the kind of girl with whom it will be fun to talk. It will be fun to discuss the world. You can have deep conversations. If the spirituality element is high then brother, you will have to become something at that level. It is not possible that I am so what do you say friends. Do you know any extrovert person and get married to my interworker or I want to marry someone else? You have to see what the person is looking for. If you want to marry a very rich girl, you have to do it in a rich family.  I am also a rich son-in-law, I don't want to be a rich son-in-law, I want to be a rich son-in-law because of my father-in-law and not because of my father, you could not choose me, that was fate, but my father-in-law has free will, which is the difference between destiny and free will, I would explain it like this.  I am in astrology that you know father is destiny father in law is free will you have a choice ok who will become my father in law then if you are in a rich family you will marry  Want to do that I should get facility, my father-in-law should do something, I will not use that word but then no one knows, if a father is giving something to his daughter as per his wish, then giving means that you will not call it something.  Rang, if yours is like this then now you have to think that if they will choose that family then you will have to go and do the same, there I am not teaching, I am telling as an example.  I am doing this so that you learn that if you want, you will have to say 'Mummy ji' as forcefully as you don't even speak to your mother, you will have to say 'Papa ji', you will have to parry, you will have to give that vibe that even though you are not from a rich family, you will have to say big but you are big.  He is taking good care of us, giving us a lot of respect, he can't show that attitude by going there, Mithun Chakraborty 's 80's movie, we too are treated unfairly, how are we, so what happens then that, that Rich father will say, what a useless character you are, meaning one is he is singing such songs to my daughter and he himself doesn't have any facility and one is also passing the wrong time, meaning giving means what is the future, meaning he wo n't be able to handle my business.  Neither will he be able to handle my wealth nor will he have the wisdom to handle it. Okay so you will have to think like that how will that girl or girl's family and the same thing is true for girls.  Also, if a girl wants a boy, who should be like this, this, this, loyal, just now, this is the thing which I was reluctant to hide, okay, I was afraid to hide, okay, this is wrong, Hindi, okay, you understand what I am saying.  Okay, sometimes he is Rohit Sharma or his captain, he also says like this, hey, see, do that, I do n't know what he is saying, it's fine, but if the people around him understand, then my subscribers understand now. Acharya Prashant's people can go at this moment, that too by writing to me in the comment section, now I am talking to my people, okay, so what I am trying to say is that if a girl says that a boy should be loyal, then you too 10  Do n't hang out with people, you are hanging out here with 10 people, now you want him, he will hit you only because you have to marry some buddy, whatever is in your mind, then think that if he is like this  If someone exists then how is he searching? You have to become what he is looking for and if you don't become then you will not get that too, that is why today people have become so ruined that they are thinking in their mind why marriages are not happening today.  Because I am the number one marital consultant in India, my best course of pre-marital counseling is that, take membership of Sango Lai Sut, you will see the first class is excellent, okay, so let's move ahead, then why is it not happening because you  It is okay to make a program outside, but you have got nothing to attract that thing to you, whether it is a girl or it is a boy, I teach the skills to attract it, say what you want, I want this, then I am like this.  I see at the current status, it could not happen in this life, Thakur, it could not happen with you, Munna, it could not happen. Okay, so now it could not happen with you, why couldn't it happen? Because you do not have the capability, that is, if you have a magnetic field or an attractive force, with such a small magnet, you will not be able to attract such a big iron object, but if you are such a big magnet, then you can attract it, you understand.  If you are, then first of all it is simple things, I say respect in life, have the ability, talent and the hard work to get what you like and please like what you get most.  Of you will have to settle for less You will have to lower the standards No father is also not rich No not very handsome but will settle down I am an arrow in which pumpkin I am also like this I am earning 500 brother this  She is earning Rs 28000, she will get married, here girls earn Rs 40, boys are needed, those with Rs 4 lakh are not boys with Rs 4 lakh, what a man they have become. Old man, are you going to marry divorcees or are you going to trap married people by having extra-marital affairs? Be practical na friend, you will get married in early time, if you get married in 23, 24, 25 years then this is what will happen then what do girls do 30, 31, 32  It happens that while searching for it, I have not found it. Yes, it is the one that awakens the intellect, conscience and consciousness. Yes, I will find it. Basically, she is searching for the one worth Rs. 4 lakhs because  I have got 2 lakhs madam, you should have done it before the one of 5 lakhs, it does n't matter, a husband who needs your salary will respect you more, I want to tell all this to the people of 40000, I want to get your 4 lakhs also.  First of all, he will get rid of your job and then that 4 lakh rupees person, there are many scams and solicitation programs, don't think that those 4 lakh rupees are going to your account. Girls, it's me with a package, he has already got a loan of Rs 4 crore from his parents, he has spent the same money in the marriage of two sisters, he is already sold, for the next 20 years you will go and think that  When you see his bank statement for the first time or you come to know the truth, he will say that he has been robbed, he has been robbed, better than this, the one with Rs 80,000 which was equal to yours was not looted anywhere, that Rs 700 was yours.  Would have respected Hajj's duty, would have gone ahead with you, would have worked in the house too. Now the husband worth Rs 4 lakhs and the daughter worth Rs 40,000. Suppose if there is someone then brother, you will have to do all the work. Lat Sahib earns 10 times and this will tell you to leave.  Will I leave you for your job of Rs 400 thousand? Should I make these adjustments? You are a child, after seeing all this, these girls start feeling very bad again. When they were looking for that.  If I get this much, if this happens, then there will be programs for him too. Are you that person, because what is wrong, you got it by mistake, why are my marriages not working? By paying such a huge consultation fee to me, I am giving this knowledge to people.  What I am giving you for free is that brother, you thought that our luck has woken up, we don't speak like this, our luck has woken up, our daughter has got married to you, is it a bungalow, is it a car, is this but that is the mother-in-law's.  and father-in-law  If he has a child then it is just like that there, your daughter will get it after he leaves and he will leave after 50 years and he also has a daughter and maybe another son or daughter, so he can give half or quarter or even the whole to her.  If it is your daughter, then she will not go in that. I had also done a case study. Your daughter is an actual example, the one standing behind the Desire, in which the butler of that house also travels. It was not told that she will travel in it to get vegetables and bajji. Someone said, yes, that's why they brought your daughter so that she can be so tame and submissive and they did not bring such an extremely educated dominating intelligent, they just brought her to see if she had any luck. Features are fine, chest height and weight are fine, children will be born later, this was their thinking, you thought that our wealth has woken up, no one's wealth is waking up, today no one's wealth is waking up, everyone is theirs.  There are girls, one and a half boys, above them are a lion and a quarter lion, all these things are going on in life and this number one of India is telling the right thing of this society because many have it, many have not, we are the best every day.  They collide and everyone collides with us, they come and say no one is number one, number one does not have number two, this is the truth of life, nothing great is being found in life, one is getting it as it is and if you are getting something great then it is.  I have caught a lot Repeatedly told that luck is not waking up, if someone comes to know later, then think once that if you are like this, then why is he getting married, is he doing something else somewhere else? Also, when I teach some things to people in webinars, one of my main dialogues is 'Whenever it is too good to be true, anything in life. When ever anything in life is too good to be true.' Then it is not true, it is not true, so always remember this thing, do it with just this much, you are sitting with this much beauty, if you yourself are 5 feet 7 inches, then you boy can get married if you are 5 feet 10 inches. Kaif type fight is fine but then there should be something inside you, then it is ok, there should be something inside you, then there is nothing else to attract that much, then you will not be a brother, then you can reach your 5 feet 2 inches 5  Foot 3 inches Find all this 5 feet 5 inches Find it And the same thing goes for physicality It goes for mental This thing and money things These are all three things in a marriage These three things are the only things Boys go more for physicality  Girls go more on this, hold on to this one thing, this is a fact because earlier what used to be, resources and power were seen because there was no bank, there was no money, so today's days are the best of the times.  Because what was there earlier were the men who were strong and like the selection takes place in the Animal Kingdom, Narmada, see it in Net Jio, I have seen a lot of Net Jio, it is okay, I took a lot of knowledge from Net Jio, I was in a place many years ago.  I was stuck somewhere in my life and I only knew the channel Net, so I watched that lion and leopard and this female does this and speaks from behind in Hindi, a boy and a girl have watched a lot but I have learned a lot from them.  Okay, you guys too, these days I do n't know that people watch it, I too have n't watched it for 15 years, I watched so much of the internet that I stopped watching TV, okay, so those earlier times were like that if you  If you are strong then you will take all the females. Be it a lion in any species, whether you are a monkey or whatever, it is okay, but how good is a human species that even those who are not like this have been given the opportunity to brother.  You You become better with intelligence, you become better with money, you become better with nature, you become better with speaking, even then Roma boys don't understand how much chance they have, otherwise brother, everything will be taken away by those alpha males of yours.  That one does not come in Animal in the first scene, Ranbir Kapoor doing cigarette and hair like this and Dhichak Dhichak Chhoti Si Aasha, that is not the song of Aap log sab sab wahi le jaayenge Dilwale dulniya nahi le jaayenge alpha male le  Ours and yours too and everyone else's brides will go but thankfully all this is there in this society that actually now other things also make a difference since this is so much of variety that is why everyone has a chance of getting married otherwise they are like this, boys with bad intelligence.  They are sitting, they may never be there but this is the system that girls get attracted by doing those things, okay then this is your chance, so I hope I have given clarity about marriage now.  While leaving, tell me, have I removed any confusion, have I given or increased any clarity, because I come and become wide-eyed that brother, this Acharya Prashant is not giving clarity, he is increasing the confusion, what have I given, have I succeeded, then please comment section.  Write in 'Total Deee Became That Person' whom you want to marry, is the one seeking that person. Like they say, if you are a hunter then he is also a hunter, so what is he looking for?  You are seeing that you have to become that person, only then will you meet, only then will you meet, this color word means only after meeting, you will get married, it will not happen otherwise, you are this one here, someone is searching here, this one here is searching here, if you want to marry this one. So this will have to be made, then you say no, if I have become here, then I will search here, it will never happen again, this has to be seen also, you will have to look below many times and I personally am very happy in my consultation that I have got many girls married. Brother  You have become very big, so marry this person and she agreed and many girls are also changing, I know it, at the end of the video I will tell you, this boy is this and this girl is this.  So palla is like this, sorry, boys are like this, they are a little down, they are upset and my subscribers are also sad that yes Guruji, girls, I am doing a little bit, I am also giving knowledge to the girls, now or not brother, now don't think like this.  boys mean  She is less in physique, she is also less in appearance, see some decency, because if you want to settle down, then see a little of that also. Okay, so I am teaching all this and the girls are learning it at all. There was a time when I was out, but now.  I am going to influence here, now I am going to sit with the boys team and explain to the girls team, there was a time when I move here and there, I am both, so wherever I sit, the one who is with me wins.  Only that team wins, okay, so right now I am sitting here on behalf of the boys, if you boys are my subscribers then increase more subscribers, take me to the level of wisdom, intelligence and consciousness a little, if you take me a little then I will wake up everyone.  There is no one above me in practical. In practical, I do not quote any book, do not quote anyone's old knowledge, do not say anything that goes over my head, my aim is to explain, even if I have to take 12-14 minutes more, but I  I can teach this very well in one and a half to two and a half hours and that will make you perfect. If you want to do that kind of session, brothers and sisters, then please write in the comment section that yes we want to attend that session in the weekend.  I will make a plan, I will reach out to thousands of people and we will do it well. Okay, so if you want to join, please do join. Tell me how you liked this video and do it."

    "title": "Why All Calculations Shown To You For Retirement Planning  Are Wrong ？ [Ualuz0Xk57I].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today's topic is Wrong Calculation, Dan by Most Financial Influence on YouTube Regarding Retirement, what mistakes do people make about retirement, because what is the point in life, I also do happiness course, I also do other things, one happy, one practical.  You also need a question, many people are of the opinion that it is okay to buy raw vests on SIP or get them on email or it is not okay to go anywhere like Starbucks.  Why do you want to drink coffee for Rs. 400? Why do you do this? If you save like this then it will happen like this. If you save like this it will happen. Then you will save money like this. Then a day will come when neither teeth nor hands will remain. Okay, it seems golden ahead.  It is not golden, retirement is a very very problem, it is not golden, I want to tell this because it is not about Mani because you guys know that I do very little else.  By now, my audience knows me brother, when old age comes, when retirement comes, it is not that now everything has become less for you, your wife is in trouble, her health is bad, money is being demanded for the married life of children, give me money.  Give something, because in India it does not happen that one has seen one's own life, it is a different matter if it is America, it is okay, your age, we will see it will go away and ultimately we have to go to the old home, it is not like that now.  You give all the formulas of America's content. Those who are 40 here are making some plans for their retirement at 30. They will not be working in India [Music] At 55 or 60, if you stop wishing, then date premise needs you.  Question: Why should I live my life in such a frugal manner that I can spend only 55 minutes and then I have to live for 95 minutes and I am short of money?  And I did not enjoy anything by tightening everything, brother Kant I said no, I will reduce it till 65 years, I will reduce it till 70 years, even till 75 and I will establish such a system where my assets will give me cash flow. Instead of getting into financial assets, I keep giving, because this is a very, very important thing, it is getting very messed up. In all the videos on retirement, just like you see, give your retirement a little 5.  Years will delay you can bomb very comfortable plus you really don't know what your aspirations will be you really are not your retirement will be can you remove these 56 things from your calculations which put pressure on you sadanasonially make you a millionaire too  I give it to everyone, if these people can't make it, I'll make it for myself. Write down that it's not a boy, it's a girl. Brother, you can spend money on your child's marriage. You can do it right.  It is yours, it will not work, it will not work, there is no guarantee, no, the rakhi is made of gold paste, it is only worth Rs 18000, it was going for her for so many years, tell me about her marriage, there is no marriage, I will not do this, this is a girl, this is a boy.  Do n't just spend it, why spend it? The next man is very talented, he is the one who is getting married today, 99% of the marriages are taking place, boy up to 40000, 20 30 40 50 thousand, girl this  Is it happening that a boy with a salary of Rs. 3 lakhs is getting married to a girl with a salary of Rs. 2.5 lakhs? It is much less than 1%. I am telling the numbers of the entire country, so where to spend the money, the tension must be raised, who knows in the future.  Your children will invite you to the wedding, whom should you marry, what to do, you are preparing for that and for that, go to Starbucks now, feed the child also, I am not promoting it in myself, I am not a father, it is better to go and think somewhere else.  Is there any affiliate marketing of mine, Rakhi Hai, my name came out of my mouth and take the name of some fancy restaurants, you spend money, movie is fine, then if you are not bhogoge, then you should donate your teeth, no one can do Indian, if you know then your children.  We can do it for them, we will kill our own blood, okay then do a cutter for them, save it, if you do n't do all this then it will never be destroyed, we don't know what is the financial economic system, you are buying gold, you are buying real estate, you are taking everything and yours.  As such  Look, to withdraw your money, if I have to withdraw money from you in any way, if I take it, then if it is in real assets, it is difficult to withdraw, but if it is in air type, then it is easy to withdraw, suddenly some news will do the valuation.  A brother went and reported that brother, this is what the company is doing, everything was known in India, everyone knew everything, what is happening, there is nothing new in the report which was not in the public domain.  gave and he did something and printed the report  Gave him how much money was due to print the report, where did that wind go, where did all those lakhs of crores go, where did those lakhs of crores go, some were promoted, 2075% were his and the remaining 25% were also said in the remaining 25, I do n't know how much was his but someone 's fourth common man.  It must have belonged to someone, how will it go, how will it go, you people have to think big about this thing, you have done clear retirement planning, you have married a girl, the market has fallen by 25%, it has fallen by 20%. Now what will you do with all the returns like this because of marriage not waiting no marriage can wait marketing at the right time retirement not waiting at the right time which country will bomb which country what will happen you can not predict right  Give everything in this link you date date dajunt min date you don't invest I am not coming all over saying you are not I always tell us to invest everywhere  There is no need to leave any asset class, we have to invest everywhere, but it will be good for us, as the economy grows, if the base increases, then the growth may not increase that much. If a child taking 90% goes towards 95%, then it takes a lot of 5%.  In increase and 45%, the one who takes 50 will get 50 just like this, if father gives a little help, he will get 45 to 50, if he listens to the teacher a little, then 55 will be earned by doing some hard work himself. If you go with us, then a child with 45% can easily go to 60, but a child with 90 to 95 does not know how much has to be increased to increase two or two percent, so the date is going to happen, you see, this is their America's economy and  What happens in them is what I am telling you, if it is a formula, then whether you do Assam or not, the party will continue like this and the rates which they run by sajium are financial insulin sir, till your retirement.  If you get 12% then you will get 14%, you will get it or you will not get it, this is what I am saying, you will not get it for 2 years, 3 years, 5 years, you will not get it again, all these ajmpetions are wrong of yours, please do this planning for 30 years, don't plan.  Give me more 3 to 4 years, this is my message - Everybody wants retirement. If you are collecting a little from your nearest rivals, your relatives and friends in the present.  So see that you will earn money in the future also and you need to stay above the general public, just if you are middle class and you are protecting the middle class in your middle class that I can support the maid, her salary will increase.  As for that, we are not catering, we do our best so that everything of ours will increase but nothing else of yours will increase and tomorrow there is no idea of ​​aspirations as to where the expressions will go and the biggest thing.  The biggest problem in retirement planning is that the children do not know who is going to go where and what they are going to do and we are Indians, we cannot leave our children like America, 18 year olds are not kicked, even 28 year olds are not allowed to do so.  Do you know whether it is a boy or a girl, what are you doing for UPSC, who gives food, father, who gives clothes, father, who pays tuition fees, father, who pays the phone bill, father, internet, father, you have to watch a movie. Even if you want to have a girlfriend or boyfriend, then father, cut that and that too, you tell me, the one whose child is settled at 21-22 and starts earning money, what is the problem of his father's retirement and then he says that I am not a spendthrift.  Son, enjoy her marriage, don't spend money on your marriage. I have made assets, I will give them in your name, I will give you money before also, I will let you enjoy, but if you do n't spend money, then you will also be like this.  People may think, tell me how did you like the video, please share it and this is a misconception which I will call out and I am not trying to make personal attacks by criticizing anyone, okay but I am telling this because if someone tells this thing like this  No, he is scaring you, also you are a doctor, an astrologer, no ad can do any less than anyone without any rate, this is also a fact, this will happen to you, that will happen to you, only then the man acts and even then.  No  If you are harsh then it is fair, it may actually be fair, but look at the bonds of fair, you see this, friend, I don't know, no one knew in year 2000 what the jobs will be like in 2023, so how will people prepare you children.  For a job, the job gets changed in 7 years or 8 years. Now your child is a secret, I don't know what is going to happen next, because if I look at the teachers, then it is artificial. I am a student and I say, ask me any question and I get it ready and say that I need a teacher, how will everyone start doing their project work together and asked, I know after giving 4 GB, I took a printout, these days it is the same printout, printout.  Out project work in schools do you know kya naam rahe gaya ok to think what I am trying to say it is a dynamic world changing very very fast and we have you can not plan more give 5s 3S  C Just Can't You If in 2015 at the age of 16, anyone had thought that some type or thing would be achieved, it could be work from home or it could be something else, the only thing that is important is family and home and emotions and heart.  You need a roof for your child, you need security to live, you need a house to get married, there will definitely be a demand for a house from the girl's parents, like it or not, this is it, if it is going well, then this thing is one.  Practical living is the rest, who knows about retirement, where will the accounts be settled, what will happen, maybe you will keep doing less, after retirement, you have become something else like a consultant man, you are doing less and for the sake of your mind, if you want to do less then don't.  Get too much and repeat content is happening, one kind of picture was not made as if he says make something different, do n't think the public is stupid now because look here too there is public. You have to select and reject a content right in the comment section, this one, tell me a lot, friend, tell me how much, do SIP of Rs 500, then increase it by 10% every year, it does not increase, 10% tax for 10 years, inflation is increasing and there is no loneliness.  Is increasing and how can I increase it by 10% every year when it is 10000 15000 20000 30000  If there are 40000 fans then it increases but brother, when the one who has 5 lakh rupees, it again becomes ₹ 4 lakh, the one with 4 lakh is getting 3.30 lakh, the one with 3.5 lakh is getting exempted, this is also happening, you have  You have done a very simple stick calculation, 10% is a big deal, can't you increase your savings? If you are saving ₹1000 a month, then ca n't you save ₹1100?  Maybe after a year if you are saving Rs 10000 then will it be Rs 12000 next year? It's something like that. Had you not heard of that, then fold it once, then fold it twice, after folding it 32 times, people will cross a few lines, that means all the calculations are shown like this.  You give on excel by doing 1 + R tu di power n but here power tu di n do not do that how much savings will be there in WAN plus WAN tu di power n, I am saying that  If you hit a salary, then that salary also starts turning upside down and that is what is happening in India, no one is teaching you, think about making money rather than saving money, saving is important but saving will not make you rich today.  No one has become rich by saving money. If anyone has, tell his name, but it does not mean that it is not necessary to save money. No one has become rich by not saving money. This is also a fact.  Okay, so this is basically to tell you, brother, how much do you guys have to focus on and where do you have to look, I tell you my resources and income stream because I am a cash flow person, you are plotting and investing which you cannot enjoy every month.  In the stock market, Rs 1 crore becomes two, Rs 2 becomes Rs 2.2, but you can eat it by spending it, you can give it to me, you can roam around because you have supported the tax and then you will feel that the rate will increase further. Where's the cash flow, where's the income steam, where's the income streams that I can actually spend on my life style and  Everything in Capital is Protected and Increasing You Can't Leave on Absolute Investment Because You Don't Know When You'll Back  Today you catch a hold of a 65 old other time, it's okay, when you talk, he will say, I am leaving now, I don't want anything, my age is okay, but as soon as it comes to his money, you can't date him F or date C. Whatever sour bond he has kept, now he does n't know the specific thing, he will have to live till 95 and this is his right, but he has inflation 8% 9 sour, he doesn't know, the government says North.  In India it is said that because there are aspirations in it, it is not being calculated in numbers, okay, this also you people have to check, okay, so you have to think in note, Mani part's mine is this much and it will become this much like this.  I am not going to do that, the calculation is wrong, no, I have generated so much return stream, money also from income or from different things and this stream will remain and it will keep increasing and I don't know how much it will be but I will generate it multiple times.  I am doing it and I am involving it in my next generation so that they understand the stream, recognize it, watch it, protect it and expand it because there will come a stage when you too will become like this in old age, no one is telling you about those things. But I will make a video of this one, please share how you did, thank you."

    "title": "Why Do We Marry ？ Some Myths Broken About Marriage [4MQQ1h-aQko].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, do the same, I have something wrong about marriage, I will try to break the misconceptions, there is a champion in spreading misconceptions about marriage, this Acharya Prashant ji is right, he is a champion, if you apply the formula of Kant, convey, confuse, dem. Ask me anything, have you read the Vedanta book, have you read the Gita, have you read the next chapter? This confusion is not over yet.  I will clear it, those who are married are already okay, watch the full video, enjoy, okay, and those who are married, keep them as they are, and those who are their followers, brother, you also listen when Acharya Prashant ji says not to marry.  Get married but do it with someone who takes you up, who makes you a mean but good person and before doing this, first discuss the matter with some friends, why should you get married, I will tell you a little later, now I will tell you that this marriage is with him.  do it don't do it just like that  Take the marriage in your senses, don't do it just like that, don't do it, a man has given her a warning about marriage and then at 40 he will also say the right thing, brother, if you give whole milk to so much milk, then add a spoonful of poison and then  He said, the rest of the milk was fine. Hey brother, the poison is still innocent. Better than this, add water to the milk. If you add clean water, the milk will be diluted. Okay, you won't get that much power, but the poison is not going to the local one. two spoons inside  He gave poison within 1 kg, you too are okay, then he will end the program, that is, you will not say that 99% is good, try to understand, put the poison in desi ghee, still it is okay, Bjp, if you put the whole poison, then this is  The content they are posting is poisonous, the youth is deteriorating, I am worried about our country, I will make it and the cost of army till the net is very high, okay, their comments are 10 times the number of views I get.  They go and their army is all ready like this okay but never mind okay somebody needs you do it so I'm doing it okay you me the audience tell me how do you feel I understand what's going on which side  I am on your side friend, there is a basic common sense that if this person is here and this person is here and this person should marry this person because what is the rule told by Acharya ji, marry the person who takes you up, do it consciously.  So this person should do it with this, but give the rule of D, this note is applicable, you, us, this, he is doing this from the bottom, friend, if he is doing it, that is, a girl [ __ ] very well in the stage, she is very good, she is entangled, very good.  He has personality and is a small boy, does not do a job, does not earn money, is not responsible, is not spiritual, is not intelligent, he will be good for this, so this is this, according to Acharya Prashant ji, this boy should marry this girl. Do it, but whom should this girl marry? Then the Guru's knowledge should be university applicable, whatever Newton's formulas are, he has Einstein's mc² thing, whatever formula he thinks should be university applicable, it is not that it is not the reverse.  It is applicable because you have knowledge, everyone is becoming equal, second thing, marry consciously, marry him after seeing what kind of person he is, friend, you tell me all of them, like you 4 years ago  Were you the way you are today? How will you be after a year? Can you tell about yourself? On what basis will you marry a person? Have you seen something in him? How is something in a person? How will he be after five years? Are you very sir? Are you very sir?  About Yourself Which of you can take a guarantee for your son and daughter, if someone like me gets married and someone says, brother, tell me your son will not divorce our daughter, give a guarantee in writing or your daughter will not divorce anyone else.  Who will not have an affair or the boy will not have an affair? These days, parents cannot give a guarantee. No one knows what will happen to me, what will happen to my thoughts because there are too many variables to keep in mind. Marriage, Hajj, you happen on a torn lip. And the lip of trust among lot of people is going on in the society. I am telling this thing to you people that it is above me because in marriage you have to basically see that marriage is about giving note taking de moment.  You want me to have someone take me up It's about taking You can never be the show The next guy will give Won't give Only think You can't show About giving Only giving Ki Yes I'll give everything to this marriage It touches me  The second thing is that many people think that the day after tomorrow, Home You Love is a big misconception, according to the facts, according to the flexibility, we love, we love, that is why we want to get married, the marriage should not be based only on love, not on power only.  If you love then marry then you should marry whomever if not if you don't give fruit and you don't agree then give this please follow Acharya Prashant Ji Chetan Vivek Buddhi Jagao 303% Follow me Date Category 67 Bill Note Fruit in Date Category Dewar R  One in three people, I should not be married and marriage is broken when it is the day after tomorrow, I should not be my marriage, the day after tomorrow, I should also not be mine.  Deez tu people when they collide it leads to divorce as long as a man also loves marriage then home same should you love marriage because you love d institution of marriage you love d concept of marriage thoughts same no are you maybe end up loving that  Day after tomorrow more li love someone up you understand you can never lover day after tomorrow on a daily basis you can't jinke shaadi ho hai bata do can you love your  Wife everyday can you love your husband everyday can you love you parents everyday can you love you just can you love you job can you love you kids also every day people say to children everyday not child don't wake up from sleep on time and misbehave.  I am not doing my homework, I don't want to say anything, mother, if something is happening then you can't be loving and it is a commitment every time, this is my child, I have to raise it, it is spoiled, slap it with maroon love.  Should I do counselling, should I get consultation done, should I do therapy, should I do this, should I give knowledge, should I join hands, should I eat some good toys, should I tell a story, should I do anything, should I awaken my child, should I do anything? I should not give up until I commit. You don't have kids because you love kids. You have kids because of you.  Want you be a parent you understand this is a very thin line which you have to make people understand you just want  Do Things Because You Love Dem Doing Somethings Have You Been Like Driving So Devour Are People I Love Driving But Then Are People Be By Cars Because They Have You From One Play Store And Place And Date Driving Is Not A Very Joyful Experience Because  Everyday do you don't get to drive on an open highway in Rajasthan and next you go to the beach of Goa like a movie or a western.  You are going to the ghat or are in some nice romantic atmosphere, the car is very good, the partner is very good, the songs are very good, that is why it is fun, the GP ship is in water, India is lying in the traffic, there is a bad smell inside the car, there is noise from behind.  It has been that railway station after the railway crossing, all the Indians stand facing each other like this and then they go out in the dead hour like this, is it fun or not, do you have to drive, don't do it, then it's okay.  Don't do it if someone does the driving.  If not then you have to understand you are on d institution of marriage marriage is about giving because giving me ur very sir I bill give d best I bill try that I give to that person if he is doing something good then I bill give  D is the best shot, I should help him in that, as much as I have wisdom and discretion, I have to do what I want to do, he will not do it, that is his problem because bringing happiness and story in life is an individual.  Responsibility is that you don't get married, your wife will get you promotion, you don't get married, your husband will reach you, you don't know where, where he will give you happiness, what materialistic gene tax is imposed on you, don't give me a date if you are married, let's see like this. Your happiness is not going to be in your hands, so if someone else does it then say Sir but be very short because what is it, these people keep records, I did this much, what did he do, now he didn't do it.  Keep telling your side of the story, all are children of human beings, everyone wakes up on one stage when they get married, there is caste, why do we marry, why do n't we marry, he is giving knowledge on marriage, we have to keep it within ourselves because people like us  We are married, we were bachelors too, we have also seen bachelors, what is there in that, how much happiness was there in bachelor wood, where is it right in the bachelor wood, where is the one who is married, when you have not even tasted that laddu, have not eaten it, no, that is a matter of sour grapes.  Isn't it brother? No other married person should go to an unmarried person and say no. I am enjoying it a lot. I have to cry a little too. Yes, my friend, I am in love with you. It is good for you just because that is yours. Married people would say yours.  By the way, you have to have that relationship with them, you don't have to say anything like this, if someone doesn't have anything, then you are useless, you don't know because the good thing is not told, caste is the bad thing, it is only visible that  He could not go to the party or did not go to do the big timing or did not jump from the mountain. The story is that he is not able to make tents like this. Married people are not able to do this because yet how many other pleasures are they getting, he will not tell further.  The thing is, this does not mean that marriages are spoiled. Why do we get married? I have explained this in a very good way in my two-hour happiness course, but here I tell you in one line, if you want to take platinum number one happiness, then this is so.  saree because curiosity  You also have a lot to complete, so do it, take platinum membership and then share the knowledge, but still I tell you in two lines, you get married because you want, fitness is your life, sambadi bill witness, your life is your journey because you get married.  When you don't do it because of this basic human retirement, you were born and someone else is looking forward to the journey that your parents will pass away, siblings will pass away, children will also pass away.  Go but that is a journey of 40 50 years old adult, 24 25 years old to 75-80 years old, 50 to 60 years old married, which you see with pause with your wife and this is a basic human retirement and if  If this retirement is not met, then as Acharya Prashant ji says, then you will have to do a great job, as if he is saying that he is doing a great job because of this. Wants date people, you witness date only, you were born on Wikipedia, you go to YouTube, then you will be read as less great and if you do not do less great, which 99% of the bachelors do not do, they are not brothers, mother is less, because everything is there, then normal human being, all are great less.  If we do this then we don't know where the country or the society or the earth will reach. The great cannot be reduced, do you know that the great reducer Vivekananda ji can become everything, the rest who keep taking the name of politics is fine.  There are many politicians, there are not many bachelors, brother, you will become less PM, see for yourself how realistic you will have to become, you will have to become Swami Ramdev ji, he will have to go to the level, even if votes are taken, all the great people in this world till date. If there have been a thousand people, great people in this world, then 900 were married and 100 would be bachelors. 90% are still in marriage. Look at Sanatan Dharma, whoever we ask is one of us.  Hanuman ji is there and one half will be someone else, it is okay in the South and the names which are Bachelor Gods are ours, the rest are with our family, all our sages and saints, whom you are teaching Vedanta and all those things which are taught by Vedas and Buddhas. That all of them were married, brother, all of them were married, that is why we are so many, we are living till today, 144 crores have not reached such animate world, there is some other place as well, we have reached there only then and they are from the animate world.  When there will be no human children left then all those bachelors have to serve the society. This is not the society but Nannu's father is the one doing it. Prashant ji is enough to take his name if he becomes Nannu's father.  What a big thing you have done, it is a big thing because Nannu is the one who is building the society and his father is raising him and he is doing less. His father makes him go to work in the bus lane for which his mother does not do Nannu.  Nannu is on father's side, Nannu should not eat, nor should he live and sustain on this earth, you cannot do anything to him, you will raise issues, animals which are of good quality, why brother, ultimately, why should they sustain?  So the basic of substance is the same and it compares living in marriage with marriage and it is there and they do it like this and shout that the audience knows that this is nonsense but  I don't have the courage to speak because the aggression is like this. If you make someone like us sit, then tell us what to do. Yes, you see, it is a lot of fun. See, what is the problem in happiness and give one's happiness and take it from one person and that person from another.  Take it from here and spend your whole life here, if you are neither HIV positive nor AIDS, no sexually transmitted disease, gonorrhea or gonorrhea, and no dumping of society, then what is the problem, brother, these 10  15% people who do not have this retirement, why do you not have it, then how will children be born and if there are no children, how will life go on, I will tell you in more details in the future also, their content is such that instead of giving clarity to the war, it creates confusion.  Is taking you towards if you want and got confused because of clarity on the whole thing, war doesn't know anything, today he is ready to live in relationship in the name of sex, no one has any conscience.  Chetan is not awake, he has been this pushy, he is doing such and such, he is struggling with 40 types of diseases, okay, and the story is not reaching, and there is confusion, no, the marriage is not good, area 498, saree girls, area 498, are wearing Puri, all  We will put it on our hands, if we are worthy of it, we will put it on yours and we should also put it on our hands, if we beat the drum then everyone will go crazy, isn't it okay, if it doesn't happen like this, then the train will not run that day, it is not running here in India, it will not run further. No one wants it, everyone wants it not to happen and we do something for it not to happen, but still it happens and still the world goes on and if something happens here, then no, now one should not sit in the train.  The government should guarantee that this will never happen in life. Who will guarantee it? Brother, this clarity is very important in life. Sikh clarity is not a guarantee, it is a guarantee, so for something, we all will leave this life, one day there will be a marriage. It is a very good institution. is time tested  It is an institution, the color has spread across the world, there are very few things which have spread across the world, because everyone has their own tents, this color is accepted by some, some accept less, some religion is accepted by some, marriage is a thing, which is religious across the countries. Everywhere it is a big institution, now it is being attacked so much, it is not good for the society, for the country, for the future of the individual, maybe these 10 I can see that the period of 15-20 years went on but after that only this movement happened when people became fools and losers, till then he took his knowledge with a gun and every time he slowly started using our Jason's, who are also small YouTubers, who are like this. I will only say attack, it's okay, if it comes then you change it because the friend is religious, you said something very extreme and then you confuse him, I agree.  So does marriage, but then do it well, do it with him, then it gets spoiled a little and you become good, then it doesn't happen like this, don't learn like this I Hope Myself I Have Not Confused You At List Five Confused You Please  Type in D communication done, Guruji got confused, now if you want a little more clarity then clarity will come in other ways. If you are not confused on this, but if as much as I have told you now, then you have understood it because brother-in-law.  This note is one and the video because there is a lot of anger, there is a lot of pain, there are a lot of doubts, it means there is doubt in every party, boy and girl, this note is this, so slowly, slowly, hold the button one-one, two-two, three-three.  Only if you give me clarity, let's get married. Let us witness your life. Retirement is a basic human. In such a big world, you are the center of the universe. Whoever is listening to me, you are the center of this universe. You want it.  That friend, I was born, I am doing something, I have a struggle, I got an increment, I shared it with someone, I got promotion on the basis of peace, there is a struggle in my life, I had a small phone, a big phone, but this is a retirement, my growth and  To witness your journey, that is why we take photographs, we make all these things in the album and then physically we want someone to rank us nice and that can only be one of our like partner who knows you very well. Along with this, you can open up what you are because of other vices, then you will go in search of this spiritual thing, I will also call you Spiritual Narasim, I have taken this contract that only I know it, please tell me the names of the books, you have read them, you have read them, you are there.  We will take your test, you tell me what is written on page number 44, verse number eight, after reading it, tell me whatever you have read and he has also read the same, he should come and tell his.  And they are taking our religion from book or book based religion, I will give a lot of clarity to ISP also, this is a new rant started in Asan, people think of Sanatan Dharma, you are taking it on top of books, rest also, a book is a book. Everyone has kept it everywhere, the original thing that comes out from within, something of their own, what do I enjoy, what do I get happiness from, don't leave it, Sanatan Dharma is such a deep religion, now I am against religion and this.  I will not do that but I will say that a lot of your things are good, here Sanatan Dharma is of level here, why should you take it down to the level? Have you read the book? And that knowledge was also written by someone till some time, there was an amendment policy in everything, there is gold understanding and if you will say then maybe I have a separate one because I too am an astrologer brother, all that astrology too.  All these Vedas are written in these Vedas. All this is not written in a separate book for you. Saree is Rakhi, I tell it in a simple way in a different way, without coming, the heroine came next. Have you read that?  Let us tell you normally, if it is a small thing then the next one will understand that it is your tax, where is the knowledge coming from, it is not the page number that makes a difference, this is our education system, this is junk, hey everyone.  Possibilities There is something bill on you Something on bill note on you depends on you Knowledge is this but this bill is different on everybody You ca n't impose on it is written here it is this is this is this is this is this is this is this is this is this note is this is this note D 10 more of Hinduism No I Don't Believe in Gods It You Are a Good Hindu He is also a cutter Those who will read books will read these scriptures Will read Vedas He is also one  Brother, this is the one who does n't believe, because the one who doesn't believe also believes that he doesn't believe, that is, he believes, he too has a belief, the only thing is that he is not someone else's, he is, so both are equal.  The longest two are curious. To prove my point, you understand that now I will not make it longer, it will be too deep, then it will go from the top, but I will keep giving this dose slowly. These two have as many followers as they have, the children are getting spoiled.  You will have to give a counter view point to the parents who are feeling unhappy, it just suits you because what Acharya Prashant ji is an action election, ultimately if the genuine conscious intellect Vivek Jagar is going to the mountains and doing something, then those percentage people will also help the society.  I don't want to agree, but you can't take everyone there, just like not all can become plumbers, not all can become electricians, not all milkmen can become, not all can become doctors, not all can become engineers.  Not all can become astrologers, we cannot all become teachers, every friend is important, this is also the case brother, not all people can be like this, we cannot become anything here by awakening our conscience and intellect, the society itself will end, you will serve someone, you will be abroad now.  Look at the countries, what is the situation, what is happening inside Japan and what is happening in Europe, whom will he serve, when he will not be there, will Nannu's father and mother do, will the population be more, then you Do your part to make up for the lack of something. I make your parents a secret by making marriage a secret. All those who speak against marriage, neither did they like their parents' marriage when they had children, nor did they like their parents' marriage because they used to get food.  Marriage is broken, now tell your parents that marriage is useless, I am still emotionally dependent on the parents, I am the parents, that's why who else has the place, so how did the parents come to this marriage on their own?  The institution called them, when they themselves were born, the marriage was very good, two or three children were born, after timing it, if five or six children were born, then the marriage was very good because it gives you comfort. Now when it comes to reducing your own.  If I have to endure that time, then now marriage is not good. Marriage is good for the parents. If the mother gives you the marriage, then it is good. But if the wife or husband or children give the marriage, then it will be a responsibility. Come on.  Ok  If you want to give a star, if you want to understand, then tell me. And people are not able to forget that by going on the mic and making noise in an audio story, you are talking crazy and after doing this, tell me about it, but if it is, then give it only.  Do you want happiness by giving pleasure? What is the problem? It feels good. It feels good like eating food. But isn't it an animal? Isn't it animality? Is it a child? You should not eat boxes and this should not be done, so it is a child.  If yes, then humans are also animals.  Mother, we have to save each other, is n't it only to save the animals, do n't give birth to any more animal children, then the animals will become 10 times more in the world and the humans will be less, then big clapping, big consciousness woke up, very good, someone do the logic.  Come on man, at least do some logic, you would have embarrassed them by saying this thing and you don't have the courage and it is only the middle class that is getting involved in this, no other class is coming into this, a different Bageshwar Dham type of lower class is going on. Keep looking for your own people, okay Rich will never tell, he has some private limited company, okay, everyone else finds their own, wherever they can find an escape, he is going there, if he reduces the hours by 15 hours, then he did not hear.  I don't have to get private, then I don't get money, then I grow beard, then my face is useless, I do n't get any girl, I don't get married, I don't have honey, my body has become weak, so what is your choice, you have the wisdom and discretion to wake up and come and do the role again.  Jinn Adiyogi is like what are you like, Acharya ji doesn't say like this, Acharya ji says like this, he says like that, alam Balam, make 20000 videos and then say no, it was good in that, oh poison, what did I tell you, this is enough again and again.  I gave the example of milk. If two spoons of poison are added to the milk then it cannot give him the sin because if poison is added then is there any milk left in it? This much germs are enough to insure the society and then I am its antidote. Am I there or not? Tell me, am I reducing myself? Tell me, is it okay? Do you agree, what don't you do? You tell me, he is like Amitabh Bachchan with aunty, Dharmendra wala. Aunty ji, what does the program do? Because a good person can make himself good, he cannot make others good, this is the truth of life. I hope you guys enjoyed it. Please share and like. Thank you very much."

    "title": "Why Do You Sleep Late At Night ？ [gSVhrFwkbT8].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, this is a very important topic. It affects maximum people in society. You have to share this video with everyone. The topic is why do you sleep late at night or are you sleeping late at night? You are awake till very late, especially because of social media. I will also add a little bit about youngsters and ponies and I will also give ideas about them. Generally we will discuss why he is sleeping late. Many people normally discuss that one should not sleep late, one should sleep early.  Benefits of waking up early Disadvantages of sleeping late Friend, everyone knows this These are childish videos okay, you know my content is a bit higher order and a bit deep so I am going to explain some deep things It is going to be a lot of fun First of all we should do  The world is ready to tell what is needed, but someone should tell us why we are doing this, this is very important because it is very easy to say this, give up alcohol, give up smoking, don't do such wrong things, you should live like this, do Kapalbhati in the morning, do it like this  Everybody knows this, eat food like this, don't worry like this, do meditation, all this  You know it doesn't happen, so the reason is that first he should learn why it is happening and then he should learn how to stop it, everyone knows those benefits, there is no need to count the benefits of sleeping on time And what are the benefits of sleeping properly? Why is it happening? The routine of people today has become such that they are not living consciously and purposefully. They are wasting a lot of time in such pursuits and things that by the evening you yourself realize it.  I did n't get anything, I didn't get anything, I came late from work, didn't eat food on time and then realised one thing that it's already 10 o'clock and me time hasn't even arrived yet, then at 10, 10:30 me time starts and  Then we don't know how two, three or four hours pass by in our me time, and even in our me time, people may not be consciously aware of this thing, but what is happening subconsciously and it comes to our mind that I have lost this sense of my mind.  So you start listening to some things, you might be listening to my videos as well  You must be listening to Gyani too, although I am also a number one clarity giver, but after listening to his words, the purpose is not met anywhere, then you get distracted and then say that oh I have worked hard, now let's do some entertainment, now that entertainment thing  He wakes up at 12 o'clock, when he messes up for two hours that he thinks that nothing happened here as well, now something else, now in the affair of that and that, depending on the age group and gender and what ever the situation, it changes for everything  It is separate, then they enter into it, so people are sleeping at 1 o'clock or 1:30, you identify it through this, after that some other attempt is made to wake them up, the public is doing only two things, there is nothing else because when it does not wake up  So then an attempt is made to awaken it, what happens is that there is nothing great here either, and then the telecast is repeated every day, then the story from 10 o'clock, then I remember your story, this is happening with everyone, the ways to avoid this are, first of all, whatever work you have to do  Have to consume social media anywhere One thing to look at in any content creator is that there are so many click baits that the matter inside is not that much, something else is promised outside, you are not going to become rich by watching any content, you are not going to become fit by watching any content Nothing great is going to happen to you with any content, the only thing is to follow that thing plus use that content purposefully, do not follow more than 10-12 content creators, you cannot follow practically, people subscribe to 1.5 crore channels but do not watch them  It is not that you like one video of someone, no content creator is taking you on a journey, I try, I have my own different channels, at least I am conscious that if you are connected with me, connected every day, then  You will feel like you are on a journey that I was somewhere and I have reached somewhere now and maybe I will reach somewhere else, this is not my job of doing grinding of the mill that I come everyday and do SIP of mutual fund, now you will make one crore on Excel, now you will make two crore In 30 years, you will become a millionaire in 40 years  If you invest, you will earn this much, I say invest for 90 years and you will directly earn thousand crores because why don't you put 90 years in that Excel, if you did so much in 90 years, then there are people like Ankur Warku and  It is necessary to take the names of a few more but they don't take you anywhere, you are not reaching anywhere and then after consuming so much of this content your subconscious feels that if you are not reaching anywhere then you will reach something else because your soul needs that to reach. Thing happiness and purpose and that feeling of reaching somewhere, something is happening that when I wake up in the morning, I get up a little smarter than I was while sleeping today or than what I was when I woke up this morning, I do some research, I do webinars, I do courses, I speak in them, brother. You should write it down because it will be like a satsang, as long as you are connected, you will enjoy listening, three-four useful things will be discussed in 15 minutes, write down those four lines and read those lines again sometime and follow it a little  Then life will change, it is not happening just by listening, this is the biggest thing and whatever time you are wasting during the day, whatever so- called work you are going to do at night, you can do that work even when you are wasting your time  Now look at how many things you are wasting your time in, and the time wastage that is happening is happening in the inability to say no, to please that person, to please that person, you went there when you were purposefully Suppose at 8009 you have achieved something during the day then you can say that now I will just relax, I will not stay awake till late, I will also watch these videos purposefully for one and a half hours, I will also give you hints on how to watch the videos In any video, within the first one and a half or two minutes, you get to know what is going to happen. Whenever you are listening to any good one and a half or two minute videos, you feel that this dish is very good.  If yes, then download it or save it for yourself. Now play it in my playlist as it is mine.  Do I have any videos now, I will claim mine, you can see all of them but it is possible that I also come on different topics, all of them do not concern you, if you are a housewife, then job will not concern you, no one should invest in real estate  If you want to do it then he will not understand it as a stock person, if someone does not want to understand a mental model then I also have a buffet, but the video which you feel that friend this is good or it is a hit and because I had given so much to me, where is he, oh my friend No one even remembers, I have already done 1500-1800 videos, so keep the ones you like. Similarly, whichever content creator you like, you keep a different masala of it and then when you are sitting comfortably, you can use it purposefully.  Consume, make notes and then do your own thing because this soul wanders from 10 to 12 on everyone's social media, those doubts, doubts, doubts are going on, that useless content is coming and going, film content and this one too, I have done it purposefully myself.  of the people of  So I started consuming something like this so that I can save you guys' time, someone said to me Guruji, you say that you don't watch pictures, you do this, so you started reviewing pictures, on my other channel I have Guruji from Gurugram  I have a new channel, on that I am doing reviews etc., of movies, of everything, so you are telling me to do something in life, and watching these movies does not achieve anything, and there will be no benefit, this will not happen, it will not happen  That will not happen, I replied to him that friend, for me watching movies is work in the office, I am earning money by reviewing movies, you are going to the movie for entertainment, I am going there and saving your time or by telling you about it beforehand  That bhaiya is it worth going to or not worth going to and after seeing my five six seven reviews I will also gain credibility, the movie which I said was bad turned out to be good, you liked it okay and the one which I said was very good you found it bad and  If this thing happens three or four times then I am a useless content evaluator for you because look, for many people, even then I can be good, okay so that means my frequency and explaining to you is that okay then do n't consume me, tell me brother I will not see your review, your reviews are like that only but many people are liking my reviews very much now they know that friend  He watched the web series, understood it, tested it, evaluated it, reviewed it and recommended it because I never give spoilers. You will never find spoilers in any of my reviews. Whatever is latest, there will be an analysis later. You may be there in the analysis but not in the review.  So this is how you have to consume consciously and sleeping late at night is happening only because your subconscious knows that even today you can use deity words and there can be other good, dirty and bad words too but you are a fool  A man can say that your subconscious is saying, hey idiot, you spent today also, nothing came out of your life, now you have not realized anything today, as if you are stuck in this mood of the world, this, the same job, the same boss, this is like this  Some?  Life is not moving forward, you did not get any idea, you did not find anything workable, look further, you may get a SIP, someone is giving freedom to Ankur Wari in 30 years, someone is giving it in 25, someone is giving it in 40 All such claims are being made, someone here, do this, do that, become an empen, become like this, become that, there will be a clear video on this also that this is also a disease that you will want happiness, in what is happiness, in how  I will tell you a little about it, my Happiness Course One and Happiness Course Two are very iconic courses, if you take platinum membership of the channel, then you will get to see them, recently there was Happiness Two Conclusion, there are six or seven, okay, you will get to see those as well You can take membership and consume the content carefully. Evaluate the content. If you or someone else does not like the content, then there is no need to go there again and again and waste time. See who will take you on the journey in the content. what are you going to do that you got involved with  Did you move ahead and get the feeling that yes, I have moved ahead? If you followed a creator for two-three months, you should get that feeling, right? So brothers and sisters, before leaving I am asking you guys who are associated with me, are you subscribers?  Platinum members are already saying that a lot of good is happening, that is a matter of expense but I am asking the free ones, I am asking the free ones, do you people feel after consuming my content cross channels that this is what I have said  He spoke in English, you are going on a journey, you are reaching there, there is a feeling that we are going somewhere, we will reach somewhere, something is happening somewhere, at least I am asking you to shed the load, I am asking you to shed the extra baggage, so if you do this  If you feel like it then stay connected and consume such purpose full content and find purpose in life and only then you will have to sleep because you should have an idea of ​​what you have to do the next day by 8 pm, only then will you be able to sleep and  You will feel like getting up in the morning to do that work for which your Eureka has come.  It's a day now but if you have wasted your time with losers saying that this is a scam, that is a scam, you have said that Sandeep Maheshwari has a big army but I have to take the name of that Sandeep Maheshwari by choosing content like that You took it, however they too have started copying my content because their content writer must be thinking that this is a small channel, take it from him, who is going to tell us, I am not telling Sandeep Maheshwari ji, if he knows it then maybe he won't  If one consumes it, he says that he has seen it but only the topics that are visible to me are the same as usual, middle class ones, just like that, I have posted the UPSC one, so people send them to me, so now I say that I am number one, I have the original clarity. I am a giver who is raising the issue, I am raising the issue in originality and I take lot of happiness and satisfactory issues that now I have told you the reason for sleeping late at night, it is very easy to say don't sleep the whole day  Take your time as if someone  He is asking for a note from you, do n't take it and give it to me for free, this is the message for everybody, what did I learn today, like on every video of mine, my request is, write a video set name, write the date, write something whenever I hear it and in one line  Write that today we learnt this, the purpose is full, we have to consume the content, we cannot sleep because we are getting all that knowledge, we are actually getting it and we are not getting that much from real people, father is not able to give it, mother is not able to give it  As far as the colleague is not able to give, there seem to be people who are willing to give, but we are not consuming it purposefully and there is a lot of noise in it, meaning that the useful thing is available in less quantity and the things around us are available in excess.  And there are many other things like motivation etc. It is fun to listen to them. I will make a separate video on which friend we will find and which friend is good for us. I will also make a separate video on happiness for now.  There was such a dose, please tell me how did you like it and further you please do it purposefully  consume content thank you very much"

    "title": "Why Does Your Boss Keep You Busy On Weekends ？ ｜ A Counter Strategy Suggested [HcT1pddXJP8].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, I have come because of 11 in two films. It is very interesting. It is good for the job seekers. What is the phenomenon and whose side am I in it? I will tell you what to do. It is going to be very interesting. First of all, it is a phenomenon for the people on weekends.  In the job of keeping a BG, the review is on Monday in the corporation sector, did you tell me on Saturday or will someone give such a low salary on Friday that Saturday will turn into Sunday's curd, so many of your places are open on Saturday.  Gone has started to subside and if nothing else, one tomorrow has started saying tomorrow is tomorrow, tomorrow is tomorrow, okay your tomorrow is at 1:00 o'clock, again he has not said, tell me again if it is not, he is busy with that story, go and watch a movie, go out  Girlfriend wife ca n't eat or drink anything, okay this is a phenophena, this is a phenophena, but why has this happened, this is another positive form of phenophena because all these poor people have happened to themselves.  Conversation and discussion are not you, I bat from both the sides, I tell you people, I give consultation here too, like Prashant Kishore ji gave to Congress, he gave to BJP and also to criminal Congress, Nitish Kumar gives to everyone. Now we are doing something of our own, okay, so I am also like this, okay and I am telling Ka, I also tell them how to tighten and I also tell them what to do, batting from both the sides.  does this for free  I do it fine, but nowadays I have started consulting even cooperative employees, so if you are a corporate employee and you are 83 from any situation or from many situations with the company, then I don't think anyone in India is doing it because of copper.  The trainers here are giving obesity to only these people, so they give it to the common man, what will he give to them, motivate them, tighten them, do everything, now understand the joke of IT.  These people are BGing you on Saturday Sunday so that you can start your private company in the name of sitting and everyone has started doing it and it is a very good thing, today no corporate employee is satisfied with one when and whoever is doing it.  The company could grow only because of planting out anytime thanks to power and awareness is being spread life economy is being spread what is there in this If you are an employee then please listen to it. It will be fun. If you are from the IT sector, even if you are from the non-IT sector, you can steal the template to apply the formula.  He will have to use his creativity but the biggest reason is that he just wants to tighten up what the management has done, he knows that he can wish for something more and he knows something. Every employee comes to the office with two phones and does not do anything. If the company does some activity on the laptop given by the company, then I will catch it. Is this not bought with a laptop worth ₹ 1 lakh? If you want to do a small business, then everything is taught to you.  Earlier too, that company used to do snooping on its employees, how was it caught because on its own, you can catch everyone who is doing what on their phone, on their given phone, on any electronic device given by them, now this is their second leak.  There are very interesting videos going on and enjoy watching more. I am the head of a lot of offers. Since my YouTube channel Chale Achhe Chale, I used to tell earlier also that it is okay to come and give knowledge to people according to corporate, that is not from me at all. I can't at all, I can't see any corporate person giving his life for which company, the amount team, I have said that this is Chhath, it should not be done at all, now I am batting for it, no one does anything for it, a poor bus.  In a corporate setting, there is a laugh in the stomach, you will also laugh at this thing, everyone is removing it from there, you are no reduce stress, manage stress, you are happy, this has to be made because I have been called for all these things.  Come on sir, if you don't do this then do this one, hey uncle, why are you giving stress here, I mean it is right that the height should be taken by the doctor sir, you do one here which hurts, then it bandages, oh you are giving this pain.  Why are you staying and for this they have programmed him for his life, but he has to attend the program because he is experienced, that is why I am telling him about the program, when I find out which department you belong to, which is the laziest department, where there is no stress.  It's not only those people who come where the real sex is getting curdled, she is poor, she has not left but she has got money for the program, she gets money, but you also know that and that's what I used to like.  of  Brother, I am a salesman and whoever achieves the target, I am his servant, he feels stressed, then if you are the one with stress, you are the one who is going to achieve the target, you are not getting the review, you are not getting it, your mind is racing as to how to navigate it, it is a maze for him. My tax team does the consultation at a cheap rate. I don't do it at my own rate. My rate was very high. This is done at a cheap rate. I will not do all these games. My tax team is a specialist. He has learned from me too, he has also learned from me and he himself is a great expert, so from him you will get to do direct concentration and you will get to learn and you will have fun. The biggest thing is to give a hint by pressing.  I was going to say, listen, now if you want to do something morally then do it, but I am telling you that you should think that all the employees are doing less for the East India Company in a way and these are the things.  So, should they be helped by brothers and sisters and should they not be helped? There is an IT company, its project is running in Poland or Switzerland or it is running in such and such manner and it has taken huge amount of money and this one is an employee star.  It is like the employee team is the one who has to do the coding and wedding. He is the star employee. His life is fine and he is not living it. He is talented and he is paying less than the company.  It has been very good sir and every day you have done this, you are getting salary and this project is doing it. This company of the project is giving so much money to this company. What, brothers and sisters, if this is the star artist then will he leave his company and go to this company?  By typing this directly from a person, it can cost Rs. 110 for this company. This is the template. This is the template. Good clients. Hey, this will be a fraud. How will the company be cheated? How will someone take business from another company? You have created your own company, you have become a company, you have left that company, that company, you were just studying behind in that company, that was draining your life, and you are talented, your crying was only because you are hardworking, intelligent, good.  If you have the strength then try it and if you don't have it then stop then there is only one thing, power is there, torture is happening to you, whether it is going right or wrong, if it is going right then keep getting it done because you are a fool and you are trash.  ok we will read And if you are a horse, you know that you are intelligent, you have power, you are the star and the second thing is nothing else, three to five of your team who are terrorizing, take it with you also to those who will not be on my role because then I  I will also become like this company in the future, I will make more detailed videos in future. These companies which are running, in future there will be thousands of companies and every two employee will be a company with three employees, one employee is an implant, the company with 10000 because  If it is worth Rs 10000, then the system has become so much that terrorists will do it, they have something to do with the process, they have something to do with the discipline, the discipline should be right, but I have nothing to do with anything else, there is a joke about this in Haryana.  Okay, it's not a big deal, brother, a soldier from Haryana, sometimes this happens to many people when they live in the system, they have to live in the system, I am not disrespecting them, it is okay and even in pain, they read it, which is okay openly.  Let me tell you, one of my army brothers comes, the discipline is very good and he comes on leave at home, when he comes on leave at home, you have seen that when he comes, everything is going well, he is a buffalo, he is milking it in the morning and  The music system is on, it's okay, they are milking, the buffalo is milking, and it is happening four groomsmen, make it a very sophisticated, good one, etc. everything is for the sake of its fatness, Rakhi and color are also being used. so friend  Meaning, that buffalo is at the center of activity. If the buffalo gives milk like this, you say, you will milk, but I will not milk, then it is okay. If it starts milking, then the comfort level of the buffalo is not right, neither is there music, nor is it color, it is that shade.  Even if the buffalo doesn't kick or give milk, then only he charges the sorrow, then he takes out anything else but ultimate non- story short, he says that he would come, someone else asks him, then he says that he wants it in every way, I say that  Discipline has to be corrected, I don't want milk, so sometimes what happens is that you are a stupid people, those who only want to correct your discipline, they don't want milk. You have understood from this joke, from this story, that some people are just.  Gate process is being done, this is happening in many companies, it is less where the upper ones should only do the processing, it is the habit of the buffalo to give milk in a relaxed manner, it is getting good water, good bathing, good things have been done from above and I am telling. I am from Haryana, I have not settled in the village but so people are in touch and I am in touch with me, small things make a difference, how is the buffalo drinking water, how is it eating, how is it in the mood. Do it with things, good milk comes out of it, consult some body and he will go away again, how many days leave did he come, 15 days leave, do that, spoil his buffalo, spread it, then go for what he wants, then what if you  Want this kind of thing, want to understand, want to do it and if you have to treat yourself like this on weekends, then do it with a company which is not giving you salary on Saturday and Sunday. When employment is given, it does not even check the terms and conditions.  Sir, how many hours do you want to reduce? 10:00 o'clock tomorrow, 10:00 o'clock, tomorrow, 11:00 o'clock.  You have given birth to children, give us some chance, this is not to reduce, no, I have got married, I am shameless, you will say how are you, if it is true, then I will tell you a simple thing, Nisar will do it tomorrow, so what should we say, what should we do, after doing this, I will ask questions.  Don't even miss it, it happened yesterday, then sleep with your mobile band tomorrow. It is necessary to give all the phones which you have given to the bus. You also have your wife's phone. There will be some emergency in your house, that is why you have kept it ahead for the night.  This is what the phone will be for  Do that office band, Sir, the battery had gone off. Urgent Sir, I support you, actually pick up tomorrow Sir, Exit Part of D Games Sir, meaning you get salary, you get only 24 hours to reduce it, this time, do it like this and talk exactly how.  Have to do Ad Bank, how to end the pain, it is necessary, there must be many people who are running their companies, who are working on scenario positions, oh no, no brother, every friend is necessary, if you are running such a good company.  If it had stock then why not tear it down, I don't know where it would have reached. You are only reducing the average. Quarterly results are not flooding in your quarter. You have so many employees. You are sitting with too much. You don't know how to reduce it. More people are put in higher positions. They don't have to justify their packets of ₹ 8090 lakh dead crore 2 crore and we have made the lives of juniors happy and they all come to me. I was consulting astrologer to get rid of their sorrow.  There was no consultation, you need a corporate lady, why are you spending more money, don't take money from me, there is an expert team, they will teach you how to become a good player, that bowler is hitting bouncers, you need someone to learn something, for the poor corporate employee.  There is no one, those tax payers come with a junk motivation very well duet, this is the one who is going to teach you, someone is going to bat on your behalf because I believe  If every citizen in India is happy, is stress free, some money is working, somehow the country is also working by doing one's own business, Dubey, doing all this is not having any negative impact on my country, I am very very clear that in the organization,  A dirty box, a dirty bus is spoiling the lives of 500 employees and the 500 are not spoiling their families because of the game, because now a lot of coaching has been done here too.  It's time to do good gram, it's okay, so I have to do some coaching, now I am stopping doing this because a stage has come when you become a lawyer and you learn how to do all kinds of things. But sometimes you feel that it is too much, it has taken a lot of work, now this has to be reduced as advised, officially, legally and Murali, you are justified in telling anybody anything in consultation, but I see that this is Pratap Na Ho Ki Bhai. It will be less wrong because people are thinking so much about the marriage issues going on in the market. What is happening in office is also bearing in the quality of life. You tell me about your married life and the way your married life is.  Quality of life is not directly in the control of your idiots. Don't you want to get back date control. If you want it in the way of roaming then I will make the video for free also, it is not like that if you  Do you want, if you want, if you want, no, no, we are just middle class, we just have to learn to work hard, just keep motivating me that this time will also pass, this is a big time, it will never pass, just bad and bad.  And they will become useless and desperate because what is happening I bill tell you that every man who is intelligent is going up, going up, going up, releasing at some time is nonsense and taking out salt, note this.  Staying in these other so called co-operates and organizations after 40 and send those who go back are sadistic narcissistic negative people, this kind of people stay and do this to everyone, let's not do it to everyone, I do it to 95% except 5.  I am giving it to you so that you think to yourself that you have a misconception that if you like her in five, then 100% according to me, it is okay to eat the butt, don't believe that you are big.  I give 95%, I myself am sitting on the board of three companies, four are doing economy, are running five businesses, are doing all the work. Okay, the resources of the organization are being used by the four people for their personal purposes.  He is a sycophant, he gives a knock salary, the organization reduces only his own and others', he is a donkey and Vishal is not that much, so don't take tension if you want Malik.  The tension is that 75 out of 100 belong to your company, so you are taking 85 of yours, Malik is sitting on 75 that you will be thrown away like a tight song, you will not be able to walk much, you are saying that I am a mental agent, I am hardworking, that is why I am mine.  You are getting respect, you are getting respect because you are ready to exploit yourself, hence you are getting a little more life and you will be relieved that this juice will be taken out, I will go further.  When you will not be able to go here then you will get another donkey or horse, whoever catches him will run till here, after that another one will go, then you will get this realization that if you go first then you will limit yourself to running so fast.  Earn salary by reducing the setting at 67%, earn money also, do not be unfair and do not indulge in too much more money and do something of your own, then I will give you training and history in doing that thing, which is yours.  The woman is sitting at home, is n't she most likely a housewife? Please give her a loving name. Give her the same name as Aadhaar and PAN. Give her PAN card to form a company and property. Earning money is fine, where everything will be yours, she will have only her name and also a job.  He runs the house and is also running a business in my name. That money is also coming to me. I am defining the syllabus and what are the possibilities. The story here is motivational and uncle China and  If you do n't get anything by doing something like this, if you want to do something practical then tell me and please join me only the one who wants to do something, don't get involved, just tell me, you tell me, not the one who is doing something and wants to do it.  And this thing which I have told you in a subtle way is understanding what has ever been said then if you understand and want to add that of you welcome organization then I will tell you further what will be the process thank you very match"

    "title": "Why F.I.R.E. Is A Fantasy ？ [1RzxApSPMMs].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today we will discuss again a concept of fire, financially independent, retire early because it becomes very youtube0, then you will do happy after like this, go to some tourist place, stay there and life will become like this, then I want to discuss on this thing.  I think if this was such a concept then let's take a figure like two cr th cr four cr f cr six cr any y calculate  If we do and tell the person who is sitting on that figure, there are many people sitting in India and there are many people sitting in the world too, then why don't they retire, why do they work and the child who stays late, his father is like this and he starts.  It is from there that means he should not do any work, it is only sold that there is something with an ever heavy happy after like they used to show in old Hindi movies, in the end there comes a honeymoon like this and any English movies or old ferry.  There used to be tales of ever happy after. That ever happy after does not exist in life. So, instead of talking about the concept of fire, you have to calculate whether I should do such a thing that I leave my job as an athlete because that  You are tortured by your job. You go to any tourist place or a peaceful place or a good place and people say no, it is fun, then we will stay there, there is no one like that, I am about these tourist places. In the coming few days, I will also make videos about this fantasy that we are in a place of great peace, the air is coming very nice, yes, it feels good for two, four, five, seven days, it is okay, it feels good, after that you will get purpose and fulfillment in life.  What is needed is that which cannot be found here in the tourist places. Stay here for a long time and see. I will experiment and show it to you. Now let me explain this particular thing that how can you stay for how many days because that is the change of water and change of air.  The change of seeing the change of people feels good once but how many days does it feel good? How many days does it feel good because no one actually stays on a very sustainable basis like this because no one will get so much time otherwise it feels like this.  That is two days, two days, three nights, three days to four nights maximum, by doing this it seems that yes, we will live life like this, one day you are going and one day you are also coming.  If anything, you have only 48 hours in between to live your life. If people want to extrapolate that life, then you should not run after the concept of fire, you should not do any calculations, you should not do anything because of your aspirations. That too over a period of time, they will keep changing, what do you want today, what do you want tomorrow, you do not know what your children want, many people are preparing for the higher education of their children, it may happen if higher  You do n't have to spend on education because in India, athletic education is not giving any returns. People prepare for weddings, even weddings are not going on. You don't want to do weddings. You may have spent Rs 40,50,80 lakh for the wedding. Whatever savings you have done or want to do or you have started SIP or want to do something else, the actual expenditure on that wedding may be only Rs 5 lakhs.  Gift 30-40 lakhs to your child under NT plan, whether you keep the marriage running comfortably or keep it running well and we will keep giving you 5 lakhs-10 lakhs per year, we will give you for seven years whatever your expenses we have initially planned.  If there was a lot of things will change in the coming times, don't get into this Jorgs Sen, I will reach here, I will give you so many SIPs, you can do the best in that, as the ball is coming, two runs.  Two runs to Wally, one run to one run, six sixes to Marley, will you think too much or not, here I will make 350? You do n't know the pitch, which is the pitch of your life and what is the pitch of life, the environment is not in your control, macro.  Economics Just before this Covid came, now a geo political something is going on, in the future also geo political economic something is going on, it is not in your hands, what you have to do is beat the inflation  Try to do better than most of the people around and have a benchmark, okay try to do and be very intelligent in that because what happens is this person is you, he is doing better than you, so now you try to do this.  Couldn't do better but this person, I don't know, is investing money foolishly, I do n't know what kind of programs are there, what kind of stagnation are there inside you.  Then you were the one prominent thing in this, who was ahead, you were behind here, so what did you do in your mind that friend, here I am and my car is not going to go faster than this, you started your own small things and you told your wife. Someone has taken it and that wife was doing something here but she was exactly the same here, the housewife has taken it here after encouraging her a little, so as a package you have come here all at once and after awakening your understanding, intelligence, wisdom, consciousness, everything is fine.  you here  You can go here also from Dispina, you are only so far behind there, but due to the lot of programs running on your back end, you are going much ahead because of all these things, I give ideas to my members in the form of workshops.  I am telling you because it takes one and a half hour for each idea, making a video of one and a half hour sitting somewhere is not that easy and there is no two and four interaction because questions will also come and you will say, oh like this.  It doesn't happen like this, it can be good, it can happen, it can't happen, then there will be discussion on these things, you can take membership of me, you can take paid membership, my upcoming course is a Happiness Course 2.0, five classes, it will be an iconic course, do n't miss it, that Happiness Practical.  By living things in a practical manner, they will come easily in your life, then we will bring this happiness in your life. For that thing, you join, I debunk the concept of FIRE. You do n't have to waste your time at all, you don't have to run after your numbers, you have to increase your numbers, you have to count these numbers, then the person who is in 6065, when he stops earning money, then he has to earn this number, I should stop earning money.  How much money should I have, how much money should I have, how much money should I have, how much is enough, that is no answer, don't run after money, just do fulfilling things in life, money will come as a result of it in you.  We have to add income generating skills to the people, I will tell about this thing through many mediums in the course because there is no fear of money, the fear is that I do not have the skill, the one who has the skill does not have to do anything, very dear to you.  Is it Kishore 's type, is it Arijit Singh of Abhijeet or someone else below him, take a singer anywhere, sing a song, you will get money, you have the skill, no, they do not fear that they will remain hungry. Any skill.  Who can stay with you? What is the problem? People do not actually have skills. People are picking up the phone and making calls. Good morning sir, these people, sir, will you do it like this or are they doing a very humiliating job? Someone is coding, they are doing coding.  The world is doing that, you know that after a certain age, your eyes will ache, your head will ache, your soul will be sucked, this is some work and a new man will start doing better than you, that is why there is that fear and dread.  The fear is that brother, somehow I will reach that number and from there I will retire soon. This fear does not come in those people who have a sustaining skill, any skill which they can do till the last moment of their life and get money in it.  Can be because if you have fitted the jugaad to earn in your 60s then in 70 then the number which is required is actually very low to do.  Your Own Thing: We calculate these numbers as financial influencers, we take this number that brother, you have spent so much, this much is declared as corpus and then we do something with it at 4, 6, 8, so that it will grow and we will withdraw this much.  You will do this, this old American had also just brought out, now people like us, Ankur Warku ji and others, are now telling these stories which they had stopped telling 20 years ago.  Granted, they themselves don't follow all this because of the generation that has come and the generation that has come after her generation, there are people who are right now from 2011, they don't have to do a lot of work, the Millennials, the generation X people and those before them.  They do n't even want to do those things, now they have seen a simple thing like you, no man should marry no matter how much he wants and then suddenly he changed his decision, you were saying in 20-30 that I will not marry, so I will retire like this.  I will die, there is so much loneliness in life, you got married at 39, then where are the calculations, then at 42 you have a child, now where are the calculations, then calculations cannot be done because my mind is fickle. There used to be a dialogue between Pushpa and Rajesh Khanna.  The mind is fickle, now the fickle mind can start something at any time, it can do less, so our focus should be on our inner income generating capability, money.  Earn only this much and you should have this much wealth and glory, then there is no need to keep track of the small things, keep track of the big things. Don't keep track of the small things, how much is my petrol expense, how much is my driver's expense. How much is the cost of travelling, how much is the cost of food, if you don't care about such things then how did you like this video, please share it and we will keep bringing such topics for you. Thank you very much."

    "title": "Why Gen Z Will Never Be Able To Buy A Home ？ [gfCG88kqhSc].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today's topic is Why people will never be able to buy property and homes. It is a subject of pain, I will tell you logically, what can be done to avoid it, I will tell you what to do, I will tell you more and it is not fear mongering, there is no such thing.  That's why I said it because these trends are clearly visible. In other countries, playouts are taking place in London for example. The biggest pain of parents in London is that their children cannot buy property. Can't live with parents, parents can't buy for them, so yes, England is a small country, it is not even like India, Guinea has 1015 main cities and they are not able to do so, they have to live with parents, there are no marriages without crying.  If it is happening then this trend is already happening there, so no one is coming up with such a thing that it is happening for the first time, it has already taken place in the world, now why will it happen in India, how will it happen, we will argue from there. coming out  So, this is the generation that was born after 1996, which is 2627 years old today. Now I will include the people of 2011, 12, 13, 14 and 15 in it, so it is more applicable for them too, but to tell in general terms, this is the generation which is now I have told the age groups who have already come in the job market or will come, I will tell you some reasons why they will not be able to buy, the biggest reason is that the property rates are already very high in big cities.  The jobs that are being created are getting higher, they are not at that level that the savings become too high, if you look at inflation, the rents are already so high, the electricity rates are increasing, the gas rates are increasing, petrol is increasing and so on.  The aspirations of this generation have increased, the children of the middle class who come to big cities or even the lower class also have the right to use a mobile, use the Internet, watch movies, use the Internet, etc. Spending on all the food and drink is a done thing for them, then power dressing them, wearing good clothes, this has to be done, if we are not doing this then why are we living, and then in between is that of roaming around and doing our own thing.  They do SIP of Rs 2000, 4000 and 5000 in mutual fund, who are very influential like Ankur Waraku ji and I am telling you by name only because they have not left anything worthless.  Let us show you that if you make two to four 5000 rupees, you will become very great and one day you will become a millionaire, you are not going to become anything, I am telling you that, I am not trying to create negativity, just like the elders teach by twisting your ears.  I am going to tell you, listen, doing a SIP of Rs 4000 is not going anywhere, Rs 000 is not going to do anything for you, but it does not mean that you should stop doing that too, if you are doing it then it also does not mean that it is okay.  So listen to this financial influence, see what is coming and what to do and I am also telling the parents that these things are okay, savings are not happening, they are going on rent, one life is definitely going away and so on.  Then as soon as you realize that this thing will not be possible, then why do n't you get married next because you know that when you get married, you need a house and the girl's parents say that if you give a house then you can't show the house, you can't take it because if you let's go.  to 50  60 Lakhs is an average of any small two BHK or one BHK. Let's take the big city average. Let's talk about the top 8, 10, 15 cities of the big cities. Then there is less money in other cities. There is a little more money in big cities. Brother, if I buy something worth Rs. 50 lakhs and I make a down payment of Rs. 10 lakhs which is a huge amount, if I buy it for Rs. 40 lakhs then my EMI will be around Rs. 0000. To get an EMI of Rs. 0000, my salary should be at least 1.25 lakh because tax is also deducted in 1.25 lakh because sometimes if I buy under construction, I have to pay that for two-three years and here I have that.  It also happens, that too is a pain and if I don't take it, I take the old thing and its price is also inflated and I am not getting any further depreciation. Secondly, it is not affordable if the youngster's money.  Look, he is not able to buy a house with his 10 years' average salary, whereas the normal average should be 5 years, so if he is getting 10 years' salary, he will not be able to buy it anyway. Another reason is that as soon as he arrives, he should be the first person to buy a house.  For example, if you want a car and not a motorcycle, now they will say that it is safe to buy a car worth Rs. 4 lakhs. I also say that children should buy a car. Motorcycle is unsafe. I myself say that it can be managed from anywhere.  Buy your car, any day is safer and better. Bet, but if you buy that car then what is the matter, it is worth Rs. 6 lakhs but then it is more. Why would you buy a five year old car instead of a 20 year old car?  If it doesn't come, then you have used the image of credit card, then you have wandered around, then the big thing is that there are no savings and parents are not able to buy Rs 50-6 lakh, how can they keep it? First of all, at the time of inflation, you have to pay the expenses.  Paid school fees for 18 years, then there were fees for higher education, then there were coaching fees, then now they say, friend, now you are earning, now you earn, now they will buy a house for you too. Is this the thinking of the parents?  What is right or wrong, should there be a change in thinking, how should the house be, in the beginning I am discussing why one cannot buy these, then I will say what should be done if one has to buy them, because I am trying to awaken the Guru Tattva and help in getting rid of the hopeless. Video I don't leave, I leave on hope that it is not possible because of these reasons, but how can it be made possible, anyone, I am 25 years old, because neither the parents nor the parents themselves, if I am a son, neither the parents' son if I buy the house.  When he talks about it, he says, alas, he will go away from us and we are not doing anything for our daughter. Anyway, you are gone, so you belong to the husband, we belong to the husband's in-laws, we are the daughter, but still someone is there for the son.  Maybe you should buy a house for your daughter, no one is taking it, this is also very unfortunate, daughters are ours, then that too, when no one belongs to anyone, then they also show their form in many places, that is a subject of a different pain.  A separate video will be made for that, otherwise I will go astray while giving that knowledge. I will keep it to this only. Anyway, no one is giving anything to the girls. Girls do not have a half-time job, so if they have a job, then they would have left it if they got married. If they had not left it, then they would have given birth to a child.  I would have missed out  If it is theirs then it does n't matter to them at all, the caterer is not saying anything, the girl's house is the husband's house, meaning why should you take the house or is it your in-laws house? I will make a separate video on why girls should have a house for girls, but it should be for both of them, today I am telling you in a gender neutral way, the method is very simple, yes, it is very simple, you will get 5 lakh rupees on marriage. I don't want to spend too much, any wedding is very nice, even for one lakh, I spent 5 lakhs too much. Spending 30, 35, 40 lakhs on weddings is usually normal. Sometimes there is even a competition for jewelery between the two parties. Bring even a small set and see how much it costs. Four-five tola doesn't feel much on the neck, it's fine today and wear this and this and some more.  If you wear the one here, I don't know how much it would cost. Girls wear lehenga. What do girls say? If you won't give us a house, if you have a lehenga worth two lakhs, then you will be foolish to ask for a house. Lehenga, I will manage in a smaller lehenga, something that means cheap.  I will manage. Marriage is the first time. The parents can save a lot of money. Get the couple both from the set of parents and say brother will not marry but take this money. 50 lakhs.  Take 2 BHK, 60 Lakh, 90 Lakh, 30 Lakh, it is different in different cities, I have those solutions also, if you want those solutions, then there is Real Estate Info Webinar Group in the comment section, join it.  Also in this stage, what is the matter now, what is the problem, what are the tantrums, the status of a house worth Rs 50 lakh but the desire for a house worth Rs 1.5 crore, this is also the problem of the new generation, this matter  I don't even buy it because they see it worth 50 lakhs, but I am not enjoying it because your status is up because your parents are living in a big house somewhere but brother, had they ever bought it before and their status is given in Bhujne.  The status of this one is yours, it is on now, so you cannot take that one, if you can, take it, do not throw tantrums in the wedding, the hydraulic lift is coming from here, the hydraulic lift is coming from here, it is washed, it is washed, such is the combine hook.  Then the garland is being held and the photo is being taken and the photographer himself is charging Rs. 1 lakh for the photo session, so if it is not him then we do it only once, no, we do not do it once, nowadays there is no guarantee that only one  If you do it multiple times, then don't spend less. Get the marriage done in ₹ lakh. If it doesn't last for 70 days, then they come to us. I go and see that man, this is the pain of breaking of marriage in their eyes. Boy's parents, girl's parents.  or money  Fear of drowning is pain, meaning that if you don't know then don't invest money because when you give a house in the life of a young couple to start with only, that marriage is fine because if you talk about 60 lakhs then both of you got 25 lakhs.  The boy's parents gave 125 lakhs to the parents, the girl's mother gave equal amount, friend, whatever you want to do there, give even 1010, give even 12,12 and that is from marriage.  You gave only the saved money, you gave 25 lakhs and they may not have taken a loan of 25 lakhs, they may also have savings of 5 lakhs, the boy and girl were working, so friend, a loan of 171 lakhs was taken, that's just like that.  Will repay because it is a loan of Rs 18-20 lakh 1617 EE, we are also taking some income tax rebate from it and the rent is left, so your cash flow should be positive, that's it. After that, when the house is done and it is in the name of both of them, then it is just a strong joint of Fevicol, the house is on our head, there is security because there is no house, the girl is not safe in the house where she gets married and when the house is in the girl's name.  It happens with the husband and his age is 25, 26, 27 years, so it removes a lot of stress from life, this rent every month, even if you lose your job but you are not able to pay the rent, then this is still what gap war, what schemes?  You can get flour for two, three or four rupees, you don't die of hunger in India, if home is something very important, you don't say such a dialogue that 'Maya Se Chhaya Pyaari Hai' is the dialogue here in our India 'Maya Se Chhaya Pyaari Pyaari', then you will have to do it, the woman will have to work.  And the house will be done because there is no region and people to buy it because the house is not the priority because the financial experts who take the priority of the house have told that if you do SIP for 20 years then maybe you will get the house.  Till then you should love your life because if you buy a house then you are not living life because this is how you will live, how you will buy clothes, how you will roam around, how you will look rich, how you will have false pride and love, how you will wear shoes worth Rs. 12000 even if they are worth Rs. 6000.  Shoes are fine, how can I buy a mobile phone? Now they say, ok, someone told me, I should buy a mobile phone worth Rs 20,000 and not the one worth Rs 80.  Should I take this, brother, can I buy a house with the savings of Rs 60000? Yes, you can buy something because you are applying this logic everywhere, you are also applying the same logic in buying a car, the same logic is being applied in buying shoes.  He is applying logic, he is applying logic in buying clothes, he is applying logic in travelling, he is applying logic in everything that brother, I have just stayed in this four star hotel, my expenditure of Rs 0000 was for 4 days.  Had I done this for Rs 8000, would I have been able to save Rs 12000? He comes home for Rs 12000. He is applying logic in everything. Yes, this is how he comes home. Save Rs 80000 here, save Rs 20000 here, save Rs 40 there, save Rs 20 here and get 5 lakhs. From mother to Rs 4 lakh, father-in-law to Rs 2 lakh, mother to Rs 3 lakh, wife to Rs 2 lakh, extra income by doing side gig or one  By doing lakhs here, some things are bought by joining them like this, but it takes away your life in joining, does n't it make you feel that oh I am not living that life, when what is the reason for that brother, nobody is yet to come and told, I am very fond of this.  I will also make a detailed video on ' The Joys of Owning Your Own Home.' Brother, then you do not live with rubbish furniture, you do not live in dirty furniture on rent, your fixtures are good, a lot of things happen, I will make another excellent video on this so that your  10 12 15 benefits of buying a house and in that I will not talk about money anywhere, your rent at 3, mutual fund at 4, so much will go there, in 20 years you will save so much, what will you do then, will you buy a house or will you bear it in old age?  I am fine with the money which tells these calculations. These days all the financial YouTubers have smelled like this. Does it smell? It is okay to write the dialogue down and now they are talking about real estate through the back door. And I am saying that now is the time to put it in equity also. I am the owner of both the chits, it is my father's wife and my father's chit was there earlier too. If you understand then why should you take one line? Emotional decision is not emotional. Buying Term Insurance Term Insurance Term Life Insurance Is Right Endowment Plan Not Lipp Buying Term Insurance Is Not an Emotional Decision It's a Practical  The decision that the man of the house was worth three or four crores, if something happens then he will get the money, it is not nothing emotion about it, then why should the house be on, what are the other factors which are there, I will not talk about money, I will talk about coolness and coolness and what else.  -Whatever it is, I will make that video also but first, whatever video you send to Jane Judd, circulate this one, only then will it be included in your priority list. Looking sexy is on the priority list. Posting photos on this page, getting your likes and dislikes done again and again, you have taken all this work for granted, how am I looking like a fool, you don't even have a house, you are poor, today even the poor have a house, the government has come out with a scheme.  You have said that you are worse than those poor people, you don't know how bad your condition is, I am telling people and you are busy, no, I am in life, or who said that those who have houses and do not go out for a walk, or they do not live life, they cannot live. every  When you pay rent every month and the rent is falling into the pit and is increasing every year by 10 to 12 or the landlord is saying run away from here if it becomes like this then you will know what is there in the society then the first thing is affordable seems to be difficult.  I will sir the parents, the parents have to help the parents, I see the child has turned 12, 14, 15 years old, the parent is going and taking a commercial, the speck will drown, he will die, but he is his child.  It is clear that you should buy a house for him, the house will be built in four years, he will go to college, till then you will not have to pay the rent, but the children will buy their own. Hey child, if you believe, your child will do very well, believe that it will come out.  If his package of Rs. 80 lakhs is exhausted, then you can rent out the house you had bought for him, he will buy his own separately, but suppose it is not exhausted in all, then where will it go, then where will you keep your daughter-in-law, the daughter-in-law will not come in your two BHK. three bh's  If you don't live in my house, she will not come, your child will not get married, marriages will happen only to those whose houses are big, boys are feeling very bad, in reverse dowry system in India, because the dowry used to be 5 lakh 10 lakh 15 lakh 20.  Houses used to be sold for Rs 25-30 lakhs, houses are expensive, now if you buy a house for a boy, you get a great feeling from within. Man, what happened when the boy was born in 1990?  So thali was played, thali was played when it was a boy, it is not played when it was a girl, in India do you know what is the scene in North India these days, but what I know from many years is that thali was played when it was a boy and not when it was a girl.  There was a degree split when it happened. Unfortunately, those who play, okay, this or this, I enjoy telling about the things that bring things to the society. Many people have problems, but those who do whatever they want should also have problems. Personal attacks also come.  Your girl is fighting with my God, because of both of them, you cannot blame me that I am fine, so I have no benefit in either one, I am just giving neutral advice, okay, I have benefit in this also, there is benefit in that too, society.  When one improves, everyone benefits, whether it is your daughter or son, everyone has the right to live a logical and equal life and the society should move in that direction, then they are not able to buy a house because of this, there is no focus, there is no help from the parents.  Not there.  The young generation has no idea and then when the properties will be bought today, they will eat bread and butter throughout their life, they will eat the rent on rent. There is a generation which is from 1970, 80, early 80 or late 60, they will suppress the rent and will eat the property.  She will eat till she dies and as she is, she will only give rent, so if your child gives rent throughout his life then it would be better if he gives it to you only, isn't it?  If you are a family then create assets, now you will ask how will it be given to you, my child is working in Bangalore, I bought the property in Gurgaon, then it means how did I get the rent, you will also ask if you have bought the property in Gurgaon and you have the property or have taken it somewhere else.  You are a North Indian and if your son has to press four IT buttons, he will press them in Gurgaon instead of Bangalore. The house should be nearby and when you are not there, he will go anywhere and when he is not there, he will go anywhere. Tell the child to say that you are like this, you have to pay 10 months rent, why should I forgive two months because one month goes to the brokerage that vacates the tenant and one month goes to the maintenance.  You only do it, you will not do it, otherwise he will be saved, whether you are my son or daughter, if you give him 10 months, then your rent payer is also saved and he also has continuity, no one will be thrown out of the house if his circumstances are bad.  For some reason, if the child's daughter got spoiled or for some reason the job got reduced, the salary rate got reduced or something else happened, then you are the father, you will say, son, don't pay rent for six months, how relieved it is that you have also kept the property in your name, but in practice, the child Poor guy is paying the rent which is justified i.e. rent, he is taking it, you are not even escalating, your own child has sometimes forgiven, sometimes said come on, it is your anniversary this month.  Don't pay the monthly rent, see how wonderful it is, this month my grandson's granddaughter's birthday is coming. With this month's rent, I can give her a gift like this, she can do anything in my name, friend, I have to find her ready.  As age increases, you have to find ways to please your new generation. It is a lot of fun to live life just on the pretext of giving something to the next generation. Look, buy as per your wish, it is okay and don't invest directly. Pick up SCO somewhere.  Took the plot and it got stuck and nothing is happening because your child cannot go and live in the SCO plot, it is fine anytime and somewhere your money is lost, you had bought it in the back side of some mall, something that does not work, it became a ghost mall.  There have been so many of them, why are you doing so many experiments? Those who have children in their families, they see no one is lavish, no one is big, absolutely normal, okay, when someone buys a car for his child, is the first car very important?  if you are rich  It is a different matter but for a normal middle class, what will be the first car for him, Innova Crysta or Farr, which car will he buy? Come on, take Dezire, you can take Amaze, you must be spending a lot, the money will go till Karetta, he is buying the first car, right?  If you are buying a brand new car now, then why is there a need to buy such a lavish one, brother, you can buy it now and see later, it is decent enough now, so in the same way, just by the desire and amazement of real estate, don't go for fortune.  Ok go for this but go for this because of the now they say no desire to me hey brother desire is still better than you no going traveling in a bus standing or waiting for auto rickshaw and uber rolla it is still better than  That's the exercise, that's the choice. I hope you guys liked these videos. Okay, and please share. And if you have n't subscribed to the channel yet.  If you want to subscribe and join the real estate info group, then it is posted in the comment section. There is a plan to conduct real estate workshops. There is a plan to spread education. There is a plan to explain so that you can take these decisions in your life. That father is listening.  I can also do restructuring of assets, can go towards new things, can go towards better things, old undeposited, unproductive properties, properties in bad location or whose story has been played out.  It is no longer possible to replace them for your own next generation because your decisions in real estate give you respect and standing in your family. Firstly, it is your job. You have done something in the job and you get salary from it. Yes, this or that is normal.  It's a thing, but what decisions did father take in real estate, he defines the wealth of the family and the same stories are told, I do a lot of consultation that our father has wasted money.  He didn't deserve anything, my father was a great man, he took that at that time, he took that at this time, he took that at that time, this is how it happened to me, now I have got all this, now what to do next, so consultation.  So all your fathers who are listening, your report card is that your mother always has a good report card. She has given birth to children and that is the very report card. After that, she spent two-four-five-seven years and all mothers evolve.  If you grow up a bit then mother will always remain exceptional or above average type, her CGPA will remain above 9, mother's father's performance is just on wealth creation that she is nobody judges the father, what he has done, can he be even better?  He may be a clerk or may be at a very high level, children don't judge him, he is whatever he is, but whoever was at that level was at that level.  How was the performance, beyond that a person is judged because the level of many people was very high but the arrow in the pumpkin did not uproot anything, they say that we did not get any benefit from this level of yours, you have done it in your Chaudhary hut but you have got nothing to do. Show, you took a cheap thing there, got stuck there, took something there, it is nothing for us and the same if he is a poor father, he is a relatively poor father and he applied his mind and took advice from his eyes.  If someone takes a decision openly, he eats a lot of bread. Father, I respect my father from 60 to 90. Father, father, it is very good that you have brought us here to do this and to learn because no one is teaching, I am teaching.  Why I'm the Number One Because There's No Number Two That's Possible 70  But it is free and after 30 days it is paid and you can easily join it and increase your intelligence because these are very expensive decisions of life, so I hope you will join, thank you very much."

    "title": "Why Gen Z Will Not Be Able To Buy Home In India ？ [0s9Er8zidmM].en",
    "content": "Hello friends the topic is Y Janji will never be able to buy home house and property Janji and Hai Ji who are born after 96 97 are considered to be the generation till 2011 but these children will not be able to buy because of the economic cycle this happened because you  Now no, we had bought, they had bought, everyone will buy, this is the first generation which will be financially poorer than its previous generation in the history of  If not mankind, then every generation has compared to the previous one and this is also a topic of resentment. In many countries, in London, the biggest problem is that the housing needs of the parents cannot be fulfilled because there are many privacy issues there.  You know, foreigners can't even keep them with themselves and don't have space to keep them separately, so in India too, this thing is playing out, because of the assets, their prices have increased a lot.  As an example, any child who is of the age of 1996, 97 or even 98, 99 and has entered the job market, you can think that his age is 25, 26, 27, 28 years. His salary is on an average, there are exceptions and outliers.  Not to mention that brother, this IT turned out to be of mango, its package is worth Rs 1.5 crore, we are not talking about that, whenever we make a video, we will focus on 90  If we make it for them, then there is something only for 90%, otherwise 100%, sometimes there is nothing in anything, okay, then how much salary can you imagine? 25 30000 40000 which are starting IT salaries 50 60 70000 1 lakh.  Also, you can never buy a thing while paying this much rent, basically you cannot buy it without the support of your parents.  Maybe the parents may have spent a lot on their education, the parents themselves have kept their savings somewhere for old age and what is the concept of their parents that we have educated them, they have got a job, now you know.  Know your work, because I can't do beyond this because this house is mine, I am paying its MI, mutual fund SIP is going on for my old age, I have planned something for your marriage, that's it.  If it has happened, then I will say that he is kept for marriage. Whether it is the girl's father or the boy's father, he should now go for this housing need. Without the help of that 101 lakh, now you will say, which house can you buy for 1015 lakh? Many people will say that he doesn't come home in 1015, he doesn't come home in 1015, but if he gets 1015 and 1015 girl, he gets 20 to 30 lakhs.  Even their savings of Rs 55 lakh, which they have worked for two-three- four years, turns into Rs 40 lakh. Things worth Rs 70,80,90 also come to Rs 1 crore. You take a loan and pay income tax on it and instead of paying rent, it is yours.  You will not be able to get the house alone because if there is a short fall of Rs 20-25 lakh in the calculations or it is not only Rs 20-25 lakh for the down payment, you have made the down payment.  If you make 40 lakhs, then you will also earn the loan load and if the payment is to be made in 4 years and initially you have spent two and a half years from Rs 40 lakh, then after saving in two and a half years, 6 more months will be spent and in the last one year, Rs 3040 will be spent.  But if I have to pay through loan then it will be tight for a year, after that I will not have to pay rent and I shifted to my house and income tax rebate came, then this  This is how the investments will start going And if Janji does not follow this Janji said I will take a car First of all I will go out for a walk It's only one life I have to enjoy or Why should parents give I don't ask my Parents, I am a self-respect person, I have a lot of respect and why should I take money from a girl and the girl says why should I get married so soon? The boy says I am  Those who, in 30-35 years, will invest all their money here and there, will spend it in some mutual fund, will be happy by playing SIP, the asset will not come back, will pay rent throughout their life, those will be the previous generation, those who have created assets, that will be their age.  Will eat a lot of rent because he will keep catching up. It will be that he is asking for run rate. It's like cricket. In cricket, the opposition team scores with lets.  320 runs, you have to score 50 overs, then from the beginning, you will not get an average of 6.24, the ball is swinging fast, but at some point of time, you have to take care of the run rate, if you will make it increase to 14, 15, and that.  Even in 15 overs, it is not possible that anyone can hit 48 like Virat Kohli in the last three overs of 15. Agreed but Virat Kohli can also be hit.  Tell me, calculate the run rate of 16, brother, even that cannot be calculated for 10 overs, so this is what I am telling you, I have data and money calculation book which you can also calculate, change is starting at a run rate of eight.  Nine which is really not possible is not possible right from the start so they need support from somewhere so that their asking run rate comes down to 5.5 and on that they will be a little better.  Be a little stingy with yourself and don't jump on marriage and other things in the beginning itself. Once you buy a house, you can even leave your job at the age of 38. But a man who is married only.  33 34 35 Ki Karega And Dreamy Eyed And We Live Once Only Man We Have To Release We Don't Live Once This Is A Color Statement Of The Youth No Know We Live Only once abe baoli butch we die only once we die only once we live everyday it is not once every day we have to live many years we live only once is not a correct English age for all India is concerned only once  Live, live every day, live every moment, die once and have to die, go far away and you will not understand and the biggest thing that these people have thought  Janji has kept that my father is rich, his house is here, here, oh brother, you are not going to get that house, your parents will still be alive till your teeth fall out, which is a good thing, if life expectancy increases, then you are not getting inheritance any time.  So, for how long will we have to make our own fortune, will you think that no, no, we will get this drop, this is not a life to live, the parents have given us theirs, I am guiding the parents and everyone else, you have done so much of yours, this  There is no need to give, but whatever you have done, you can give them some time. They are your children, once you have a house, you will have the courage to get married. If you get married, you will have your own house, then you will have the courage to have children. In this generation, the middle class does not have the courage to have children, they do not have the courage to get married because they know that if I have to live with my parents or live in a room or I have to keep roaming or be a wanderer or  Don't take responsibility because a single boy is a human being.  You can live anywhere in crappy conditions, cheaply, The moment you get married, you require a decent space, you need a respectable space, even if it is one and a half BH, it should be clean, it should be of some style, it should have curtains, sofa, sofa, everyone should have their own TV, CV, washing machine.  Machine, AC and food, model kitchen, all that is needed, gradually it becomes fun to live in it, but if you do not get married then you do not need anything, then sometimes I run here and there, sometimes I run there.  You are living in two suitcases, sometimes you stayed in a PG here, you stayed there in a fully furnished room, you stayed in a guest room given by the company, you stayed in a hotel, you traveled around, you traveled from work, sometimes you stayed at your parents', sometimes you stayed there, sometimes you stayed at a friend's.  Because youth spends 365 days like this, it is the biggest problem of life and this is the problem of a house which will not lead to life, the problem of will lead to life because Without a home, no life will start in the future because what is life, brother, marriage, children, not marriage, children, you do it again in 38 years, brother, it is because of a house that you told your story, that means that wisdom. Those with Vivek Chetna have their own Acharya Ji. He has given another escape route to the people who also call me ' Global Warming Guruji. If Global Warming does not happen, I will not buy a house. If Global Warming does not happen, I will not buy a house.  If it happens, I will not marry, will not have children, but KPL gives it, that is my show, I will lose in Davidson, I have nothing to do with carbon footprint, but I did not get married and it is a big thing, but some Acharya ji has said it.  He said that if a child is born, it is equivalent to cutting 10 lakh trees, then he has got himself an exit, someone will ask, he is not getting married, why he doesn't buy a house, why he is not responsible, he doesn't do anything because I don't.  Want to bring babies in this cruel world You know neither Aurangzeb was there nor people were bringing babies in this cruel world ruled by Aurangzeb nor Narada Shah was attacking Delhi even then in 1739 nor Ahmed Shah Abdali attacked nor babies were being made in 1761 That's why we all are alive, our DNA is still alive, that's why this video is being made, we are from Haryana, we all I suffer here, I know my old history very well, if there they say it's a cruel world, it was really a cruel world, you could die any time, anybody could do anything with ya khata khata pata apna baata baaki kya amat shada ha khata Pita Laida Baqi Amat Shayda Punjabi Proverb What ever you eat and eat in your stomach is yours Baqi Ad Shah will take everything that  Was the saying nothing is yours what ever goes in your stomach is yours only ts your people have lived during 2 times also and they had babies and they lid and since they live and they endorsed ts we are there nahi to kha hote hum to original  My everything is from Haryana I know my 25 generation back Lucky Lucky I know 2530 so me  I know exactly where we are from and where we were from here and what happened when we came so far. If I can explain things, it is a cruel world in this country. Before Lord William Butting banned Sati in 1835, it was called Satya.  And that Sati was of poison, not the second Sati, that of Jauhar, and it was the case of the first one, there was atrocities on women, women used to give birth to so many 1010 children, if not. Mortality rate was high, there were so many deaths of women during female pregnancy, no one asked, today is the best of the times, everything is the lowest in terms of law, these incidences and yet Janji, those who are listening to me, Janji people will also come and write.  How can you say this we will be more spiritually are you life no further prop nahi re chaatte hoga spirituality ko what is spirituality us  I will teach you that day too, that is my Astro Channel, I teach you simple astrology there, join there, there is no life without spirituality, first of all, life has to be there, the work that is done by you is not the same by nature, then you are running away from spirituality.  If yes, then we should look at spirituality. People with spirituality should run away from here. If you want to go after spirituality, then look at the forest, then this is social.  Coming and commenting on media, spiritual person is committing commenting and writing a naughty comment because you have shaken his belief system, you have actually told and him ki him aur har ki tujhse na ho paaye munna te se kuchh bhi na ho paayi to janji if you Are Watching Me Be Very Very Careful About What I've Ever Told This Is How It Will Play Out Yes You Can Jump And Do Some Lot Of People Sometime Say You Will Have To Sell Flats To You Come And Keep Telling About This Thing No My Main Income Still Comes From Consulting Relationship Consultations Unfortunately My Maximum Consultation Normally I Don't Tell Is From Bachelors People Hu  Don't you think that I have this conveyance? You are feeling like this after coming on such a face. I am talking without any confidence. Look, I earn the most money from an unhappy bachelor, so it is very beneficial for me. You should go on this path because this is a business and in India, many people say that you are talking about marriage.  It is said that in Marital Consultation India, so many people are already married that even if no one gets married from tomorrow, I will still keep getting marital consultation for the next many years. It is not necessary that it should come fresh.  There are a lot of troubles of being old and there are many old people and it is not going to happen that no one will marry in India, we will reduce it but it is not that no one will do so many times what happens is that as a content creator we have to tell that our  Positioning is everywhere, you can take consultation even if you get married, even if you don't, you can take it, it is also about investment, it is also about marriage, it is also about sadness, it is also about emptiness, the biggest fear that someone has in life is also from illness.  The fear of illness is still not that much until it comes. The biggest fear that I have seen in my consultations with people is that as they become old especially they are lonely and they hit lonely in the sense that they are bachelors. Not married is this loneliness.  The biggest fear of loneliness is that a man does not want to be alone and I am telling you that if your bachelor nobody will want to come to you after a particular age, you have so much money.  Isn't it that you attract everyone, your looks are messed up and you do n't have any life partner, there are no common goals, there is no purpose, then you will be left lonely and Janji half seems to be going on this path, I don't want any advice.  So give it friendly aa bhaiya, this may be happening because some selected people who were Millennials who were born in 1985, who are now 39, who are from 1984.  86 Jinn have gone on your path, who are more in touch with me, none of them are happy, they said sir, no one told me, the circumstances were like this, many people are like this, na woh dil, yeh wale phir bhi aise, their reason to not get married.  Was Still There in a Wait They Fell in Love with Someone Didn't get married and didn't get along with her, then didn't want to do it with anyone These are the stories of these people who are now 907 Those of 98 and 99 are something different, they are a reason for global warming, how can they accept this brother, there are sexual dis functional issues, I agree that these are issues, brother, that too can be fixed, there is a breakup in the relationship with the doctor, there is a heart break, there is sadness.  Yes, that can also be fixed, it can be fixed, brother, it can be explained to him that it was not about you, it was about har har.  Choice is this story, I do some of these things professionally, many of these things can be set, but brother, it is difficult to ask this crazy person, I said yes brother, you only save global warming, you only save the earth, you are okay.  He is just saving you, you should get money, there is no cure, what is the actual reason, they do n't have the courage to live life, they think that they have to buy a good mobile phone, I have to pay for it, if I get married, I can buy such a house.  If I take it then my fun will be reduced. I am trying to tell you that no matter how many stories you have heard about a married man, section 498 is probably number 86-87 in the new code, the one who enjoys the most is no no, fights happen as soon as possible, divorce yes but then again. People like me have been bachelor also for some time ok and married also for long time so come and I interact with bachelors a  Lot and I discuss, look at it publicly, no one says anything about Bachelor, it is the center of everyone's life, it is very happy, less happy, less happy, neutral, sad, unhappy, unhappy, mid-mable, so Bachelors are from here to  In the midst of this, depending on how much bachelorhood is going on, how life itself is going on in life and I want to give a secret out also a little bit if you heard that secret.  So tell me whether you agree with ten secrets or do you think it will be true I am professing marriage for every buddy Sach Professing is not a correct word I am advising Ok if boys do not marry then they remain more unhappy if girls do not marry then boys The chances of you being a female and not ever getting married will still be relatively less than that of a man of vegetation.  You are listening to me, you can do it, I still do not force women because women still have the power to live alone, it is okay but I am not saying that they should also live alone, they should do it at least once.  If it is okay then it should be done once and if it is not right once then it should be done twice and if not twice then it should be done thrice. The site is so sacred that it is not in that thing, that thing should be discussed later.  Will do, people are afraid if it's a dozen  Work out a dozen work out then do second if that also dozen work out do third if not but it will take away all my everything Sara does not take everything the first thing and the second thing is that it does not take everything that is but more  Be careful in selecting, no, I will remain alone, so you are saying this, I will not play the game, it is like I played cricket, if the ball hit me, I fell, if I got hurt, then I have to learn to ride a bicycle. If you fall, then you will not be able to enjoy life. This is the thing, but isn't life all about this only? Life is not about this only. Also, everything is needed in life. Actually, it is not about any one thing, no one thing.  Can give you happiness all the time Some times loneliness is very good Some times bachelorhood is also good Are they married  People also stay a little apart, there is no such thing as he went away due to his job or went there and every time the wife gives happiness is not a correct statement, every time the children give happiness is not a correct statement, always give it but brother, it is not a correct statement.  When do you have to get back? At the time of Covid, it was revealed that no one in the country belonged to anyone else, only my own family was there, everyone else had given up and in many houses, the family was other wise.  The only thing you can look forward and fall back is family Family is what is permanent in life Religion can change Maybe not I am not saying it should be done but people do Many people religion changes You know the procedure Koi Kisi  Do you know how the house of a person changes? But he is not telling you to do it. It is possible that the citizenship of the country can change. You know, today we were Indians, yesterday we became American citizens, we were American, someone became British, citizenship also changed.  It is possible that religion can also change. It is okay, both things can change. How will family change? Family is always there, family is the only truth, the only constant. You can run away from everything but family is family when you are there any time.  You Will Have to Fall Back It's Your Own Family Your Own Siblings Parents Spouse Children So  Don't Give Up So Fast Some Times What Judge Happened I Will Come To Relationship Workshop I Have Hurt Many People In Life Understand Lot Of People Have Had Very Tough Relationships With Their Parents They Have Seen Their Parents' Relationship Not Quite Good Their Faith In Marriage Again They do not think that family can ever give them happiness, this is also a fact and once you unfortunately become  If you have many such children, then in this time life will again give you a chance to create your own family and not do the same mistakes when you become a father. Life gives you a chance again to live your own childhood the way you wanted and  You can live this life is very beautiful if you understand that you get a chance again to be the father.  You Wanted Your Father To Be And It Will Give You Comfort Be The Mother You Always Wanted To Be That Parent To Your Child And See Your Child Having Fun That You Probably Couldn't Because There's No Way That You Can Go Into The Past  And correct your anything it can't happen that trauma that emotion will go a little bit dark side I will stop this video right here Because after this the expenses seem like water, then it is okay if you want that relationship because I have a very good explanation beyond that because many things do not feel right to be said in the public domain because there are many sensitive people in India, it is okay to be sensitive too, video  You will come to know what people understand about sensitive and what it should be and what is the correct definition of sensitive. There are two definitions that I always want to correct people. One is selfish.  If one is selfish and the other one is sensitive, then many people have mismatch between these two. If you want, brothers and sisters, then write this also in the other wise comment section. You can also write in the comment section of RW Relationship Webinar or in my comment section.

    "content": "Hello friends, today's topic is the same Indian most of Assam, okay love, you discuss religion and politics and nowadays you have come a lot, why do you do psychology, what should not be done, should not be done at all, these two things should not be done at all, but workers.  They have become like this, every other person on the road works for some political party and he will not be there for you, everything is in danger, religion is also in danger, the country is also in danger and the arguments will have to be discussed, so I tell you that everyone is conscious through discussion.  what is yours  Many problems in life are like that, what happens is not in the eyes, sometimes what happens in the distance is visible to you, but if you don't tell what is happening nearby, then the time can be passed by the Illuminati who is running the system.  China goes to Ukraine, Putin with these economic crisis jobs, artificial intelligence, talk about far and wide, in your house that is a boy, a girl, he does not pick up on time, there is no bedsheet, I am on him, in your Fox, he is the same.  Do because we immediately move away from whatever issues we have in life, as if we feel that we have a very middle class disease, lower class you will never be seen discussing politics, you will be seen earning money and that too by going and voting for whomever you want.  They do taxes for their own benefit and the rich class doesn't care about their cheats, my cards are also mine, they don't care about their father's, you today, you today, today you, all of us, all of you, our shop.

People are praising on WhatsApp groups in social media. No, this is fine, this is fine, this is fine, hey, whatever are the politics, let's discuss politics first. Whatever these politicians are, this is service to the public.  Of  We ourselves say that we are servants, so since when did we start fighting over servants?

I am here and you are here to protest.  For him, you people are protesting against him, this house of yours and your family is falling apart. To protest the country, Rs. 15 lakhs have been spent, not only Army, Air Force, BSF has also been engaged, CRPF has been engaged to do the internal work and so on.  Police led BF, I don't know what kind of system has been put in place, everywhere you have politicians, you have ministers, everything is busy, your role is engaged, CBI is engaged.  AD is engaged in the Finance Ministry, you have to worry about all this and in your house, you are the Prime Minister and your wife, whoever is the Deputy Prime Minister, Home Minister, you are not able to do this, you have to discuss about the people's country. I am not saying to everyone in the country that one should not do it, one should not worry or have an opinion, but Sir, Syllabus Dharmesh, it has been 75 years, some religions have been going on for thousands of years, some religions have been going on for 15-20 thousand years. Some religion is going on, it has been going on for 1500 years, but it has been going on for so many years, friend, it is going on till now, it will continue in the future also, this one will go, no, tax this one, it will be like this, it will be like that, friend, you do it yourself.  If you are then it is okay, you are wrapping the whole world in it, only the middle class is doing it, the poor man is not doing it, the rich man is not doing it, that is why he belongs to the middle class, seeing the truth of his house, he wants less money, his caste is less.  he knows about his child  If you don't get a job, it will cost you Rs 30-40 thousand. If an officer is sitting on a job worth ₹ 2.5 lakh, 3 lakh, then he enjoys discussing something else. It is fun to discuss anything else, except to see his real life.  Because if you see the real thing then the blame will go to him, accountability will go to him, it is always but you talk about politicians and cup telling dam ho bed de yaar when I think Indian politician at the best.  Politicians keep the public in good control by twisting it, this is how the country is kept under control. According to me, on politicians, the public says that they fool me, I have not fooled them, my friend of the public, I am not a fool of the public, I am also a politician.  Understand it is okay, I too have glow on my face, it doesn't look bright, it looks bright, a hemoglobin is not visible, it is not visible at all, have you eaten grapes or pomegranate or are you happy or having fun?  Josh, look at your face, how are the people at home? You are pampering those whose face is so sexy, that means if you had walked 3000 kilometers then your body would be fine, it would be good, 3 hours of torture, 4 hours of torture, everyone according to their own.  They are very fit and singing well and you see this great person of theirs, no friend, look at their face, they are ready to fight with each other, you too, vote for this one, you vote for this one, with whomever you can cast your vote.  There is no one to tell us that it can happen as per our wish, this 5% GDP growth is to be achieved and this situation has to continue, no, after their arrival, we are getting a lot of respect in the country immediately, but your children have gone to foreign countries. You are affected, you are there, good things, be happy, what is the need to fight, you know the man is good, so you vote for him, I will tell everyone, oh brother, his child is not going to a foreign country, he does not need respect.  He wants bread, he wants the same thing, you want this, first comes bread, then comes clothes, then comes house, then comes anything else and whose thing has not been sorted out yet, you are sitting here on Maslow's Hierarchy Need, selfish team also crossed.  After attaining Nirvana, the next guy is eating bread, now you are saying, you two vote for one, Baba, she will not vote, someone else will attract her, someone else will attract her and this customer will remain happy and this is India. Possibilities of so me late date happened same one then this ring you control the other tapka ki no I am fine and you reached here ok you come here you come here now tell me what would you have done if you were in this stage of the situation  What am I supposed to do now that you are here, that's why you are making noise. As soon as poverty is prevalent, there is caste, then of course it will be a matter of religion, but I am telling you that if 10 trillion dollars will go to you then you will do whatever worship method you want at home. Whatever system you make, why are you making another one because right now there are some videos like that of Mukesh Khanna, who is Bhishma Pitamah, all of them are saying that we have to come together, everyone becomes sour, it is not us who is afraid.  Only the one who is not gathering is sour, he is not afraid. Why are you creating fear? Is it necessary to be sour? Is it a cricketer? Which animal is gathering? If you think for yourself, then you are telling someone to become sour because it is sour.  hey brother i I am not making anyone up or down, I am just saying that where there is a brother, the situation is such that you are told that when he is not there, then what is necessary for him to happen, otherwise I am here now, if you will not be there now, then your name will be destroyed.  Hey Bhishma Pitamah, Bhishma Pitamah, I mean, I am saying this to Mukesh Khanna, because it is nonsense, first of all, you did not get married, you do not even know what it means to get together, the tax man will now say to you that you are personalizing.  I am attacking that man who has become so old, okay, I don't have the hair of my age, Gyan's hair is white, my age is less, he is also of the age, when will you go, you reside in the Mahabharata, now you have come to your YouTube channel.  Even after making it, you are talking about 15000 years, everything is going well, there is freedom, government, democracy, secular country, army, media, which is conscious, Vivek Buddhi Jha that now and then.  Vani 3600 years ago, whenever there were daily programs, then we went back to make them straight, now we are in danger, friend, what do you mean by not reading history or do you want to do mine? Mukesh Khanna ji says that on Tuesday you have said that All of you and how will you tell by doing like this because they do it, oh brother, don't do it brother and something so flexible cannot be destroyed because it can be destroyed, now it is glasses, now this is a  It is a rigid and flexible thing. Now any person from outside can come and break this thing and destroy it. The Sanatan Dharma exists in so many places, it exists in nature, it is a caste that worships every animal, it is a caste that worships every tree.  There is a caste that worships wind, there is a caste that worships fire, there is a caste that worships water, there is a caste that worships rivers, whom will you destroy brother, such an eternal person, now I am not praising any religion here. And I am not condemning, I am trying to learn here that brother, be careful, become intelligent, what is your intelligent thing in actual or their religion, what to talk about in acting, you will not speak wrong in someone else's religion.  You will make excuses for your elders and silently reduce them in your life. Now this person sitting idle is acting, he doesn't have any role, otherwise say that he is roaming around, he will like this kind of video, he will share it, now in my family, he will make me happy.  I am afraid of reading pakoras, do I have a brother or not? I am something else, am I not a religious person? I am an astrologer, the one who shows the light of God in astrology is called astrology, who is this people, who is Mukesh Khanna and party relation, survival, survive yourself, many people. Earth's Earth Bill Take Care's Itself This Earth Will Take Care's Itself  Keep it six because you think that you have created so many scandals that the backless will come and we will turn to dust, so whenever you are taking care of it brother, you are not taking care of the earth, you are taking care of yourself, this is how religion is religion.  This is going to be you, always be afraid of your take in this system, whenever you see someone talking about religion, run away from there, say, 'Hat, this one is big, very good, I am in danger, bye bye, don't talk any more'  talk about the country Even if you have given an exam then mother will take it, it is a great patriotism, only you have given the exam, someone has given it, Agni Veer has given it, if it is not Agni Veer's, then who are the officers, NDA or any other exam, have you ever given the story? CDS and other ways, you also gave police exam brother, you gave many exams but did not get selected, even if you had a lot of passion, you will take mother, there is no one of yours from far and wide, it is okay and yours.  Nothing to do with the story, but you get up and go here, I do n't know why I am, what is your agenda, what else are you afraid of brother, you are happy, no sourness is done, it is okay, where in the country the car has not come, it is worshipped.  Water is poured on the tyres. Wherever Rafale goes, he is worshipped. Lemon is also put in his tires. How can that religion be in danger? that religion will be  Is it yours? Since when did you become a threat? You don't want to make it and there are no scripts like this. Send it friend so date. Do people have any thoughts in their mind? Is there anything wrong in this video? I told you about religion. This is excellent. Keep it in your home and do puja.  Reduce everything, don't tell others how to do Sanatan Dharma, accommodation is done, these foreigners too, who become many, read more of our religion and give more knowledge that here, you can do anything for everything. This is acceptable, you are spreading things of intolerance here, Mukesh Khanna ji, why are you doing this? You have so many friends of so many elderly people, you have so much strength in your voice, your style is complete, why are you doing this, friend, why do you keep making videos like this on WhatsApp?  You are spreading it, you are the one spreading whatever you say, we will also do it Tuesday Bill are giving this Bill are giving whatever days are Monday, you are Sunday and I am telling you, I also know [music] and I am killing style by working in America And I am showing it below, I am taking it to a very high level, I am taking religion to a very high level wherever it exists, I am taking it to such a high level that it is a different thing from the one who is talking more about religion.  He is lowering his level, his level is not falling, we have to raise someone of our own, contribute something to him, but there has been some amendment in that too, with the passage of time, who are you spreading brother? you will give whose  You are the one who wants to get something done, you are the one who is getting it done, we are also understanding that we are ours, we will do it, brother, now say this, make it a band, we will do at least what has to be done, it doesn't matter who all went, this is the resilience of the country.  It is very strong, anything can be jailed because there is so much flexibility inside, no one could break it, wherever whoever ruled, all of them went into things, but if we go back then there must be something wrong with our personality, what is it about us?  You have to break the things in our personality, because of which everything happened, taking care of family, being at individual level, being so great that individual cannot be broken, yes organization was not dear armies, I was captured, became slave.  All the programs were done but the resilience at the individual level was very low because the individual did not have a brother. Now you can spread the brother at the individual level.  If you are breaking even the last thing, then what difference will it make? I hope the audience will have understood this thing and will also do this thing and I have talked about a lot of higher order thinking. The channel is about higher order thinking. The channel is off course. If you are less educated, you will not understand.  It is okay because water exists in every country and in every religion and only they capture it because smart intellectuals do not tell you that water exists in every country and in every religion. Exist but their voice is very low and water is the highest and their they say na by de time de truth first time it's leggy liye had song around de world and come back raha tha truth ki main bhi nikal ke jaake Till then I will tell you that she will come back live. In today's era of social media, what is one lie, one hour, two hours, then you will come to know that brother, this was wrong, this was wrong, this was not true, if 2 hours.  You somehow twisted her, she will get destroyed, then how much will she keep saying after that, yes, it was a lie, but it is a very crazy book that will make her drink and that poison will enter her, so please do something to tie this book.  I have tried to twist the truth a little so that it is not of this world but in our small world of yours, the confusion in your group gives you the positive side of the cat, where to fox the golden hand, it is becoming extreme fox."

    "title": "Why It Is Important For You To Understand Politics In Present Times ？ [TgPhlmp_FLE].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, there is a very important message for the youth, tell me do you agree that it is a very important thing and important thing which I am telling you for politics and youth, has it become important for everyone from the youth which is also above but  It is even more important for the youth that politics is something now which we cannot escape from so we will have  To know what is happening in politics because now relationships are being affected, friendship is being affected, if it is not happening then tell me because these politicians have been able to various sources get into our brace and our blood and cannot get out.  You may have to face prejudice on the job, there is politics on the job, it is also linked to politics, politics is happening at home, it is happening in the locality, it is happening in the society.  If you teach in a college or a school or maybe you study in a college, there you also know that political opinion has become very important, so how to deal with this subject, how to understand politics in a positive way because everyone has understood it.  Have you made it whether you are with it or by doing it, but can there be an independent thought process to understand things, for this I want to tell you that I have a separate exclusive channel Guruji.  From Gurugram, I will put its link in the comment section. I am explaining this thing in a very good way and very lovely and good feedback is coming. You go to the comment section, subscribe, watch videos there and get some updates daily.  There is a lot of noise and noise in this and very opinionated things are being told. I want that the youth of my country should not be opinionated, they should not take all kinds of opinions, they should be flexible.  There should be curiosity and desire to know everyone and being one sided means that we commit the mistake of thinking that this is right or this is not right, there are only actions in life, there are consequences, some right and wrong are known much later. So that's why it is very important to learn this thing in an actual independent way because a media has been called Godi Media, we know the definition of Godi Media, what Godi Media and those people agree with but  The one which is called unbiased media or independent media is also not independent, it is just the Godi media which they like, they dislike it and they are opposite of the spectrum, so one is Godi media and the other is unbiased media.  I am taking the middle path, of course, not everyone has the capacity to understand things at a deeper level because contradictions come up anywhere. People really want to know whether this is a salty dish or a sweet dish.  Whose test is this, do people want to be on one side or right or wrong, black or white because understanding things in the led way, keeping layered thinking, keeping higher order thinking, keeping alive to the possibilities, like now I have come after voting like you. Which is my subscriber base, I hope everyone above 18 would have come after voting, so coming after voting does not mean that you should not ask questions beyond the person for whom you have voted and that's all they say.  He cannot forgive blood like this and it does not mean that one has to speak only against the one who did not come to vote, I did not come after voting for him, I did not come after voting for him, so there will be discussion about him also, but brother, I came after voting for him.  So there will be accountability because the right questions are not being asked to the politicians. Politicians are able to get away with all the nonsense issue. You must have seen in the elections what level of debate has taken place and what not. Words are not being used and we who are educated, what I think is my upper middle class middle class audience, those are not our topics, no one is discussing those things, so now whatever election the leader or the government will win.  If it is made then we will ask them questions and ask them not in a sense only to mortify them and score branny points because what happens is when I ask questions then others think that I am theirs.  I am a friend who is not there, this is the statement of a thinker that you are not a friend of anyone, you will ask them too and tell them, let it be brother, we have seen yours also, what is yours, it is okay, you keep sitting, I am just asking questions to him, what does it mean?  That's where you went, okay, that's the problem, people think there are only two alternatives, one is this, this one is okay, we have to understand, all the youngsters have to understand are we listening to.  Me and others are also not so youngsters that there is a buffet, we have to pick something from the plate in front of us, we don't like this either, if you are feeling hungry and don't have a choice, then you have to eat the food or bring your own.  Now we will have to create our own, it is not very easy to have our own thinking, our own ideal, our own party, brother, there are many people gathered and what else is there, all these parties in the political space, like all of them.  If you take Idol ji and take all the people, then brother, then individually Idol ji, serve such a big plate. If someone who is a top leader or a party topper makes the plate so big, then people will say, brother, at least something tastes tasty.  As for you, there is nothing tasty here, you are understanding that you have put bitter gourd, you know, Locky Tinde vegetable, you do not like all these, there are a lot of such things which you don't like but then if there is any one in it then you don't like it.  It is also giving pizza, it is also giving pasta, suppose you like fast food or you are also giving Golgappa, it is also giving tikki, it is also giving chaat papdi, it is also giving dosa, it is giving this, then it cannot be that  If you don't like anything, then he has spread his plate so much, if you are understanding then a lot can happen, you don't like it and you are like that I don't want this but if you want something, then the politician will do it, but  us genuinely  You will have to come and say that friend, this fast food is not good, this type of pizza is not good, it spoils the health, bring a sattvik thali like this, bring it like this, we need someone to say this, we need someone to comment, not someone who raises issues.  How relevant are they, how much do they affect our lives, if not, then why are you speaking, why do you only take sentiments and emotions, and these sentiments and emotions are vocal for a while, this one.  After that, mom's tune changes and then she starts eating, so all of us have to ask questions, the politician's questions, a more questions should be put up to people who are actually in the power because they are directly sitting in a position where  Can Affect Your Lives Yes You Will Have To Question The Opposition Also That Brother Why are you not asking questions, why do n't you ask questions properly, why don't you do this, why is this not happening, why do they also have to say that you are sitting comfortably, what kind of opposition are you, you have sold out, you have become like this. They also have to be teased, questions have to be asked on the opposition too, but if you want to do this then 7030 is a healthy combination that on 70, ask questions to the ruling party and on 30, focus on the position also.  Pour in and become an aware public and whenever you will encounter because of this we will have to be able to articulate our political feeling. Because wherever you go, you will not speak. It is not that you cannot remain silent every time because no matter how many times you remain silent.  Now he has come inside the houses, people inside the houses are different, you tell me will a marriage work very well if there is a difference between many idols ji or have you not understood?  You will have to have the ability to explain in the lead way, because among brothers, sisters, parents and children, among relatives, among close friends, in job spaces, because of ideals and mental differences. As a social observer, I see a lot of conflict happening. I personally don't feel it.  These politicians are worth fighting against in anything personal, not because of people's tutu mema, news is coming while scuffling that brother, he  So how did you say this much love means people can get away from saying things to you know your extremely near and dear once, they would have abused you, there would be no fighting beyond that but they have awakened so much spirit that they are ready to fight beyond this. So beyond this, I am saying to the society that let us learn politics and understand what is played, how it happens, I invite you all with folded hands, Guruji from Gurugram, this is my channel.  Please subscribe and follow it, you will get a lot of peace, you will get a lot of clarity and you will go towards progress and growth, otherwise you will be left with bitter frustration somewhere because see, it is a simple thing, you like someone and you don't like someone.  If you don't like, he came to power which is very populous because you will see that the percentage of voting is 37, the party coming to power cannot win more than 40, so people are not voting at 60. Will you remain in bitterness? Do you not have any clarity and those who voted for many people, will you not ask questions? Will you not think anything about them or is it just that the team is divided because this work of divide and rule is very easy.  And this has always happened, so if society becomes intelligent and people start asking good questions, then politicians are much smarter and they will always remain smarter than they will have smart issues.  Now let's discuss the level of issue in this election. It shows the IQ status of the whole country as an average. Just like there is an average GDP per capita, let's say something around 00. Okay, so the average IQ is visible. I am not denying that all of us are like this, but an average score is visible and what is the exact score of that IQ? Cha Jun has an idea. Who will you be if we say no to this? No, I am not speaking like this, I have not told about anyone's special party here, then only when you come will you understand what I am by coming here, you will not be. Able to tell me on that channel whose team I am on, I am not on anyone's team, I am talking about an IQ, ok so please connect with him, thank you very much"

    "content": "Hello friends, today's topic is the same life is not an excel seat, under this I would like to give a little advice to the popular YouTube also if they are watching the athlete, someone needs you, it is not trolling and there is nothing like that that I want to condemn.  It's a thing, but tell me a point of view, I am six, I want to play excel, there is a YouTube, my varicose veins, they take children from 30000 to crores of rupees, that much increment.  You will get 10%, then it will become 5, then it will be like this, then you and I will reach but in practical life, this is not an excel seat, this is an excel seat, the company's business, you have to assess it, you have to see the discounted cash flow, whatever chartered accountants do or business.  Analysts do equity analyst shows, they are great tools for everyone because there are a lot of missionaries in the world, a lot of process, a lot of history in the world, putting an axle seat on human being is very  It's a game of danger because you don't know what bill is happening in your life. You are saving money, it is gaining money, everything is going well, then you will get married, now how did your life partner come into the marriage, you don't know whether that ship will sail or not.  In this cycle, people will not be able to get married out of fear because that program seems to be working well for them. You really do n't know they will ask for money from their parents. You really do n't know that your money is involved and your parents are making noise and sister. You are married, then that piggy bank is broken, this piggy bank, they are playing with the piggy bank, this axle axle, what is this piggy bank, they wanted to play piggy bank, children put so much, then give so much pulses, give so much pulses, you tell me half the weight, you can lose many.  Everyone will say in a week, a lot, next week also half, yes, then in this way, you can lose 26 kg in a year, Corn is losing, tell me, who is the one who is fond of fire, he gets 74 kg, he is the one who is not discounting.  Emotions, human beings and what will happen in life, money, you have too many children, I know many people, then you have moved to GP Green Noida, Greater Noida, you are stuck there, you are not paying your rent, you are also doing relationships.  If your relationship with your wife has deteriorated, if you are getting divorced then what will be the condition of your finances? If you are not getting divorced but the quality of the marriage is bad, then during isolation, put this bill note on Excel and take it. Otherwise, this is a complete waste of time, this is taking content from an English self-help book and adding so many subscribers and reaching so many subscribers, this is not the intelligence of the day after tomorrow, I am giving this, this is showing the ignorance of the public, this is consuming, see the truth, but what will happen now?  These things will not have much life because gradually people will understand after watching the date that they have given the creator no where, now if you speak then you will be so condemnable.  Why are you doing this, I am criticizing you so that you don't come to my shop, no, you are doing this so that you get views of me, you do n't want to see them, let me see you, yes, that's why I am doing this, before this if  If you are interested in writing to any of their soldiers, then yes, this is what I am trying to do, only in a hole stick 360° way, we can go ahead, we cannot run alone, we can also get jobs on the story, you have thought that increment will be given, but the same etc. will reduce the salary.  To  If someone falls in love, will you get any increment? How many jobs are there in the market and how many people are coming on supply basis? There are a lot of miss matches. There are 10 lakh children every month. According to NITI Aayog's report, 10 lakh children are coming into the workforce every month. Jobs are going, not going, no one is saying, they are available in small towns and big cities, all over India, so there will be pressure on the existing ones, only then there will be attitude of employers to come to India.  This attitude will remain for 10-12 years because that supply is very visible. This is a very miss match. Extrapolating this cannot happen in your life. If you mother, you are so happy today, you are so happy and brothers and sisters, if you excel every day.  You can become 1% more happy in a week, then you will reach bliss in 2 years, but this happens, will you put anything in Excel and it is easy to say in the beginning? 1% 5% will definitely happen and the job is also not sustainable. I am a Chhath caste and don't want to do a job. Many people are in touch with me. I have a salary of Rs 4-4-5 lakh per month but I do n't feel good in the job and that's it.  There are lakhs of people who will listen, friend, those who are not getting a job, hey, this is what is happening like this, this is what is happening to them, they can't sustain, they ca n't suspend, so don't ever go on axle in this life, what should you do?  Do Insist today Fox on D Process Be Flexible Be Alive Have Good Habits Good Habits Are Not Only Met But Only Hygiene Habits Good Financial Habits Don't keep yearning Story of anything This yearning to reach I will do this like this I will reach here You don't  What will be the actual value of No Debt Crore? New Rs 25 Lakh will be shown to you by inflation formula. It will be equivalent, it cannot tell the equivalent of Rs 25 lakh, that is a wrong formula, that too is a wrong formula because it is a formula which cannot be entered, a very complex equation is required for that and only you maths people like us will come down for that. Would also like to know what to do with aspiration brother, 25 years ago it was aspirational to have one, now it seems like it should be there as well. Tips are okay, flying in a plane, people wear nice clothes.  Many years ago, what kind of food was available in the plane 30-40 years ago, were there such achievements and such old movies are good, bye bye Tata at the airport, this is what is happening at the airport.  And as soon as he comes out, just like the Prime Minister is treated these days, Modi ji does such and such outside, people do the same as he used to do as a hero, so time things have changed and what will be the change in the next 20 years, what will be the experience.  We do n't even know that we may aspire even for a few lives. We have the power and the one who will open us to the lonely place of fun. They don't know what will be the yearning of the people. So don't plan on axles. Vetiver is the best possible in your life, do date because of its bond.  You can't do it and always try to add value to yourself, your skill set, you keep adding value to yourself, keep doing it, now again and again you bank on it. How much value is added on skill? Now how much money will I take for it? Now I don't care about this. Sachin Tendulkar is an artist and not a singer. If Sachin Tendulkar spent so long of his cricketing life focusing on this thing, how much money is he getting?  How much can I become with so much rest, then maybe he cannot achieve what he has achieved, the graph is focused on this skill and this health too, I have to play for a long time, this fitness is fine, you see the cricketers of today, how quickly they mean Indian cricket.  Team  Look at the situation, what is happening right now, don't know the World Cup is going to come, don't know which players are playing, everyone's names are going on and everyone has broken something or the other, so date on the story, it is the difference. Too much now if you want to do something quickly then everyone take it easy look at yourself Take dee long journey yes long journey is good but don't fool happy hearing some numbers so him numbers can anybody can because you bill set up yourself on  Disappointment because you feel like it will happen and then it doesn't happen. You have to be happy to maintain your mental emotional stability and sanity. Be happy in the future. Bill Wickham A Big Problem Money is not spent by those who have it. No, he is thinking that I don't know how to be a lotus, what can I see and get happiness from those who have it, and then that life is going on, you are on money, give it more importance, you are matching, what is life?

If I continue to drive at this speed, I will reach here and in the middle, if I get a tire puncture, in the middle I go to take a break, in the middle I fall asleep, in the middle I meet a traffic jam, in the middle I lose my way, then you have other things this  This is the best scenario of this, it will happen, what preparation is needed for this, you are already doing it brother, you can invest Rs 30000 in it by coming to Excel again and again every day, how much will it become now, how much will it become now, what do you do?  Is this what I have criticized a bit necessary? Is it too much? What should not be done? Should it be done exactly like this on flower jaggery? Today you love your wife so much, every day.

There are so many variables, anything from a children's story, is a Shakti, is a bouncer a Shakti or is Shakti life, that one is not behind that brother, this is the picture of the Oval, it is like this, even the pitch behaves differently on different days in cricket.  In the morning, if it's night, then when God comes, she behaves differently. If the wind comes from behind, then she behaves differently. If monsoon overcast, she behaves differently. Saree is involved in science. How will the hair swing, whose will it do then?  That batsman has to be adjusted in life, who is not a real player, otherwise, you are absolutely fine, the flat pitch thing, all five days are like Indian movies etc., then there you cannot become a master player, because there your axle will move first.  It is also like this, if it is four devices then it depends on how your life is, but your pitch bill is never consistent in life so excel bill never is it, this note is your internal etc. where the test is.  Let's say that it is a dynamic checking system of things, it is like this in small things and it will be like this in big things also, that environment is controlled only by you, because the ideal gas equation is learned to introduce such things in your life. So, what is that thing that you are putting in Excel? You are not putting that variable in it. You are just putting it like this.

What are the benefits and should it not be put and this flower is just too much, it is fine and it will give more pain and will not take you anywhere in life, I am trying to give a little logic, since 18 years you can address this thing, you can use it in any  You will go to college, go to any setting, your college is very poor, it is not very good, it is not on rank, it is not ITM, it is not even NIT, it is below that, it is below that, there is one below that, there you will definitely get opposite sex, boy or girl.  So let's meet, okay now the girl over there, if people want to understand this video by watching it from a success point of view, then I would think that they are not listening in a pragmatic manner and are watching those girls pass their time and achieve more in life.  not by achieving They can also get a post, they can get married, they can become a housewife, 90% of the time it is like this, the boy's will not work but he is getting that feeling on time, but he has the same system as the girl's, she is in the same college.  If I am there then the ecosystem is here but it is not necessary that she is hanging out with you. If she is in a romantic relationship then will she marry or will she open up to get married? There the boys who are working hard are making less, more money, less.  Because it's just Looking for this thing is good, talks good, talks good boy, ultimately what you will become in only marriage market, decided by exactly what you are doing, has much mani making potential, has it is not decided, boy's future, how he looks, how he doesn't decide.  When he decides what he does, how much money he earns, when he decides, then Krishna, who is four-five-six years old, reduces his life to his own limits.  The more you increase your mani making potential and the sooner you move on that path, the chances of you attracting a good spouse or getting a spouse the way you felt and wanted will be higher. Otherwise, this is the message, then you will remain negative that girls cheat. Girls are like this, girls say like this because it will be off course, you don't have that much time to pass, girls are so greedy, why shouldn't they be greedy, they get married and have children.  You have to put your life on the line with someone, brother, Bill, they should not be chicks, Narmada Kingdom, which is the animal kingdom, has a female in it, because of this there is a lot of technicality in her life.

    "title": "Why Middle Class Children Are Not Able To Decide On A Career ？ [hiQM8-Dy9c0].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, I have seen a very interesting trade, I bring the trade first, by the time the form of train data is prepared, I am very scared, I will keep the trade first, understand, bring this channel first for you people, yes.  This is my middle class series, so you know that the videos are making a lot of noise, a lot of content is being tried to be copied, it is getting closer but it is original, this topic is original, today's topic has come in this one.  It's a tough time for the middle class children and the employed people or small businesses. Why are they not doing anything? This trade is clearly visible. Something is going on for the poor. Everyone seems to be doing less for the rich. The middle class has always been good.  What I am going to tell today in the class is that I am going to tell which middle class parents currently have a thought process due to which Jain ji, who is yours, is a youngster, they are hesitant in reducing the story. They are dying, they are not able to understand, a general pattern is seen today catch hall of others 21 22 23 and what are you doing, what do you want to do, I do n't know what to do, tell me a pattern of this, this is the ranking ranking of a middle class. Cry understand, I will tell you something less professional. You, I am telling you that staying connected with me and agreeing yes and yes is correct because the truth is hidden in this itself. If it is said that politicians are thieves, then if no one says anything, then the politician is a thief.  It is not necessary to become a politician, it is a thief's favorite time pass. Our businessman got all the thieves, so brother, the shopkeeper got it for Rs. 45, so it is expensive, so he is a thief, he took it for Rs. 40 from the distributor, it is okay, it is less than that from the distributor. Then the manufacturer, that supply chain is only a saree supply chain, if money is needed then the saree supply is a thief, the one making it is a thief, the one selling it is a thief, the one keeping it is a thief because middle Classes were hardworking and she is bringing them, so why is she saying that instead of 50, she should have sold it for 30, it would have been fine then that would have been right, so there is a thought process, something has to be done in Bollywood, so you know that nepotism is there.  Moral issues remain, shoes of morality remain, then there is also the issue of religion and religion, so you have written it off, it is okay, do n't exclude it, then let's move ahead Doctor, oh Doctor, someone has also come forward.  These people also indulge in such theft, not all do but such allegations have been made that the education system of India is ruined, the education system is also ruined from which these middle class children have emerged and they do not even want to join it because  They themselves ruin with their own mouths, all of them on YouTube are also frauds, they are useless, influencers are like this, so no one wants to be here too, because if you go to a stage, you will sell your program or the other.  If you want to do something then the man will do this, you will do this, so earn money here, I don't know why people think that they come to do social service on YouTube or at all those who have it, they come to the thought process again of the middle class, which is what they have done. Their child cannot become like this because this is also not considered good because father and mother will not celebrate the thing, will not clap, all the government employees are thieves, they are also worthless, if they are government employees then they are thieves.  They are useless, this is a set pattern, it is a different matter that even then ISC has become, I will discuss completely and tell you a little sarcastic video, this is the hypocrisy of middle class, jump, have bin de topic, maybe maybe I have changed de topic later on, also defending on.  D Situation, I said something first, I also said something, okay, so I am explaining the hypocrisy to the society, to you, the middle class who is my audience, I am explaining the hypocrisy business.  They are thieves but if our children do their jobs then it is okay, the government is a thief, government employees are thieves, this is how it happens in the government, it is the initiative, the road is for the road, it is the government but we have to do the government job, is it leaving anyone and whom?  Whom do you curse, tell me, it is random, what I am telling is my favorite real estate developer builder, all this theft is happening, it is injustice, this saree is happening with the middle class, now it is being built.  Class does not allow him to go into the field of power. In real estate, everyone is a thief. The education system is corrupt. Politicians are thieves. The story is about Murli. People are finished. The story is about people being corrupted by money. If you have taught this to the children, then brothers and sisters. If we live in India then we will go to the lower class because if the rest are below this then we will belong to the lower class because you will not call a sewerage worker corrupt, you will not call a rickshaw puller but he is yours.  A child cannot become the one who can become your child, you have rejected all the dishes, you do not get respect for the story in it, you do not get the responsibility of it, then you yourself want to move your startup towards color, is it ITM or whatever program you want to do, whose  For which company, for those products which have thieves as promoters and businessmen who steal, then this hypocrisy has entered the mind so much that the middle class is saying that the parents are saying that the mother knows that the son should speak.  There are some things like showing teeth, different from eating, but this new generation is taking it at face value. This is the genuine generation. Children are always loved, good and complete, as long as they are not allowed to spoil them at all, parents.  There is relief among those of the generation above those who are roaming around, crying about their job and less. If you are an employee in the government and you earn your living from your job, then your child will not go to the government because it has never given you happiness. See if you make money in business GST was looted, tax was looted, husband also lost my water, if this job is better than brother's then your child will not go into business, then uncle will tell uncle, you don't even do government work, then he will tell you that this is you. Don't do anything else, he won't let you do anything, he has painted all the people black, so no DIY, personal fool, children sold from middle class people, no questions about parents, I will make a video, it's ok now, job, money  Respect is there to earn, not for respect. No one is getting it. This is the problem in India. Only one person is getting respect. Only one person gets it and he is not ready to sacrifice his life for it. Everyone is their soldier.  They respect us, they are very good Indians, they are very good at discussing, we all abuse but we call our soldiers as brothers and this is a very good thing, Jaspal, soldiers and farmers come to the country with respect, see more vacancies.  There are so many who do n't want to become farmers at all, and for the rest you have to take exams and there is no vacancy limited. I said yes, I have to go, so I will definitely go, so I have to do UPSC and if I want to go to the lower level, then so be it.  You have to do your bravery there too, that 4 year long process, the problem is that the bush is respectable, you don't want to go there and wherever you want to go, you call it dirty, dirty, useless with your mouth, so how can you say so?  If you have a dish, tell me, but the house is dirty, it is dirty, Dal Makhani is Gandhi, Roti is Gandhi, Mishri, Roti is also Gandhi, Rice is also dirty, Biryani is also dirty, Pulao is also dirty, this is what you will eat, what will you eat, not porridge, even porridge has been spoiled, no, we are very  They respect eating Khichdi. Mother does not respect Khichdi. If you understand then there is no profession in front of children where something goes wrong. There is no profession where there are no good people.  Sometimes they happen, they should be celebrated but you cannot become them, so next time when you cry in the front, then you look below and those below you, the lower class is coming up, all the things that the lower class used to do are coming up.  Now they are also entering into the domain of the middle class and the middle class has already declared them that here they are worthless, they are thieves or it means yes, they are not respected that much, then the child.  What are you waiting for for your children, then they say, then what happens and you will realize yourself, relatives will reduce their friend circle, they will go there in a foreign country and Indian middle class are ready to do it at 5% off. Read more  They get some good jobs by writing. 95% of the middle class kids leave India because the lower class people cannot work here. The middle class has declared that nothing is good, so they go and work in a foreign country.  Do we reduce the class, do we do it or not? Brothers and sisters, please write the solution in the comment section. This is the simple stop bed mouthing. Anybody in India is adopting the same thing which is their profession. It is like this outside also, there is a lot of noise there as well.  This is bad, there is nepotism here, are government teachers considered good, what is the situation, tell me, which profession do you consider very great from local politics, in your eyes, please comment in the area.  Write that the people and the working people have been sucked inside the corporate sector, whom you had earlier declared that they all came out of this hypocrisy, the middle class is this, give it a de-request, only your next generation will pick up the bill, something because if they too start up.  If you want to do it, then they have also become businessmen and when you make them more stars in the startup, then take out all the parents and brothers from yourself too.  40 50 60 70 lakh PF, pour petrol, break your HD, break the mutual fund and give it to the children, Papa, it is over by the evening, sorry, there is one thing, there is noise, something can be made as per your wish, asked your broom, the utensil will do it on its own and the noise is its hundred percent okay.  If yes, then there should be no shame in doing all this."

    "title": "Why Middle Class Is  Not Buying Car ？ [M9zB_ssBHYE].en",
    "content": "Hello friends of Cars, we have seen that people are saying that the inventory is not being sold. The inventory of 60-70 days means that there is so much goods in the shops that it will take 60-70 days to clear it there for use.  B Time Just Three Months Pack When there was negative inventory which meant that when someone went and wanted a car, they used to say that it would have to wait, meaning it was not meant to be given to him, just for show. Had some cars for purchase but didn't have time to give them away, so used to wait for two months, three months, four months, some models after six months, so let's analyze a little what has changed, okay, one is so full of water, I don't feel like buying a car at this time. Firstly, this is the region, secondly, now you are getting discounts and people are waiting for more discounts, so I hope it will be released in Navratri now, but another tectonic shift is taking place, this is about the economy. Apart from the economy, it also tells one thing about the country that right now the infrastructure of the middle class seems fine from outside, otherwise people feel scared when they take this sedan and this car which sticks to the road and  I do n't have the money to buy the higher one, I am sitting with the lower one, that is one, on top of that, if you understand a little mathematics about the car, then we will listen carefully that if there is a car worth ₹ lakh, brothers and sisters, then it is a car worth ₹ lakh. You will have to pay ₹ 10 lakh to buy it. Yes, what is the big thing in it, but when I give that ₹ lakh, I will have to earn ₹ 15 lakh for it, because 5 lakh is already in my tax, I am in 30% slab or I will take a loan.  Then the interest will be calculated, it will be more expensive, so let's not talk about it, let's talk about it, so yes friend, he is right, now I gave Rs 10 lakh and took a car worth Rs 10 lakh.  I will pay the registration money, then I will pay the insurance money and then I will also pay GST on both the things. Oh friend, yes he is saying the right thing but the car manufacturer who bought the car worth Rs 10 lakh has also paid GST, vesting and all the other things.  If he has also paid tax then how much does the car cost? Maybe it is worth Rs 5 lakh or Rs 6 lakh. They see in the math that very little money is left on each car for the manufacturer. Then you buy the car and then you pay the road tax.  Then if the car runs then you will pay toll tax, what will you put inside the car, what will you put in petrol and diesel, beyond that you will pay tax, then if you get the car serviced, you will pay tax on it again, you will pay tax on the servicing money, tax on servicing too, next year then tax on insurance. Then road tax, then toll tax, I had already paid tax and the money I earned was also received by paying tax, so friend, this is a very amazing thing, so why not buy a car, I should definitely buy a car.  I am going to give some tips here. If you like buying a car, now think like this. If you want to buy a car worth 8 lakhs, then I would say buy it for 12 lakhs but now drive it for 15 years. If you buy petrol then there is no need to change it.  The second thing I would advise to the elite middle class is that it is better to have a little bit inferior car which you can afford some times and have a driver.  Instead of having a car which is like beyond your this thing because who will give the driver's 15000 rupees, you can get it in 12 months, you can get it in 15 depending on how much your terms condition is, it is always better to have that than driving it yourself because now  If you want to drive yourself then I will take mine which is automatic and madam is not able to drive it, then I will take another car to pay the expenses of the car.  Brother, this is so much, so much that it can deprive you of buying a flat. If you are fond of buying useless cars, if you could have managed with one car in 15 years, then it is okay, you have bought three-four. Look. Businessman and depreciation seems to be like this, then the game is different, then it should be changed every 4 years, but more, my core audience is the business people too, they have the intelligence anyway, they are chartered accountants to give them more knowledge.  There is no need for it, they have the benefit, they took depreciation, sold it, bought another one, then this happened, that happened, they can own it, but the common man does not have any such facility, there is nothing like this, so you can keep your car in good condition.  Drive from and it doesn't last that long and sometimes what happens is that I will go somewhere to roam, you have to go anywhere to roam, you always take Innova Kata type vehicle on a taxi, not that much, it will cost you Rs 20,000, this is Still worth it because you will go on a trip only once or twice a year. In order to travel once or twice, I have seen people buy an expensive car worth Rs. 15-20 lakhs and do not go anywhere, once or twice the enthusiasm cools down.  And the second biggest thing is that I talk about practical things. From here you went to visit Agra. Okay, there you visited Taj Mahal. Then there is that Red Agra Fort. There the car parking sucks the soul. Go with a driver, go by taxi, just get down. And she can cook anywhere as per her wish, it takes quarter of an hour, I have seen people, the husband is coming back after cooking and the family is waiting like this, they are waiting in the village, they are doing it in the rains, they are doing it in winter, whatever the weather in India.  She is not sexy, go to someone of yours, there is some problem in her, then it is okay, then those poor people are waiting, why will the husband come, yes, I have gone to cook, but I am not getting a place, then I tell you practical things like, you are someone, I am from Agra.  I am taking an example, it can be any tourist destination, go to Udaipur, go to Jaipur, go to Jaisalmer, go to Kullu Manal, anywhere, take any one, wherever you go, it is okay, if you leave from Delhi or from anywhere, then you reach there if you are the person who  He is going there by driving himself, he will be tired, he will be better, now after cooking it in the hotel on the same day, he cannot roam around because he himself is stressed out, he will say, eat now.  After eating, he relaxes a bit and when he goes, he is making his body like this, instead of this, if he is going comfortably, if he is not stopping and playing himself, then he is talking, enjoying, see the photo, don't take it as everybody.  Jhoom Lu, I am that car he is driving, he has rented a car in Switzerland, it has become a romance, it is not for him, I am talking about a common man whose stomach is protruding, it has been a long time since his marriage.  If the wife is irritable and the children keep doing that, then it is best for them to stop the car, make them urinate, have tea, do that because when a man drives the car himself, he has 50 tantrums, the wives too must be listening, they are practical.  Does not stop him or reach early because he has some agents of his own that I am the driver of the car, brother, keep the driver, if you want to go anywhere then the driver should be with you. Watch this video, I will keep giving such practical tips to you and this will help you in your life.  You will get peace of mind by saving money and if you have hired your own driver then you can also hire your own but always take a car to the out station to go out, there is no fear of the car being stolen, you do not have the headache of an accident in the car, your car is yours.  A man is driving, he will drive properly, they are professional drivers, it is their daily work because I have seen that when I say to the youngsters, ' Dude, how much experience do you have on the highway, you have less, so it means you are going to enjoy, right?  So let that guy drive on the highway, he has made 50 trips, he also knows the places, he has not strayed anywhere, people say no, nowadays if he comes, then people think brother, he will reach everywhere, isn't he a practical driver who has been to 50 places in the city? He knows about things, he knows about everything, and the biggest thing is that it saves your time in traveling everywhere. If you see the things there in three days, then you can go somewhere and spend four days if you stay in a hotel. live in  There you can manage for three days because you will save your hotel money for one day because you have that much time and energy with the driver and the driver is a professional driver.  He will drive a lot during the day, driving the car anywhere is his daily work and you will enjoy it comfortably. Now and many times, I will tell you what happens. Classical practical things have been brought up in the family. We have gone in a seven seater. Mummy is  Sister and wife means two ladies, do they have children or do they all live in separate houses? You know about the kinship and in that the ladies feel like going shopping in the evening because I have time and energy too and man, if I don't go then brother they Send a taxi with a driver, you have brought it yourself, how much do you want to roam around, how much patience do you have, going to small markets and parking sucks the soul, so even the husband can enjoy comfortably, the man is sitting comfortably, sister-in-law.  Wives have gone shopping, we are sitting comfortably, I am telling you practical and when you go, you can also take two taxis, there is no need for all the family members to go in one bus, go comfortably, if you have taken one car then everything will be there in it.  In this way, we will sit on top of each other because the driver will take one seat. Go with two. He is telling practical things that more money will be saved and there will be more enjoyment. We should not focus on how much money is being spent in life. We should focus on how much money is spent.  How much pleasure does 100 units get? If 100 units get 40 pleasures, then it is better than 100 units and 15 pleasures. Well, if there and in that case, maybe 90 is spent and only 10 pleasures are spent. Here, 100 are spent.  Go and Anand 4045 comes, no one thinks like this in return on investment, Anand's investment will also have to be seen, how much will be mine, what about the day you get it.  I am telling you that when you go on a trip and you have a trip of three to four hours, wherever you go, your trip is of three to four five hours, then on the day you have to come back, you do not do anything on that day. Place because on that day you just have to wake up in the morning, eat that breakfast and just go home. Now if there is a driver then you can slightly delay and you can still have an agenda for that day and still make it count. Get up a little and do one half thing at the time. Looking ahead, have you visited Fatehpur Sikh or have you done anything else? I have seen the second tome, whose is Humayun's, which one is his, Jahangir's, but Jahangir's is right, and as I am telling you, I have not found any. And no, I am the only one, okay, these are practical things, then you make a video of it, then you put it on YouTube, then you earn money, that means you understand that you are not driving, okay, so you are roaming around, I did not do it.  this works fine  But you can do it, you can do anything in life because you know how to use the car. It is necessary to keep the car at home. Someone who does the calculations every year, I don't use it, he lives in Faridabad.  Every person does not live in such a place, if there is pain in the stomach at night, then one needs a poor quality vehicle. If something happens somewhere to go, it is necessary to keep a car, if someone comes or not, but I find myself in it, I would have asked you a question in one life. I am one with you  There is a car of 12 lakhs and another car of 25 lakhs, then which one is better, in which one you will be called rich. Of course, in the one of 25 lakhs, you will be called rich by going in a car of 25 lakhs. Okay, now let's change your 12.  There is a driver in a lakh car, you sit at the back like a gentleman, he opens the door in the same manner, you give him respect, you can use him for many purposes and you have yourself at many places.  You go as a driver, where the wives have to meet those relatives with whom you have no interest in meeting, but you go as a driver, you should count those four days too, no expenses, then which man will be called richer, you tell me now.  Has it become like a truck or not? On the face of it, the one with Rs 25 lakhs seems rich but the brother with Rs 12 lakhs is also stealing the show. If the car is a driver then the driver also has his own respect. Maybe you may still say that No, the one with 25 lakhs is richer because he has a good car and the one with 12 lakhs is the one with driver but then the one with 12 lakhs is with no driver and the one with 25 lakhs is the clear winner again with no driver but in The Moment I Get Khani. Driver has put a twist, now that difference of ₹ lakhs, should I invest it somewhere, brothers and sisters, if it becomes worth this much, then this was going to be my salary for the year.  1.6 Lakhs, so what difference can it make, can I buy a car by paying more than my salary of 10 Lakhs and 10 years' salary? If I had invested that money in 10 years, it would have doubled in 6 years. Now you have started liking the calculations, see, those of you who own a car below Rs 78 lakh and are lower middle class and consider yourself middle class, you will not understand anything about me.  Many times I feel ashamed to say that you speak like a bad Guruji and shame people on the basis of money, but then people are not ashamed to write dirty comments, then why should I feel ashamed to explain, I will tell you this if you are poor.  If you are in the lower middle class or are above poverty, then all this calculation is not yours, this calculation is for the one who has a scene of a car worth Rs 12,20,25 lakh and a scene of two cars, especially two. Whoever has the ass must have a driver. Being a driver, mom's work is done. Aunt was coming from the railway station. There is an airport drop. Someone has to come. Hey, your time will be saved. Is there any value to your time? Are the calculations of the car very strong?  I could have made it by doing Microsoft Excel but they get confused because I am telling you this calculation, I am telling you to do it yourself. What is the value of your time? Our time has no value.  So Then you are a poor person because if a rich person's time has value, then this is for those people whose time has value. If you take a driver, then if someone tells you no, you have 15 minutes of work to do at 3:00.  If you have to pick her up from there, then your game is over because you cannot do the work that you were supposed to do at 1 to 4:00, because at 3:00 the stick has arrived and madam will tell you whether she will come and bring you or will you hit her with the stick.  otherwise because their  Sister is coming, your sister-in-law is coming and you will not go, brother-in-law, brother-in-law, if brother-in-law had a driver, he would have sent him. If you did not want to go, time would have told, if you could do that work now, you could have earned money in work, but if  Your time has no value, you are a valet, so you are being used like a driver. Many men are used like drivers. My heart hurts women. No, I do not speak against women like that because they have manners and etiquettes.  There is a lot to say, I speak slowly, but women, look, there is a housewife in the house, the husband goes to earn money, works from morning to evening, the woman who does not work, the middle class housewife does not earn a single rupee, she hired a broom seller.  There is a mopping person, a dusting person, a utensil person, and many of them have also kept a cook. So brother, he cannot keep a husband or take a driver for himself so that he does not get any happiness because he is a man, he is supposed to perform everything.  Where are they right from, meaning he is poor everywhere, so by driving he may have some problem in his body, due to the problem in his body, he may have performance issues somewhere, then he may have to pay for those performance issues, you understand. Brothers and sisters, I am speaking about such deep things, my iconic relationship course is coming in November, it will wreak havoc on people's knowledge in a positive way. If you have not attended it live, then it will be in recording.  It will become more expensive, now there is a discount on it, if you see the number in the comment section, then it means the R of the relationship and book the slot now, otherwise the slots will be over, the discount that is going on will go away and  Then the fees will be huge, so join it, it is an iconic course, there will be seven classes of two hours each, all these are the troubles of the house which I teach and explain, today I took the topic of car, car is something which  It is a white elephant which means you bought it expensive but you are not able to taste it. Money does not allow you to taste it. It is also a fact that you can enjoy it with money. I am giving you a big knowledge in life. It is very difficult to earn money in life. It takes a lot of effort.  But it is more difficult than that to save money. It is more difficult than that to grow that remaining money and to make it bigger and increase it. But the most difficult thing is to enjoy and taste the increased money. There are many people who do not know how to taste life. They neither know how to buy food nor money  Neither do they know about relationships nor do they mean to have fun in life and this is an art and a Guruji can teach this art, just like in our Haryana it is called Kache Katna or Kache Katna, this is also a niche in itself, it is used by every third person of Haryana.  A man knows it, but not all the people of Haryana take my course and in Haryana also only one in three comes, okay and mostly they are of different level, so if you are the one and you want to learn this in life then you will see that one of yours is amazing.  I have my own driver, it's great  Make him wear a cap and keep it clean everywhere when you get down and you will not have to park your car in the mall. You will park in that under basement parking and then take his photo so that you do n't forget where you parked it and then he will walk away.  Then by then your family will have already been dropped and then you will run behind them, then next time when you will have to take out the car, oh I have to go, then I will bring the car, trouble driver, park the car, I am coming sir.  That car is not there, when did it cost 5 lakhs, why did you see 3.1 3.2 in it, I do n't know for how long they have been saying that no, this K10 model, this one has become so expensive, then understand the car, understand life, understand money, understand a lot.  People don't listen to me Guruji but I love driving If you love driving you will be a driver Have you ever heard any female sing Any female sing I love washing utensils Hey it's a thief you  You are not driving Formula One You are not driving in the sexy settings of Switzerland with Kajol and above And that hair is flying in Shahrukh Khan's and aise aise karke gaana raha hai It is not a setting, it is mud, these pot holes, drivers still know  Where is it and where to run it and how to do it ok it's better that you outsource and a lot of people I know people can afford it and yet they are not  Doing it, tell me how did you like the video? Write something good in the comment section. If you understood something, you can take membership of the channel and brother, relationship course is made. It is starting after Diwali. There will be very good practical things, it will bring taste in life.  Winters will pass well, fit in the jugaad of winters, sit under the quilt and eat tea and pakodas, take good knowledge and whatever knowledge I give, I will give it in such a way that you will earn money from that knowledge to others.  By giving consultation, because the generation has come like this these days, people, which phone is this, which car is this, which is the flat, the house, leave aside marriage, the big thing is job, job, how to change this fan, how to move this house, this is how to consult about everything.  I am not shaming you but this is a blue ocean opportunity, come as per your choice, be of any age, whatever kind of relationship you want, it has nothing to do with it, do a relationship course and pay attention to others.  The relationship will get better on its own. Brothers and sisters, every relationship gets better on its own when money comes. I am telling you the secret. This should not have been told because it is the content of a paid course. It is okay but this is also the truth of life. Money.  Take out money from any relationship, take out money from any relationship, but I will tell all that knowledge there, I will not tell it here, okay then like and share. Thank you very much."

    "title": "Why Restructuring Of Family Assets Is Important ？｜  खानदानी संपत्ति कैसे संभाले ？ [e76pscXyym8].en",
    "content": "Hello friends this is a video for war but it is a very important topic to discuss this with their parents restarting of family assets is very very important war is not talking because one is ok second is d previous generation is feeling d youth i bill tel  You are I am taking the premise of a middle class family, okay I am not addressing the very lower class on the upper class because there are no assets there, but even in the middle class despite low cash flow, a salary of 50, 60, 70 thousand is fine and 1.5 lakh  But d parent me b setting, I need a driver, you want to watch movies, you need clothes, you want to eat food, you want to travel, you want to travel abroad, you want to visit stories in India, you want to do charity, we also want to give a wedding, wear good clothes, you want to eat and drink, some health  One has to take care of oneself, one has to drink juice, one has to do massage, like ladies who are in the front, they need a masseur, does anyone have arthritis, some of them, everyone needs money, okay cash flow, you have a plot of three acres or  kothi or story, some house or story, something that is there, you do n't have the power to do all this if it is not throwing cash then give what is happening and because I get a lot of issues for consultation, I have resolved them a lot, now today I am telling you a  I am giving you a template, suppose your parents have both something and dear sitting on it and no they are old, okay and they don't have many means of earning money, I am also earning money from there, we have done some HD work now what is that who can get a tax on this flat which has gone into khasra condition, now its juice has been extracted, it was once worth 2 lakhs, now it is worth 2.5 crores, but Kara Bhai Sahab is giving only 18-20 thousand because the localite is giving it for more than 20,000.  I am not giving much because off locality is not even getting 2% from the same place two days ago or day before yesterday, so the date for acquiring new assets in between for such assets is called restarching of assets, now two to three things are required in doing this  There is a problem, one problem is that as soon as we suggest the younger generation, the elderly junction says that you should talk to us till now, after us the father of 68 years saying date will happen after us after 32 years because the father can live till 90 more  D mother is five years younger than him and he lives for four years and D father is male who lives for 94 years and if this is 64 years or 63 years and if this is 9480 and 30 years then nothing will happen to him for 30 years and one more thing has come  When parents sit idle, children get busy in their lives, they know that there is nothing to do with all this, then parents are not able to handle it because those assets are falling, in a way they are ending, then children also get affected during this period  In my life, I took a loan, I took my life, someone went to Canada, someone went to Mumbai, someone else went, it becomes like this, the better thing is to sit and sell those things and do something else.  And it should be bought in a new place and invested, even if it is capital appreciation because nobody is able to think of converting a crore into ₹ 2 crore, specially the older generation because they feel that where will we be, for me it is ₹ 20,000  What happens when you transit, whenever you do this thing and put it in construction or story for the people, then their monthly income gets band and that one-  It may be two years, the band will remain, you have to understand that the income of the capital that you have generated or the money that you have, you will get it from the boss, there will be capital appreciation and here the children can get their own loan or they can also give some money to him.  Buttering up the assets, I will give you an example, a job or a house worth Rs. 1 lakh, what about buying a good plot, decorating it and making a strong story, your own vidya, father's money which is for sale, your own loan, son and one-half of those taxes Two of you on one side two on the cara  Keep two chaddhas for yourself and the one that is part of your loan, that thing of your father's, got transferred to two floors, he got it and it became a solid asset, its inheritance will have value in future too, but what is this in that  A job of Rs 50,000 is not a small one because I don't know where I will reach, where will you reach, brother, by selling one floor there is a profit of Rs 30-30 lakh and it is ready for sale in 10 months, work day and night and if you stand on your own  Being a contractor, construction contractor, you are a plumber, you should not do this work, you should not do all this, you will not give Rs. 27-2800 per square feet, what are the margins of all these things, how to do it, on what basis to do it, I understand in detail because this then  What happens is that it is proprietary knowledge which is the result of hard work, it is not given for free, but I tell the minors that I will avoid individual consultation because what is it right to tell each person, so I will tell this thing to the minors.  I would like to do dedicated education on the comment area you will find a real estate info group on WhatsApp you can join it, whenever it happens it happens every week and you will get to know according to this topic you can do and  Then you can make your own template that even if you have a great area in Delhi, say Uttam Nagar, then also it is necessary to restructure from there, what is the problem with the parents, why don't they let us do it, why do they keep sitting idle, I have seen that they are 92 years old parents.  Then his child turned 668, then he got the asset, the one of 66, then he sat on the asset, till 90 that story did not get destructed and that was the status of a family, it gradually started increasing at a low rate because somehow just  Design decision paralysis is happening in the family, this is something which should not be foolproof, you should further divide this thing into two-three smaller properties, it is okay in small properties from where the rental can be done, something like this  Such as these  Be it construction, my construction, year or life, the value of inheritance is good, I have seen many parents, elderly parents also, HD of 20 lakhs gives you 56% return, you get ₹120000 for a year, you get ₹10000 per month but if you take ₹10000 for the whole month  If you take it, then next year there will be 20 lakhs of FDBC and not 21 and after 20 years, 20 people will do story eating in this 20 lakhs HD, this value will be there and you yourself will go to de- realise in four-five years when There is inflation which is there and it will increase, the interest that you are getting will also keep decreasing, so it will be better if you say that friend can we buy a house in 20 lakhs, yes, how can we buy our own private real estate investment trust I will tell you guys in the next topic, it will be a very interesting topic but here I just want to give a hint that you can invest your 20 lakh rupees in someone  He can give you 25% share in a property worth Rs. 70-80 lakhs. Now who will buy that property worth Rs. 70-80 lakhs? Your next generation will make its own payment. Some of it is your loan, some of it is yours, Rs. 20 lakh is your straight forward 25% share. You also invested 20 lakhs in your mother's name, it is a thing worth 80 lakhs and yours is 25%. Now the return that you will get on this 25% is rental, after taxes in many places it is up to five which is less than your HDD right now but the capital appreciation is  This is happening which is creating your security but if you look at its 25-year cycle, then the rent will double every 8 years, so the rent you are getting is 3.5-4%, debt bill becomes 8% in ATS IT bill becomes 16%  in these 16 years and give 32% in 24 years whereas if you play this program in your HD then it cannot happen, it is up to 6 ₹ 500 all four will be zero and  That money is not flowing because you have taken it, here you are getting rent, what is happening in real estate, look you have a real estate, its capital value has to increase and it pays rent separately whereas HD you  If you do this, its capital value will increase, if it increases then you will not get anything in interest and you will take the interest, so its value will not increase and you know the cap for increasing the value, right now it is 6% and 5%, it will decrease further So fully, when the government over the world is printing notes, are you wanting to be in these notes and how will you do the financial assets, the property is also in his name, he is the 75% shareholder and you have your share too, if he  We did not pay rent, now look at your children, if you cannot trust them then this is even better, if your children betray you, you will get salvation in this very life for sure, you will get it, that means if you are thinking that the bank will not sink, the economy will not  Nothing will happen, I will keep getting 6%, there will be no 2% inflation, money will not be wasted  But if I buy a property with my own blood and get it registered in my name, even if I pay 25% of the amount, it will still be a fraud. That property is in your name, he cannot sell it to anyone else. Similarly, your photo may also be put up in the tehsil.  for selling and he has also taken a loan, be careful, he will give you the property according to your share, now in those families where there are so many trust issues in this and even that is not there, then that is a different story, but in 90% of the families there are no issues Everybody trust the next generation next generation is also very good okay you all do it together like this I will keep telling you guys how to do it further okay so my request is that you guys please my request is that you guys should do that which  There is an info group, come to it and there I understand these things with actual examples and actual numbers, so it takes a little effort to understand and some drawing has to be done, here understand under the example bill note be date because in that  what questions  If you are asked about this then there will be doubt about the story, you will give the story also because what is the biggest thing in understanding something, what is the problem on youtube that if anyone understands anything then the premise of this can be dated  And most of the time this color is never calculated by friends but it is wrong to believe that because when they take the mark, they take only this much mark in it, then after that the calculation will be correct or you will use roller 72 or  You can put your P*R*T/100 or Oneplus R to D power and compound interest or any other formula, it will work fine, show it in excel but the question is the premise, as the premise says, you will also get the returns of the mutual fund  If you have given 15% in the market in so many years, then it will not give 15% in the next 15 years also, brother, this is the base effect, as your growth will keep increasing, then it will not give date, this is an immediate shot, do not think that you will get more, okay, so you will learn this  we are real  State no one is teaching no one Shikha Rahasya note n single I am also on youtube that's why I call myself real estate clarity life number one note because brother in law is no number you ji din number you are understood to be a writer learning to enhance by the way video  They make rent versus buy while moving, rent versus buy, they become very common, it is fine for you but you do not have to learn in 360 degree perspective, real estate is extremely important but you are very important, now there is the next generation, I will also make a video in future that this generation will never buy real estate  Now tell me, this is what has been happening, we have bought it, we cannot buy it, I will give you examples and I will also tell you by doing maths in it, we cannot buy it at all and those who cannot buy, house is big for them, you friend always talk about house, okay my five-  There are six things because Sir, you get peace in your home and there are members like family in your life, you have to meet them, Sir, it has to meet sorrow also, okay but it has to meet happiness also and this is a possible thing, it is your thing dates are written before its name.  The word is written real, okay, real thoughts rights, real state, okay, so learning and understanding this is very compulsory, and it is not being taught like this anywhere else, okay, thank you."

If you disagree then you can write type D and maybe B then maybe it is because my new discovery.  You tell me and I will tell you one of my experiences why you should move away from and messages have started coming especially these good morning messages. Beyond this I will not even tell you psychology.  No, we want to connect with good morning message, there is no value being added every day, you give a blanket, what difference does the message make, mothers on family groups and then when this festival comes, there is no limit, wish everyone Happy Diwali.  If you can't do it by calling, do n't do it even by sending messages. Friend, they are all direct. Happy Diwali So and So are four names of two children, Rohit Neha.  Wishes you something, this is nothing, there is no need, this is an obligation. Secondly, what do I think is a joke? What makes me laugh, it gives me a stomach ache. It will happen to you too, I will tell you right now, and if it doesn't happen, then tell me, someone has come to whom.  Someone send your private message and wish you many, many happy returns of the day and if someone misses one half of him, perhaps he was a stronger friend, if he called directly and did not do everything speculative, then what is this pressure?

Okay, those who like, like the videos, they message me, those who don't like, troll me, they also do the same and  That liking and disliking actually has no meaning. In front of such a straight face, only Guruji can tell that brother, all this all this frills is for business, it is for money.  Not for getting good wishes, the one to whom this is happening is not my subscriber anyway, the one to whom it has to happen, so I am clear, who defines work, business, money, peace, joy, fun in life, these best wishes do not achieve anything, no, you do not have our best wishes. You don't need it either, you should get the best wishes of three or four people in life, every person has that much Zenon, this is what I teach you to live a good happy life, it is okay, regular.  Webinars will also be free. Again, you will find my group of Telegram in the comment section. You can join it. If you want to enjoy, please join that also and now work and useful talks will happen only on Telegram because useless people.  They may have gathered a lot, maybe after three-four-five-six years these people may also come together, but after three- four years it is something like the way a hill station does not become crowded.  Mussoorie or Shimla means there is no taste left there, then it is like that means you go somewhere in Coorg or Kodai Naal, it seems a little fine, someone says it is something like that, but there is no taste here now.  Pick it up if you have anything of 886 messages. Now how many useful messages are there in it? 24 Whose father will find it? Go and enter through it. There are 24 useful messages in 886. Rest all are like this.  If I am telling a practical thing, then the person becomes interested in it, you people, whether it is happening or not, if you tell, then you will make a slip so that if the etcher has to take the full rebate, we told you such a simple thing, take 10 lines on this and explain it in detail.  You can tell something like this to the youngsters or in a group that will be beneficial for them, say, this man is very intelligent, don't send him those messages, you should respect your parents, who should give the message?  It is the parents who are giving it, so are you not getting respect? Then call me directly and tell me, that is, by forwarding someone's that video and this one, now I also say many times, forward my videos to the correct audience, don't irritate.  Now do not forward my videos to such a place that it will mean I will get trolled because it is mine. You have to define your audience very well that is very very important.  So even if less number of people come to Telegram, useful people will come and as soon as Telegram is opened, it will know that 63 or 43 or 23 messages will be useful. Try it, you will find a lot of productivity this 2024 and you will get as many useful messages as possible.  People, all of you are on egramswaraj.gov.in and there I will talk intelligently about business, studies, writing, learning notes, money, stock market, this and that.  I will talk about the work and this is G from gurugram@gmail.com is the email id. If you want to take consultation, the fee is high and I don't expect every normal common man to take it and only the one who understands things should do it, otherwise it is okay.  Then there will be no benefit, okay if there is genuine requirement then you will do it and mostly everything is paid only, okay then it is free.  Help, I never speak, nor do I ever give. It's okay, neither have I ever shown. Now I am telling you openly and you also have to be like this. Free knowledge has no value and that knowledge is not knowledge at all.  If you keep getting it for free, then how will it become free? I have to make a video on this too, if you want because there is a popular user who is my team and who, after seeing my content, keeps making me ahead. Now I have also made a video for UPSC.  If he is right then he is wrong then tell me he is wrong Let's go, that thing is okay, I am always ahead, okay, so I was covering UPSC, so now they have put some scam coaching and watching money, so beyond that, if you want a detailed video, then I will tell you a detailed video, brother, beyond that.  How should we approach normally Mirchi? What are the people feeling in the society like consumers or subscribers or common man? They see a lot of people making money around them and they are not.  Able to figure out because they are going conventionally right now so anyone who is doing anything looks like a scamster right while there is no one who is a scammer right now either you can join or understand that or like this  If you can sit and do like him, then while speaking, I also got the idea that if you want to put it beyond those too, then Runu Mal is number one, YouTube0 is a YouTuber and he is the creator of all Runu Mal.  If you want clarity beyond that, please write in the comment section. Thank you very much."

    "title": "Why Today's Youth Is Afraid To Take Decisions ？ [xl5YJiENZ78].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today's topic is ' Youth is so afraid of taking decisions'. My personal consultation. From a lot of experience, I am telling you what I am feeling right now. This is the new generation, the children below 30 years of age.  Are too nervous to do any thing: Which subject to select, which job to select, whether to marry or not, to do with this, to have a relationship with that, to do with this, to buy property with this, to buy that.  Buy, it is costing a lot, I am costing a lot, this rate is so high all time in India, if you see one thing, India Today in 2023, we are sitting on the peak of the economic progress that our country has made, okay, it was not there in 1980, 70s.  I was not in the previous generation, I was not in the 90s, why is this generation being judged, tell me, why is this generation being judged? Okay, so brother, I have come from being judged by the previous generation. It is this. Mostly de feeling of de previous generation which was born in 1560 and early 70s de they are like this their anything you look at the thing till your age I have so many children de we go to school to study like this de tere ko pata hum to  Now in the story, today's generation can never beat the previous generation and now this generation, I told you that it is a syndrome.  It is responsible for the new generation to be able to take this decision. I had said that consider 150 things to be done in a day and if a person punches four of them and one of them gets spoiled etc. then I had said that you have even more.  125 Sis I achieved some success in life by doing what I told you not to do. Nothing bad happened, no one tells who will talk about it. It's in my heart that Papa and Mummy have given me this, so if something goes wrong then I will just say it again.  Insults will be reduced. In India, a lot of middle class people do not want to get married in big cities. This is a phenomenon. It is okay in that also, if a boy or a girl comes according to his choice, then do it for us. Yes, I love him.  By typing love every time, the parents are encouraged to do this, this is not right for us, brother, he is getting married, what is less, you will be sitting on his mind for 28-29 years, thinking that we will tell him then he will not get it, it is not that good. get  Then he remains a bachelor, so what I want you tell me is that you are afraid because of being just your parents first of all did less things they gave head extremely let's choice If you have only choice to watch Doordarshan then which is the wrong serial  Look people, where will your time be wasted, where will you feel that your frame is missing, you have Mahabharat and Ramayana at 9:00 and you know watch it on Sunday.  You did not have a choice in life, so there was no decision making about clothes, but at this point, the choice is what combo capacino watch to wear, what mobile should I take, how should I take this, how should I take that, what should I look like, if you go to buy glasses then there are only 50 types.  Not only this, I don't understand which thing to buy and which thing to buy, take me to buy a pen, any thing of yours, go for anything, the choice is so much and no decision gets torn, it becomes terrible, that was there for the previous generation too.  Otherwise, it has not happened to them, it is happening to this generation, so you have to understand that no, this generation is not taking a decision at the same time, whatever is taking your life forward, yes, you can go by bus, now you can cycle.  But if you are going, then the decision has gone bad in comparison to that, you will use the net, but brother, if you are walking then you are going on a bicycle, then you have to collect money from standing there, this is for you to see, More Financial Blender Tankha  There is no money, there is no earning, what will you lose, so collect it, you do things, collect, you take decisions and quickly learn with their mistakes because this will serve us as a big base for your future life which will be 13 14 because Papa Mummy In the eyes of some, the decision is not taken in order to avoid any disturbance, but it is your responsibility to handle those who are not able to perform at 34. Life will tell you that your parents will always be there, they are giving advice according to their system, witch system design work other more in 2023 operating software, if I don't do theirs then something from devil, witch movie, we will not understand how to handle decision making if  You are worried about two-four things; relationship is the second, financial is the third, job is the third. All three affect you personally but do not affect your parents. Which marriage do you marry? This is your problem.  Can't it be your parents' problem, they make it out like a date, no, we don't like it, it is not set with our family, it is getting set with you, if you like it, then what about the parents, if it happens with them too.  It is a very good thing, but what is happening with the parents is not set, the one who is not found, the one who cannot be found, then the marriage is not happening, then the marriage is not happening, then there is no harm to the parents. you are here  Singles are roaming around, parents are being followed in life, they have enjoyed Kumar Ashram well throughout their life, they have enjoyed their marriage well, they have enjoyed their relationships, they have given birth to children, they have found reasons for their crying, they have found reasons for suffering in life.  Time has passed, theirs is over, what about you? So, those things for which you have to bear the brunt and whose happiness is yours to get and sorrow is also yours to get, don't look at the parents in it, do n't look at the parents for the financial decision. If father has never invested money in the stock market, never invested in mutual funds, he does not know what is cash flow, what is rental and what is construction today, what is small flat and what is appreciation. What is leverage? People can't buy a plot in a big city. If you don't have money, take the money. Brother, make it black and white too. You have to take a loan. The loan shark was not going to give you cash. That thing cannot happen.  If it is not possible then that has to be done, the father said no, son, the plot is good because we have seen that the land is ours, such a system has been made, now the child's syllabus has become such that he cannot do it. Wants to buy a flat, gets it, has a loan in the budget, can take it, father told me land, I can't buy it, father is not giving more than Rs 20-30 lakh, so where will it be bought, if I go to buy it then the year passes because you are busy in your job.  concentrate on  You start doing this, the flat you were getting was increased for Rs 1 crore, now you are getting Rs 25 lakh back from your father, he has increased the decision making from you and how much is your package, from Rs 15 lakh for a year to Rs 12 lakh i.e. lakhs of rupees for 7 months. That is, your gross earning of 2 years has increased within a year and if you check according to your savings, then the amount of money saved in your savings of four-five years has also increased here, this is the result of this, father, you will suffer. No, I would have taken bhukhenge, then what had we believed? 13 If you see, this is what something is, date youth, you take decision, she is a nice girl, you are looking good, you are feeling that I can live with her, parents are not able to understand.  You understand very well that there is no decision from you, tell me about your periods, get a girl from her, take 1 month's time, you will have to give a guarantee, if you are giving a solution, then you are facing such a war.  I have a question, if you have anything, collect this kindly suggestion and tell me, please give more, I will only decide whether it is collected, it is not that you are the parents, you are not giving the solution, the biggest feeling is that Laat Saheb is sitting like this, father.  No Munna, this is not right Munna, neither for us, it doesn't seem right to us brother, then you see, this is what parents say when they say no, you see brother.  If you don't know, then that land is taken out from under the war because the standing is not yours, there are ambitious records hanging among the parents, Katini's age will be 26-27 years, she will be educated, she will have knowledge, she will be intelligent, a fan has also been installed, but the parents have said this just now.  If you want to see it then first give them a chance to do it, this is the date off, after that you will have life, you will have yours cut off, Kant 's waiting for D, parents come to me so innocent.  29 30 32 Sir, this has not happened to us till now, what are we doing till now, we are looking at the parents, the penis and also the lifeline, Amitabh Bachchan ji gives three-four, doesn't it mean it remains endless, isn't it good?  A is not there, let's take C, it means it will keep going, what directly, not indirectly, it was not brought up by us, we did not have a decision, it was seen in most of the cases that tu de contrari is taught in reverse so that it is always there.  Inside the child so that he is a child, it becomes a little dark, the video is fine, I understand it but I make it with a lot of responsibility, I make it consciously, I make it for the good of the society and if the society has always had this history.  Whenever someone has done any good and talked about it, anyone has done it, I am not going to put myself in the category of great people at all, I am not the only one who has done anything good at all, I am as rubbish as those who, you know,  a lot of code is required  It seems that everyone in the society is feeling this, only the children do it, after this video they will get complete clarity, this is what is happening with us, this 25 year old 28 I am not saying 15 year old 18, there is time in that but like this 25  Years old boy or girl you can't take decisions parents are diligent and something date you have you checked how educated you are if you have educated parents you are in the good half of the society well done  They have good authority figures in life and if your situation is like this, then your parents have played with you, it is okay, they have played, remember, divorce is happening where parents do marriage, it is happening there too, parents go for dot com.  Divorces happen, divorces are happening even in love marriages, even in arranged ones, they are happening everywhere. Okay, so it is like an accident. Those who are not driving under the influence of alcohol, are driving during the day, are driving safely, they also have accidents.  And that doesn't mean stop driving okay dat it you have you be very live you in this situation not in people not in children are alive you it my support will be late I will keep giving because no respect youtube is  If you are making a making video on D subject then please tell me now I have a request to you guys I have never asked you to subscribe to this channel 1212  You can also increase subscribers so I will be grade full because of this message nine needs you reach out to more people because of mine when the subscriber base increases like my second channel also has a lot of subscribers in it you like sangolik sutra to that one on top of the subscriber base  When I come and tell something, I do it because if you tell me that you have a lower base, that thing remains suppressed there, this is also a fact, I have come so much.  True things, you are at a much higher level, so nothing will go to you, whatever I am hearing right now, one or two subscribers who are in your circle, who identify with this thing, who need to learn all this, increase one or two subscriber base, friends circle.

I have taken one minute of your life, you request this and my life, you request this, so do it a little bit for me. Normally I would forget to speak or say anything in the video, but today I thought I would push a little bit, so if you guys do it, it would be great, thank you very much."

    "title": "Why Working On Your  Body Language Is Counterproductive In Long Run ？ [WQI093v7OKU].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today I told you something about body language, no one told you because people told the opposite and have written waste books, there are many trainers here, one more reason why this was triggered because someone guided me that you make videos.  So sometimes you do every touch like this, sometimes you don't touch this or do something like this, okay I need shows in the New Year i.e. show days and you should not do this and by doing this you give me something.  When he came by sending a message, he got triggered. Okay, so today I want to give you clarity. You have also been told a lot that you should keep your body language like this, it is not to be done like this. There were differences from this and it is to be done like this, it is this and you have to do it in your hand.  Do like this, you have to keep a lot of knowledge, it's okay, you have a lot to learn, okay, I too was good at book journaling once upon a time, my friend, what is this, but today I am telling you a summary and I am going to give very good guidance to the war, forget this.  Think called body language, your body language is bad, it is good, leave it, now you say, friend, this is what I was taught, body bill react in A, don't stop what is inside, reverse engineering is not possible, by learning body language, you can improve it, you can throw it away.  You want to make yourself intelligent, you want to show it, it will give you a stress in life and even then you have not become intelligent, did you feel like this, did someone feel that you are intelligent mother?  But that is fake banai hai, just concentrate on adding value, you just concentrate on adding value to yourself, there is a stress in life, no one will teach you this, and let me be a body, I am a body language expert, tell you what this color is with you, now as someone told me.  If you are nervous, tell me, it's okay, I am nervous too, I am nervous, let's make a video, okay, so what is it, you are very like this  If you touch your hand then I am making a difference, I am making a difference as an example, I don't do it like this in the video, but you are standing like this, so I too am having a reaction, that donkey in front who is making a difference like this should be shown to him, isn't it? Man, I'm talking to the next guy, poor guy, it's like this, so let me do this and it's the other way around, so well done, you don't have body language, if you speak like this, I do n't know.  If you do such and such for 50 hours, you will be called a liar. Okay, so by hiding like this, what are you teaching me that you should lie but do not display it, friend, it is very stressful, don't do this, do n't lie, now the body language. You are seeing this and if you are a nice human being basically you don't need other courses in body language. Your body language is generally good if that body.  Language is not my own, science is bad, I am not my own, that knowledge is useless, yes, our body language shows something or the other in our elders, but why are we feeling so shy in showing it to you? Connect it only.  To learn body language, you yourself know within yourself, I am a liar, a deceitful person, or I am a good person, or I am, this is my friend, this is my enemy, or I love this person, or I do not love this person, saying it forcefully, teaching it in it.  goes that  The next person is saying something and you are talking nonsense but you have to give him the feeling that it is okay that he is just like that, by doing all these wrong things he has taught caste, if you say a lot till late then give him the feeling that he is talking nonsense and  I am becoming disinterested late date natural in body language if a man is taking lecture if like I do in my video so many people see me then if someone's body body language is looking bad then whose is his  It's the listener's fault, it's my fault, why do I have to accept that my friend is doing it like this, is he doing it like this, is it wrong or not? If this is happening then it is my fault and if everyone is listening by doing it like this, then only I am at fault. That is, my body language is also late, now you are becoming mayor and you are showing such interest, then you have the knowledge to say this, friend, you are understanding that I come with a liberating thing, if next time I see you yawning.  If you talk to someone then tell me sir, you are teaching so boring, teachers, we have seen teachers, professors, seniors, fear can be a problem, date you have not slept at night, it can be an issue, if it is an issue then it is a different thing, but generally if two makes five. People are taking it and are generally disinterested. Are people of rate, you tell me other vices, brother, whatever you are doing is nonsense, if knowledge is growing, it is doing English, style is killing.  There are many people who are seniors in your organization, now we have to listen to them, then the real status can be known to everyone only when you say pay to listen to me and come and listen to me for two hours, how many are ready to pay and how many are ready to pay.  He is ready to listen for 2 hours and only then you come to know that whoever becomes a hero by becoming someone's scenery, I have noticed so much in him, whether in corporate or government, he is busy in doing something or the other.  The company and they have you moved from this, you have happened and the targets have you become me, Tenu, do something, tell him, friend, a new product has come, let it reach the public, that is, he had to speak two lines, he took 15 minutes, he did nonsense, he is fine.  The meaning was this, the basic crust was of one line and people were busy opening their diaries and making their own drawings in it, someone was writing something, the settings were being set like this, how much time was wasted in our country. If you want to see all the seniors, I also do consultation with them many times and I say that you have a misconception that people listen to you, you just remove this thread of your organization and your appointment and other unknown people.  I will go and tell you, brothers and sisters, I will talk good to you and give you good knowledge. See how much fear they listen to. If they listen, then it is an attraction along with it. If I have to speak to check this attraction, then it is a lot.  What is important is your body language, but don't focus on yourself, if you have some knowledge about how people around you feel, then it's okay. Good day tomorrow, brother, do something. Now you are a body language expert and listen to me. Now tell me what is the body language. Now if she is matching the body language and I am actually lacking in that then I will try to correct her body language.  I will not try to correct my language and if I can live with it or I never feel like it, then brother, my body language is looking like this, it is looking like this, it is not reverse engineering by force that I can correct my body language.  By doing this you become intelligent, no, if you show intelligence, wisdom and knowledge, no one can rock it, you cannot fake that confidence. You are right, I just stood up doing this and confidence comes from. Your ability to add value in the life of ideal confidence comes from what is inside you, you cannot fake it, although these many people become gurus, they teach you from the middle of the book and you will get confidence from the middle of it.  Ca n't get confidence. Can't get it from story. It comes after learning some things. If you know good cooking then you can invite guests to your house. If you can cook then you have seen many women who are beyond me.  No because you don't know how, then when you don't know how to do a thing and went to see him doing it or now you have reached the stage to ask him to do the thing and you don't know it then no amount of confidence bill do and the same thing if he asks the lady to do it.  The one who doesn't know how to cook is like a singer singing on the stage, he is a singer, it is necessary to give him confidence, otherwise I will catch up and then start because if he is confident then only the one who knows what he knows can be confident.  No, how can one have confidence in everything? To have confidence in everything, one has to become the number one master of clarity. Okay friend, you have to learn things from the story. You become the master of things. Brother, this is the thing that you do every day when you are confident.  It's a daily job. Have you seen the confidence of the driver when he parks the car at the back like this? Confidence in the situation: You had taken a lot of confidence from the body language expert and there you have to put the gear, you have to reverse the car, here you have to look in the mirror, here you have skill setting, if you take confidence, then turn on the fox, leave it with difficulty, this body language is a good driver bill, give a good one.  Body language only if you are a confident driver in every situation  He is a confident cook, he is a confident singer, this can happen only if you are a good driver, a good cook and a good singer, you do not know the tunes and we have never seen a time when there was a passing parcel and there was a music band in it.  If there was no point then we would not have heard the points. When there was no talk then there was no confidence but the joke was there. If the joke was revealed then there was confidence. Then if the song was sung then there was confidence.  No, but if dancing is a given then confidence is there. It does n't depend on what you know. Now showing confidence in it, showing this, showing that, telling that means really Romeo, because the man who is natural will show his brother, his body language is fine, it is okay.  Do n't focus too much on your body language of other people but if you can improve something for yourself by watching a little, then it is okay. If you improve yourself inside then it will look fine on the outside and there will be many people who will like you.  You will not know how to take care of mother in small things. No, you should not walk like this, no, you should not stand like this. If we are standing like this on us, then it is okay. If we are standing like this towards someone, then we are showing interest in the date man, okay.  Look at this tent, they are showing interest in it and if we have done it like this then they are showing interest in it. I belong to this, brother, if this brother is interesting then stand in such a way that automatically the body will become like this.  Normally this is right, I am not accepting it and if I am standing like this then why is it for this brother that I am not interested in you brother, you are leaving me, why should this cheating and coercion happen? She is not there, she is just useless, but sycophant is being shown as a wrong thing, she is interested, bullet body does not matter till late, every man has to fix her, there are six 50 ways to impress a girl 15 ways to control a man, to do this, hey brother, control yourself, you will automatically control yourself, if you have attraction in yourself, if you do something and become worth money, then the next person will survive. This tent learner is absolutely off-the-wall people.  Which de times because you are born fool you can fool some of de people which de time some people but you ca n't fool all de people so when you ca n't fool and that  Things have to be found out someday or the other, so why are you practicing brother? You will feel small in your own eyes that I am relieved that I don't do match fixing everywhere, then I have to read only these books, then what has become of me that I have become a fox?  When should I open my hand, how should I make a hand, how should I make my hand like this, if I should make it like this, if I should walk like this, then my skill set, my knowledge, the real internship thing inside, its value is not great when its value is  If it is not big then how many hours do you do this, you will not reach the story because of skill and letter people bill see through your which this nonsense actions then D A of D story never read n body language article never reader body language book is of no use good  AT IT HAVE GUTS YOU TELL ME NO ONE IS BETTER THAN ME I DON'T KNOW WHO IS BETTER THAN ME YOU TELL ME NO IF THERE IS NO ONE SO YOU TELL ME NO SO UNTIL YOU TELL ME Come and tell me if you are not there then write down his name in the diary if you tell me, hey friend, he is better than me, then look at him, maybe he is better than you, learn something from him, this way you bill game only, no problem.  It's not a matter of saying in the end it's better than you, listen to him, then if you are better than him, then you go and tell him again brother, I have become better than you, check further, this is it, so sister- in-law, I am you.  live now  Confidence comes from within. I plan to learn all these things in detail through workshops because I cannot teach so much in a 10-15 minute video and there is no need to learn body language which is what I am teaching.  They are there now that their duty will be there, now they have come in 2023, now artificial intelligence has come, you cannot fool them, earlier any knowledge could be made about many things till then.  It does as long as you have it and the world doesn't know much, now everyone is fooling each other by acting like this, showing their interest, some are making their own tents, everyone knows what is happening, okay, so I hope.  You can join to join, you can take its membership or attend my workshops, they can join winner group etc. whenever there is a notification, there is one or two in a month, in this way one improves.  One thing which the youth is not doing at this time, please note that I will make a separate video on working on the personalities and will also do workshops. Everyone reads the book on personality, I am not doing anything on it when it comes to working on personality.  If it is a fake thing then it is a caste that on one's personality then I should reduce it like this, forcefully do that, personality will be good when there is some change inside, let only you say body is divided.  When the muscles are divided then something happens inside the story, only then those muscles are visible or you are visible, you are hitting the setup, you are killed, if you are killed, then nothing happened from outside, neither did you do anything from inside, if it is axised from inside, then something is visible from outside, then this is  What life is I hope you like the video. Have you not subscribed? If you want to take membership by subscribing to the channel then you can take it. Those who have taken it can join that if I have taken it then that is the membership WhatsApp group."

    "title": "Why You Should Not Buy Property In Goa And Dubai ？ Reply to @AkshatZayn [xEu3_h92oTc].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, this video is about which two places you should not buy property and this video is being made because respected Akshay Srivastava ji who is a popular financial influence has made it and said that if you should buy it here then I am not just for the sake of it.  I am making my reasoning for buying it, I will tell you the names of two places, Goa and Dubai, in both the places you should not buy property at all. A recent video of Akshar ji has come. If you have not seen it, then watch both the videos.  You will be able to enjoy. I have a lot of common subscribers too, so they must have seen it. The video has been made just for the sake of argument, not to enjoy. And Akshat ji, if you are listening then it would be good if you have a counter opinion because if.  You destroy this opinion also then you are a master this is what happens in life that someone has this opinion and you tell some these facts and this person can  Give again better counter facts then it becomes that his opinion is good and people are agreeable and democracy is influence market. Write in the comment section that I am Guruji from Gurugram. If you like mine better then write mine. If you like his then write his.  It will be clear if you write down the name of the winner. Okay, write down my name. Two things. I am the number one clarity giver on real estate. I will also tell you who created it.  Okay, keep watching the video, it's okay, so let's start with Goa. First we will catch Goa and then Dubai. Okay, whenever Akshar ji makes videos, he always has ' And' and he has made ' Practically'. He says five-six times that ' Practically, I have bought it.' I have done it. Whenever any influence in life starts telling about his life, who I am, where I live, how rich I am, what I have invested, I am never telling him that even a single thing.  He is telling a lie, I am not saying it at all, no one does, if people show it as per the proof then it is a lie but I am saying it, still it is not a beneficial thing, the reason behind it is that you will not be told that Akshat ji has bought that property. Bought in 2021 or 22 when Covid valuations were down. Now in 2024, if those people are listening to the video, it is like financial influencers from all over the world will also buy crypto currency from the world. Can they afford to lose money? If anyone is making money then that investment of Rs. 5 crores is just two months' income or one month's income. Brother, he can invest it anywhere but you don't have to invest it, you don't have to invest it for anyone.  And the one who has that much money should not be put there. Do not put anyone in Goa. Big builders are coming to Goa. So what happens when big builders come? The builders will benefit. 32 lakh population in Goa.  Yes, I will tell you this through this video, yes, it is going to be a very good video and I will tell you logically so that you do not get trapped and I am the only one who has been shouting through the roof for the last four years about real estate will do.  Well, these are the financial issues, now this one is coming and that one is the one living in Raipur, I am forgetting the name, okay, they buy that property themselves, all of them said this 2 years, 3 years ago.  They are saying that brother, SIP is good, stocks are good, in real estate the rental yield is low, this is low, that is low, did not allow anyone to buy, bought it myself, sold the courses myself, did all the marketing, did everything, if money came from it then  All the big money goes into real estate only. If I earn even bigger money than that financially then at one stage it goes into real estate and now these people have come with a straight face and are giving knowledge on real estate and giving courses on real estate.  Are Incidentally, I also have a course on real estate, it is the number one course in India and it is very expensive. If you want to take that from Srivastava ji and it is written that there is no one like it, my content is very rich and I have been doing this for many days.  If I am doing this, it is not that I am doing the same, it is a very expensive course, many people have attended it and I do not give any testimonials, nor do I tell the syllabus, I also tell their syllabus, I do not tell in the syllabus if my real estate course.  If you want to join, you will not have to pay RE MP on my number, so I want to talk logically from the video of Akshar Shri Srivastava ji that the concept of Air BnB in Goa is not long lasting, people do not go to Air BnB.  Indians don't want to save money anymore, women don't want to go and cook food, just because he is working for you, he is working today as if the world was working then he is not doing it, it is not a  Sustainable it is like saying a trader shows that I am an option in the future, brother, I have earned money, you also come and do like this, you ca n't, you can't, you can't, there is too much garbage in Goa, the locals have become very anti once There may be change in politics whether Congress comes or Aam Aadmi Party comes and there will be that anti-outsider sentiment, you will sit with your white elephant, no one is telling me this, no, I have earned if you have.  A dead property, a flat whose valuation should have been Rs 70 lakh, suppose someone bought it for Rs 40, then his rental ID will come, but after that, should I buy it for Rs 90 lakh? This is the question when it is said that I am buying it for Rs 6.  If I am earning rental yield, then I have to tell that I have bought this property yesterday and I am earning at Rs. 6 and you buy it today and you too are earning at Rs. 6 from the day before tomorrow.  Will you earn or else I took it at 202122 at depressed valuations and on those valuations I am getting it at 6 because those valuations were depressed. You are understanding what I am trying to say and I will tell you the markets and I will tell you  The Reason You Stay on Real Estate Like I explain, what I explain, the factors I consider, what happens right in the video  Come and say that you can do it while sitting at your place. Now you are doing it while sitting, so today I gathered some courage that instead of sitting on the sofa, I should sit outside the house for a while so that it is not said that it is okay not to go out and say something like that.  Now let's give who invested how much, who owned how much in real estate, what is it for me, what did I do, she became convincing and if I don't go, she does n't take a photo and if I go, I will take a photo and show it, there is no logic on that that I did this.  did it  Because what people say is that I did this, no one tells me when I did it, I am telling a lie again, I am saying this with full respect to Akshat ji also, I am saying this with full respect that whatever you have said, you have done, there is no doubt in it.  No, but when did they do? They are saved in the story. Another man cannot rape. You are living in Goa. Your knowledge of local will be more and you can get out any time. You know when the things start going. Air BnB can be managed. Air BnB is a flood concept in Indian settings. When Indians go on a trip, if their wife goes and makes roti, she says, Bhai tane meri roti pawani thi, if the flour was to come, then I will make it at home only. Why should I go out? People go for a change. People go for relaxation that is not available. These [ __ ] will come to Air BnB and drink alcohol.  Law and order issues, this boy and girl, these issues, you will have to handle them also, that manager will not handle them. You have ever taken him in any society, there like Akshat ji calls me uncle ji, although I am not much older than him, I have knowledge.  Hair is white and then that's datchi hai uncle ji some uncle some random uncle no there is no random uncle troubling Akshat ji other than me I am the only uncle ji ok hai troubling and there  Are we even more, uncle ji who is actually much older in age than Akshat ji, I am older than Akshat ji in single digit age, okay, not less than a decade, okay, there are many people who are decades older than me, brother, he is never there.  Will change the policy and then also tells that this is the Portuguese law and it is so difficult. Learn from me, brother, where there is such degree of difficulty, why am I saying this when you  Hanging fruits are that Akshat ji does not know much about Gurgaon or Noida. He is scaring people here by taking the name of a super tech. Oh, that is very past and by taking the name of that project, he got a position there also. For his information, affordable housing is a thing in Gurgaon where people took flight for 25 lakhs Akshat ji and they are getting 30 35000 rent which translates  Rental yield at 15 There are people in Gurgaon who are getting Rental yields at 25 but certain stuff again I am the same thing, I will not put out paid content to downplay anyone, I am more but what I am trying to do is 1010 lakhs  People have also taken rooms in which the fare is Rs 20-2 per month. I am talking about Gurgaon, that too is real estate.  Don't think this is a flat worth Rs. 6 crores today in Gurgaon there are flats which are attractive rent of Rs. 1.5 lakh, their market valuation may be higher today but at the price at which they had taken it earlier, they also got 67% of it. Here's How You Calculate the Rental If I Buy a Flat for ₹1 Crore and I Get Let's Say ₹ Lakh Today and That Flat  Is Worth ₹ Crore So If I Sell It I Will Get 2 Crore To 5 Lakh Divide By 2 Crore Is 2.5 But 5 Lakh By 1 Crore Is 5 Par How Do You Every Because People In Gurgaon Have But Lot Of Under Construction Properties And Under  What is yours in construction is the price that increases at the end of the day you have to buy properties where people will stay and I  Will tell you now let's quickly jump to Dubai. There is no tax in Dubai. There is no tax on agreed rental income. There is no tax on agreed rental income. Agreed is fine. Rental agreed at 4 5 but this thing has not been told that how much is the maintenance. Extremely Extremely Extremely Extremely High in Dubai Properties Once You Calculate They Will Translate into 1  2 3 But please go and check, it was not told that maintenance has to be paid brother, rent has to be increased, Ukraine war is going on, Russian war is going on, there is a crisis in Syria, then real estate ran there and ran inside Dubai.  But brother, it is still stagnating, it has run out a lot and the supply is unlimited. Brings out this fact in this video, why should I say that it has not been said and I have said enough that it is.  So that property is like this, friend, you tell me the exit route, but for me, brother, it is not enough, I had also told you, so brother, why put it in that lump, there are six to seven good properties in India worth Rs. 5 crores. You can buy in cities like Pune. In cities like Bangalore, in cities like Gurgaon, wear in rental rates will be at 5 to 7. Capital appreciation will be at 5 to 7.  Minimum on under construction property 10 to 12 in on absolute basis if it is a thing of 70 lakh then it is getting 77 lakh but you are not paying 70 lakh you are paying 10 12 14 lakh There are schemes which come in 20 30 50  By doing this there are schemes which come in 1090 2080 also and you make  Hell lot of money if you put it in excel it is just that you are not exposed to it you are exposed to builders because you go to dubai you get to know builders woh builders ke naam leke main kabhi famous nahi karta like hei in his videos  He will take builders because it is a promotion, why should I give money to anyone for free, I do not take money from anyone, I do not work for anyone for free, I can tell. How many great builders are there in Gurgaon, whose products have gone from where to where and people have enjoyed that wealth creation? You come to Goa sitting in Goa, come to Goa, Goans do not want Goans in Goa, let outsiders come, Akshay Srivastava ji, you are inviting people to Goa.  But the people of Goa are saying don't come friend, you are spreading filth here and that is a big issue which is happening in Goa that same thing is happening in  In Dubai, of course, I explain all those things on the political channel, but brother, have you heard something called what happens in India and the things that are happening in India, Hindu and Muslim, is it enough to give a hint or can you give further narrative in India. You know what is going on, what time is going on in the future, but to earn money there, we do not remember when and where whose shop is closed, live political, you understand something, you live. Political tension, geo political, no, nothing like this will happen, it is not like that, how do you know, how do you know whose program will be, I don't know, some big person has to take a call, there are people who are coming from failed countries and rich people come.  And they are fooling the price if you have a net worth of 100 crore 200 crore 300 crore 500 crore you are going to buy  A 5 Crore Property Is Peanuts It Is Of No Consequence To You And You Are Not Buying There Because Your Property Will Become 8 Crore And The Rental Will Come More You Are Staying There Because Of The Tax Benefits You Make It A Place To Stay At  If you are staying in India and you are investing there, you do not want to live in Dubai and have nothing to do with Dubai, then brother, do not invest money because India  Do you know what to do with Rs. 100000000000000000000000000000000000000 off Money off in India. If you know, I teach you this in my courses, then I will give you a little hint of my famous one. You can acquire multiple properties in India using tax benefits. Even in India, you can get a rent of ₹ 1.  Only 70 counts and big nose. Even in India, choir property has multiple members. Everyone has a mother, father, wife, children, everyone is Hindu in different ways.  If there is an undivided family, if there is a company, there are big ways, then it can be made very tax efficient in India and you have the feeling of being a thing within your country, plus India has the population, the infrastructure in Bangalore is so-so and now D.  K Shivkumar ji is doing a lot there and you can and the good thing is taking opposition on board also and opposition is on board and a lot of road words passed under all this  If it is being built, then the property there is increasing so much because the population there has become so many crores, it has become 1.5 crores and is increasing, so there is no space, so things will progress only in such a place. Pune is another Cosmoprof years and it will give.  You a rental of 85 90000 on position do you want to know the builder do you want to know the project why are you taking people to go you  No Goa and Dubai Goa and Dubai are NFT of Real Estate Non Fungibility My all channels and we can all go and check on social platform Who is influencing how many people ok and come to know in comment section Quality of comments come to know  Go and see the comment section of his video This video End see the comment section of mine To abhi ban raha hai I don't know what comments will come but I am presuming because I am number one  Who made me number one? I made myself. No one makes anyone with a 56 inch chest. Everyone makes themselves after being measured. You also make yourself. What's the problem? I have red hair, I have studied, I will  Not Tell Anything Because Why Should I Tell What I've Studied Where I Learned What is this and what I'm saying should be important Where did I learn the game of chess?  There is no meaning, move on, checkmate checkmate, answer from where have you learned, who has learned, whose logic is it, tourist places will not do well, I have told about it, he runs away once, look at Ayodhya, it has become political, I have even seen the videos. Earlier also I had told people that something political has happened, go and enjoy, do not invest in tourist places, this excitement remains my own, I am telling you about Gurgaon.  It takes a lot of life to rent a car even in the same city. I wake up and run an Air BnB in Goa. It is not someone's business. I will give you a classic example. This will rest my case. There is a person and not this. I have checked this 10 times.  I have a habit of talking to taxi drivers whenever I visit normally, as if I was talking to a taxi driver in Gurgaon many years ago. History It was a half an hour a this thing Had to be dropped at the airport So he says Sir I earn so much money Dh 2 lakh He said something then he narrated his back and forth story that for how much did you buy this car and how did you buy it He says Sir what happened to me  Then I called my brother from Bihar that I will get two cars and then I will earn this much. Then I said again, I said, your earning is double. They say double, but brother also had to pay money. He then says that it is his idea.  The extended family members were called and the villagers were also called and he thought that if I take out seven vehicles then my salary will increase because I have learned how to drive, where to stay and how to do so, the fact of my father says that sir, I have less money left. Couldn't because now the guy who was driving the car was not mine, my brother still earned money and gave me money but the one who was not my brother who earned was an ex- person from somewhere in my village, he used to say that today  Engine oil leaked, today the car collided, today we went there, today we went to Manali, today the policeman told this story that people are taking money like this, there is nothing left, so whatever looks good on paper is  Can't manage, this is the biggest problem, I look at the logic, I am a taxi driver, I am driving a taxi and I am having savings of 1.5 lakhs, okay now if I draw another car and I pay the driver from lets.  0000 for his stuff to these per edge per two conditions paper conditions he should give me ₹ lakh because 1.5 lakh is what I am making 50000 is what I am giving ok now put operational degradation factor say like bhai kuch to woh banda khayega piega  Will not drive with that much devotion Will not maintain that shocker properly Acceleration will be bad  25000 and deduct 75, then I should get it, but then you realize that it becomes a loss making thing, he does it for himself, thinks of taking out his car, gradually does something wrong, he transfers the money to someone else and gives it to someone else.  He earns something and does something else because you are a driver and you went there, Sambalpuri dropped it in the middle, what have you done, are you installing CCTV cameras every day?  If you are doing audit then brother, you are taking trouble, better buy something clean and tidy, flats are available for 70 80 90 lakhs, within Pune they are available for 65 lakhs and the rentals are 32 35 40 fully furnished 38 39 40000 Bangalore.  This thing is happening inside affordable housing in Gurgaon too. This thing is happening inside affordable housing in Gurgaon, so it is too late. Inside Gurgaon, there were plots of 60 yards, Sushant Lok One, Sushant Lok Two, DLF Edge Three Five and all those places, calculate the rental rate for some time, so brother, I think 100% is coming, 100% means as many houses as there were total. That much rent is coming in a year, can you believe it but it was taken 1015 years ago, so people have minted money in Noida Gurgaon. And Mumbai and every where and here the population is increasing, noise is increasing, Indian settings are there, Indian law is there, you can see, understand, control, can talk directly. Dubai is a very fancy thing in witch in my opinion Dubai.  If I don't want to go then I rest my case, tell me how did you guys like it, many things are visible as they told, this is investment grade property, if you take it as normal then it will be of no use, I am saying in Gurgaon.  In Pune, Bangalore, you have taken the normal one, you have also taken the good one, it will work there too, so this is the investment that the risk reward ratio is always in favour. The risk reward ratio is not favorable when you invest in Goa and you invest in Dubai. It is just  Not in favor for the quantum of risk you're taking The reward is not a common rate What are you getting?  You are getting 45%, I am giving you this much, here you tell me exactly, and it is not some random person doing this or that, this work is being done professionally, so don't take me as just a normal uncle, this uncle ji knows a lot.  Okay and what I'm telling you is also coming from practical only and people who have but and have enjoyed this are the ones who are in the knowledge of  This fact is that brother, there will be no benefit in going to Dubai because your supply in Dubai is regulated by their establishment, as soon as the rent goes from 4 to 5, the rental goes up and if it goes a little above 5, they increase the supply but the supply is never there.  Don't increase it so much that the rental yard falls below four and the whole thing is like 'Himself Bod in the Video' is coming in South Dubai, it will keep going on brother.  It is a desert, keep running in a line as much as you want and the population there is about to come from outside countries. When these wars from outside will subside, then someday this cycle will also change, then he will not be there, second thing, let me tell you, Vaastu is bad.  Dubai's age is an architectural thing, I am telling you that according to me, don't invest, there is no greenery, there is no that kind of life, people have come from failed states, they are of multiple nationalities, inside there people feel alone in Dubai.  If you stay no, you feel known, yes, I have returned after traveling for 15 days. I have returned after traveling for 10 days. I have had a meeting and have taken photographs.  After spending two-four months here, brother, there is no taste in living and there is no taste. All these big film stars, Shahrukh, Vivek Gabrai, many people have bought Villa Shila for them. gone away  If pollution comes here and goes there, then it's good, but investment cannot be done on this basis. It is not increasing. There is no capital appreciation happening. Market in Dubai will stagnate and fall in the next five years. This is my clear prediction for more than 5 years.  There is no need to tell anyone who has seen so much of the world, whatever forecast is there is for three to five years, what can be expected from the next three.  You should note that there is no appreciation of property in Dubai, the supply is high and all the people who wanted to settle there after getting the terminal have come and settled and it is just that the people there who left their countries and are other wise.  There is no taste, save tax, but how much are the expenses, how much is the maintenance and other aspects will also have to be mentioned. Yes, there is no tax on rental income in India, if it is on ₹ 1000000.  There is tax on 70 rupees but if there is tax then there are many benefits and things too. Your capital appreciation is one of them plus your own country plus collection of tax on rent. If there is any issue in the rent then what will you do and how will you go?  What will you do, law is the biggest thing, which one and then that factor which I told just 15 seconds in the middle, you will always have that, it will have an impact on our country.  In whose name politics is being done, in whose name it is being done and in whose name it will be in the near future, what does it have to do with whose name it is being done and what is the link, so please do a little extra polling and the same thing is in  Goa Goans are not welcoming outsiders in Goa, which is good because outsiders have created a mess in the tourism of a lovely place with a population of 32 lakhs. We spoil all our beaches by going there and the local villages have talked about imposing tax on them that if you pollute, then don't clean it, people come to the beach for free and then there is this air. BNB and this property and these big builders will go and give plot failure, there is no taste and suddenly you release when Laksh SW comes up we will come in next to the four years plus this  Your eggs will be something like meat. People will have the option. No one goes to Goa 10 times. Went once. Went twice. After that no one is going to go. This is what tourism looks like when Ram Mandir ji was built in Ayodhya. Ram Mandir is also like this.  It seemed that not many people come to see it, now it cannot be done on that basis, that is because it would have worked in India, but what ever works in India beats that thing, so go the conventional way. Low hanging fruit is where the risk reward ratio is favorable go and buy stuff in cities Pune Bangalore Mumbai Gurgaon Me B Noida Ok Delhi People used to say after Delhi that no property is being sold in Delhi nor is anyone buying, defaming Delhi like this  Rental lease in Delhi 1.5 Delhi Nobody is buying property No one is buying any property in Delhi Proper Delhi Only the Delhi seller sells something and breaks it.  Only those who buy it, outsiders do not buy. Outsiders buy in Gurgaon or Noida or Greater Noida or Mumbai or Pune or Hyderabad or Kochi or a little in Jaipur or a little in Ahmedabad or Kolkata or Chennai or all these.  These things are 10 12 15 cities, just this city and one of them goes ahead, then one comes back, one goes ahead wherever you understand in these cities which suits your budget, a person from UP Bihar who  UP will not buy property in Bihar, does not want to buy, does not want to settle there, wants to buy somewhere outside, for them the things I told are the choice, please do not go to Dubai and Goa and when I say Goa then I mean do not buy anything in Manali also in Nainital.  Don't even buy, all these will become white elephants, no one will manage here and there are legal issues here, there will be order issues and there is only trouble, there is so much trouble, if you want to take it in life then earn money somewhere else.  And it is not worth it. Do you think that I will go and live there? Why do you need to rear buffalo to live? If milk is available in the market today, if you want to go to Goa, then you can buy a resort in South Goa from Lets.  It's okay if you stay in Goa, then next time you stay in another resort in some other part of Goa so that at least some change happens. Why do you have to go to the same house again and again? If this is the message, then this is how it will play.  Out thank you very much and please subscribe to the channel and ultimately give me the result brother, give me the result in the comment section, if you want to write my name in that one versus this one then write my name and brother Akshar Srivastava ji's logic is understandable. Although he throws around figures a lot, sometimes what happens when a man throws figures seems fine but the problem is in the part I am  Questioning The Ansh Figures What Ever He Is Telling Is Right But If You But A Property 2021 22 Then You Don't Come Up And Say 6 Par That Is 7 Par Here In Gurgaon Also Please Come And Ask I Will Tell You The Properties 6 Par 7 Par Capital appreciation is also available in Gurgaon and rental rate is also 100%.  It is at 3, today it is at 3 but when it was bought it has doubled, so brother it is at 6 so have to spread awareness datchi"

    "content": "Hello friends, there is a message for the youth why you should not consume short form content and spread this message, although I am not trying to make it in 1 minute but it will not be too long and those who are not very youth.  If you are doing this then I will tell you why, but there is a lot of waste for the youth, there is no limit to it, it is like you should eat a balanced meal, proper food.  You should eat, you are eating all that, you are eating only snacks, sometimes you eat this, sometimes you eat this, sometimes you eat this, your stomach is full and you are not getting full anymore and you are also eating junk food. The biggest problem in this is for the youth.  Those who are consuming a lot of content are coming, they are consuming short form content. Sure enough, there will be a lot of shots to be seen, there will be a conclusion, then there will be some take away, there will be some learning, there will be some method, some So if you are doing this too much to learn something, then you are thinking that if I watch a big video then it will waste a lot of my time and if I watch 10 small videos then I will take a lot of information, but the word is information wisdom.  You will not get knowledge, you will not get knowledge, only information will come, before information comes knowledge, after knowledge comes wisdom, you will never reach wisdom. Quickly come to two stocks, buy this one like this, see the next one, then two things which you should not do, one thing should not be done like this and it goes away after doing this because there is no need to give any more knowledge to the creator in it than from the book.  Got a punch line somewhere and made it quickly and it started working and it is very easy to become a creator like this. If you like videos like I do, you can create long form content. 15 20  If you have to shoot for 25-30 minutes, then the editor's requirements increase, you have to know the script, you don't have to worry about it, it's not easy, it's not easy, although I am like Amol Macho, there is grace, something comes out and it becomes mine, but when new.  If a person starts making it then it is not easy but since it is not easy then not many are doing it so everyone is going through this  Short route, tell us in 4 minutes, tell us in five minutes, quickly, hey, where did you reach so far, brother, do you remember those 18 years in school, how much time have you wasted, that teacher did not come, that games period happened, that interval happened, then it became useless.  Teacher came, he wrote something, how many questions did you write, then you wrote the answers again, then you did the homework, then you did the project, you know how much of life you have done that, now your time has become so premium, now you have to release.  I am not telling people to watch ridiculously long content and waster of time but only big content has to yield something, if you have tried any creator 2, 4, 10, 15 times, you are not able to understand it, like a book is very good but you don't understand it.  If it is coming in then you will not follow it but the small one will not do any good, the big one will surely do good, this is also not a guarantee and that content can also be useless but small  In fact, your mind's own processing will become so bad that you will not be able to talk at any level, you will not be able to develop communication skills. People have written many comments in my videos after watching my videos and what I also tell in the workshops. I also explain under the courses that a structured thinking is very very important in life. This information knowledge will help you in doing this work today and that work tomorrow but in any  Bringing the information first, discussing it, doing first order thinking, then looking at its second order effects, then going to those third order, if not till fourth fifth sixth, then that is one way a person can explain through a long video and through this your  Communication is better because communication is nothing. Understand the statement carefully. You guys are the waiters. Thoughts are the cook. Food is being cooked here. The tongue is the waiter.  She works as a waiter, whatever will be served, the thoughts will come out from here and if she is busy here and there is anxiety here that she has to tell me quickly, tell me quickly, then she does not feel like it, she will not be able to process that quickly and from here she  It will come out, it will have no meaning, people are focusing, what is coming out of the tongue and we are making everything small as a result, attention span is less, going with someone, outing, dating, girl.  You have to select the boy, you have to select, it is not just a pause, it is not a structure to check whether the person is good or bad, it is not right for me because everything is short content, which is your habit, it seeps into every aspect of your life. You have done this, analyze this video carefully and what I am trying to tell through this video has happened to you in everything, due to this your patience levels have gone. Every time something is being taught, it is all punch line. want to go to  That is, if comedy is happening and the jokes are good, then people want that too in short form, just tell the punch line, tell it quickly, do not tell the role, it does not happen like that, if ever something like that happens.  To get the meaning of the line, some background is needed. You are not interested in this background. This line will not take you anywhere. That is the message, so please make yourself aware of this thing. Do not deliberate in your mind, what kind of content do you consume?  Think very carefully about who you follow. Think very carefully about whether they are taking you from one place to another. This is very important. Everything is just for entertainment. You are not getting anywhere. Why a long content is serious content important.  The content is that if you are watching that creator, then you are feeling a journey that when I started watching it, I was here, then while listening to him, while listening to him, I thought something.  Made notes, made changes in some thought process and I reached here. Reached here and I am realizing that I will reach here when you feel like some content is improving you and by giving that content you are not doing that.  Is there any information in the reels that you want to impress someone, you want to impress someone with it and by thinking of motivation by hitting a dialogue and hitting a punch line, then that is a very superficial level.  If you are not reaching anywhere then I hope you will not run away from this short content. I too am small, many people have advised me that I have made many youtube3's and I have made them as well, but after giving them, I released that no, their quality is off.  That subscriber itself is not good because from the short content you come to the big thing of your long content, they will go away after abusing, trolling and going away, you have no patience, you have taken such people.  You go to a fine dining restaurant, you have to eat good food there, you will have to wait for half an hour, otherwise go to fast food, go to Magdi, you will get work like Magdi, if you don't have the patience to eat good food, will that be yours?  We will keep it after making it from the old days, just leave it and give it to us. Whatever good is being made at home, mom is making it, wife is making it, you are making it yourself, so it takes time, so you have to have some patience in making it.  Will it be necessary? For that thing, people need to bring their patience in nature, they will have to spend some time and yes it is possible that the video was of 12 minutes and 15 minutes and some great things were learned in it in the 10th minute and in the sixth And you can speak in hindsight, by editing it great, you make it only four minutes, so that was the point, that thing is not understood, that thing is not understood, you don't do such a thing.  You can make videos yourself as a content creator, see how much pressure comes on you, just tell me in two minutes, tell me in three, just tell me in short, tell me in short, tell me in short, till now no one has time, one and a half to two hours.

So I am telling you the reason why this has to be done. Okay, now I will not do too many such shoes and old things and all this in it because it is youth on clarity, the channel is different, I will tell you from a different perspective, so you should understand, the moment you disclose it to anybody people Bill slot you give a little always judging and give bill hit some comment or put you decorate if there will be more income then del expect something and you bill definitely every something hey this much income is there in the room he is driving in this car hey he is doing so much  he is wearing such clothes hey he is doing so much your children are doing it in school the world will increase your expenses by talking so much you will not understand it yourself and I see this problem when I give my financial consultations to people or who  I have seen his portfolio management, such expenses have been incurred in it, today take the medical council, today take the astrology, today Vetiver I do so I think when I go inside the kurta then it comes out that means they are light aqua so much  So what you have to do is that if I have a package of 20 lakhs then it is not like that brother, your package of 20 lakhs is more than that, check the tax in it, see how much is the variable income, see how much is it, you also do not get 100% because your target is meet  It is not there and it actually counts it under CTC but check how much is going into your account in the bank, it got deducted there, it got deducted here, it got deducted there, let us think of our income of 20 lakhs that an income of 20 lakhs means 1  Lakh 70  It has already become thousand so you are maintaining the expenses that way because first you told the people that well tell your wife that the dog is more than the wife now if you do not want to tell your wife about the income then tell whatever you have got in hand, if you don't even give enough to your own wife Tell me what I am saying friend one should not lie to one's wife friend many times tell him every man should save a part of your salary for his wife that if your salary is this much then her salary is this much only that is why it is matching  Indians want to know everyone's salary or income, that mine is this much, his is this much, if his income is less than mine and his children go to school, then mine will also go, if you are understanding then now this can happen inside his circle I am spending on the school, apart from this he neither goes out for a walk nor does he do Zoma Tomato nor does he do anything else, he neither goes out for a walk nor does he do anything else, he does one thing, you took care of the school, you took care of the child, we took care of his car, we took care of his clothes, all of them  You are doing some of your programs and then you think that friend what has happened to me because you have done your own Because in moment you oil ur income you are big and everybody bill want your income you open n bank account or open demat account you buy property you do anything everybody bill from 5 to 10 lakh 10 to 15 to 20 to 25 and many times what  It happens when you start earning more money and start earning new money, then how do you get your self- steam, which happens, I have been witness to the emotions that you go through, okay, through various things, that is called friend, 3 lakh rupees there  Give me the money, I am late, he is asking for 3 lakhs, someone is asking for 2 lakhs, now you do n't have the money to pay for the notes debt, you do n't have any money to pay because the notes debt were not useful to you, but you are investing them for useful purposes. You have arranged your income schemes with the intention that this will be mine, I want to buy a flat, buy a plot, I want to buy property, this is my school, this is my code, I want to study as per my wish, in this way you should make him a human being.  For  You don't have Rs 3 lakh to spare and the person who is asking for Rs 3 lakh could be someone close to you, could be a friend, could be a relative, could be anything, but if you have done so much wrong then he will  Then what were you going through, you are in the bill, you are on trap, if someone asks you about your salary, tell me, I am managing, don't ever answer in a straight forward manner, no, still how much work do you take, how many children do you take, ok, you tell me this, human being, okay  And that is a shirt worth ₹5000, see, I am saving ₹1200 from it, so I bought a shirt worth ₹3800 for 1200, which is worth ₹5000, so you tell me the income of 1200, dog, what did you get from that to me for ₹4000 So 250 now you have not done any calculation that what is income tax, what is GST, what is the rent of the shop, if there is sales going on then what is the net amount, that is your shortfall and it is giving you times when you have lost  If it happens then it means whether it is your job or your business or anything else because he is driving a taxi, how many children he has, oh I did not know how many children he has, I ask you people this simple thing, you deposit money in the demat account  You invest money in mutual funds on your own. If I ask you for returns, no one can calculate and give it to you. It becomes so tricky. When was Dell, when was Capital, now it is Reliance, it is nominal. At the moment I will sell the bill, then I will have to pay 10% of Maraco Capital.  You will need that ₹1. I have tried some of the best apps, I have to check their algorithms, they fail, they fail, it makes my brain go crazy in calculating my own returns, I invested ₹1 lakh and it returned 3 lakh in three years.  If this return becomes lakhs, then you can calculate it very easily. This is the formula of P*R*T. This is the formula of 1 + R to the power of N and you can calculate the formula of its component. But my brother, sometimes you put in, sometimes you take out, sometimes you book a loss and sometimes you make a profit.  Sometimes I booked and then put in a new one, sometimes I put in more and sometimes I put in less  Have you ever taken out a fan, it makes your mind go crazy, give it to yourself, this is the fact of life, calculate your own income, this note is this, if you are earning more, give something, a rough estimate is relief and here I am going to make a lot, let me make it in a separate video, but I will tell you this  I am telling you that please do not disclose your income to anyone, keep it to yourself, whoever asks, tell me that you are managing, he will say no no, we are getting to know a little more, still we want to know, so give a figure which is the actual figure  Whatever welcome you got of him, if you see any fibers, many people have a habit of keeping guns on the garden, relatives and acquaintances, they give guns as Rakhi, what kind of feeling did you get from here that I, that Gabbar, kept it with Kalia and if it will go on, then I have to tell you now.  So brother, the amount that has come to you after deducting your cut, tell me it is ₹ 200 less than that in your actual hand, ok it is that much, then in the next comment I thought it was this much or if it is this much then why don't you do it like this, then lie down that, then this  Why don't you lie down, this is a big bed habit of us Indians This is for Indians, in other countries this thing is considered very big and if you don't tell it, you will be directly asked how many you are, whether you are getting married or not, you will always have to tell because the girl is coming to you, you will have to tell that  She started asking about Form 16, she should also ask about ITR, these are the situations, you will have to show the allotment letter as well, you have booked the story to show yourself after 3 years that yes I am a very eligible bachelor, this situation is different because there  Relationships are being formed by your birth but other distance is that now the people who are in government jobs have relief idea of ​​salary, in private jobs it does a little variation so don't worry about telling this people that I have not taken any package at home People are ready to tell everyone what is the package, CTC and what is the actual package, so my request to the audience is that they should have the confidence to not tell and they should not keep jumping around and asking questions, then brother, that will rock.  can you have any of your  The business went well, the training went well, you tell him, the next guy will start extrapolating and say that if your brother scored 80 runs in 10 overs, he will definitely score 400 in 50 overs, who knows he might get allotted at 180, you are also thinking that I will score 400.  I will take it, he is also thinking that if you get allotted on 180 then he should check his expectations, after coming home he told his father that I will get 99 or 100, then when I get 92 also, thoughts like decent marks D day after tomorrow note this, you are very happy then  Tell me whether you will get a score in 90, the paper went well but you cannot know much, then when you get 92 it seems like a good number, then he says yes it is okay, so these are important human emotions and psychology, understand it and please do not tell him anything else about it And give me two shares front table, is that okay or tell me yours, it's a simple thing, what is happening, if the person is intelligent he will get the hint and if he is a fool he will get the hint  If I don't find it, I'll open it and tell you, okay"

    "content": "Hello friends, let's discuss a little about the same thing that you should not have a credit card. The major benefits of a credit card are counted. There are some benefits of a credit card. I am not doing it but I am still going to discuss today why you should not have a credit card. You should not have one at all. He should get it done judicially, he should get it done in emergency, only by doing it he gets points, if we pay the money on time then there is no interest charged and there is a lot of profit, many people keep many cuts from here to there, I do it like this I want to give a different perspective because a lot of youngsters are caught in this cycle of credit card and they also get a lot of calls asking Sir, you need a credit card, do you qualify? By doing that, will you get any benefit? You will get some facility at the airport or on the launch?  And it is written to them that okay something will happen to you in the movie tickets or in the restaurant there is something or the other in the world okay so firstly I have covered all this which is sold by telling other benefits now I say why not  you should not keep it [music] it's done but the interest charged on it is GST levied on it, remember when you  Let me tell you that there is no GST on the base of a normal home loan, but here it will be applicable. Many people come to know about this. Secondly, with a credit card, we feel that we will garner points and we will take this thing on credit.  It is possible that next month you may find yourself in a situation where you are unable to make the payment. Then the cycle of interest starts and it becomes very difficult to get out of it. And you know the credit card people charge a hefty interest rate and the problem does not end there either.  The problem is that if some dispute occurs somewhere and you do not have the full knowledge of live and you close it or do not pay the money or leave it or there is a fight or you do something else, it reflects in your civil and  Many people cry later when they do not get the loan. The loan is available at 9.30 percent interest. It is supposed to be 8.30 percent and if the loan is repaid in 30 days, it cannot be repaid. So there is a problem and trouble which can be avoided by Potli.  I can go on but I would like to discuss a few psychology lessons on this.  I will tell you something, you people should understand it carefully, firstly it is a practical aspect because many people will think that if there is an emergency then in an emergency you should create your emergency fund, secondly in India family also gets involved in emergencies, however all these stories are not different  It is made according to America that there will be an emergency, no one is there for anyone, that is where the credit system has started, you people will always be made to get used to it, you should not buy any small ticket items with a credit card  It is not right to buy a house with a credit card. Small things are bought with a credit card; be it a mobile phone, clothes, dining out, going to the movies, all these things should be bought with the money you have and this  When you get involved in the matter of points then you are batting very, that means your batting is very bad, friend, your playing is very lazy game, you make yourself a person worth ₹1050 per point thousand per rupee, the psychology remains the same  And in that you have a stress factor that I have to make the payment on time, there are many stress factors of making the payment on time.  things happen ok but keep the stress on it, I have given standing instructions, then there should be money in the bank, I am telling you because if you keep an option for yourself then he will also have it brother, then that one will be there, the other will be there and then this  Point is, its payment through this, its payment through this will also be less, so do this thing, use your debit card less and these are the sources of increasing your money, these are the sources of adding value to yourself, your mind should be there for this, then apps will be downloaded.  The rest of the things will be downloaded, basically if the focus of your life is lost then there will be no bamboo, nor will the flute play, take the approach of cancelling the credit card afresh, the biggest risk of its benefits is that it will ruin the civil life of many youngsters because I  I also have a home loan, it is a vertical kind of work which I do, in this it can be seen that what was pending 4 years, 6 years ago, it is reflecting, now he will not say I will be very particular, I will be  very particular i will be  The history of the credit card, as you do a lot of it, how much you consume, civil also affects it, how much it affects the exact and gaurism, we do not know yet, how much it is positive or negative, but that is also a thing that this man Why is there a need to take credit for small things? Now I have tried to check exactly what the exact bill is, but there are many things that are not known. If you default, there will be a mendali effect.  It will happen, there is no doubt about it, at least if you default, then if you are put in a separate list of defaulters, it will have a huge impact, but without date also it is late for you.  Will after listening to your advice not to have a credit card and then you will be still there, nothing like this will happen, I will take it because I see it very seriously and I am totally in control, okay please write to me in the comment section, thank you very much"

Listen to Bhai Saheb, 'Hey Bhaiya, there is a very big youth, who likes it so much, the latest video that you have posted 'Earn Punch Paise from Credit Card, I should also dreamstify it' and I am coming and saying that apply for credit card.  Don't even apply for credit card. Let's go to the video in which it is said that brother, my monthly expenses are all for 40-45 days, I get interest free or 30 days and I put this money in my FB and then  If I give it on time and then if I do it like this then I will save Rs 2700 in 6 months. Did you tell me the calculation, that means you have given the knowledge of Rs 14 per day and in giving the knowledge  Even the Creta worth ₹ 14 was lost. Okay, so what a great knowledge he gave for that ₹ 14. Even once in that, you somehow fell ill or you went to a place where there was no internet connection, your phone got broken, your tension got broken.  And if you forget to make that repayment on time, then what will happen to you? Look at this, they are actually telling you what is the punch thing, you have to tell me the first thing, you have told me the second thing, you have told me in the third one, you have told me, I am absolutely against.  I am not YouTube  People should promote themselves, don't you friend, send your [ __ ], earn money from somewhere, what is the problem, you pick some apps and give them in bulk, there is no benefit in any of them and then you claim, we do not run ads, you are just one.  After increasing 12-14 lakhs by doing the app and you are showing your points in it and better than this, promote dream11 or take that credit card, it will be like this and this war is also going on in it because some facilities are not available in my account.  You will get a discount, you will get a voucher, your brain is going crazy, date is what time is saying, your concentration takes toll on your brain, don't have a credit card, just have a debit card, these points work on debit cards too, but they will not tell you that  People who have debit cards, banks have debit cards, there is also a scheme, it does not work only on credit cards, you should have money, then you can do it like this.  Take this and take advantage of it, you have made the youth worth Rs 2.5 thousand and many more and these are the people of Fortuner too who are being made fun of by the civil score. If you are a credit history civil person then you will think that brother cannot meet his monthly expenses. Similarly, I can take a loan, I can take out a month's expenses, even a credit card is based on its logic, you friend, why am I angry, sometimes I have to learn these things and people learn them.  They go and think, Papa, should I take my home loan because he told him that uncle ji told him, it is okay, brother told him, he also told that he has got so many subscribers, so many people are liking it, brother, it would be good if someone cross checks.  No one is going to do it, no one is going to come and tell you, catch one thing about this thing that the bank people, the civil people, you see, brother, you go and ask someone that the civil butter gets spoiled, even the simple monthly expenses are done through credit card. he is doing it  You have to use your own mind, think about what is happening, take this point, take that point, take this point, brother, such content is requested with folded hands, people, hey, you are making this video, subscribe to you, absolutely right, absolutely right but. What message am I conveying in this, at least discuss it at least once, whether what I am saying is right or wrong because if my  The thing is going to only ₹ 32000 people, it is okay if ₹ 30000 is going to 32000 people then the effect will be less later and if someone's wrong thing is going to 27 lakh people then you will have trouble with that ₹ 32000 will become ₹ 1 lakh. He is making it, let him make it, it's about the movie, it's about entertainment, his movie is doing well, so why are you doing it, Pathan took so many less crores, so you are yours.  Launch your game and earn less crores. This is a narrative social responsibility. As your subscribers increase, how can you not make anything by raising your hand? Your responsibility is to increase the higher content, which can take something to a higher level. Tell me something like this.  The chat is secret, Google or nothing, friend, apart from these five things, my request is to sip from the financial influencer, sip, there should be an emergency fund of 6 months. Your emergency fund should be You should do it by pressing the credit card like this, friend, make something other than one-day topics, plan to repay the home loan quickly, whenever you get it, do it, your income will increase by 10% every year, you also lose your job, which people do not understand.  You come to me, enter your direct father's income and take home loan by entering your income. Civil is yours till then and take home also and I also take home's calculation van point is de trap let me tell you off.  All D Financial Influence D Catch If you listen to him on the van, there is no one who speaks slowly, I too do not speak slow, I do not speak slow, I speak normal, I am fine and I speak, you will be missed in 1.5, that mind does not have the capacity to process.  That it is not about Ki Sam is factual information that it is being immediately told that its capital is Washington, South Korea.  Korea's capital is Seoul and it is copying you. It is China's Beijing and you have quickly taken your factual information and you have reduced the numbers by doing something to it. These are the things that are happening, if you want to land in it, then you can listen to it and where you can land in it. This trap works only on 1x, you all have to see the pattern, you will find it written as 1.5x. Hey brother, that is the wish of the subscriber, he will listen to it on 2X also.  Its wish is 1.7 speed. Why are you doing this? I need an answer to this because do not give even one second more time to your calculations because I am selling messaging apps. I will show some calculations to sell messaging apps and they will turn out to be correct.  How many presumptions are there that how much attention will I have to pay every time, how much stress do I have that my friend has to go, I have money somewhere, I have spent it, if you keep a debit card and keep a credit card in your life.  So nothing is missing, I don't give much personal examples but I don't miss anything out, I have never used a credit card, my civil is very good, very good and simple, nothing has to be done with credit card, I am telling credit.  Card only remember, if you want message only, then thoughts are same and topic, by the way, don't have credit, it will cause civil damage to you, it will not improve, either it will be kept from you or you will not make payment.  You turned something off or you had a fight, they charged you something else, you turned it off, something happened and something was left, so your bill went down, it will not increase, this D message and all these app based ones are the same.  Give it, what they say is that you give this money from this card, give this card money from this app, this person 's hat is his head, his head is his hat, everyone's head is everyone's head, half a time someone fell ill, Vyas etc.  Stomach ache, forget it, bad mood.  It happened somewhere, I got injured, somewhere I got busy in exams, somewhere there was no internet, anything can happen, I am telling you all these things, then it is only for you that my payment has not been made or something else has happened to you, so don't do it.  Na don't place him, for whom will you tune in by saving Rs 2700, it's great, you have given good advice, so please customer, wake up, life is not this, things are never ever going to be easy, you are watching this kind of content.  Yes, the second content is easy, what are people watching? Lifestyle videos, they are watching the most of the rich people, they will not look that sexy, either take this 2700 rupees baby or watch these of the rich people and then sleep whatever I hope you like.  The decision making series which is my mental model, green people should see it for themselves, I have to promote and speak every time because in this off course, people get to know how to take decision making in life. 15 Mental models are shown in one video. I have read 18 19 mental models with English titles. Kindly watch them. Stock market deals are also done easily without using other jerkins. So you both give. Such videos will continue to be made. There is no competition.  Okay, I am not in any affair, I am not in any competition. Okay, so I will never suggest anything to you people by doing this or that. Whoever is suggesting is a fancy thing for me too. Many calls come to me, promote it to 2 lakh, where 2 1/4 lakh subscribers come to the one with more subscribers, more come to this, also come to this, but after talking to them, they come to know that this is  Ford is a thing, there is no need for it, everything is going better than normal banking, how many apps will you keep in the mobile phone by force, if it is fine then please don't get impressed by this 25  The thing worth 2700 is this D message credit card, I have managed 10, it was a good workout for me. Hey brother, let the marriage happen, the man forgets the school fees, sometimes he forgets to do something else, just let the mental juice come for once.  If you are 24, 25, 27 then there is energy in life, after that there will be a lot of destruction in your job, you will be burdened with many presentations, you will forget, you will forget."

First of all I wanted you, the friend of IAS, it is a very big thing. Thousands of people have come to study. All four people have gone. Okay [music] Should I eat the bread of what I am going to say now? There is power in my words, there is power in knowledge.  It is just that, where it is coming from should have no meaning, here in India today, if you pick up so much wisdom and wave your hands like this and call people animalism, then you look very good and are children.  They become fools because even their parents are not guiding them. No one in the society is guiding them. What is your Thanos saying? What is this Indian Thanos saying? Why are you getting married? What kind of marriage is this? Now I am going to tell you. Not marrying is an abnormality and a different thing. Our society has become so mature that it has accepted this thing. The Supreme Court has accepted this. This is fine but now you are a homo.  Notes of sexuals, comments, it is wrong to have hetero section of oil, you are a fool, and less, everybody should become homo, I am telling you by taking a sexual example, I am not condemning anyone, your homosexual cant comment that you are having sex, it is very safe, don't get it.

Let's talk about biology, brother, you are ashamed of the natural desire and instinct, shame the body, after doing sex education from here, our country has died, bed touch, good touch, sexual resolution, children have to learn, this is how these misconceptions happen.  If this was the case, then you go to India, Khajuraho is also there, all your Kamasutra, everything was ours, you get all this and everything, all the knowledge, now you are changing some other narrative here. I caught one Advaita, one caught that, don't condemn him but ask and catch him, you come and say anything, this is the thing you do, make a fool of you, loot your money, I am saying date it D Lesnar crime when you finish today itself  What you are doing is that there is no need of nuclear bomb, there is no need of terrorist attack, tell a society, what are you saying that service is important in the society, hey society is Nannu's father, Nannu is the same. And she is Nannu's mother and those who marry and give birth to children are the society itself. Since when have you, a social worker, become above the society? Have you not become above the creator? Hey, the day that little baby comes in your hand, that boy becomes a mother.  If not a day, then even small things keep roaming around in life. By taking a motorcycle in life, you learn to live for someone else. What are you being taught? How are all four of you being eaten? Do this, do this, gain knowledge, achieve this. Achieve that, achieve that knowledge, then what knowledge should I do? No, then I am talking about Moksha Moksha Scientific, the theorem has become acceptable, foreign countries have accepted it, I agree, but I am speaking in your language.  Whenever it suits you, you take me here, etc. because now I feel from inside that I will have to leave the room, I also talk well, I also keep it rational and I have also read those books because  I see the auditorium is full of people watching their videos on YouTube and those who come look like losers sitting. If you catch hold of me and the losers then have some conversation and then tell them once about their situation that it is okay which is bad and  Those who will not have proper children, there will be no society and this brother is saying that you leave one child, don't even marry, don't do anything and this is an animal, it is an animal, so stop eating it, don't even eat animals.  Eats, do you go to the bathroom in the morning, don't you? Animals also do it somewhere. Stop doing that. Brother, let me study whatever science I have. I have also studied Biology. I have also studied Physics Chemistry Math till 12th. In Biology, it is said that there is animal kingdom.  Which one of us will be in one, at least the plant owner will not be the one who will take a butter fly or a bee from here and if such programs do not exist because we are in the animal kingdom, there is animality in everything. This is that man.  What  Man is the one who has taken the world till here and woman is the one who is the creator and in India and this and the whole of India considers the parents as God and respect them, so brother, at least the parents should be respected. So why can't you become like God? Why should you be afraid? What are you going to become? You have become parents. When you were born from parents, how were you born? How were you born in animality? How were you born? You tell me how everything was born.  There are holes in them  Do your Vedanta book, he has not even read it, but his life is a miserable loser life, he justifies it full and those videos and views and views and what do they say about me, I know that I have thrown stones under the umbrella of honey bee. Diya, there will be an attempt to troll me, troll troll, I also know, because the man who thinks it is right, it feels right because man, he will troll all this, the man who is working, has a family, is studying, is getting married.  He can't even come and stand, now why is someone like me making a video by reducing it by 50, I also have less because the one who has less, the one who has to raise his wife and children, the one who has to move his life forward, he will not come and say these things. All the losers have said, I ask for one of my own here too, make a moment, I ask for this too, now say this here, give it your old name, Chetna, Vivek Buddhi, this is Chetna in every three lines, Chetna, Chetna, Chetna, then what do you have to do with Chetna? Tell me where are you taking D Youth 22-25 26 years old needs you to work 59 And he will only work And the purpose comes from the institution of marriage It is un time tested Start roaming around Don't do anything There is no need to do anything  What are you paying attention to, I will also go to the auditorium, I will also go to college, I will also go to college, tell me friend, okay, I will also speak  I also say, friend, there is a limit, I also function arrogant and understand [music] There should not be any torture, everything is getting equal, then you feel everything is going wrong, you come to know that in the picture.  What a villain he is who says that the whole world is this baby, behind it all the other babies look very cute, so I neither have dogs nor puppies, I will make them so cute and I will make them even cuter so that  The world should follow him and stop doing babies, he has a problem with babies, it is okay and the picture of baby bossing is his theme, this is his friend, if this person is reducing the system, then this person is taking us in the same direction.  It is not visible in the short term because this effect will be visible in ₹10 years. Today, if 2 crore 3 crore people are under the influence of this person, because 40-50 lakh are only subscribers, brother, that is influence. Why are you subscribing, my words seem ridiculous to you, will you subscribe, subscribe me, give me this date, but if someone has 50 lakhs, someone has 40, 50, 60 locked and one is becoming a boys club of Vellore. And that thing is accumulating one crore two crores and then brother, no one will marry because looking different is a pressure from the society to get married and what is wrong in it.  They are saying that there should not be this pressure, remove this pressure, this thing which is entering into a man, it seems easy when your face is such that no one wants to marry you, then it feels very good to have the institution of marriage.  Saying that the institution of marriage is bad while I am not commenting on anyone's beauty, beauty is this much, can I attract someone, this hair is realistic, also here she is.  So this one will attract, so I am here, so I am here, there is someone for every man, someone for every woman, everyone gets married, the one who wants to do it, the one who does n't want to do it doesn't get married, so now this youth Who is confused because how much brother has he been given, all the girls will do section 498, will take money, will file false cases of dowry, please tell me how much is it, I am not saying that this does not happen, but its government.  Let's even change the rules that now we will not directly bring the code, it is not like this now, there will be investigation, this will happen a lot, they have started saying in OTS also, that is an extreme, there is no doubt here which was there earlier, the government has made the rules.  They took the rules here, now after going here, they are coming here again and will come straight slowly, it will take time but it does not mean that you have done all the right topics, why can't men accept those who are our 56000 and  Those who talk about this big thing in the books, all that knowledge is written, female choice was the time, today also see this exercise, if you see there too, [ __ ] wonder whose off spring I will be, if I want a strong one and that, then there is no people, no prince.  If he would have got angry at the Swayamvar in time or if anyone among the animals would have been angry then you would have seen these angry people making the positive sour. I have a lot of problems and there is no time for evasive talk or not.  I respect you, now I don't do it, I am scared, I do it because of somebody, you comment, nobody is telling, so free run, I have got 40 lakhs, 50 lakhs, 70 lakhs, 80 lakhs, one crore, now I am sitting at 30000, 30000 is getting screwed by 50 lakhs.  Even if it is good, many people will say this, and for what else, Bano, please tell me, Panch Janas to do good to the society.  If I talk about something inside, then it means don't talk like this and how this is not enough to earn money, you can do many more, look, it sounds spicy, I have no doubt in my words, okay, but friend, tell me that I  Friend, there is no one standing for the normal majority which is running, nor is anyone standing for the middle class, friend, if we talk about the religion of our Sanatan Dharma, then all our people like God ji are with his family. Look at it and follow it, it's okay Gauri Shiv, it's okay, ours, this is how they come together, this is how they do it with me, okay Radhe Radhe, okay, what do these people want, that there was a king, there was a queen, both of them died, the story is over.  So there was a king, there was a queen, one day they got married and they did and then what happened, Nannu will not be there, Nannu's father will not be there and Nannu's mother will not be there because each of them became their fourth and they say nano nano by nano, I have a big objection.  She is very dear to everyone and should be loved by everyone because that is life. Children, means agent, children, means all the children. Now I call you Chotu, baby and with great affection I say to you, Chotu, baby, there is strength in you, the good within you which comes out of the human being also awakens the women.  I am already on the default setting, I am talking about men and you make her realize that by giving her this useless knowledge about you from so many people, then brother, if someone does not want to marry her and wants to do something great, then she will automatically go to someone for him.  knowledge to  There is no need to take from anyone, there is no need to give, it will go on its own, it will go on its own, and this is true only for one percent, if even one percent goes on the great path, then India will defeat America 50 years ago. If he was genuine, in our India today there are 10 lakh boys, 10 lakh only, I am saying, the population is misguided and more of them are being misguided. In our country, it is very easy to get misguided and explain.  It is very difficult to talk to the first person who understands you, who agrees with your reality, you become his friend and those people are growing and they do not confirm this and that, it was said that they are not married, they are questioning again and again.  -You would ask again and again and people would get irritated that you told them, was it the pressure of a society and after that, if the society was closed after a stage, then it would not have gone after a 45 year old man, it is time for a girl to get married at the age of 30.  Year Till 32 years of the boy's life, no one talks about it after that, no one is so crazy, but the society does its duty on its default setting that it is not like this, it means there is no such issue, but it just means that the mind is not getting married again, which means there is no actual reason.  So it tests if how great is yours, because of larger reasons, because of small reasons or because of stupidity, are you a deviant, normal in this marriage, normal marriage and not normal society, you did not get married either. Don't accept it. It's okay but don't make it so that those who are not doing it are letters of praise and those who are doing it are living at the level of clean animals. Its message was heart hitting. If someone got hurt if this happened, then I would not accept it.  I also apologize by adding that I do not mean to put anyone down, but if someone is taking a rat down the hill like a wrong ID paper, then from within I want to stop them and break that tune once.  If you have become free from this mantra, then listen to a counter narrative as well and if you can wake up after listening then go for Jagran, even if you don't want to wake up, I feel that the country has to be destroyed, divert its war, call it nuclear bomb, call it terrorist.  There is no need to have bomb fighters, call it attack, army, keep some people who can instigate them by making them knowledgeable about things, everyone can sit well, where will there be GDP growth here? Hey, this GDP is something.  Nothing like this happens, children are nothing, extreme example, no one should marry in India, no children should not have children, like it is happening in many countries, brother, someone will come and sit there, we Indians are also going there, look at Finland, rest. Look at the countries, we are capturing there, if we don't do it like this then someone will come here and then we will serve their society, our sticks will become their society and we will serve them, we will speak, some more videos will also come on this. Dependent on comment, there will be no clarity on this, normalization will not happen, thank you."

    "title": "Why You Should Not Watch Cricket Matches ？ [cKZ4MY3ZXqI].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today's fast is a simple topic, why should we not watch cricket matches, now there will be many people who will tell what is okay, it is time wasting, it is okay but we know that for relaxation, I will tell you in such a simple way that whatever  You know, if I tell you that, then why would you come to my channel? Okay, and I watch your channel too, so you say the same thing, what is the point, what is the benefit to you in watching a cricket match, I like that, it is good that you also drink alcohol.  looks good to someone  You may also feel like teasing a girl. Well, some people may feel like passing the time. Well, some people may also feel like getting out of the train and making such selfies and uploading them in this program. But is that okay? Below is how one can compare cricket watching in foreign countries. There are some disadvantages to this.  The same topic is there because you are watching others becoming rich, if you are becoming rich by watching them, that too people had come up with the system, which one is there in the playing eleven, which is the app, some can write it.  dena ki team  By selecting and winning, sometimes they got involved in IPL, sometimes they wanted this game made by the British, the English world used to play this game, they did not pass the time, the villagers got to subscribe and are sitting comfortably after setting up their tents, all the water in Pune and their Subscribe this style and those who were from that people should subscribe and population that all this continent India Pakistan Sri Lanka and that your Bangladesh it is so clear that there is rescue if it gives five percent tension  If you put in the rest of the support then they will get the gold medal in the Olympics. The population of New Zealand is 70 lakhs. Najafgarh Dwarka Rohini, Najafgarh Dwarka Rohini, get less messages than that. Hey, along with New Zealand, our gold medal comes, it should be such a country of Neeraj Bhai.  I do n't know what is right to celebrate, but why is there so much celebration? Which country did one belong to, there is no meaning in a small country, don't give three gold medals like that. His opinion is even more, but it is less and here we have six crore names, this recipe is well n Golana, here also the thing is diesel, then who will ask, how many will not ask the cows, why is this happening because I will do all the specials in cricket since 1968.  See, the whole country is listening to the cut from the SSP, this is a conspiracy to invest the time of a rich man, a very rich man, who has no work, how has he got the money, he is sitting on the beach, watching cricket, doing something else for himself.  ok but the country which is poor  Where we still have to take DP3 is that after so many years, how much has happened to China, let's stop Tik Tok, we had to stop it because it was a weapon, make the youth waste all the time, okay, make the youth waste all the time, the war will end and their minds will be affected.  Neither should you focus, because it reduces your time so much, Twenty-20 is also called your four hours and not you do not leave it in four hours, after that you will also translate it in English. Five bullets of this match, that green chilli channel.  But why will India lose? Pakistan is adamant on defeating Pakistan. What was it then like that, it is a typical spoon, this is an eco system, the system is playing a game, it shows you matches, it shows you ads and what is the benefit of the whole system to you through broadcasting rights, soon.  This video of penis, you should also be a taster, neither should this trunk also be selecting you what you want, now people will say, friend, give me, if you enjoy yourself, then can you do something in which you will be valueless and also enjoy.  So ultimately I would like to tell myself a very deep thing, please understand it carefully, this is my request, a reminder has been set for you about this, there is a lot of stress and tension inside and when you only see it, you become stress free.  You feel but you wait so much for time and since you waste this time, you are put in such a system of job, target, salary and sex that you cannot come out of that system by editing it and then go there again. Chakli back and that chakki grinding in such a way that it covers you again, you do not improve your health, posted key and sims, if this one is bad for you, then you brother, if it is bad for me, then I will understand why I don't see the meaning, so if you do one thing  You will see such a situation in which your value increases, you get some information from which you can become rich, you can get pro quote, so it is fun to see it, you know that cricketers buy flats worth Rs. 64,64 crore, in that too you show yourself that I am the one.  I have seen so much of him, done so much of him, I am so connected to him, I follow him on Instagram and do all this in everything and follow him on Twitter. Worry, this man is not great sex, sitting in my hand and this being far away.  Show that many people are doing very good work and are not recognized. If they are not just recognized then they all have devotion and why waste India's time in this game. Even if it is of 40 minutes, the demand is that it should be like that.  Football is also gone for 70 minutes and half the minutes because the remaining twenty-three are our free entertainment and these collective sports which are historically in our DNA, I am saying to remove them but perhaps in a match of 190 minutes, a person gets more exhausted, which means children too are now  To fill the volume, in the game of hockey and football, perhaps more juice is released by clearing. In cricket, he is standing at one place and is batting. If he comes to bat, he is out on a run. 5 Pro Kabaddi Football and Hockey  It does not happen that you did not score a goal, did not do anything, so you are just standing there, I am speaking from the experience of playing in a message, not only watching, so all the countries which are intelligent design, whatever you give above, you are the GDP top 10 countries.  Look at the GDP, you will get one India and only one England. Life is funny, to waste the time of the whole world, do the rest. To my knowledge, there is no third country and how many World Cups of Cricket have they won in countries like Australia too. There  Even their Rabi and local sports were given to other sports by the time their gold medals came. Even England has invented a free game for them too. You can see how much focus they have on other sports and can't get results which make them look like bawdy children.  Look, we are all this, we are all this, we were slaves, we were standing here in this trick, some people will feel bad, it is true that this is true, we used to look at them and think that yes, we too will survive, we too will survive that.  to joy  Double the love, which movie is it Lagaan hai to double continuously, now you will win, we have defeated Gaurav, we have just made him ours, oh brother, we have made him a seventy-five year old child, now leave it now, friend, when we are engaged in the colonial past, we are removing all the things.  We removed the flag, also the Navy thing, great thing, ok, we made the district duty-bound, the expert said, great thing, everything is ok, this is also a colonial part, now why should we close it?  If it is profitable then what can we see then we can reduce the entire narrative. We will take what we are told, we will put in our minds that making Janpath the path of duty, it was a great thing, if it is done in response to Janpad, then that is sugar on Janpath.  When the President walks on the Rajpath in response to the kings and the Rajpath, when we made them the path of duty, now he will walk like a human being, he will feel that he has some duty, so it is a very great and good thing that if someone criticizes it, remained You were carrying some old colonial marks in your emblems. She moved away and started wearing her own. Our history is very great. Oh, cricket is also there so why not waste your food time. I am very anti to you, reduce the viewing a bit, friend, it is very fun, if you are getting some noise then look at it, it is like having too much software, reduce the office, tea also, these people were seen now.  height shoot us  Cricket, I, I, I should give up, okay, I will remove the colony and the whole thing, which means it gives me a big headache, it is Punjab. Whether I give up alcohol or cigarettes, I never smoke or drink tea. I leave tea at a small square here. How many people like Udta Punjab? Anyway, Udta Punjab is a movie, I am not criticizing Punjab, nowadays I have to hit delete every time, why should I get angry if this movie was Tata Punjab, then I am relating to it, I am relating to Udta Punjab, it was a movie withdrawal. Symptoms like this, if you leave tea, then this is the question, that time is lion, so liquid, will you people who reduce it, if even 20 people write that they will reduce, reduce, then in that much time they write that they will reduce. Please grind it well because you have something to do on this channel. The wishes of this are that you do not have anything to do at that time, so you are doing it if you have to.  Is there any better thing which can provide more entertainment than that or can the time be fixed? Someone gave me a webinar at 9:00. I did it at 9:00 in the same districts. Hey Sir, India got angry with Sri Lanka. It's okay, the match missed the call, I don't forget it because it's our life.  I don't believe that time is only limited. Do everything else too. Indians unfortunately are very time mirch gas par Manipur Vilpur but time mirch is very limited and time is very limited. What is there in youngsters that youngsters find time and dirty because you are 22 years old in a team of 25 so you feel that you have to give this year, if you watch the match then three hours of life were three, 350 in three and see five in this test.  The match should be banned absolutely, they say this turmoil, what will take away something, isn't it right, this was quite the start quote 2 A but to be ahead, this power  And do this, I will call you, you guys can support Tanker 2102 Hey, you lie and settle it, watching even 120 balls becomes too much because when it comes according to the timing of other sports, then it can happen that yes  Look, I am not saying anything about doing zero, but this is the time, this is a test, a lot of people also watch the match of Pakistan and Afghanistan and sir, the product launch was last, it was like this, someone came to meet me today, it is okay for me, today my  I don't know who  What a match, if you had given it to someone then maybe she would have gone away. Why is India so emotional in this world? Keep so much salvation for your wife, keep it for your children, keep it for your parents, keep it for your brothers and sisters, keep more energy and time.  Focus your attention on earning money, so what am I saying wrong then write those wrong and if I am saying right then write it like this, I am right like this, right and wrong are like this, just like writing ATM, is this correct then write it down, it is a recorder and so on.  you will explain a lot  This is the subscriber base which I will always teach in the videos how to fill that time in which there will be fun in BJP Nimaaz, I will feed the edition which means drink bottle gourd juice all day long, it is very good, maybe then you will not know the secret of tomato, first also cheese taste too.  So, not only everything is needed in the whole life, when the score is good, it does not happen, there is no acidity, the thotti which is made and is suitable for the field, there is some such system, then it is a shock, it is fun to watch cricket.  Equal to eating junk food, should not eat too much, profit and death is certain, if rotting is fun, I am the captain in life, if there is fun in life and value is added to that thing, it unites your life, corporate them.  Take it only for the elders and there is no fun, brother also follows him day and night, if you enjoyed this video then you can write, okay then set it at night, it should seem like before sleeping, today there is something new.  Learned something new, got a cricket match, Hey Hero's water, how many World Cups have come in Thana City-2, has India ever won and lost, it is important to remember all the history, Maharana Pratap 076 Haldighati 200 crores, pass the exam or do some other useful thing.  I would like to do some work, I know it on social media, I can learn something in presentation, I can improve communication skills, I would enjoy doing these things, I would know that  This is the work of a person with Guru Tattva, to pour it, how to do it, otherwise you have to open a simple hotspot like Disney, start someone's my channel, close all the settings, stop buying tea leaves, if you see tea in the house, then the mood will rise from within, then he felt it.  Will take one cup, make one cloth, someone never stops at one cup, then brother many will go to the office, brother in relation will take tea, play money, both of them feel bad, they Nikita, ok then drink cold drink Nicole Richie Nikita ok then you have drank more juice then juice concentrate comes with 100 edits packets of conference juices and school uniforms now on call you will not get its juice completely and will stop the product made in mixer mummy mix is ​​not fall press  I am wearing this kurta and belt, now I can't even make WhatsApp. If anyone goes and has my own brand, those ghagras are made of three or four things, are they mine or do you want to meet me for tea? Drink something, drink cold in it, say something, this is you also have to take open shot, what are you filling with? Be who is soft and your sent this is filled with what, the whole time is also okay with questions and in everything, which is anti-ship.

    "content": "Hello friends, the topic is just because of you respect, respect, love, respect and like respect, I left it after doing just that, in which the bus is ahead, the video is very late, the video is settled, it will liberate a lot, will give you happiness and it will help you both, you are this human being.  It can be the one on the left or you can be both, okay, it means that just because you love someone, respect and care about him/her, then Jan means date, you bill on other think of date.  Anything of date the day after tomorrow can be first, this attention has the power to play out in many ways, your nearest relative may have an issue like your help because women worry a lot, I will tell you in this video, many people, you can identify them in this way. I am giving creative in this. Many times you get attracted to some celebrity as if it was a fan picture of Shahrukh Khan, it is okay, maybe you are such a mother, you are very worried about your children and you are worried all the time.  You worry about them and you do n't get the feeling, you don't get respect and you are thinking that you don't know what you have done to them, for that the person has nothing to do with the fact that you are thinking so much about his elders and that is what you respect.  You say to someone, I respect you a lot, I like you a lot, then he will be liked by everyone, thank you very match, now give me a free consultation, this is his livelihood but you are respectful, he asked for respect from you, so everything he wants  To  If you are giving respect, then nobody minds but respect is not being reciprocated. Date is what time you try to say three by five. Emotions are fruitless. Everybody needs respect but it is not less than free respect. You understand what I am saying.  If you respect him then he must have given you something, that's why you are respecting him, he shared his knowledge with you for free, you liked his acting, you liked his behavior, you liked his conduct.  You felt that the only person you were meant to meet was the one you worried about him with all your heart, so brother, if that person is your son, daughter, relative or friend, then you worried about him because he gave you some kind of emotional happiness or support.  With that, the same transaction has become a band, now you will not get anything additional, here people are busy in taking something additional, you say that people say that I have studied a lot about periods with children, there can be parenting videos too, though.  I am giving this as a template for other places also because what happens at times is that at the workplace or at some place, we respect a scenery or someone a lot, then we even think that if I respect him, he will not scold me, he will leave me or I will stop him.  If I like you, he will do it to me like this, there is nothing in it, there is nothing in love and liking to anyone, you cannot take anything from him, I am not going to do this, do it a lot, like it a lot, my favorite actor is my favorite heroine.  This is my favorite cricketer, do all the work but do not expect because of what is that disappointment, Katua has come, you have come because these are strong motions, people are raising them like this, everyone is a boy, just imagine a girl, I love you, that means I am mine.  Love you, I like you, I respect you, the girl will become his girlfriend. What should I say? This happens many times. What happens is that the boy is crazy about the girl and in the movie it is shown that you are chasing her.  Is teaching, is teaching, is teaching, right bill, you like because of you, lover, so match, someone write something of yours here, write something in your hand, someone write yes, just writing here for you, liking someone, you don't get that much ownership power. His is that of the individual and his is that of her and tomorrow when many people will come to you who will tell you I love you and respect you, you do n't know what they will take from you, they genuinely respect you, like you, they do n't even know you, you will be completely defensive. when he comes  It happens and then that man talks like this, yes, let's show, then the stammering man says that he is very rude because you have emotions for him on one side, you have created such people and you think that he also does not appear like this, this is I have seen a pattern in my consultation, the thoughts shown in many people are the same, I can create so match of content affecting real people because I have worked on real time consultants and real time people and this is what is crying in it.  Feeling sad and seeing him like me the third day after tomorrow I wonder what kind of off course even a consultant is like this I am not judgmental but I understand where it is coming from him to the next guy I invested so much in him I fed him I gave him this  When I went to his city, he didn't even ask me if I fed him because you knew how to cook, you needed his company, you needed time, when you were in his city, he did n't have time, he didn't even have to cook.  He used to order it from C's, once he even fed you, but you complained that the dish he ordered was not cooked at home, brother, he does n't know it, he doesn't have time, once he even ordered it from outside, but like you, it was sweet.  The dish and that advice and that good cutlery and if you can't do that then what will you do, I too will not reduce it again. This was your strength madam, this is the strength that you know, now by doing this with the world your life will be very different.  had power out  Because atlist only this appraising date you did but we but only and right this not able you reciprocated some other way but you want de reciprocation you happen in de se way but example you more like respect me but you respected him like  You liked and respected him, he did n't like and respected you next to him but he gave you something else 20 Satisfied with this date Don't message him  Think date reciprocity, whatever you will get will be found exactly in this thing - You invited me for dinner, I invited you for dinner, then you made me roam like this, I made you roam like this, you gave it to me like this, I don't play you out like that.  Because in real life, this is a subject of pain for many people, so I thought that I should make this topic so that you guys may be in some party, this is happening to you or you are doing this. My request to all of you, whoever you are listening to till now, is to write your ID so that I can be assured that you identify with this video, the ID is correct on this short and did you find it helpful or did you enjoy it and tomorrow  You feel this knowledge, which seems very abstract, this knowledge, you used to do it earlier also, not that what I told has happened to you, but by giving words to something and making it a topic, you can serve it to the world.  Me especially date, bring the same thing of I am number one clarity guru, now off course make these things a topic of discussion, then you people can add on it in the comment area that yes this happens with us, I do it like this  Do I deal or is it seen this way, brother, I used to know that this existed but you liberated me by telling me like this that next time it will happen to me, I will not be fooled under pressure because many people get under pressure just for the sake of it.  Because someone likes me, respect me, give me time, then I am duty on you to give us your likes, respect and time, I am not getting any value addition, nothing is happening in life and you are doing all this because maybe you you you you  You are doing it only because I am getting something and I don't want it after 1 limit and this transaction is complete for us, I gave you feeling, gave you something which you enjoyed and that is the end.  I don't give anything more date, it has already happened, if you understand it like this then life becomes Jhingalala Shakti, we everyday write our life in notes and then say to ourselves, I do n't know what is happening nor  No, I don't get it because he likes me a lot, because sometimes what happens is that I am very big, I love you, respect you, you can just walk in and say, please do this for me, you do it like this.  Ca n't go you don't have you fool guilty you prepaid date think it some other way and if there is famine in him then he will be satisfied and if not and if he files an offense then it is his problem it is not yours because every time if you are so touchy  Will you become sensitive and that kind of person? No, no, to me, brother, time will go away from your life, you will not reach the story, this is the D message, I hope you people will like the video and will understand that behind this.  Genuine Purpose: You will not find this thing written in books, you will not find it in foreign books, you will find it in Indian books, these are the solutions to the problems that people are facing which I am observing, apply them in your life and please like this. Please do share this video, thank you very much."

    "title": "Why Youth Needs To Know This Thing About Their Parents ？ [mOhOVPX1owM].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, I want to give this clarity to the parents but I want to give it through the youth, so that's why I am posting this video on Clarity on Youth. The youth have to first watch the video, understand this thing, enjoy it, agree, like it and  Then brothers and sisters, you have to post it on your family groups, many people tell me that Guruji, if I post your videos, then they get angry, so many times you have to post it in such a way that look with hatred, what nonsense is this man saying, I don't believe his words.  I don't do it, but still people will listen and it will make a difference, so do n't panic so much, okay, you should definitely start sharing this video, there are two types of parents, two types of dialogue in everything, the old two types are addressing you.  Yes, brothers and sisters, if you are between 18 to 35 years of age, then I am addressing you. There are two kinds of parents. Tell me which one are you lucky to have? Which ones have come in your luck? One is the parents, these are in the majority and the other is the My first ones are in minority who always compare their kids  They keep doing this with other kids, what is the percentage of this majority? It may be 95%. No survey has ever been done. The government has not even taken a census till now. We don't even know how much population there is, but these parents always criticize  They do it to their children, I do n't know what is the reason, and many people do it publicly as well, one of them is to say it in front of the children and another one is to do it publicly in the park, through phone calls to relatives, my son is like this, my daughter is like this, oh this  So they do n't do anything, they don't say anything, they just do this and that and these parents enjoy getting sympathy from the society that our product turned out to be bad, yes it is amazononline.in delivery and father's should also be considered as your production factory So it is your own product, it is made from the genes of both of you, it is made from intelligence, it is made from values, so if it has been made, then do not reject them so quickly, this is the message because if you are doing this then  This is a message for you that whoever you call and tell this to in the society, Yes, I enjoy all these things a lot, it is fun, what we call in Haryana language, ghee gets dissolved, ghee from inside, ghee sugar, I enjoyed it, I used to think that your family is very great, I used to think that you are great.  I was jealous of you, do you have to say this about your daughter or this about your son, look, they gossip about their daughters-in-law, I will not go there, then my stomach gets upset, that too  It will keep going on, though you shouldn't do that either; that child is also a child of your house; whether it is your son in law or your daughter in law, he too is a child of your house; you shouldn't do that either, but friend, still you can do it that it belongs to someone else's production factory but here it belongs to you only it belongs to you only going to the park with relatives who are of a different kind parents this is very rare never make this mistake this is never wrong  Their children say, do this much, do this much, they will sing so much, my people had come, it did not happen, she calls a lot, no, she  He calls a lot, no, it is very good, they take it from them and these parents who are in majority, they also get very angry with them, they get very upset, these parents also are very sad but they never tell them, they always look for the positive  in your children and if your parents are of this category then you are a blessed child and majority of the people are like this, you are requested to show this video to your parents when you say something negative about your child, suppose he/she is not married  Or even if you are married, that thing spreads in the society, your merit list, your family has a merit list, there are relatives, in India we make merit lists everywhere, it makes a difference beyond that.  Business is affected, relationships are affected, there is also a brand image, today is the era of brands, every person has a brand in himself and that is very important, look at your children, tell a lot of lies, give a lot of false praise,  Sometimes it is not possible and I do not promote that either, but We can avoid criticizing, specially when it comes to your own thing. You don't criticize your maid so much, who is probably even more useless, whom you pay and she also doesn't work, because you will say that friend, why criticize her?  Which way will it be alright so why tell her then the same thing applies, the same thing applies for the kids also, there is a lady in your relatives, she is talking to her brother, sister-in-law, sister or  If anybody is doing this with anybody, with their friends, then telling them that my son or daughter is like this will improve your son or daughter or you are trying to shame them, it is possible that if those kids get to know about it  And they will become a hit, now they will say that you beat us in the society, you insulted us in the society, so now we are not going to do anything, this is a matter of great pain, I am the original social reformer of the society, you can call me a social observer, first you observe, then you  videos like this  Do you try to put original content on YouTube? Even if I have to say it twice, I am trying to put an emphasis and the children have to tell a parent that I am in a lot of pain, father, I am in a lot of pain, mother, I never go to such a place  I do n't say that you spent your youth in foolishness, I do n't know where you used to go to the boss to flattery, you used to waste time or you used to be busy with aunt, you were scared of your sister-in-law, you were scared of your mother-in-law, you never paid any attention to me and that  The Sharma aunty next door was so cute and nice, she used to take such good care of her kids, she used to make cakes, you did not have any skill, mummy ji, you just had to make rotis and half the time your vegetables were also like this You did not teach us any skill set, you did not know anything. The day the kids start talking in the same tone and tenor as the parents do, especially Indian parents, the parents will not know where to hide, but kids are very forgiving.  Yes, children actually feel pain, parents Look how much I am liberating in spreading pain, how much I am liberating by telling the truth to the society, the complaints are not resolved then the problem is that you got misbehaved, your body also suffered a lot but it was not your child's fault now  A child cannot come and make up for your lost time. There are many of us women. When I try to explain in such workshops, consultations or when I go physically somewhere and try to take lectures etc., many women say, what about us?  Guruji, you were crazy for doing all this, as per today's standards it can be said that you were crazy if you got this done because you did not have the courage and all the women were like this and the country was poor, now if someone says that 50-60 years ago  There is a grandmother who is now 80-90 years old and has passed away. If she were alive she would have probably been 120 years old. If she had come and told them that we were crazy that we used to go to get water when there was no tap, we used to go to get wood.  6 years ago this was seen in fair skin by all the people  Now after going to some village I got LPG cylinder etc. earlier even this was not there, so there are lots of people who suffered, females and males have suffered a lot, 100 years ago the country itself was a slave, which means they used to get whipped by the British, to be used to it.  This literally used to happen if people got flogged then what should we do now, what should this generation do, what should they do there, they will call them freedom fighters, they will give them something, they will do all that, they will give them respect but brother, no previous generation or next generation can go and change your life  One generation cannot settle the account of the atrocities of the previous generation and you are adding a new karma to this generation which is today's generation, the young generation, which is my subscriber of Clarity for Youth, by torturing this generation like this  Whatever harassment you might have faced here because of the legitimate or illegitimate country of the society, for any reason, these people cannot do anything and it is possible that you make these people like you and then this one  If the next generation does this to the next generation, then it will be the misfortune of the country. This needs to stop at some generation needs to realize that it does not work like this, constant complaints, constant complaints, it does not happen to us, do it, don't do it, don't do it.  Very clear that brother you live with us, these things are not right, if it is worse then tell us like in America, please, you are 22, 24, 25 years old, please go on your way, live wherever you want, this constant crying Keep them together, cry, control them, tell them, it has made everyone very confused and the youth also has this, brother, if you have self-esteem and some strength inside you, then do something of your own and show it, do n't cry for 24 hours because of your parents' crying  If your parents are crying then no one can cure their crying. If your parents don't like you or they feel disgusted with you, no guru in the world can cure this. It is in your hands.  is in  Either go away from them and start doing your own work, if you will live on their crumbs, grow up in their house, eat their bread, then after you turn 22, 24, 25, then this is what you will have to hear, brother, it is possible that these parents know  Do you do it after asking her or torture her so much that she leaves the house without any effort, that may happen but I still want to say this, there can be a civilised way of doing it, it can be said lovingly, she is your daughter, yours  He is a child and can be told lovingly. Never ever compare your child with anybody else's child because if he compares their parents with you then you will not understand. You will not understand where should we go now.  If you are facing any problem then please spread this message, do it with positivity in the comment section, Art of Decision Making, Pre Marital Consultation, these are my workshops, these are very good, people have seen them, they have benefited a lot, if you are a youth then please can take them  There is something equivalent to the cost of a lot of pizza  In many cases it is even less than that, so take it and improve your understanding because many people are unable to make decisions and because of that there is a feeling of being stuck in life, so please you can take the membership of the channel Or you will find the link in the workshop comment section, you can purchase it from there. Thank you very much."

    "title": "Why Youth Should Not Join New Age Start Ups ？ [13tMS8NMLQY].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, this is the topic for war on clarity that you should not join other new startups in future, many people are excited about the name of startup but from practicality, I am telling in my Indian contact that brother, all these startups are there in your startups.  Startups are running, you should avoid these startups. Region first is process, note is in place. You can get any role there, you will speak well there, why do you speak the same thing when in the interview too? I also have something to say. I got to sit in the panels, only then it was enough for me to feel inside, brother, there is no time here, brother, here you can do anything, it creates enthusiasm. If you are getting stocks and something is happening, then maybe it is a different matter.  And if you look at the biggest bad thing about startups, look at all the new ones listed now, the next ones are fine, you can look at any of these, take the example of Paytm, take the new ones and more 5 6 7 8 more  I can also tell 25 which may not be listed and are trying to do so. Sir, they earned money, made venture capital investment and got listed, made some business model late, kept giving equity, first round, second round, third round, four rounds, kept increasing the valuation.  The valuation kept increasing, the person who was buying time and gave all the stock shops to the retail investors or their program is going to be in this or that sector.  Look at the condition of those who say that their startup is fine and Raju Bhai, see what is the condition of those who are cashew nuts, that is, to earn a revenue of ₹ 2, they are incurring a loss of ₹ 1. Now what is there in that, the jobs will go away, then when the job is caste then it is very sad and when someone drunk comes out of a startup and comes to the market for a job, then brothers read him to adjust the money in a forced job, if you have Insta of yours.  to start a career  Please start from very various table, is it right or big group is ok, stable group, now you tell me, market cap also increased and what happened, everyone knows, okay friend, there are 25000 employees, did you remove even one, I am this  I would say that your Google and all these other big people who are also firing and wiring are going on in America. Do you know how big they are if they have a price in the stock market? 8-10-15% falls immediately, they start firing, Indian big companies do not fire, join, take any name, take note, date, I have taken some money from it, disclaimer, this is off course, want to praise some of them.  I am but I am Tata C i.e. Big Indian, this is think stability. In big, you will learn less from the process because tomorrow you may have to open your own startup. You do not have to join a startup to learn startup because that is  The Tukka system is running, there are ghosts of people and you can learn from them. You can learn from them which is a stable system. People think that the energy that is good in the startup will be very bad for the boy, girl, alcohol party.  Day and night, people are living in less flats, living in that colorful environment, money is noisy and the funding that is coming, there is a lot of money too, because if the money was coming from someone then it would have been shared like this, right?  how is your time going  But brother, he has no stickiness like you, no stability, no future, you, he has one more thing, people in India have always been fond of the name Rai Bahadur, Desh Bahadur, even before independence, nowadays people do not consider him a manager.  Executive Scenery Executive VP Vice President Falna Dham Hey, you can make a name for yourself, it's fine, it's fine, but in a big company, I am on Chuku Matko post and she is.  Someone is sending you a story by posing as the Region Head of MP. Your position is also changing. On hearing this, you get confused by the name Region Head or some such name. After that, you said that the children are stable, meaning the stability of the children's school is the stability of the wife.  All of that gets shaken, brother, he is well settled in his 30s and the initial bachelors are also these jerks, from here to there, only marriage gets delayed, sir, the rest of their program gets done daily because there is stability in the startup. No, if it comes out today, it means that if it works for a few days, if not till the evening, then this is the fate of the startup. If it works for a few days, then some one becomes a hit. Not a startup, but if 10,000 people come, then one goes to that level. You people know what happens to the rest.  So there is no process, I will say again and again, there is no stability, there is no peace and there is no savings in the brain snake's personal development. What I said was Brain Joshi Rijiju Energy in the brain but you are there.  Certain Other Task It is an example of when you eat food, when you break a morsel of food and put it in your mouth, then if you have this much capacity, then you should put only so much morsel in your mouth so that it can be chewed by turning it. If the capacity of your mouth is this much,  It is so big and if you put some lentils in your mouth, it will taste very good. There is no space to chew it. These are the games being played in startups. Let me look at such examples. Share what I understand.  That moment happens easily which an 11-12 year old child can understand, otherwise put these big terms, you and friends brother do not get it, where there will be processes, there will be a routine, in the routine your less bells will be defined like this.  No matter what anyone gives you, no one gives you anything less in a startup, no, you do this, you do this, this is your role, that is also your role, no, do it like this, there is excitement.  There is excitement but health is bad. Excitement is defined. That environment which I told you about is attracting many people. Boys, girls, late nights, parties, alcohol, flats, living in color and reducing it. And by doing this, they are running on half the money.  These are ridiculous models, why do I wait? Many people come to me for consultation. I have seen real business proposals. I have to understand them. And brother, they don't seem to work because they are the best. This is how Ajmashan will become.  They are so speculative that now this will happen, this will happen, every startup is burning money, all these people are sitting on your shark tank and all these people are so passionate, pick up some company, pick up some company, some profit should be ours.  So tell me, this company is not making any profit margin, half of them are buying goods from China, they are doing marketing, they have become brands themselves, some do not do manufacturing, some do not do anything, what do they say?  Our merchants are normal, our normal pop stars and small ones too, they are doing less, they have no glory, money, they are also working and they are in profit, this is the difference, they are the ones who bring the goods from China. They are here in the middle and are in profit because their frills do not bother them so much. In the sexy show they have shown, all that money is being wasted in sucking, they are not getting any profit in showing and all the youth.  These icons are sitting there, they will tell the world that you will go and pitch it, money on the pitch, hey brother, why should I give equity in your business, if it is going well, the one doing well should be like me now, if I have YouTube is also a business, why me?  I will give useless Google ads. If what I say is true then people used to line up in the Himalayas even in the caves to meet Guruji and Babaji. In olden times even today if they meet someone then they are ready to die there too. So if the content is strong.  I'm into your thing  So useless ad's IT just pea of ​​time date people bill discover your content bill speak if you make some good taste IT bill happen because whatever you are bringing external should be big paste its thinking bill capture de market and do  Aldos things and those are not sustainable cash become rate is so hi cash band karke kabhi koi dhandha nahi hai dhandha ka simple sa phool hota ki I have taken something from the story  Lee story is saved and in this I have earned a margin if the work I am doing is not in negative and the earning is not going on and I am being sold and I am thinking that what I have is only a wiki because it is going on the way.  Yes, that rate was the day, I thought that by then the market capture rate and earning would be something new. The future children, they understand that if they have to learn the business of entrepreneurship, then the old Marwaris and Sikhs should give their money to the old people.  Learn from Gujarat, there is business in the air of Gujarat, stay in Gujarat for some days, stay there for 15-20 days, you will understand, invest from the air, ok, this will be a long video but I just want you to get yourself a job today please. Don't start, there is no benefit, there is no learning, it seems like there is a lot of learning, no, this is what I am trying to tell you, this is the biggest contra advice, it seems because you think that I also have to start my own.  So this is also a startup, so I join the startup, I am not aware of Vansh, you are the next one to know, GST is corporate affairs, how are returns filed, what is logistics change, supply procurement, what is input, creation, how to take tax, where everything is established.  Something is established here, you will not be able to learn, you will be given role after role after role, you will keep reducing yourself and as soon as you are free, someone else will give you less.  Learning will not happen. Learning happens in a short pause. Even in a short space of time, you are learning. Because what I had told earlier was brain juice, I had told you about debt and energy. It is there in your startup.  No, you can't turn the morsel, your mouth is stuck there, it's a relief, it's stuck, it's a relief, date is the best think, all those who are attracted, go for campus placements, whichever company is like that, that's the risk.  She is taking you brother, today she is taking you, today it is good, you are getting it, so you go, you look for a bit as to what you want to go into, so don't be so desperate, let it not be the first choice to join the startup, let others  Startup should also be the story of the last choice. I did not get a stable place in a big company in a stable area. So, now I am telling the story. Earn something because it is possible to be a startup. You were given a salary for 10 months. Then you are on Jain.  First of all you jump, we will date this D message, wait a little, take a little left right, roam in a stable company and give you can do wonders if you are this one, this is this distance, you will be in constant stress, I am getting married. Many people have seen that they are getting married and the job got canceled two days ago. Now they will go and tell the bride about my Chhath. This happens because it is a raw company. This is what is called raw private jobs. Jobs used to be called government, they were called sure, now even in private, some are very raw and some do less, okay, those are very good, like egg sales, don't vote on those who date this message, please share like.  If you have some scenario of your own, then put your children and them in the group of youngsters etc. Have a perspective, what is the point in this for you people because well, what is the point in this that those who are running startups will listen to me, right?  So they will litter, that too has to be written because many people are also startups, you will not give time to our startup, this is a factor because look at the advice I have given to you that if you become an entrepreneur tomorrow then you will also get me to join. Yes, this is this, this is the oxymor, this is the selfishness, this is the contradiction, this is the tension, this is the factor. When you are an employee and your boss is extracting your juice, you do this thing. Detect and when you become a master yourself, entropy becomes lower under you, then you want to extract the juice from people, you also know the truth of life, what is good in it, what is there, will not put you in the trap of big, if you give butt  If you want to start your own business then you don't have to do that and all the entrepreneurs who are listening to me and who have a good system like this because there are many of them too, I know ITM guys who do this, I have my own personal phone.  If there are many people on the list, then they should not be considered big. This advice is fine. They should also create such a situation where there is stability and cash flow and do not expand too quickly, as in the rush of expansion, employee consolidation is not happening.  At the same time, this hiring and firing is happening and what is happening is that if someone is found, they will hire him for less, then it turns out that he either has no money for less or is not doing well, is not doing anything, then fire him.  Brother, their life is affected, my bed karma is your enclave, you are like this because in a well established company, there are verticals running there, the promoter is not doing anything every day, start something, turn it off, try it, fire it, do it, do it.  The processes are going on in stability for years, so there is that stability with entropy. If you are also a small entrepreneur, before hiring people because of your debt.  The selfishness of the young promoters is visible. Hey, if you don't take the tax then they will fire you. This is the salary for 3 months. This is the salary for 3 months. It will have an impact on his life. You are using the wrong word, there is one more word before it, he is making a mistake, you are right.  So he is saying that you should not do this to anyone and the rest of my audience who are youth on Clarity, I am teaching them that brother, these people do not have anything, nothing is going to happen here. Good company, join it, join a big company, take less work for two paise, you will be at peace and keep adding value in your life, thank you."

    "title": "Why Youth Should Not Watch Desh Ka Dhoni ？ ｜ @FlyingBeast320 [QvDFdHiN1Sc].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, I was getting questions, so to give clarity to the youth, this is a video. Flying Beast is a popular user. Gaurav Taneja is the name I think and now if you watch his videos, someone is doing his country 's sound and there is something else.  And he is riding a bicycle and has a mission, so people were asking for a lot of clarity on this because the way it is becoming, what is my take, what should you follow, these are the daily bloggers, this is a  There is something going on in their life and we get attached to their growth. Practically, there is no use in watching them because no value is being added to your life and it is just a matter of reason and conspiracy.  Mother-in-law is also sometimes very equivalent to that, yes, he reached the bicycle, what did he do, he got very scared, now he is struggling a lot with the bicycle, first of all, riding a bicycle is not a good thing.  The difficult thing is that it is being shown as if something is very great because people have not done it, okay, in this world Mount Everest is not known how many people have climbed it, those who have no legs, they have climbed it, they have climbed it without oxygen, they have climbed it many times.  Have climbed from China side to Nepal side. The world has done a lot and we still do n't need to be impressed. If I am climbing then I have climbed Mount Everest. I don't want to climb. What is happening in your Monday life? Who is adding value to you, with whom are you trying to associate, because these will take away the moments of your life, I do n't know whether Dhoni, who is a personality himself, will ever endorse this thing. What ever I know of Numol ji and Dhoni and personality.  Reading itself is a no nonsense person, that person of compulsion, the Dhoni of the country, there is no purpose, now show that thing on social media by yourself trolling that people are like this.  Will do and we will get back lash and hate is coming, we should not hate, first of all what is the biggest problem, brother some thing is coming, if the tea is not good then what should we say to that, it is wasted tea, I hate, don't make tea again, it is not your tea.  Drink it, just say this friend, sugar is less or leaves are less or milk is more, it is less and leave it, but what is that, self victimization is shown a lot, a creator, every buddy, smart, including politician.  Politicians will also say, now I have done it like this, they will come to do this to me, if this happens, it will be a little too much, then show him by doing it like this, see if it is happening, then come to save us, I have made a video before too, I hope you all did.  You must have seen that Ra and Sun and I together have put life on the line that brother, you should not be in the power of anyone, whose power are you in, who is retiring, why do you have to pay tribute, brother, so much, so much.  What is Evolve for? The world has gone away after doing 10 times bigger work than it should. I am not saying that dispay Dhoni and dispay Gaurav Taneja ji but why make a truth a big deal. Your life is going nowhere. Why can't you learn and watch a content which affects.  You directly, a man played cricket, earned money, no brother, earned a lot of fame, earned name, got good, I love, respect, okay, got it, not done, not beyond that. Why should he start talking so off like this? Although this is not my point of view but this is not the end. Why did he not ride a bicycle for the soldiers who are being martyred in the country? It is not a commercial exercise, don't you understand? Many people get sentimental about this.  Also, the soldier of the country is standing with a gun, taking 47 bullets, he is being martyred for the country, his package of 6.8 lakhs per year is fine in risk factor and the soldier who is making a picture, his thousand crore rupees is very much.  There is no injustice. There is no injustice. We have to understand that emotions are sold and earn money. The one who sells emotions earns money. The soldier who is standing with a gun is not able to sell emotions. He is standing there on a salary and there is money in his name. Earning can be done, we have to understand that and those earners are not there, no, give it to them, no, this is how it happens, we have to understand the capital structure, it is a game of emotions, only emotions are sold.  Let us go, we have to see what is being sold to us, what should we teach, what is the benefit to me, what is the benefit to me, some soldier gets martyred, all the media news channels reach out to us, oh, we are many, you are there, you are there, you are Pakistan.  Pakistan has done this, now they will not play matches, now the film stars will not go, these two days, four days, the day ended like this, then what did they do on sustainable basis, why did they not ride the bicycle, then the thing is that the bicycle is ridden where there are more fans and where there is social interaction.  Media will be found where  If the narrative is where money will be earned then it's extremely waste of time to follow true people I'm not doing late criticism, that's too good to let someone into your life, show your kids, show your family, which age is true, what ever little bit I do of you  No astrology and other things, we do n't want to make it too much on this channel, but this is not right, why enter for energy, why show your personal life so much.  Show these my children by doing like this, although the daily bloggers have done it like this because they connect because those who are loser type children who are not going anywhere in life, they say come on, something good is happening in their life, see this.  Do we take it or its struggle along with identification struggle? We know that we had great leaders, not just one but many of our great leaders, how did all of them show that they were with the poor, they were like this and that identification was done by all the people for their poor.  heard the story  There is a very top actor of India who says that he too was very poor. Father had contested the elections in 1952 and he had lost. That is a different matter. Will any poor man contest the MP elections? That too in 1952 on It's Not That Easy.  These facts are hidden for convenience and then later they are revealed to me because if I come and show myself to be very middle class or poor, I will Because everyone wants to hear a lot of stories. You tell me who you are. What is the story? Why is it necessary? If I have a good message to give it to you, you will listen. Listen to the message. Comment on the message. Argue about the message. Question the message.  They say don't shoot the messenger is an English proverb so the message Gaurav Nez is also giving is a venture.  They have their religion, they are doing very well in the content, the shooting that is done is voice editing, the entire team and excellent type of course, so many subscribers, so many views etc. will have to be given, they talk about production quality but bhaiya, does it do it?  Fall in to the domain of entertainment does it fall in essentially infotainment and entertainment and that value addition and education and something in that  You can get sucked into the true content in that. Don't watch someone else's life's struggles of resolve. Someone says this, you wo n't see it. You don't get any motivation from that motivation. Never follow anyone's life. Do n't get motivated by anyone. Don't say anything to anyone.  Look, how much time will you devote to listening to something useful, watching stocks, watching real estate, where are interest rates going, what is going to happen to politics, what will happen next in the stock market, what will be your job. What will be artificial intelligence? How to set your skills? How to control emotions? What is narcissism? What else happens in life? How do people improve relationships? How to improve body? How to improve mind. All this is beyond what you do and to yourself.  Deke sukoon mile janal jo sustainable ho where the video is about you this video when i am shooting and making is about you its not about me i  Don't talk about my self, in between I have more than just one line that brother, there is no one better than me, listen to me, I do n't speak anything, I only speak this much, I do n't even speak my name, I don't speak anything else, otherwise my content is about The audience has the content which talks about you for you of you and all these people have shown their apna apna ke saath bachcha ne ek woh jo spek ko joshi karke ladka hai woh ho gaya mere ko inse. You are irritated, brother, they are doing good, it should be like this, but my only problem is that if everyone has become like this, everyone has gone on this path, then you will say that my life is not going anywhere now.  Tell me what to do, you also become a flying beast, I tell me one thing, now the World Cup match is coming, okay, what stops you from cycling and what is the problem with its recording, no one will see you, why not?  Will see because you do n't even have a fan base. The world rides bicycles. There are people who ride bicycles 50 kilometers a day. Even today in India, they ride 50-60 kilometers a day. They go to work, come and do work and then come back.  They drive 2025 km and go, they drive 2025 km further but why is there delay, how can they sell? Sale can happen only when you make a base, your brother, get crores of subscribers. After subscribing, if you do anything then it will look great. What I am saying is cycling, anyone can do it, even a 12 year old or 15 year old child can do it. Put all the fuss, attach a camera and memory, do your cycling, what is so great.  Have you done it? Yes, I have done it but did not record it, then showing the proof is not a big thing. What is the need to show the proof? Show the proof of that thing which is great.  If you have climbed Mount Everest, then it is a big thing, so will you show me the certificate for it or have you done some other great work? 00 Great, by showing you my great work, by getting you a certificate and by calling myself great, what harm has it done to your life, believe me?  I have shown that I am very great, then we will respect you and you will respect me. What benefit will you get from it? I have earned respect, what is the benefit to you? If you understand, then never fall into this trap here.  We respect you a lot, we saw that content creator, we saw his time like this, we saw him wasting his time, please do not waste your time like this at all, this is a huge time wastage of life which this Gaurav Taneja ji is doing, Sara.  Content is a waste of time, avoid it, this is the message of course, his fans will feel bad, they may also feel bad, but this is okay, this is okay, then who should you look at, look at someone like me, you are just saying this to increase your views.  Is it selfish? Yes, this is what I am saying, they are riding a bicycle to increase their views. I am giving this counter narrative to increase my views. You awaken your consciousness and wisdom and decide who is speaking the right thing. You decide.  Everyone is doing it for themselves, I am also telling you the same thing, you just want your cheap publicity by taking the name of a big man, so no one would want cheap publicity, what should I do for one subscriber?  To gain, make a marketing budget of ₹ 5,000,000 crore, make it of 100 crore and then the picture will flop. Everyone will love what is so much in cheap publicity. Why are you being judgmental in love and why are you keeping so many emotions for me or  If someone speaks ill of me or I speak ill of anyone else, why are your emotions so awake? At the end of it, to any of your relatives, to you and anyone else.  If you are a subscriber, then you are not saying anything bad about him. You have so much love, so many emotions for your wife, for your children, for your parents, for your siblings. Keep that is the message. You have become a walking fan of anyone of the public because you feel like yourself.  You don't love and you don't have any people in your life to whom you can give those emotions. Now you are giving those emotions to the creators and our job as a creator is to extract your emotions and share them with you.  Stick to it, but only a person with Guru Tattva will come and tell you, brother, don't connect emotionally here, connect here on a practical matter, noted a good thing, will do it next time too, does it every time, you are fine, the day you won't do it, 1015 videos are done, someone  I am not able to understand the matter of work. Brother, don't you listen? Which is very good every time. I put pressure on me that in the video I am making, I am talking about work. For the next one, anyone can make me famous.  Look at my struggles, look at me like this, what a struggle it is and since when did struggles start becoming very good and rare in India. There is a struggle in every person's life. Here, go out on the road. Everyone is struggling to go from one place to another.  It's a struggle, it's a struggle. Stuck at the gate, somewhere at a railway crossing. It's a struggle to take out a car. It's a struggle to reach office. It's a struggle to reach school. It's a struggle to pass exams and go to a good college. It's a struggle to get a job after a good college. It's a struggle to get a job.  After marriage is a struggle, marriage is a complete struggle, having children is a struggle, raising children is a struggle, investment is a struggle, everything is a struggle, so since when did struggles become great in this country, why is anyone struggling in the UK, why there?  If you are doing it then you are doing it, what is the benefit to you, what is the benefit to you, you have to ask in everything, whenever you consume something, go anywhere, take any action, question your life, what is the benefit to me brother, if like this  If every person starts thinking then every person becomes selfish. Yes, if every person becomes selfish and he improves himself and takes care of his family and his extended family then our country will become a super power. This is the problem.  No one is selfish, no one does good for themselves, and no good is being done to some people, they just do good for themselves and go away like Tata Baba, and then when they grow up, you think, hey, look how much more.  To what level will the excitement go now, I will say, now I am feeling very excited after telling such a story, I am saying please like, subscribe, share but I will still do it because it is my religion, you got value added, you enjoyed it, if you liked it.  Do it, this is my dharma, this is my dharma, to engage you creatively, to benefit you and you grow me, but you have to see what you are getting in growth, any direct or indirect benefit of yours in my benefit.  Have a look at that then take a decision in everything in life no one will tell it so clearly and bluntly ok brothers and sisters please share it like subscribe thank you very much"

    "title": "Will MGTOW Movement Gain Momentum In India In Next 05 Years ？ [ETEtDdntC40].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, D Youth on popular topic, till now such a great video on topic, story would not have been made by Indian YouTubers, Mangatao Movement in India, Bill game in next five years, I will tell you in the main section of Makdao Movement in India, What is Maktao, okay, Regions, Cities, Gaming Popularity.  What's next, we will talk in a big way with a set mind and the best video will give clarity to the youth, it will give clarity to all the boys, all the girls have to watch it, parents. You guys have to spread this India's number one clarity giver is going to give clarity better than this brothers and sisters or children, if you ever get a clear cut on this, then listen carefully, those who are from Mecca, please first give Mecca and  It is okay to write it and if I ask for anything else then do it in the comment area, it is a request, it is okay, it should not be too much, at least keep it a little. Let's start speaking by erasing it and saying like Was it MIG-21 or MIG-29? So MIG wala MIG, MIG, you are NGT and W, so what is I going on? This is a movement that has come out, it is a faceless movement, it does not have such a leader, something is like that, there is no one.  But due to this growth of feminism which has taken place within the very strong West, this men's movement has emerged, a kind of men's movement.  Feminism can make all these sense, it is fine, so it is becoming popular in India too. Basically, what is the identification in this, that nowadays many people have to write on their DP, status on Facebook status, Instagram, boys, they say that we are tough boys.  Those who are from Mecca also heard, those who know about their life in Mecca also heard, those who are confused, those who are confused also heard and those who have no idea also heard because the phenomenon is yours.  It is in the face, it will definitely increase in 5 years and I will clarify it very clearly, I will not take it from the side, it is better to grow it, I am not a moral science teacher, I am a life of clarity, it is as if you wear glasses and things can be seen as they are.  Now, why are they the way they are? After that, what do you have to do, then you have to take the decision yourself with your conscious mind and wisdom. Okay, so what are some of their characteristics? This is the general role that they have.  The conventional role of the society is to get married, have children, reduce the time from morning to evening and this one does not make it green, it is said that this is our life and women, like the dialogue of many women was that mother is like fish in women need.  There is an attitude of some celebrities by doing the cycle like this, earlier Priyanka Chopra was also there that brother woman was doing this, now it is the reverse in this basically like they need women basic if you do it, however, people felt red moment. Blue Pal and that too keep practicing English a lot because if you people have seen it big then Gavran had come out with Blue Film and Matrix, then Blue Pal means that you will go into bliss with the ignorance of this world, you do not know what is the reality of this world and  If you take Red Pal then you will see the bitter truth of this world. Nowadays, it is also called Red Pal, most of the people also call it Red Pal Movement, nor am I telling this to other people who do not know this vocabulary and all this, young. Generation's Na, those red moments are blue moments and like bills are made by doing like this. So today I am going to tell everything to the red moments, I will watch more carefully while asking for all the red moments. Okay, Guruji is also telling something, okay.  And I am not telling you about moral science, I am not going to give you any old knowledge and you will become a moral science teacher here, whether it is good or not, I am going to tell you something, okay, so this popular generation is creating world war in India and also India. What specifically?  Gender is there, it has become too much, people are seeing that there is another movement that all girls are traitors, that one is also making a lot of ketchup that girls cheat, are selfish, are after money, will ruin, this is how they mean women.  There is dominance, okay how about this third divorce, you are seeing the cases of divorce, of the aluminum man of Alumni Oats Dhaba, so these are men in all the coats, okay now.  But if it is a matter of speaking garbage, caste content, content, you know what happens these days, but in general quotes, law, government, government, personal life, too much, too much trouble has entered the country, so they say that we should not play games, basically you are this  Will you decide? Okay, she will take everything, the child is also her property, everywhere and she will not even play games with me. It is okay because child rights are the default setting of the child.  Study Woman Sympathy Woman Everything Woman Meaning These days the proponents say that if a woman walking around in a big city says anything against a man, he did this to me, then she is not Sunny and if a man  If the court bill takes IT scores and procedures then everyone will shame him, it will become a political thing and living, their cases are getting flooded very much, so living are reading their cases when girls are unmarried.  If some are living with boys, then there is a big group of boys who is watching all this and that is, morality is over, women are all over because the cases are also increasing, so this is also there and the basic essence of this is  The way to increase is that man, mother, young mother especially, this is not happening in last 50 years, then it is happening among young people, they are like this, girls have become like this, the girl's point of approach is to her, the man is thinking that even his mind is mine.  Pat also  Meri Ada Mere Papa Ka Heads and Tails Head Jagan Tails Also I One And Agar Woh Mistake Coin Ada Kya Hota Hai Coin Aise Stand Jho Jaye What Is D Chess Of Coin Standing Like This I Toss But Desi Ki Agar Woh Aisa Bhi Ho Jaaye  This is father's and this is also mine, this is also mine, this means this is this, this is this, this is what it is, this is what I have perceived, this is because it is a flood, but I am going to tell you the real reasons, Guruji, because this is what I have just said.  If you tell me four-five-six, even Google will tell you. If Google tells me, then how will my reputation increase? Why will you say hello to me? Only Google will tell you. You are getting flooded by telling me only this thing. I told you five-six regions, but what is the real region?  What is the real region? What is that region? I tell you that the sex ratio is quite favorable for the girls born in the 90s in the sense that it is less. The data that is available is all that, it is practical data, very much that.  If it is different, then this is a reason, girls will have a choice. It is a game of quantity, isn't it? Brother, demand is also about supply. What is the second thing? The system of arranged marriage was a middleman system by doing business. Mani ji will tell that the boy.  Who is Ba ji? Who is the girl? Told the family friend and those marriages happened. According to caste, community, according to social status, according to acquaintance, according to job, wealth. So what used to happen in that is that if you are a boy, it is okay and you are from a good family and you are not very sexy in appearance and your personality is also not good, even if you look, you were married, which if you look at, it is 20-25 years.  Even before 15, 20, 25 years, the answers used to be there, dear, many people must have attended the weddings. What do you say, the married couples looked beautiful, Bibi, and if I tell you tomorrow, the elder will be the one with color, but I am like that.  I am six, Miss Must, tell me, it used to feel like a lottery has been opened for you, brother, you will see this type of thing a lot in old times, that someone's mass, I don't know which one is his, they have come out of the cuckoo mine and they have come out of the diamond mine.  Aunty has come out, that is, such relationships were visible and a big marriage was going on, right, that and she also felt a sense of achievement that yes and she was also relieved in the tension that yes, we are caste, we have bananas, we have money.  If you are famous then it is fine then what are the chances of you attracting a decent female partner in your decent? What have you thought in your mother that I want this above 60% and you yourself are sitting at 40 and are not getting that? There is a lot of frustration. That's a different story, these girls are either marrying someone else, going into a live-in relationship with someone else, or not marrying, or moving in with someone else, or they have four  There is no pulse, now they know that they can't get it, there is no power, there is no power, they can't have it, then they ask for it, and then they say it like our Acharya Prashant ji, say the name, why are you late, you have to tell the duty, you have to tell one hundred crore people to the Miss Guide, man.  He is doing this to the youth so I have nothing to worry about, I have to play a role in it, do the role, awaken the consciousness from within because no one has told me in India, I am a marital counselor and consultant and I do n't know anything else.  What do I do to reduce sexual dysfunction among young mothers? It is a big disease, happening and nobody addressing, because there is no other world of yours, then you go into conscious waking state, you tell your mother, neither to father, nor to brother, nor to friend, actually mine.  Program, something has gone wrong here, because of my childhood bed habits, because of my thinking, because of this, because of that, actually that's why I am going, it's those who irritate me so much.  The story among women is that 5-6 out of 10 people are boys, I feel like no one has been on service, but friend tell me, these are the heroines on Instagram, these are the girls who do those demonstrations, they wear less clothes.  Have million subscribers, are there girls and are they asking for it or are there any different boys who are these who are doing so much porn and bad things on these websites, if anyone sees the data, this much is being downloaded, who is doing this?  You are demanding that everyone is becoming a monk, everyone is becoming a saint, they are all going to reduce the consciousness of the world in a big way, what is the hypocrisy that in real life, after having a female sir, but in private life, they give vikam on the phone, very good.  It is creating a lot of hatred. You are understanding my point, this is a big thing. Next, what is one more reason? Earlier it used to be like this that even 20-25 years ago, when marriages took place, those who were born 40 years ago  It is for those people that you were born a boy, it was a big thing in India, it was money caste, did you become a boy and what to do, if we became a boy, then being a boy, lion, your market value was very high that you will get a girl, the girls will say Namaste.  In the future, you will definitely get it, that is, just because you are a boy, a little money after seeing the family's respect, now something like this is not happening, right now many things are being done, the system of arranged marriage has ended now, your father, mother, uncle, someone.  Middleman, friend, relative, do n't know how to bring a girl because there is no guarantee for anyone, so who is this idiot, she agreed that she brought the girl and tomorrow they will be saved and if there is a fight, then mom will also get upset, didn't you suggest that it came from your mike.  She was that great grandmother who must be living, Dr. Das etc., she will not let me live. Oh, she has ruined her own life, she was the same, that's why I came. It has gone a lot, I have seen it like One Up went on inside Haryana too. If the people of Haryana do something about marrying in your country, then these days the people of Haryana will not marry your girl, they will marry their own, that is, but there are many things, I will tell you too much, then people are a little worried that when the truth comes, then they will arrange marriage.  The system itself is collapsing because nobody wants you to take the responsibility inside ye.coms, and brother, there is insecurity in the marriage of jo.coms because of you, really the day after tomorrow, a lot of fraud is taking place, boys are also giving in it and  The girl is also giving her n-tankha, the girl is lying, the financial status is lying, the girl's family is telling 50 different types of lies and these cases are becoming very common, what is the whole marriage sir, nothing ever happens but it gets messed up.  There is one last region of Mecca which is in the rail region where there is insecurity of a mother, that man who is not only good in looks but also does not think that he will be able to attract any girl and if I do it then This one will not last with me because I don't deserve this feeling, it has also come to many people, it was not there before, like I used to be confident even if the boy was shapeless, that means he has no hair, his stomach is protruding on his head.  Its color is not equivalent to its popular color, its face is not equivalent to its features, its manners, its language, its way of speaking, its personality, even then there was such a blast in it, it was such a relief, that thing is gone, that society, the apple is gone and if it is gone then Well, now the youth is permanent, so now even the good boys in comparison to earlier are also very insecure about their ability to attract, because of this era of social media, everything is Instagram, have you seen these days, if you are any youngster. Look, everyone has kept the same beard, everyone seems to be relatives of Virat Kohli, it seems like Virat Kohli roams around with a beard, is n't this one different?  There is no personality, that means we can't tell which one is which, the face which is not visible, it takes 10 times more effort to maintain the beard than doing it daily, meaning if you do it daily then it does n't take any effort to get a cat like that.  So Bhai Saheb, I don't know at what level of maintenance, I will do it from here, I will do it from here too, but this one will have a beard, this one will be so short cut, this one will be like this, this one will be more like that, I am God, now those who do not maintain her like that.  You do n't know about them, everything is fed and everything is giving rise to security. I talk about change of mindset. I am going to tell you in a very good way. All the people of Mecca are as much as you are. Please Guruji, I just want something less.  After what doesn't happen, tell me, we will continue like this, we have made a clear cut, first I will tell you what lies are, how they are, some yes, are women taking advantage of the loss, some women, yes, what is going wrong with some boys, yes, no day  doing  I am not doing any day but please capture their number and base rate as I am telling you, the biggest thing is to listen carefully to all the government exams which are held in different statuses. You must have heard about every state, be it Haryana and Rajasthan.  Be it Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, it was Vyapam, question papers are leaked, governments are about jobs, I do n't know what would have happened had I applied for a government job, this note and point is not there, Monica, why are you ignorant?  This aspect is because they have you do it advised you bill not survive second thing you tell me how many builders are there who do not give houses developers how many people have lost their money you see in Greater Noida 38000 MBC is being built and everywhere in the world India  The third thing you will see is that it is written on the cigarette that smoking will cause cancer. The photo has been pasted on it well but the smoker smokes or not because of this, you ignore it.  What I am saying is that there is a mental something filter with everybody that you can actually suck you can ignore you can actually suck you can ignore if you want because look at the next example, the accident that happens to you on the roads, there are a lot of accidents, even in the newspaper, there is a train accident.  What has happened is so terrible, recently do people stop traveling by train and by car, then this is what will happen.  I told you less, not everyone can eat ready food, everyone knows it is dirty, dust is visible, Ram is making these laddus again and again in dirty oil and whatever other things you like, those are the things you get like mom and samosas.  And that means pakoras and all this is happening and those Golgappas are also covered with dirty hands, water and dust of the world, everyone knows that the hunger is going on, they will eat better, that is, it can be done, the tenant takes possession.  There are many tenants in the house, they always give money to the house, even the bachelors give Chadha, these people give you what is over India, despite the privilege, now that because how much is the bill, you give and do, farmers are suppressing pesticides and not putting it in India.  So many farmers are called Annadata. It is okay not to have the courage to speak against the farmers. Simply, the farmers have caste and they are using them for the dirty taps of Najafgarh.  There are also vegetables etc. Tell me, go to Delhi and see, go and see in which water they grow. Once you see, people are worried about everything, so you are doing this, it is causing a lot of trouble here. Insidiously, compare all these things, if thousands of vegetables, thousands of this tenant, thousands of accidents, thousands of exams, then check those details from them and check here also.  The reason is that in all these things you feel that there is a difference between a boy and a girl, boys have given up mentally, I am sad, sexual dysfunction issues are something you should talk about and address and this is a subject of so much pain.  You can also become a psychopath, your movie will be good, a psychopath can even become a killer, if this thing is not addressed, I am telling you how extreme it is, but how extreme it is, it is zero. Late on body to 10 and if it is on the scale of two-three-four-five in someone's life then it is depression here, teasing from girls, these kind of reactions, I want to tell you one more thing, apart from being a woman all day long.  There is nothing to talk against, they hate women, they will write everywhere on Twitter, everywhere in the comments on YouTube, they will read the same articles on WhatsApp that a normal man in a normal relationship with a woman who has a  She is a normal wife, she lets the girl take it off, she used to fight that she is a mother, a daughter, a sister and a normal wife is in a healthy relationship in a normal relationship, he does not even talk to the woman, what about the woman for 24 hours, what to do about the woman, what is this something like a date. Hit rate: If the religion that you see is not hot, you know that they will talk about it 24 hours a day, the man who will keep it boiling like tea.  It is secured, it is okay, he knows, yes, there is something wrong, but I cannot talk about it in 24 hours, nor can I think about it, I have to reduce the rest too, so this is an issue, when I ask you to take a moment to do this.  Now you have to do this thing and you have to always tell that women are bad, bad, bad. Some solution to this is if you see that no matter what you are, can you attract a good female who is good in your definition? That definition is quite strict, Shakti is that definition based on your mother, Shakti is like your mother, there are no girls like her mother, she endured atrocities like her mother, doing too much physical work in the family is also an atrocities in itself, we glorify it, mother.  You are torturing me by eating food from my wife's hands. Mother, I have become wise. I will eat from your hands. I don't have the courage to get my wife's food made. Now she doesn't get it like this. So join Makkah and I and you will eat from your mother.  Why can't you mix it? Who said that only the food made by your mother will be good? The food made by you cannot be good. The tea made by you is not good. These are the ways to reduce power from people. If you can have a society then you can attract people.  I am subscribed to the info group and will do ISP workshops in the comment area. Those who are losers, who have stamped their place, made corn on their foreheads and painted women for their whole life, then you are  They will not join you, it is not necessary that they will join you, but those children of IF I Baati, who do not have friends, no Guruji, tell me something, no, no, because why am I telling you, when not many people will talk about marriage, first of all, 20-30 years, 40 years, 50 years.  Getting married is not a great deal, getting married is also not a great deal, because having more children is happening because these were happening. Photos of great but no it bill start people are not getting married.  The marriage of 50 more people is not going well and 25 people are unhappy in their marriage. Those 10-15 people whose marriage is going well and are married and have a child, then their sense of achievement is very high.  IT BILL WILL BE HIGHER AND IT BILL GIVE MORE SATISFACTION ACHIEVING OTHER STATUS AND CORPORATE POSITION AND RICHING OTHER POSITION IN LIFE BECAUSE YOU AFTER 20 YEARS IF  A man can say, I am married, my marriage is going well, my wife loves me decently, that is why it is going well, we have two children, 10% of the people who eat this will remain in the middle class, only 10-15% are in the middle class.  Will go because either there will be marriages or there will be no marriages, then there will be no marriages, if there will be no marriages, then there will be no children, if there will be no children, then there will be no beds, then they will not walk, then two will not do, one will do, the one doing one will also say, I will not do, these misconceptions are 80%.  It will happen that those 20% of the people who have become normal will dance like this, you know me, marry this oil live, this will become a big thing. Today, those who are in the age of 4056, their marriages are going on, so there is no sense of achievement. Ronali is that he did this, this is yours, you are like this, here you are women, yours is like this, yours is like this, your husband is also very tortured, the son has seen that in the marriage, you  Who too is not happy, he got a black mother, he will also join, and the girl who sees that her mother never got happiness, she will also remain, I don't want to stay in the bond of marriage, the previous generation did it and someone came to India.  He is not coming and talking like me that give it an effort, you have to work hard because it is worth the effort, just as you work hard, you get promotion at your job and you feel relieved, you have to grow a lot, you feel a sense of achievement or  By preparing for IIT/IIM exam, you get sensor achievement. By clearing UPSC, you get achievement. By doing some bands, you get achievement. In this way, even by getting married, people will get achievement because not marrying is the easy way out. By getting married, fulfilling it is adjusting and adjusting both.  I am speaking for, not only for boys, but also for girls, achievement and brother-in-law are very good girls, there is always relief at 10-20%, your rice is whole and there is a black one in it.  Even if there is a pimple, it will not be noticed. If this shirt was supposed to be white and if one day its mark would appear on the white shirt, then it would be so small that such a big white shirt would not be noticed. This is human nature. This is how many boys would get noticed.  And it suits them, everything suits them consciously because their mind says Bhai Humse Na Ho Pe Munna Sir and someone else will take it, she will run away and go away, who put this in your mind, why are you not confident in yourself? This much  Why would you leave the flowers and run away? Your face is not beautiful. You can take a good haircut, you can maintain good physical hygiene, you can apply fragrance, you can keep the fragrance by brushing your mouth, you can improve your speech, you can improve your thoughts.  You can do better than this, many women get attracted. Women are not just superficial, it is only your six pack that is attracting you. If you were getting attracted by your six pack, then all these people who break iron in the gym are with them.  The IT I reduce by wearing glasses is not there, they do not get married, then there is the problem in real life, so before being tough in life, boys will have to do some self-examination before abusing women. I conduct workshops on this.  I will do the workshop which is not a loser, it is okay and the Qatar which is not Maktao, I ask that people should not be called losers, do not step back here, losers have spoken differently, Mecca has spoken differently, I ask for a thought process. Because of your circumstances, because of your exposure, you became demanding because you did not find any woman in your ecosystem who could give you coolness, in your relative friend circle, maybe your friend circle was such where friends  If your wife has done this or you are dating someone you know, then you have just considered her as the sample size, you have considered her as the world, then it would be wrong to think that when you will have to increase the sample size and  That horizon has to be expanded and when I tell you what in Wagner and what I tell you in the workshop I Bill Do It on D in Only Because in Going There on Way then I will do between 18 to 30 years old 30 18 to 35 Whatever This is my bill to give practical advice where as they say, the jeweler is the real one, he does not have any tension whether the diamond is a separate real diamond or not.  And we can't know whether it is fake or not. Diamond's transparency is this, it is brittle, its hardness is this, its color is this, the price of diamond is based on what we call carats and parrots, so I have been in Surat a lot there too.  If there is a diamond industry, it has a pattern. I follow it with great interest and have learned it very well. I can only speak loudly to myself. Diamonds do not survive but I value them. I get to know the importance of diamonds. According to its value, its tax parameters are big, I will tell you that thing because when you do not know how to see a diamond, you are not a jeweler, you are always afraid that something will be stuck to me, someone is wrong, but once you know this diamond.  Is the diamond real or fake and what is the level of real diamond? They have to be written in IQ. You will know that yes, it is fine. Whatever diamond is bought is fine, it is also cut according to transparency and it is cut according to weight. According to the color, according to the looks, the price of diamond is decided by that, then I will teach you the procedure to attract girls in big ways, butter yourself because when you increase your value, then later I will teach you that procedure.  That I bill do this in the month of July One side cross subscribe Just request to you guys Can you add two or three subscribers This video also 10-12000 people  So see, I am Sir, we can see this much, even 20000 people can see it, so if only one of you has subscribed, then even after doing well and good advice, if two people subscribe, then it will touch you lakhs like brother.  If I do this, then get it done, who is going to give so much clarity in it, take 2 hours of date, I will forcefully improve each and every thing about you, I will remove all the bitterness, I will remove all the pain.  I demand, I demand, what is Maktao, it is not just a bitters and a pain, Rakhi is kept for where, friend, the moment is going on like this for the losers, now I have called you a loser, no problem, it is okay, so don't be negative because ultimately you are bill and up speaking.  And thinking about female only, she is not taking you, not giving you happiness, if you are getting happiness then it is necessary to talk, woman is bad, leave it, it is necessary to talk through mouth, who knows? Girls are following girls, tell me this much brother, society, discuss, why is this hypocrisy maintained that here the girls are of good caste, if I look quietly like this then Gandhi and Gandhi look like this and look like this, you look with the eyes of hatred.  You look at this with hatred even when you see it here, tell me in private, no one will come to your face and ask so much, don't tell me, don't take it while asking, if you don't even look at women then where a woman is cooking, don't show any emotion. Don't go where there is a woman bus, don't talk to anyone of yours, don't end all relations, do n't even talk, we have nothing to do, now I got it right, but brother-in-law, I will call it a last decade, note and decide. Give more in this decade, then everything starts late, okay, I am telling him, do it with the child too, you will do whatever you give birth to so late because you are 15 years old, that same movement also came out in 60 of this.  You must have seen the movies Andar Dum Maaro Dum, they will end, some of them will come to the normal stream and those who will stay there will remain the same, they will not go and live their life because as you know in the sixties neither it had happened nor it had started. Gone will be popular so much, this is also a factory, whatever data is there for 5 years, whatever will happen in 5 years, children born in 2005 will come in the marriage market in 2030, there will be gender five, six plus a little after eight.  When it will start getting better then the little tantrums that remain of the girls because it is a choice because there are missing girls, those missing girls will reduce, so that choice factor will not be there because then it will become equal, so after 2330 this things are getting better but before.  Getting butter witch it like fight tu seven years from no de bill get butter initially just today i have discussed but it will pick it will grow it will grow  And your child should not get entangled in this, you have to take knowledge, you can tell the child if the parents are watching that brother, listen, attend the workshop, your mind will be a little healthy, you will look at a relationship with an opposite gender with a normal eye, I will make it very healthy.  I am not saying to respect and look at you well, normalize what is normal, what happens in normal, some have bad feelings, some have come good, some have come doubtful and they are normal people.  It is good by force, good cannot be seen everywhere. If it is not good everywhere then do not find bad by force everywhere. Date is D message please share this very important video very important video I hope you share it with maximum people many in society.  Many times I have to request you very loudly to share this one so that it gives clarity to you people and I have shared it with you. Explain the examples. Giving exam after getting the exam paper leaked. Sitting in the train in case of an accident. It is OK to have an accident. Smoking cigarette even after having the chances of getting cancer. If you are doing it everywhere then what problem will there be here? I demand this, why aren't you people making a movement to quit smoking? Why aren't you people making a movement to reduce wrongs?"

    "title": "Young Indian Men , Relationships And New Laws [VuvANmRgrbo].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, this is a very important video for the youth, especially the young men, okay, such a devilish smile comes on your face, I have always been a channel, if you are a content creator, you must have seen I am a family man, marriage, this is everyone's chak more. Whenever I used to make such videos, I always talk about family serial type and sometimes happiness and sometimes sorrow type, so below I will say a lot of very youth only. Because the line that I am about to say is very old but was written and by linking to it I will tell you, Hey Guru ji, why to marry, when milk is available in the market, do you keep buffaloes, it is a very common thing, I do not endorse it as a.  By doing that, I am telling you that people used to speak like this, so brothers and sisters, our new Indian Code has come, the law has come, okay, I am not a lawyer, nor an expert in law, nor am I the one to flaunt my expertise here.  Okay, but I am going to say this to all the young men out there, read section 69 carefully. You are okay, so those who were going into living in relationships are living or are thinking of being in this kind of relationship because it is okay.  No, this is not happening in India, as per the present times, this new law has come, under this, if intention to marry has been stated and claimed by your partner, then it can land you.  In trouble since it is your life since it is your decision please start googling ok I am not coming here to spread such fear ok and as it is true I said I am not a qualified lawyer because here when the lawyer's mind is curdled  So why should I come and become Guruji above them, okay why should I become but many people are saying that this is the law and I will get experts also on my channel if you  People Are Interested in Full Clarity If You Want Me to Actually Read All This Make Notes This is not the whole thing, these are the changes, this is what I have, this is what I have, these are the changes, these are so many changes, you have to read all these notes  We have to make it, okay, so I am not going to give it just cooked like this, okay, I am also studying, making notes, this has come recently, but there is one thing, brothers and sisters, two in life.  This is the only way we get sex and I want to tell it to my young boys, it is okay to make your hands yellow, that is marriage or it is okay to blacken your face, there is a lot of risk in the second one, so please be careful, don't be so casual now.  Everything is written in it because in the language of law, start reading that a promotion was promised, a marriage was promised, some inducement was done, some fact was hidden, something was done like this, now it is.  It is very difficult to prove that this was not the case or if it was there, then there is a provision of 10 years of punishment, so brother, you will have to be a little careful, but those who were on the path of wisdom, discretion and consciousness, then what is the right thing to say about section 498 now, which section should it be?  Has it gone? Is it 86? Is it 87? Start reading. Whom it affects? Nothing will happen just by being afraid. There is power in knowledge only. How do you go about it please if.  You have a lawyer friend, it's okay, start this, this is high time, there has been a change in some countries, so you should know, otherwise, Suti Paisi, I did n't even know, I didn't even know, a lot of people are saying that now on social  There are experts on media and where we also discuss. I would also like to get an expert if the audience wants. If you want on this thing then there are lot of NGOs and I am in touch.  With this thing, voice against men and women and that too, whatever names remain different, okay, so voice for men, I forgot, I think the exact word is okay, so it is important to know the law, it is important to know the law.  You do something after it happens, that's okay, it's like everybody has to stop, every buddy knows, that's okay, so in the same way you should know, now if you jump on the raid, you should know that  This is coming at a great risk, the risk of having an accident and the risk of being issued a challan, so the rider is responsible for his own luggage. It is written in many places, so there is a bit of I will not say moral policing, but it has been done in such a way that the incentives are reduced. I don't know if living in relationships will come to an end overnight, but as if that UCC had come to Uttarakhand, it is a bit okay, it created a stir.  Okay, then now this is coming, a little is coming, so now it will be a little like this, where to go, where to go, meaning the path is there, then where is the color of the shirt I am wearing, okay, the program will be done with this color brother, okay one  In a way if you look at it then you can be a happy man if you become a moral science teacher but if you go by modern times then it is a topic of discussion then I am I may like something but I still stand up for individual freedom and right also  that This is my personal take. Okay, so I am satisfied that something is happening according to my idea and the attention is going there, but then I always say that building up the consensus and taking it after doing that is always a better way than you know. This is still happening by interpretation experts but it affects your life. Brothers and sisters, all you youngsters are in your early 20s.  Those who have not married at the age of 30, what can happen, please read and clarify the provisions under this and if you feel that no, this is not right, then you have to raise your voice. Britishers also used to bring laws, so they like it.  Had it not been so, Indians would have raised their voice even at the time when they were not free. Now we are free. Now we have democracy. Be it brother. Now there is no punishment for raising your voice.  There will be sticks and whipping because at that time when the voice was raised, where is the voice raised these days? It is not that I will pursue my personal agenda or will do something based on personal liking because that becomes the correct thing.  An approach for a good mentor is to show both the paths, even if he says, this is my favourite, I like it, but there is also this path, this path has these advantages, this path has these  These can be disadvantages. Benefits If you are feeling them then they can be but they are temporary benefits. For long term I think this is a better thing and this is how it is okay but yet I feel individual in present times individual rights.  And I think that freedom is something higher than a gender, yes gender should also get rights and protection but individual rights are also there and in this I want that  Women themselves came out and came up with something that they should feel that yes man, this is okay, nothing too much is okay and this can be misused because maybe their voice should be heard more according to men, if they see this then they will say ok you.  So you always need the exit route. Everywhere, it is a very tricky thing. According to me, there is a need to study a lot on this. You guys, whoever has knowledge on this can comment on it, brothers and sisters.  Better knowledge please write exactly let this comment section be flooded with and especially many of you are lawyers too so please write and that is one of our crowd sourcing of wisdom information knowledge will become and knowledge because many of you Now don't start writing in this opinion, what is good and what is bad, what is there but exactly what is there exactly and according to what and  How meaning can harm you, just what it is, giving logical justification to it, dismissing something in one line or calling it great is a lower order thinking, my channel is based on higher order thinking, so I would like brothers and sisters, as many of you as possible  I am also a subscriber, please contribute, add me to your circle, if you have any bright intelligent boy or girl or someone who would want to know, do good research on it because  It also talks about marriage. Got married by making false promises in marriage. Hiding identity. Talks about interfaith marriages. It's a long thing. It's not just about living in living in. It was part one. It talks about marriage. Sex And 69 Is What I Think You Should Be Reading Now The New One Is And Talking About It Please Share With Every Buddy  Thank you very much"

    "title": "Youth And Oonchi Oonchi Baatein [W4PvptLekfw].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today's topic is youth and high things, why do I have to make this video because a trigger happened, I saw a video, someone sent me a very popular user like this, he also wears glasses and talks like this, is it okay?  Will there be youth with them, 18, 19 and 20 year old children? I don't even call them youth, I call them children only. Okay, so I got to hear big things from them. What I heard in the last video were the things about success.  What is it inside the foreign countries, inside the developed countries or in the US, is it all about money, is it all the same, is it like this, is this what happens and they are listening, no, I am watching, children are listening.  And they are getting motivated like this, they are getting inspired for what is happening, they will discuss but what I want to tell I am the only one giving clarity for the youth and I am saying that my channel is actually  It is required, I wish it would reach crores, all this nonsense, the youth should not talk or listen to such high things, nor do they have the right, and I will tell you what to do, but first I will tell you all these things, which may sound a bit loud.  Let me speak a little calmly, all these things are not taking you anywhere, they are not taking you anywhere, the users themselves are like what they do, they have attracted all this because these things are opposite to father and mother.  We do this, father and mother will say, do something, become something, go out, do something, and then what should we do, we have to do something like this, I am having such thoughts, I am under a lot of pressure, this is a very good generation, is n't it?  This mimosa generation has got these people who care about people, they are not like us, the fathers who show tongs are fine, so they just reach out to them and the parents do not even have the language to talk to them. All the children are sitting with their heads held on these YouTube channels, whether they are on their phones, whether they are physically going or listening all the time and it is visible that if you are roaming around with 3 crore followers, then brother that means 3 crores.  People are attracted, but it is a different matter that when they turn 26, 27, 28 years old, their attachment gets disillusioned, they realize that your talk was nonsense, then it is seen that your 3 After getting close to 10 million subscribers, the views don't reach even 3 lakhs, but those fresh chickens come, subscribe, follow, after two-four years they don't reach anywhere and leave. All the people like me do n't leave, listen.  We are understanding, we are getting benefit and this is what I want to tell you that you have no right to talk about any spirituality, otherwise, if we do n't know, then we don't know, yes, no, I myself have been doing this for 25 years.  I am telling you the record below, I have also told you in my webinars, today I am telling you here too that anyone below 25 years of age asks me any question, 99 but I don't even talk to him, I ask only one question, you 12 14  Do you work for hours? No, I don't want to talk. Don't talk to someone whose car is not running. There is no benefit in helping someone who is stuck. No one can move him forward. This is the youth who is between 18 to 25 years.  Talk, I am sitting like this, you tell us why should we do this, you explain to us, answer this thing, we will learn a little something from here, I sow a little knowledge, I say shopper's knowledge, I will give it to you and come and test people like us, you are good Guruji.  He understands, tell me who am I, who are you? I said yes, I understand, I understand where you came from, I am okay, then you say, okay, you are this but this is your name, okay this is this, this is yours.  Gender is this, this is your profession, but who are you, then I am a soul, I am this, you are not made for this work, work for 14 hours, set up your own food, clothes, house, then you have the right to this kind of thing.  You have not even crossed the syllabus to discuss things. You cannot do these things about differential integration in seventh class. You have not studied Newton's laws yet, but you can do all the above things.  What ca n't you do? You didn't do a job, you didn't earn money, you did n't go out in the sun, you didn't struggle, but you have to be intellectual because it is philosophical, because these are activities, there are things in them that I don't want to use the word, but do that, you are fine because.  These are the things that are said to the youngsters, so what are the parents to do here if your children are like this, parents, if you see it becomes like America that 18 year old Tom Peter Mary please go out stew lone.  Do whatever you want to do by Tata is fine, but that is the habit of Indian parents, it means taking care of children till old age and then making them serve you through life and all these are our values, these are very strong values, right? People have to realize the youth have to realize that the old Indian success and India is old, they are telling only half knowledge, oh man, how was the work done earlier, Kumar was made in the old system.  The child was a potter, the goldsmith was a goldsmith, all of them were engaged in their own system, the child was a weaver and he started working from the age of 15 16 14 15 and then he used to work in the agricultural field, so the youth was Working or this is what has happened now, father is a government servant, a teacher or is in a corporate job, so the child cannot do anything. What will the child do in 16 years, will he become what the father is?  He will become a typist, shorthand or something like this, he cannot become an assistant, father, he has the luxury, earlier there was no luxury, the children in the family used to learn, they used to work, they kept learning while doing it, it was late 21 22 23 24  The 25 year old youth was not talking like this, there is great taste in this, don't go to college, there should be discussion, there should be thinking, there should be revolution, there should be revolution. Then what revolution is the youth bringing? A person who cannot change his bedsheet, cannot clean the bathroom, has his mother wash his underwear and vest, is dependent on eating food cooked by his mother, can never prepare tea for his mother and give it to her.  It will bring a revolution. People do not wash their underwear and vests. People wash their underwear in such a way that the skin gets cut. Now I have to tell you that as an example, soap does not come out of them.  Their thighs should be cut, their waistcoat should be cut like this, this is the condition of boys and girls too, this is a bad condition and this means that before changing the world, change your room, change your bedsheet once, keep your books properly and this Idle talking eight eight 10 10 12 hours, stop taking knowledge, start working and all the adults are fine adults i.e. above 25, working parents, elder brothers, elder sisters or I am also requesting the influencers to please stop giving knowledge to 18 to 24 year olds. Friends, 18 to 24 year old people don't deserve any knowledge. Give them the work they deserve. I will tell you what to do now. Now you people are listening too. I am in this age group that brother, go out of the house for 12 hours, do some work in the real world, talk to real people, do networking, you will figure out that in small towns there is so much.  That book like Bavi Fell has been annihilated, now after seeing the picture, more books will be published, because what is there in the preparation, in the preparation, Papa will feed you, Mummy will make you drink tea, Papa is doing all the jobs, Mummy is taking care of everyone.  She is keeping it and the child is just sitting, getting motivated half the time and what is he doing in it. When he gets tired of being motivated, at 111 o'clock in the night, his consciousness, intellect and conscience remain awake till 1.30 in the morning. Then he sleeps late, then he wakes up late, Satya has been destroyed, there is nothing actually to do in a small town, you cannot do anything except preparing for the competition, there is no opportunity for work, till then your father is busy in work.  If your father is a businessman, then it is okay, he went to the shop, sat in the street, did business, did something else, what is the other way in the big cities, who is the athlete?  Which is my core audience, mostly I am a person from big cities, okay I am not like that from small cities but if you want to learn by connecting then it is a different matter because no person can create content for all the genres.  Have to throw them out of the house, do whatever you want, come and work for free, go and do anything for anyone, this competition is not going to be like any magic, till 12th you have learned all that you have to learn, writing, reading, communication, be it BA, B.Sc or B.Tech.  Engineers are not teaching you, they are becoming stand up comedians, no engineers are doing engineering work, no one else is coming out, every person is asking others, whenever someone comes to me and asks, what should I, a 23 year old, do?  Go and ask your teacher in the school where you studied for 12 or 15 years. Ask the college students who used to show tuition and teach. Ask them like us, now tell me what should you do. If anyone ever asks what should I do, he is the biggest loser.  Don't give him any guide, tell him one thing, he will not understand, then he will not enjoy what he enjoys, he will not be able to sustain it and who needs to tell everyone that earning money is never fun and learning is fun.  Stop doing this, you Qatari Kaif, Ranveer Kapoor, Alia Bhati, all these, what do you like about their works, they are fun, there is a lot of money, animal picture is gone, 900 crores are gone, all the pictures are gone, you must have seen it is still released, earlier released  Pathan Shahrukh Khan, it is so much fun to see those who do this work, no no, they are very passionate about it, they are just discipline, they know fear, money and if they want to sustain this lifestyle, then they have to do it, the fun doesn't stop even there.  It's not fun to give 15 retakes to one shot. I know that. I, I, I do these. I make my own videos. I don't give any retakes or do any editing. I know that if I had to, I wouldn't have made anything.  I will get it and I will give it in one shot, it has 25 shots, one scene, one dance, one step, you don't know what happens, there will be no fun, don't talk big, do n't go after big things, don't ask big questions.  A person genuinely wants to go or reach somewhere, like my best consultation is, I have seen the life of people between 35 to 45 and people between 35 to 50, I have seen the struggles, a good coach can help there.  There should be a bowling coach, someone who runs away, you can't reach someone like this, I do n't know how to bowl, teach me bowling, there is no one who can teach me from zero, why would anyone teach you, you should have a natural inclination towards that thing that I bowled so much.  It bowls at good speed, accuracy, you tell me what action should I change, how should I change the run up and how should I improve or you will go straight and ask me, should I bowl?  Or should I bat or should I throw javelin Nobody will even look at you This is the hard reality What I want to tell the youth Maximum youth This is what is going on I am telling you by taking the example of sports parlors Why would anyone tell you?  Let me take the example of a live webinar and tell you how to interact with the youth because of this 20 18 20  Sir of 22 people, I want to do law, yes, do it very well, but sir, it is costing a lot of money, and my father is not that rich, okay, don't do it, but father is saying that he will manage the money.  If you do it then I said ok then do it then father is allowing me then should I do it again but then how will it happen further, this friend from where do you want the shot, who will give it, why will he give you any confirmation for anything that you do?  need everything Who will give it? Why would anyone give it to you? Anyone who is giving you a course, giving you knowledge, conducting workshops, making you do something, that is for people who are performers, you did not become an actor by worshiping someone who has zero acting skills. There needs to be a basic intention that I want to become an actor, then I go to someone, then I learn from him, then I knew so much of something, I learned so much of the story, multiply zero by anything, zero remains but you.  If it is above zero then you can reach somewhere. If there is no current coming anywhere, then how much amplifier should you put in it? Put some, the current will not come, but yes, if there is some voltage coming somewhere then it can be increased and mostly.  Youth, especially youngsters between the ages of 18 and 25, go to their parents, they go to their parents, their parents say something, they don't find it convincing, someone else says it, they don't find it convincing, then this All the dreamers come, do SIP, do it like this, become a millionaire, become like this, become like that, you watch all this content and then those motivational people come, they go after the motivational people and talk big. What is your right to talk big, tell me, you have not earned anything, you have not published anything. You have come to America by naming America as useless, now India has become good, then ok, America is bad, the western world is bad, their values ​​are bad, we are great.  best nation  It is the best, then what happened in your life, then now you have heard this, accept that India has become the best, then our India is the best, our values ​​are the best, now tell us how happy you are, the next day the sun will rise again, then what will you do now, what will you get in that best India?  What are you getting in that best country with the best values? What happened to you? You have called America dirty because there we talk about money, we talk about success and success is all about money, is n't there success in health? So stay happy youth  22 year old people are healthy because mostly people are healthy only or in youth everyone is mostly healthy, so be happy then you are healthy and just maintain your health, just go on with your work, health does not mean anything in itself.  No one is asking you to lose your health. Be practical in life and do not seek that someone will start or push your car. First gear in a moving vehicle.  People are sitting in the car to shift from second to third to fourth gear, but they should see the moving vehicle. Not only this, there have been historians who have helped somewhere, there have been gurus and mentors, no one wants to be one of those loser students who are big.  There are coaching centres, there are schools, they also take entrance tests so that our result does not get too bad because if we take the totally incompetent person, then he will not be eligible for the name. You have reduced the fees, you have collected sheep.  They have done it, they have given it, there will be no benefit to them, so you will have to become something somewhere and youth should stop asking what to do because nobody is actually interested, what are you to do, everyone is sitting with their own, do different digital marketing digital. I can teach aspiring entrepreneurs through communication, but after selling something first, come, struggle, try, at least sit like this, but how can I speak, but how can I open my mouth? It doesn't open, you can't say after attending a two-hour workshop that if you are from this state then you should not come. Recently I heard someone say that even on a salary of ₹ lakh, you ca n't reach it on a salary of ₹ lakh.  Start from 40, start from 50, the one who is sitting on one today, did they all start from one only? They show everyone this package of IIT-IM and make it look like this, they too are only 5-10 per cent.  The packages are available there, they are not available and they are also installed, there is no job beyond them, sometimes the burn rate is so high, no one tells the whole story, no one understands, everyone listens to a little bit and then runs away after listening to their own version.  But stop learning this motivation and learning this fun. Any person who takes you towards some harsh action and gives guidance there and that person is right, the person who gives you the greatness of spiritual knowledge in 22 2 years, 18 19 20 years. Remember that he is telling you some stories, he is your enemy, you are liking it only because father and mother do not listen, your friends and boyfriend are not yours, you do not roam around much, you do not understand how to make money, you are not earning anything from you.  If not, then he is just like that, he is massaging you with something that is giving you peace, he will put you to sleep again, take you into unconsciousness, then you will wake up again and then you will go to him, he will feel good now.  Last time I had taken a little name of Utter, what about me, his army has come and made life difficult, so I am not taking his name, it is okay because his army should not even collect me because it is okay for him who is his ex-army.  I just want to tell you that you come and tell me that I am telling you the truth, I am not telling you why you wasted so many years, it would be better if you could have worked somewhere else, work in double shifts in India, otherwise you can earn Rs 1200 00 in a big city. you and  You can earn Rs 40000 per month without any education. If I am talking about doing daily wage labor without any skill set, it is not that there is no money but that this is a small work, I am not even asking you to do it, I am also useful.  I will tell you something in the videos. Earlier also I have told many people to do it and earn money. Many people could not do it. I told about OT exam but many people did not understand it because how will they do it, what will they do? Only you can tell me. I will tell you like that in every video. I say, tell me the account number, I will just put the cheque, I will tell everything, the youth will have to see from inside why anyone would tell you everything, why would they tell you anything and if such a great thing is being held by one person, then those who are his employees. Below the 40,50,600,000 work that is done, it cannot be achieved by following it, if that thing is so easy to do then I tell you the things which are very simple but not easy like weight.  The formula to lose weight is very simple but not easy. Eat less, exercise more, reduce calorie intake, take out more. Your weight will reduce. It is very simple but is it easy? Is it on a sustainable basis? You can do it.  If yes, then you will definitely reach then please share, like, discuss, subscribe the channel and in the comment section you will get my webinar info group Guruji from  You will find a Telegram group in Gurugram, join it. Whenever I organize any such workshop or that thing, you will get a notification. If you do not do anything, you are already sitting at zero, then please do not join because zero people will not do any good.  Yes, some are fixed and physically some are trying and some physically go out of the house for 10 to 12 hours some do it not to interact with each other  The one who actually does something then you come then I will be able to help you in another way Not so crystal clear No one tells you everything is so easy Just doing it Nothing is easy No nothing is easy Even cleaning your stomach in the morning is not easy  If it is, then nothing is easy but you should know what to eat, whether you will eat roughage, whether you will eat coffee like this, how much coffee should you eat, then when you know like this, then it can be simple, then life is very.  Simple is not easy, but learn the formulas of that simplicity, then you will be able to do it, even then it will not be easy, nothing is ever easy, so join, like, subscribe, thank you very much."

    "content": "Hello friends, this video is a short video for all those boys and girls or young kids who are under 20 and who throw tantrums for marriage, I want to give a little knowledge to those people that many times, every time this is understood in a conventional way, a convention  There is a convention in it that the boy will be older than the girl, is it also a convention that no, the girl is older than us, is it okay, no, no, everything is fine, but how can this be done like this, is it an observation?  So today I want to tell all of them that Mukesh Ambani, who is the richest man in India, always has a choice for his sons that he is at that level, it is okay, both the sons should have got married earlier.  It is already happening with the other, the partners of both the boys, Shloka Mehta ji, Radhika Merchant ji, are older than Akash Ambani and Anant Ambani, so I don't want to create any such sensationalism, I just want to tell you that bhaiya,  There is no problem even if you marry someone older than you by one, two or three years.

    "title": "Youth Should Be Aware Of Silent Layoff In Companies [-8haJkMb6kg].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today we will discuss the concept of silent lay-off by companies. This discussion has started now because recently a report of a very big company of India has come that 42000 employees have been fired but there is no hue and cry if the announcement is made to 42000 employees.  If it was withdrawn then it would have been known only on the day it was withdrawn but now it is being known by reading the annual report in which it has to be mentioned how many employees there are and that was till 31st March and now in August there is talk of 42000 which is a huge amount so take it silently. What is happening in the layoff, sir, I am not telling you about this company. Generally, what happens in a silent layoff is that instead of firing the employee himself, such a situation is created that he leaves on his own and is unhappy.  Or he may not get promoted or you should come clean and tell him that you could have done it and if he misbehaves too much then you will be fired and then you will not get the credentials that the next company needs  Then if you go there and say that the problem creator is he, he did not resign from that company because after resigning you go to one company and join the next company then you can also tell the story and specially if the previous company did something too much against you  If you do not do it and put in your good word then you will get the job, you will have hope but if you have come after fighting then that will not happen, so this is happening, so what can you do now, you are a helpless man on his job, so you can do this if  If your situation is getting very tight, then go and have a clear talk with your boss. Tell him that you want to fire me. Don't make me suffer for a month and a half or two months, because many people are suffering for two or three months and many others are leaving.  People, he thought that he wants to fire you and is saying something to you and you are working hard and burning yourself out and messing yourself up, so ask this clear cut question that you are also firing him, what is the scene, tell me a silent take off.  quitting is better than quitting okay quit  Quitting is a different concept that is even a better concept another warning which I want to tell and what is happening you tell me people who are in this category wether they agree or not and there will be learning for other people also that at the age of more than 45 years No one is happy to keep 45 years, which means if you have worked for 20-15 years, then this age will come when your salary becomes so high that sometimes even after taking 5-10 increments for so many years, that even after taking them out,  You can hire two employees of 28-30 years of age in your place and they can work with more authority and your light is getting extinguished because at 45 you would be facing mid life crisis anyway, children 's requirement, parents' requirement, your own desires, so this is a new concept  So if you are in a corporate plan, your life as if at 45 your shop will be closed, shop in the sense your job shop, your work, you do something  If I do that, I would like that people who are between 40 to 45 years of age should start preparing. In fact, the moment you hit 37, 38 and you have 12, 13, 14 years of experience, then you should see how many more years you are going to last, because if you are a  Blue Blood Pedigree What do you say Blue Blood Pedigree in India, IIT IM, any big networking, good MBA, it is not from outside, and your network is not like that, it is not blue blood, like this is something made up of blue color, it is not like that of yours  Blue so brother then your program is going to be in 4546 thank you there can be many exceptional people in it depending on whether they are very talented or there is a requirement in the sector or the performance in the company is good or the management is good it can be 10 20  But out of this but at 80 you will fall in towards this I will soon be conducting a workshop to guide changing jobs upgrading realizing your value and  I will tell all these things to you people, if you want to attend that workshop, it will be a corporate workshop, then give it to CW on the given number, also Independence Day offer is going on, you will get it in the comment section of my courses, enjoy the discount and  Please buy John sa, it seems more suitable for you, there are many choices, you can also become a consultant after listening to some things and the rates were very low anyway and beyond that a discount was also given, so now there is no reason not to watch it, so tell in the comment section  You will get it, please see, thank you very much"

    "content": "Hello friends, what has Duggal Saheb become today or this is what Duggal Saheb has become today, this will be a very good video, the youth will learn a lot who want to do something other than trolling in life, this is the meme behind it, okay and the history behind it. Let me tell you a little, there was a picture, Mujhse Shaadi Karogi Karge, in which Salman Khan was the hero, there was a character in it, Qadir Khan's Obi Dukal, he used to become something different every day and it was written on the outside, Aaj Duggal.  Sir, it has become like anybody and everybody likes me, who does different things, then it is written as Duggal Saheb, today Duggal Saheb, it has become okay, so because I do a lot of stuff, you people follow me. Okay, so today I want to tell the youth and you people and the subscribers that you too have to become Duggal Saheb and Bhai Duggal Saheb.  This is a very good example to follow. I am not saying it exactly according to that movie, I am saying this with the help of this example that why there is benefit in doing different things, you will be able to do any one task, stagnation is bound to come in it, you are bound to master it.  It has to be ripe, it has to be boring, it has to happen, if you can do two instead of one, four instead of two, if you wake up someday, today brother, you hold real estate, not marriage today, not astrology today.  Politics Politics is always good. What will you do today in the stock market? Seven days in a week, seven things have been done, one thing has changed in a month, sometimes you have done something, sometimes you have done a lot. It keeps your productivity high. It always takes you towards interesting things.  It's because you can hold on to any one thing, you have got hold of a government job, you are ripe, in 10 years you have got hold of a corporate job, you are ripe, isn't Duggal in this new age economy? Sir, only you will do better because that is what is sustainable, you can be in one thing at any time, you started doing that work and got stagnant while doing it, there is no growth, what to do now, you were commenting a lot on becoming another man's Duggal Saheb. Duggal sir, before you speak, there was another Leonardo da Vinci, he used to do a lot of work in different ways, so no one teased him like this by clarifying Duggal, okay?  So brothers and sisters, before teasing someone, learn something from him. Do you want to become Duggal Saheb? Take membership of the channel. We will make you Duggal Saheb. I will make you Duggal Saheb. You can become a consultant in real estate, astrology, marital, relationship, job. I am doing a workshop on interviewing in Lincoln profile on Sunday on how to manage job and its if you want details.  Brothers and sisters, if you want to become part one of Duggal Saheb, if you want to do something, then there will be a workshop on my whatsapp2. Listen, you will understand and what exactly will be covered in it. There will be three two-hour workshops in the workshop. Queries will also be taken. It will be an interesting workshop. Come, learn and grow. Nothing is achieved by trolling, not just one youtube2 youtube3 youtube4, I have five channels, I am doing something, right, I don't leave even the small ones, I don't leave even the big ones.  There are different subscribers, there are different audiences, so come and learn, what is the need of getting irritated, I repeatedly tell people that if you want to compete in life, then don't compete with anyone, don't do like us, you don't even know how to compete.  If so, then do it with your sister-in-law's husband, who is your brother-in- law, do it with your brother-in-law, do it with your brother-in-law, do it with your brother, do it with your sister's husband, do it with the person with whom you want to do it, only then you should do it.  It will be fun, in order to move ahead, why should we do this to people like us or even those who are bigger than us? And in reality, ideally, if you should do it to someone, then you should do it to yourself, that who you were yesterday and who you are today.  Have you become better than you were a month ago? Are you better than you are today? Have your value adding skills increased or are you a one trick pony? It is better to be a Duggal Sahab than a one trick.  Pony Most of all you are one trick Pony Now see what happens, what is the benefit of creator's pass, we have the platform, we have the platform, the subscriber who is loyal enjoys it but the trolls who come and like it are so good.  There will be comments, but before writing on this, the soul will burn from within, because those who find pleasure in strange things, those who come and troll the troll themselves, cause pain to people. No man is one how, learn it, there is only one pattern, everything is linked, once I tell you the secret, listen carefully children, all you are listening to, 18, 20, 22, 24, 25 year olds, the education system we do.  I am not going to tell you its secret and the video is not going to be very long and sharing it will be beneficial for the people too and for those who are a little older listening then please share it too. This is the education system, isn't it?  If we know what it is for then you can become Duggal Saheb and what is it that the education system basically teaches us that we learn how to do what we do and sit by rote knowledge that Akbar died in 1605  His father was Humayun, this is integration, this is coordinate geometry, this is cus theta sine theta, this is memorized, this is done in the exam, no, no, no, any How to approach a new subject, how to learn it, how to remember it and how to use it in life, this is the main purpose of the education system, which unfortunately nobody teaches, the teachers themselves don't teach because if they knew then maybe  They are not teachers at all, this is also a bitter truth, those who do not know do not know because you should know how to use the education system, how can we learn. Then what to learn can be decided later. You should know how to learn. Once you know how to learn, then like us, you are doing all kinds of work in everything from flying ships to astrology. Brothers and sisters, ask me anything, if you want to do science, do it.  You have to listen to stories, tell stories, do this because we can learn anything quickly, you do not need to become a chartered accountant in 15 days, you can learn 100% 80 things in 15 days. Can be learned and when you learn everything on 7080, you will become Duggal Saheb and the same is required, you do not have to go and fill the balance sheet of the company, you should know how to fill some of your returns, you should know how to calculate your HRA. How to avail benefits, how to avail Section 24, what can be done in home loan, what is capital gain, there are some 15, 20, 25 things which are useful for you in every domain.  You should know about different things in health, like one simple knowledge, I want to share with you, health management and Medicare is a different thing, we feel that doctors make us healthy, doctors do not make us healthy, they are ours.  We do medical care, what makes us healthy, what keeps our mind cool, keeps us relaxed, I am your health care guy, I can give you cool and cold and something has gone wrong for you, something has gone wrong.  If you have already failed like us, then you go to the doctor of Medicare people, then the day I explained the difference between two things so easily, now it will be difficult to get into trouble, if it goes according to logic, then good things have to be learned.  If you want to learn useful things, if you want to do well then you will find Webinar Info Group in the comment section, you can join it.

    "title": "सरकारी नौकरी ना करने के सात कारण ｜ 07 Reason You Should Not Apply For Government Jobs [6mwQzd2EpDk].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, this is going to be a very good topic, government employees can also watch it and those who are preparing for government jobs can also watch it and those who are preparing for government jobs and those in the coaching industry can also watch it and can troll.  I will cover 7 reasons why you should not join a government job at all. There will be no better video on government jobs than this. In this video I will not talk about private jobs. You know I do not talk about this.  Announcement is the launch of my job series on this channel and you will see the best videos, you will get full clarity, the youth are listening to whatever you are seeing, you see, watch till the end, give 25-30 minutes of life, do seven preparations and get the job.  Even if it takes 35 years, if you have to do it for so many years then brother, you have to give it 25-30 minutes with seriousness, then whatever is your opinion, please give it to me at the end for the sake of parents.  This video is very important for parents too, they have to take decisions, so it is important for them to also talk about the things that I will tell you about the job, we will talk about the government job, the second power is the power of stability, the second power is the power of prestige, the third is the promotion of salary.  Fourth and fifth we will talk about work life balance. Sixth we will talk about public perception and seventh will be about debt and alcohol. Today in 2023, getting into a government job is a curse. I will tell you why it is because now whatever job is available, do it.  If he has to do till 25560, then why is there alcohol, you should not go at all, you don't even have to fill the exam, but still there is one person who will go, I will tell you in the end which one, you should not go at all and who can go, still this  With listening, it will be clear, you can tell in the debate, what are these projects, if you want to give solution, then you are my audience, there can be two types, one above this level, one above this level, I am from social economic status.  If I am talking about, then according to that you will get the solution and you will get complete clarity, then first of all, if you get a government job, father, mother, world brother, then life is set, you have heard the dialogue, 'Hey, you will get married, you will get married to the market too.  I will touch, okay, hey, brother, government job is stable, it is sure that you have become a government son-in-law, this is the biggest curse you hear, Han ji, the job in government is stable, only this one is stable, the rest are some table jobs, yours are stable, remember this. [Music] Except Indian Information Survey or Indian Economics Service or some two or four such services which are permanent and do not rotate and stay at one place, 199% of my government jobs are in the state government, whichever center I belong to, no matter how many railways you want.  You know, in the 30-35 years of traveling in Beltran, you go from here to there to here to here, there is no stability, there is no stability, but when a person is holding a job and there is job discrimination.  So wife, marriage, children, stability, who knows what will happen in 35-40 years, but you are entering, you have to remember this and that, due to lack of stability, your relationships are not formed, networking is not done, money is not added to your children again and again.  Earlier, admission would have been standard in your Kendriya Vidyalaya Navodaya Vidyalaya, 30-40 years ago children would have become everyone's students studying there, today you know education will not be like this, your wife will have two-four punch stations separately.  She goes along with him for posting and after that Boriya does not lift the bed. At the age of 35-40, when the touch happens and the children grow up and she takes a station, a place, a location, a city and then you spend your lonely life as much as you do today.  These days, I feel like a government servant. 42 to 45 years old, tell me the taste of midlife crisis. Is it happening or not? Your house is settled at minimum, two or three or four places, one child here, one child there.  A child there, is it worth it? Those who are holding jobs and giving exams to join the government, please do some government job. There are nine government servants in every family and family. You just have to ask those who are 15 years or 20 years older.  Brother, tell me, what Swadhar do you have? This is not the stability of life. Without stability of life, you cannot be happy in life. The second thing is that your job is secure, so the employee below you is also secure and you are less than him.  You are understanding what to do, when they hold the head, right, when lower staff comes, lower staff, this work culture is also coming within this, it is Persian from lost staff, not up, you are D mark, you cannot do anything for them because like you are stable.  By taking it, he is stable, all the senior officers keep the good staff with themselves and give their head to the junior officers like this, they remain strong, this is also a matter of pain, but I have something to do with the donkeys every day. words like this to him  I will do that as a poet, I will not use a little exaggeration or embellishment, but to understand, he has to do something. If someone is feeling pain, then it is to give a message, there is too much pain in it, don't say like this, you have done it to everyone, next comes. Yes, this is the power of prestige. This power of prestige is such that in 1947, our Princely State had the power of prestige. It is okay, Rajababu type, all of which went away, but before they knew, Indira Gandhi. When I fell in love with my lover after 22, 23, 24 years, I came to know that he has nothing in this tour, no power and prestige, but he is full of arrogance because there is time to find out, the market does not know yet.  Well, those who are government servants know that both power and prestige have different sorrows. Power has been given to each of them and when it comes to prestige, prestige is like Bauji's Indian family today.  Is it inside or has the Indian breath? There is no prestige and respect for government employees. There is no prestige. No big love. People call the government employees who drive on the roads as government. People in the government have problems in everything. There are potholes, pollution, corruption. This is it. Government job is very good, there should be something good in the government, I am telling the public's opinion, the duplicity of the public is fine, nothing good happens in the public opocracy, but the government jobs are the best, we will stand in line so that we too have to go here.  So that the rest of the people can shun us, if you see then the true hypocrisy is not prestige, it is newsons and the nuisance is changing drastically which is the political dispensation dispensation in India today and for many years and may last for many years or you can see.  Where is the low transit? Digitization of everything; Increasing transparency; I am telling you a little about the passport office that I recently learned about what has become great for renewal.  There is a difference of night and day between the experience of the first time and this time, gradually the whole thing has become so smooth, isn't it? Today you are feeling that the government servants are changing the brothers, you become this IAS, become this, that's why I am saying.  I am at the top because the rest are at the bottom, so let the people at the bottom take me to the bottom. Hey, the country changes. Politicians and businessmen set the agenda, whether someone likes it or someone else feels bad, this is the truth brother, when you are because when I am telling you, is it? I am demotivating you that you are preparing so much, when you come fasoge here, you will know this first, go and cross check these things with those who are engaged, because the tuition takers, the coaching staff and father, mother and father did not tell you.  Mother said, son, our respect will increase in the society, don't increase it, I am telling you not to increase it, because when those relatives come, they will give less, rather than recommending brother, get this done for us, get that done, that will not happen and then. That's how it all happens in three to four years. Now let's start with the salary. The next thing is that the power is going to be very less and in the next 5 to 7 years people will not see anything. Question paper.  What I am talking about today will be out. Through this video, your people's curiosity will be aroused, you will share it and it will also reach the government people and with folded hands, I request the government people that I myself, if you can write something. Write in the comment section because it coming from your mouth will add more weightage also ki han bhai ye aisa hai apni jeevan itna savour, don't just do it but don't do it so much, the next thing is the starting salary of a government employee is very good if  Fourth kind of qualification especially in lower post means peon, if you get it then it means that ₹ 21000 is basic, you will get defeat, you will get so and so threat.  It goes up to 40-45-50, okay, if you compare it in private, now I am not doing any comparison with private, I will make a separate video for private, I will definitely make verses in this, it will become a lot of khichdi, I am completely on government.  I am telling you if it is okay then Sarkar, I am saying this, it is like this, it is like this, gradually when the series will run straight, like an episode, like Netflix, clarity will start emerging on its own, very good.  If it is a promise to you that it will be done properly then the salary is there in the beginning but as you get to a senior position, the less your responsibility increases, brother, it is nothing, these days the government is a luxury, there is leave, there is road brother.  Come and see, ask, this woman has kept the mill grinding, whatever it is, everyone has made the system so tight, there will be inspection on Saturday also, the minister will come, this will come, this feedback, managing public perception has also reduced.  You are everywhere because you say that neither the officers nor the sales in the government are you, the operations are also there, everything is yours and along with it is your public dealing which is the most dangerous thing because the public code dies and creates ruckus.  And it is insulting that if you reach the VP level in a multinational company, then no one can reach your office, if this phone is bad, then he is a VP, tell me the meaning, he can answer me, but with senior officials in the government.  Even the crowd gathered can become conscious and you have to deal with it. And it's the lesser or Charter of Duties. You just run away from the public. From here, you can become an officer as per your wish. The public can come to you at any time and do anything to you.  Pension can also be there, earlier there was old public pension system, it ended, NPS came but politics is getting too much, salary is 3% increment, donkey is horse, donkey is horse, I will tell that also to the horse.  The starting salary is good but if you look at it, now government teachers cannot do anything else or like I take consultation or do destruction. How many government teachers are there who want to do private tuition, do it secretly, do not do it as per the rules.  You are not allowed, you cannot do much because you are in the government, you cannot do anything else according to the rules and regulations, you have surrendered everything, you are not someone who can study two tuitions and then do it there.  I will reduce it there in the evening, I will do the economy, I will do that, I can't do anything, you will take part in the opportunity cost that the coming time and the Indian economy will offer you, which is a journey from three trillion to fight trillion and then train trillion dollars. 8th pay commission is not allowed to come to these three-four persons, it will increase, there will be issue of inflation and now by 2025 onwards government employees will start lagging far behind in money when the rest  Booster dose will be given in Navami because of opportunity cost only. People who live in big cities have to roam around in small towns all their life. It is a subject of pain which comes to mind as soon as a class comes to the top. I will tell you well about the pain of samjhaunga. To whom. Shouldn't go Shouldn't go Do n't sound a little classist because I will clearly tell you what is happening going forward, you have done a good job in promotion, a lot of promotions are time bound and time.  According to this, this is what you will become in 13 years, which donkey and horse you will become in 17. Donkeys also come in government jobs, I have not told anyone to show inferiority among horses, I am the donkey at all, do n't consider him a donkey, I am a relative, he is not very creative sir, Ghisu  Master, the horse is like this, the date has burst, Haj is creative and all is less in itself, horses come less, donkeys come more, I am not classifying it as an insult. Both of them come into the government. In the government, if both are converted into mules, then the donkey gets upgraded because the mule will be upgraded and the horse gets demoted because it was a horse, so if it is made equal then you will no longer be in the government.  The best thing is that any officer can reduce anyone, he can be adjusted anywhere, anyone can do anything because by converting a donkey into a horse, it has been transformed into a mule by doing this, now when the mule goes up, he gets promotion.  Very  It seems good that the one who came from a donkey and the one who came from a horse, every time he gets bloodied, he starts having problems after 10 to 15 years. The horse who was the original horse will either call himself a donkey or a mule.  But will he be satisfied or will he get distracted and leave, this is also one thing, so you also have to decide, you are a donkey or a horse, you are preparing and keep it in your heart that brother, I do not understand, I do not understand stability.  I mean I can't do it here and there in creativity, I can do the syllabus once in a while and after that I absolutely like it, I do n't have any problem in doing it, so please it is fine for you but it is a matter of pain for a lot of people.  Increment has to be given in person, do less good, do bad, do something useless, do something, when you get promotion, 13 years, 17 years, these are different stages, there is an extra increment somewhere in your salary, when 15% 20% 30% You will never see anything like this in your life and in the coming life, there will be no commission on 8%, he will cross your da by applying ratio formula from the card and merge da, basically the same.  If the numbers are looking good today then they will not be right in the future. Now I go to work life balance. Work life balance is very bad. How is there a place where one should have fun not just work? Life is not good but the place is. Life is such that many government employees are trapped in such situations because you are stuck at some place with your family members, you are placed somewhere in such a way that the work is so exhausting and less stressful that postings are given even after 8 months.  There are so many postings that you don't understand what to do, go there and join now, start reducing, then posting again, posting again because the orders will come from above, okay, you have to see this in the order, it is shown like this in the movie. Singham style and no one harasses like that but it is a simple thing, there is pressure to do something or the other, he does political work, he has become very active, the government employee cannot reduce his wrong because there are courts, there are commissions, there are rules, because his job will reduce his wrong if he does something.  If he will go to a very low level then he will not be able to appeal to many people and then from there he will get posted, so what is the choice, that is, either he should leave the job or go to jail or he should get posted, that is, it is big and in between.  People who become spineless, their lives also have to be given a lot of relief. As soon as the politician checks the dispensation and changes it or someone complains from below, it also falls for them. This stress is too much. I want to tell you one thing today.  This can become a subject of huge research. Is there alcohol in India? People who drink alcohol are in private jobs and others drink more. Government people drink more. Some people have a direct relation with alcohol. At one stage, people are drinking a lot of alcohol.  A 27 year old is drinking a 26 year old, but as a person in his 30-40s, he is in the government, getting to know many people like me, getting to know each other and sitting, why is he stressed because his parents are retired, they are in a different city, the future of the children is not known.  It is going on, the wife is living separately, I do n't know about my promotion, the money is not enough, the solution is not enough, then due to pressure from all these things, take it out of greed or compulsion or whatever it takes. That happens and that too is not possible because its risk reward ratio has also become very strange, meaning the rate of getting caught is the rate of the system because many people are openly telling you because I am telling you that I go to the public perception next.  The sixth one is my point, public perception is very bad, government employees, you must tell yourself, ask someone, write in the comment section yourself, where are you getting respect, whether the government employees are sitting among them or not.  The government was being reduced, once you give an order, you have to go here, the sun will set here, you have to stand here, live or die, no matter what happens, and this is also a subject of my pain, many governments and jobs are such that there is less risk of dying, which means you will be killed, which means like this.  Do you know what are the government jobs in which you can go, job in line of duty, these people also get scared of dying unfortunately, which is very good because their training is less, but they also  There is a rate in leaving the job, after one stage or after one stage, there is a need to give up the leave, one after the other, in many places the retirement disease is less here, they also have a rate, on top of that, the debt with NPS, this thing should already be reduced, it is okay. You must have seen the government everywhere now that scheme of Magni Veer, it will come within 4 years, the government cannot do this balloon and the government means the budget which can increase so much of their pension salary, how good does it have in the government. Whatever little intelligent thing is being done in the government, everything is being outsourced to the private sector, they are getting any project, consultants are coming in, there is no shortage of famine, the only thing is that to sit on one seat, an employee is needed, who sometimes  Whatever happens, an election is such a thing that the entire government is doing it on its own, but it is very required, it is okay that the whole system is shaken, somewhere technology has to be brought, somewhere you have to bring Aadhaar, somewhere you have to do it.  Your own TCS Infosys is doing the same and the outside ones are also doing consultancy. On many production projects, the consultants come from outside and they take their money in full. You know, they also do the rest of the lateral placements.  The one who has reached the level and then brings him to the level, then here they say that wherever the famine is going to be reduced, the lateral policeman will take him directly, they will also make him georgette or if they make someone higher, then This is skin, no, government people will tell no, public perception is very, very bad, now why is this a career and what is it, is it a curse and why is there alcohol, I will tell that. Last time I had said that if you go into a government job, then there is no alcohol, you see this. Many marriages in a government job are not based on his actual public status, but on his actual salary, which will be Rs 30-408-70, and not on his ability to earn under the table.  Is this true or not? You tell me in the society and now when she gets married then the government employee knows that my bride has come, she has come under my table, she has come from ability and you have given her the same. It will depend on ability otherwise it will not remain, this is also a fact, now it is becoming a subject of pain because it is giving him pain in the heart, there is stress in people's actual, money desires, wrong adjustment of knowledge means this. because now you  You have become interested in that thing, doesn't it mean that you are a group C, you are a group, and you are carrying a phone and an iPhone, if you walk in a car, then everyone knows what is happening in weddings. If you go, it is okay, you are CN, you, I, take an example from one.  If I am an exchange, then it will still be a senior position and down below, go to level A, go to level A, go to A, go to A, show off where the money is coming from, because you can do it anywhere else, if you are caught then do it in consumption.  If you can then there is also a liquor in the consumption. Look at their health because it is going on in your stomach. What will you do? Some have given, some have taken, some have taken, some have gone. All of them are decreasing. This is not a good.  They are live training, because you get stuck, you get stuck, you can't do any less, fan, you become a diamond here, if you can't become then this mess is less and this mess is also less tight.  are  It is wrong to do this anyway, by doing this your health will be spoiled, your soul will be spoiled, your karma will be spoiled, the public is in trouble anyway, everyone knows what else is the duty of the public that it should not be reduced. Those who like it, they feel that they don't know what a great thing is not a small thing, I tell it with a classic example and here this is the advice of Geeta, it is not good to get attached and it is not good to be detached, most of the government employees know this advice of Geeta practically by giving an example.  Let me tell you, he is a big officer from Haryana. If you write his name, tell me. If you can understand, he has many postings. There are many postings. Every three-four months, he goes on Twitter. Twitter and everyone else also do it.  He is a senior officer, I think he must have served for 3032 years. Leave alone any government. If there is a change of government in five years, there have been six government changes during his time. In different political parties, some may not mean him, some may mean him.  I don't like it because it is publicly known that brother, you are not suitable for a job, you are being harassed so much, you are so good, so why are you not getting a job, you can't do anything less, why can't you give an example?  I am not looking down on them but I am giving the examples of other people, that is, they have come from very big educational institutions which are top in India, you know that is the institute of technology, they have the qualifications there, why don't they go and do startups, why don't they do this? Because many times what does it mean, why does it mean what is the rate, because many people have started using this word Startup India, Makeup India, This India, this India, all these words have come later, sometimes government employees have started working while in the government because there they have started getting a taste for this thing. Do youth want to come for this thing  He wants to come to commit corruption. He wants to come to mortgage his soul. What is this method, what is the meaning of this, which is the power of prestige among the four? Power is some, not some system, it will be done like this, you will not be able to steal ₹2 today. Whoever wants to come for theft after seven to eight years, tell me this, it must have happened earlier, the country has changed, after doing that, now they have three, four, five or seven years of service, they will go to their homes but  If you are joining considering this  That in the next 30-35 years, I will give you such a beautiful example as an example, you will understand that you have to join, it is okay not to do so, you think about it, there is a camp for government employees, there is a relief camp, there is a relief camp.  It is true that something has happened and anything has happened somewhere and there are thousands of people there. He is like a cook who prepares food. A government employee has nothing to do with quality. He has to feed people with quantity. Is this any less good? What is the need of such people, what is the need of a government employee and if you are a chef with five star rating in the mission, the foodies who have come to the mix will know what they are, five star people means you are the chef of big fine dining in big hotels, then brother, if you  This will be given less and if you are like that then you will grow up. It is better to remember this, so today you release what is your status because there are few people here, here you will not get such clapping, that boy very tasty food.  fed  Because the cook here knows only three spices, this one from the government, the example that I am giving is one called chilli, one turmeric, just here, what would be tasty in different languages, not the first one is fed up, here I am the food, so this is its example.  Do it and tell me that first there will be a tank test, then the pilot here, then the brother here is like this, he has the capacity to make food worth Rs. 7-80000, so we are here to make bread like this, we have to make bread like this, bhatakhat cracked.  Fat, raw, raw, raw men are standing there, there is so much stress and pressure, and the guy is standing like this with lungi and vest, he is sweating, doing something, this is a government employee, it can be setup, but this one's passion is less, clapping will not happen like this. By doing the same job, Master Dinanath Chauhan, this will reduce your meaning, your stage will be such that son, your father has earned a lot of respect, he has not earned the respect, if you want to see it then you have to see where to come. If you are from a poor family, you come from a low level, then it is better to be from a lower level. Now it is bad for the public, so take a level, if you are poor, then brother, then a government employee, a government job is very good for you, because only what kind of government job is it?  If the rickshaw puller's son becomes an officer, if the rickshaw puller's son becomes a group wife, if he becomes anything, it would directly take him up in the society, then it is very good for him, but your father himself has been an officer for 30 years, it is okay, now you are a.  When you go to work, you yourself will not get a great feeling. You have a father and a son who has also become an officer. If the father is rich, middle class or businessman or has less money then there will be no sense of achievement. If you are below this level then from today you will be 5. I am predicting after a year, this trend is already happening, only people below this level are coming and those who are leaving from this level, who were very intelligent, English speaking, threatened in their life, will give. Meet this people and the same point of time, these people will be over their heads being boss, nine these tadpenges will torment you throughout your life, this is how flying Punjab will keep happening, it will be like this on the ear, these people will continue to be like this, now you see yours What is the family, what is the background, if your family is earning more than 8-10 lakh salary, lives in a decent city, i.e. tier five tier six town village and level it.  But it's not okay, if you are tired then please try the award, you are less, look at the government job, here I am not talking about Group D, Group C job, it is absolutely desperate, D has returned down, that and that job.  In any case, Group B and Group A jobs, which are considered to be very precious jobs, are also losing their taste and this will happen very fast. No one will explain this thing, everyone will say that there is no personal growth, there is no government growth.  inside the job  There is no time to get actual, there is no time to be intelligent, you have no brain juice, you take left government job, left right, you keep moving around in this world and you have done a five day course somewhere, you have done it in dimension, it does not increase your value.  You people know, the government people also know and all the government people who take 2 years of study leave, how many Einsteins are made in it and why do they take it, they also know that it is okay for daughter's marriage, daughter 's marriage for building a house.  It is okay to take it, you also know that 1999% of the people who take it do not think that by doing this I will make them in the government and the government itself made the video to demotivate people from government jobs and not to do it that they will sacrifice their lives.  You are living and the amount of fun you have created is not so much that all the clippings of yours keep coming, Azim O Shaan Shahenshah, you should also watch that second clipping when what does the judge say, he is doing DC to SP and him and that.  New York Melody Melody No, it's not like this, brother, look at both sides or Azim Shan Shahenshah wala, this is more true, this is more true, the horses are the ones that seem to be the most, no, it is not such a bed of roses, no, someone will have to do it, someone, someone else  So let's see whether you are the one who has to do it, someone has to do it, there are many people who do it, but you see whether you have the sensitivity, can you shake it, because of so much stress, one thing is clear, it is kind of stress.  Which is there in this government job today likely it is like you increase only it is not worth of money with you are getting and know everyone and everybody has there knows it very well so thoughts same this corruption and park purpose privileges ki bata to its  His car came, I did n't get the car, this one didn't get it, you remain the same people, he has a good car, his printer is good. Gave him a good laptop, he got a phone, he got a good house, the quality of the houses, government employees are very very bad in 90% of the cases for people who come from decent family background in terms of monetary because using this word decent and decent again  Bikma, I am telling you about the money supply. If your father's house has Jaguar taps and fittings, then you will find such houses which are not found here, if you open their windows.  If it is there then it is not closed and if it is closed then it is not opened, it is like this, but it is a very good thing for the man who came from a poor family and he was living in a hut, he did not even have a house, at least there is a house here.  It is a big house, its paint is coming off, there is a wedding, grass is growing at the back, the surroundings are not getting that good because even to keep it good, you will have to misuse your privileges because somewhere there is no one to keep the government houses very good. Daily basis monthly basis  You are supposed to spend money from your pocket, you keep your previous government servant, you are suspended at samsingority, you also know the thing, it is not like this that people are for forwarding, that car is also your fight or quarrel.  You got the desire, this one got the suit, this one got the Ciaz, you will remain a maximum person of Ciaz level if in your life  I only have dreams of a car up to Ciaz, okay then please come, if you are thinking so much then because the whole fight will be about these small rupees, he got a good laptop, he got a good connection, I, he got a good clean, I got a good staff.  Look at the pod you found, politics is everywhere, be it a private job or workplace, politics and stress are there, but here there is a lot of pressure from the additional public too. Sir, anywhere there is a public interface, there is a lot of pressure and even where it is not there, it is there today.  on the day you  See, one of the most wrong things in the government, which I feel is happening within the employees and in the organizations is that they are very mean to the politicians and will show that the road has been built. Am I a lizard? Government people are starting to do this.  Now if you look at their Twitter handles, look at Facebook, this is the low level of public perception, it seems to me that after seeing these handles and all this, it seems that they also have to contest the elections, you do your work quietly and  Keep changing departments and keep moving, you are showing yours to whom, it has become a survival mechanism that tomorrow somewhere the workers will say something, they will say this because this is not right, this is winter, I am telling and this Raita is bound to spread now workers.  They will stand by you and make you reduce, if you don't reduce then you will be posted and if you reduce then you will not get reduced directly, 80% and success of not reducing directly will be paid, if you do then there will be some survivability for a few more days, people will stay there.  But if you do it, then someone or the other below you will give up your company, the one below you on whom you are becoming more of a hero will think that this one is doing less and then she will go somewhere else, then what will you do, neither your attention nor your aad nor Patap's anything.  There is no government job here and you are saying that you are spreading negativity, I am only saying that the government employee who has a lot of freedom outside, when I will tell you about private jobs and his struggle is there too, this series will be covered gradually.  please like  Do this thing with the opener that came first, I hope people will take it pragmatically, you have to see what you are, brother, are you a horse or a donkey, I would say to the horses, don't come at all and I will also tell the donkeys that after a day you will  This too will be pained by a society of that era and your parents who are listening to you again and again look at my level and I don't want to tell that because I need to become controversial again, what are you doing? Classes are being made but I am saying brother, it can just be done to all these jobs because all these jobs will become sour and become irrelevant like they are being made in etc., they do not even come in the top ten jobs, government jobs in India.  There will be a stage like this in India also, there is a stage when girls will not marry government servants because they cannot do the job themselves, he keeps doing the land, he is not the one who has given the job to the government, you are at home because he does not have time, he has to do the work.  Because if there is no stability then why would a lady stay away from her husband? If the child is staying away from the father during adolescence, it is not a good thing. Your boy and the girl are 13 14 15 16 17 18 years old and father is missing just check I want my  Check the audience among your relatives, take your vote, write in the comment section brother, all the government employees aged between 42 to 50 years are of different types.  How many such percentages are living with their families? You see, especially those who have traveling jobs, which is already 89%. The madams who do not roam around, they say, Maggie, I have studied in school, I am teaching the children, you are studying.  Go again and again because the admission fee is two-two-three-three lakh rupees. These days, admission is given in the school every two-two years, one and a half year, six months in one year. Who can call a government official and give two rupees?  If you have children then you will do well. You are given a team in a school. So come brother, go from here to the room. In the first 5-6 years, you definitely have an advantage, but after that everything is a disadvantage. This is the message and you will not be left out, even the big ones.  I have not given you an example, younger brother, you will keep on scolding me, it is not good for me and my whole life will be spent in your posting, all the sycophancy and all this will you also reduce it now, right?  Jugaad fit here, fit there, that only posting means after 1 inch, 50% of the effort and energy of the government employee is going into managing his posting, protecting, fitting the jugad. This is a very bitter truth that the top people in the government. Only then they also know what is happening, how much less to take, where to take, they know that in the very big and good projects, government employees of Fortis are not kept and there is no juice.  Young people are kept, those who are inside the government, they know that today I wanted to tell through this video, I have brought this inside story for you people and inside, sorry, I am also talking about everything else.  I will bring it and it is not that any one relative is mine or Ghanishtham is a relative, if there is anyone else, then it is just him, friend, you tell it, it is a big consultation experience pain because you know, I am the rest of my second Cybo Live Sutra channel also.  Hai and I am Assam, you people must have subscribed to that channel because the subscribers from there are also coming here. If it is a big channel, it has 2 lakh plus viewers, then please go and watch it. Okay, so I will do mini things.  So this issue of pain is too much, I would recommend a government job, if you have a good status and are financially ready then give it to the people at a different level, it will be good for them as well as the country.  It would be good because that one person there will get the benefit of his family by taking a government job. It is a completely selfish team. You will get upliftment in social status and all the things will not be of any benefit to you. If your father becomes a government servant, then which one should I do?  If the arrow is shot then you will give it many more opportunities to play and the government will also go to all the four. I am telling you this as this bait will come out and the grain of reservation will be raised. You know that reservation cannot be ended by political suicide.  Yes, but how can it be made irrelevant that brother, if one has to become a government employee, then what will be the meaning of reservation, if today a government employee is the biggest advertisement of every job or every professor who is doing that job.  That happens, you test me today, this same thing happens with everyone, you too are above 40 years or those who have completed 15 years, 20 years of service, around 45 years, ask him if he is happy with the government job and he will say happy.  And if you get three or four such punches, then tell me, how much force should you apply, you will not find punch men, those doing government jobs are happy, look at them, everyone is happy in the honeymoon period, those who are in the first four-five-six years.  There is excitement in it, we have become something, we have power, then gradually we come to know that you are power and what is it actually, what is the game, then service above 15 years or people above 40 years of age. Talk to 5-10 people and check if you get even one or two, then there is no need to eat all the rice, you also have to talk to a ₹ 50 lakh employee, it is two crores, you have to talk to him, you can know even after eating a little.  You can do it whether it is your birthday or not, if you have 15 20 25 people who are government employees and not even one is happy and is not very happy because everyone has been cut off and does not leave, I call this miss a government job riding a tiger.  That is to ride the tiger, till the time the ride is going on, it is fun, but when you get down, you know that it will eat you, it will not even come down and I will and one thing is the only thing, you can associate all the government employees, you can share a zoo. Like, have you seen the lion of R, okay, the private ones, don't be too happy, here a video will be made of the private ones too, the private ones are the lions of the circus, okay, have you ever seen the lion of code there, you get happiness, you get food three times a day, you have to eat, you have to have stability.  He is completely satisfied, I have given him his own area, there is complete stability in Zoom, it is fine and he will definitely get food, he will not die of hunger, but you should look at him carefully, if he also has any parameter of happiness or is it visible because no one has said that he is a lion in the jungle.  Look, what is the lion of the jungle, if I tell you, then Siri will remain, if I get stability, brother, then you keep telling, woman, I will get food three times a day, he can share, now I am very happy and then all the public will come and see me, only the public will come.  isn't it in the room  She looks at the head like this and takes a photo of the lion. It looks like I too had a time when there was a push around me, now Chotu Baby has also come and the photo is taken in the front. Okay, so I am not making fun at all, it is a matter of pain.  I think I am only giving clarity because I am helping you people in informed decision making. This is my biggest video till date. Till now I had not crossed so much time but my request is that in the beginning I  I told you that brother, you have to prepare for so many years, the job decision is not easy, how many more years do you prepare and you don't have much choice like this, and in government jobs, people say, if you try and get it then I am here.  I am telling you not to try because if it hits you, it will kill you, otherwise it will not come off, otherwise the wife is clear that you should not go to this place, it will save you the energy and clarity that will come to you, which will take you forward in life, please.  If you stay engaged in the series, if you get some good reaction, then the series will become longer, because it is like that, isn't it, that Brahmastra? If the first one likes a little bit, the first one will also say, what are you doing, this one is doing such nonsense, it is not government, it is very sexy. Here, put your hand on the government people and tell your genuineness, you tell this much forcefully for your countrymen, rest and it was very good times and this, we are not talking about that, our decision making is taking place. 6th of 2004 8th of 11th of 2012 I am not having fun, I have to go on time, I have to come on time, I have to do even less, I have to do even more, and everything has to be done, and order, you government, now what is there in a government servant, it was earlier than today.  20 years ago the world was a government servant, there was a lot of information on government in it, now what is a servant, beneficial, now in the future, government servant has become like this and the word servant has become more and this is another. Transaction which is happening date is not a transition which is happening nobody will tell because it is dozen suit other big date is d region so because government jobs what is it happening population is not big only your population will be 70 crore to 140 crore in last 40 years and  If you check the government jobs, they have not doubled and are decreasing. If the population will double, it seems that it will be very pumpkin has three is very good but it is"
