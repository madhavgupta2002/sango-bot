Hello friends, as always interesting and original topic, will your dreams come true, friend, which dream are you talking about, dreams means, yes dreams means, whoever has dreams, then there are two types of dreams, brothers and sisters, one is a dream What you think about yourself that I should become like this, this should happen in my life, secondly you are shown dreams, there are political topics on this channel, so only politics is the topic, there is no tension in having personal dreams or goals.  It is not a matter of that but if your dreams are such which are being shown to you then you are not going to reach anywhere in your life. This is the message. Never let someone tell you in life that this should not happen, that this should not happen here, that should not happen here.  And you get drawn into it, these are just stories, someone is saying that if 30 lakh jobs are given, poverty will not be eradicated, someone is saying one should not reach here like this, someone is saying that one should not become a Vish Guru, some, aye it is the example,  Like the husband tells the wife we ​​are sitting, it's okay, it's evening time at home, the weather is nice  It's raining a little outside, it may happen that a tea is made and then the paneer one is served and it tastes good with the nice chutney and then the wife also says yes, it's okay, who will make it, it's a problem of dreams, especially of politicians to show off  This is that just show who is doing the work, he gave dreams, the dreams themselves are a feel good factor, if I tell you like this, if gulab jamun is your favourite or rasgulla or your ice cream or when mango is in season then mango is fine  If it is there then you feel a little good even after talking to him or by doing this, let's go to this house and have a holiday, many fathers are like this, no matter what happens, if you promise in June, then for 15 days your behaviour towards that person  It will be very good because father is taking you to Switzerland and it is a different matter that Gullu took you to Manali, he cheats you and many people take you to that ice skating rink in Omus Mall, it also feels cool, okay?  There is a mall called Omus in Gurgaon on the top floor, eye skating is available on the top floor.  He is very cold, if someone says that this will happen, just think about it, he has taken a trip to Switzerland, the temperature is this much, so by that time you have taken good care of the child, his behavior was like that, the same thing is happening with politicians and that  Now people tell so many people that it is the same, for some people the lollipop is the same and the lollipop is the same, so people separate it and when people collide with each other then they separate the lollipops, they have both the choices of lollipop  There are enough of them and there is a huge audience as well. Go to each one of them and tell them a story, this should not happen, that should not happen, these are dreams, I am telling you this about a dream, secondly what do these politicians do, they will forcefully play with your respect On self-esteem, we will tell you that we have done this work and it has increased your pride because it is very easy to increase someone's pride, especially if you are from a country where you suffer from low self-esteem, no one at home asks you about your job.  No, your looks are not good, your relationship is not good, you are not able to attract a boyfriend or a girlfriend, you are not able to attract a spouse, if you have a spouse then you have quarrels with him/her daily, you can say anything in such a mood.  G-20 do whatever you want, it was fun, the pride increased, now the poor person whose pride does not increase at all, he will say, yes it has increased, what do you mean by it, you organized the function, okay, so it's a great thing, the world is organizing Olympics, it happened in 100, in 1896, okay, so  It is being done for 128 years, we have not done it till now, do you know what incidents happened in the Commonwealth or in 2010, okay then I mean Chhutku Chhutku Barcelona, ​​I do n't know what all places, what all people have got done forcibly here.  If that was done then there is no pride, this is pride but whenever they play, it means women, any big leader of women, any leader is fine, anything and all those leaders are acting as women only, everyone knows about both the factions.  Both the top leaders are great They are playing a game, women know that they do not get respect at home, this is the bitter truth, mother-in-law will not let them, husband will not let them, women will never be understood like this, FinanciallyExpress I am not among the feminist MCPs here but the fact is that  Talk to any woman with a little love, I am telling this to husbands also, if you do it then they will not get into this mess that he is a great leader, he did this or that, it should not happen that your pain becomes mine  It is pain because no one is able to hear the pain of a woman, so this lip service, come and tell me I understand your pain, I have given you this, now I have given it to you, you want more, the heart wants more, there is no respect for a woman Give it to their closest relations, especially husband, brother, whatever you give to the woman, she will give you 10 times more. Leaders know that they give so much respect, give them all the vote, fold your hands and talk about them, the rest is just words and actions.  The thing is practically no one has done anything during periods  There is no talk of leave, only those people stand up there in the parliament, no no, don't say such things to us, it doesn't make any difference to us, it does matter friend, ask those who are responsible, there are many things, there is lip service, there is lip service everywhere  Looking at the women, but what are those women now, they have not become that intelligent yet because they do not get that much love, affection, respect at home, so the leader comes and gives them a little bit through his mouth, wow wow wow wow wow, and I remain a fool How much because, how much because, even then men have become aware, they are able to see through because what a man is, what is going on inside that man, many times it becomes known that this friend is fooling the woman  Those who stay at home and do not go to work, in the middle class and many sections of the society, women are working less in India, they work only till 19, which means only one out of five women works in India, between the ages of 20 and 60.  those who are of working age do not work, those who do not work  What do they do, what do they have in their house, whatever is inside the house give them some comfort there and then give it to them and they are sold for that much only brother, if we are about to complete 77 years of independence, after so many years if  If we become happy with some small things then it means that those dreams will become ours that I first become mine, hey whatever happened, I made you win the election brother, now how many times can you keep winning on the same thing, some fresh thing  Bring it so that whatever is fresh, those dreams are coming and talks of pride are taking place and that pride and the pride of India because we have been a slave for so many years, it has gone away from us as a country, as if anyone has come from anywhere  I saw a movie, you all must have also seen it, and I felt very sad after watching that scene, and I want to tell you because it was a very popular movie, everyone must have seen Lagaan, the Aamir Khan starrer in Lagaan, you know the whole thing at the end.  When there is a cricket match etc. then in the last scene he hits it like that and then he catches it and it becomes a six.  Which scene is that, it is not the one about the sixer, after that the announcement that we have won, so look at the faces of all those people who were there, the picture is beautifully made, there is no criticism of the picture in it but look at the emotion that  We are such that if we win something, we want validation even today; if some white man writes a good report on our country, if some white man comes and does something good for our book or praises us, we want validation even today.  While it is a different matter that we have progressed to such a level that if something does not suit us, we even reject it saying that no, your reporting is forced work, but still if it is good, then it can be boasted of.  We definitely play the game. We do n't want any report from such disruptors. I don't want your applause. I don't want your validation. I don't want anything. Even today I want the Oscars. Okay, even today I want the Nobel from outside. Even today we have a lot of outside  want and this is our low self esteem big things that if you have seen anywhere  Look, after the First World War, there was a leader in a country, many people are calling me dictatorship and beyond that, if you want, I will make a video, my take will be different, my take will be different, what about Hitler, the Germans  Was he very bad for the people from whom he got his votes? He was bad for the Nazis and he humiliated them with his shameless actions. Otherwise he only gave a feeling to the Germans which after the World War I, their morale had increased.  I was also not feeling good about his respect, so I heard his speech, I got so angry that I became a fool, now what is the matter, if I have to become your leader, then I cannot become one by insulting you, there is a different politics in Haryana, you will enjoy a different video on that People of Haryana live a little different, people of Haryana even like the one who insults them a little, saying that this leader is good, but generally in India, people of Haryana are a little different, sometimes there is a different video on them, the politics here always goes in the opposite direction, that is why  But still I am addressing a pan India audience That no leader can get your votes by insulting and degrading you, he has to make you feel good and there are no people who deserve to feel good, if he has not done anything great then it is all just a hoax and he is exploited in this way, what kind of a message is this?  I felt like making a video to tell you that can we see through these politicians? Can we? I want to tell you one by one why the people of that time did not praise the old leaders as much as the politicians of today do. Such a great work across party lines. Nobody did this, his son became the CM, someone else's, later on books were written on his father, when he was his father no one even asked about his caste, I am telling you this by taking an example from Haryana, there is so much flattery among the old leaders  He was not as great as he was made out to be, there was a half brother who was at the top, well he was deserving, but many such leaders are being produced, even in the past, who were nothing like this in their time, but there was no way to know  So if you tell me their stories, it feels good at that time.  Neither did they get much respect nor were they honored and these stories are being told, so there is a low self esteem in our country, a child has low self esteem, his father and mother are responsible, if your child has low self  If there is any reason for esteem, then she will be exploited, she will be exploited in the office, she will be exploited in the relationship as well, a girl who has low self-esteem about herself, the boy will turn her around by giving her a little affection, I will see how far I can go as a social observer by linking up things  I am telling you that my job is not to do politics here only, the atmosphere has become such right now, that is why I have to take examples, otherwise this video would have been uploaded on any other channel as well, but you see, in how much depth and how beautifully I am explaining by taking examples,  The girl who is our daughter travels with low self-esteem, so anybody can give her a little affection and lead her on the wrong path or exploit her and any such daughter is  The self esteem is right, no son you are very intelligent, no your personality is good, no you don't see those kind of frivolous boys who lay a trap, these Casson type, you will not get trapped in them, I am such an example and vice versa, I am also irrespective of a boy Low self esteem, any slightly beautiful girl comes to him, gives him a little smile, he is ready to return all the money, is ready to waste all the time, is ready to return the emotions, she will use and misuse him and then she will leave the boy and then he will go into depression  He will keep roaming around and will also lose his job, not me, I am talking about self-esteem, it is very good to have low self-esteem, the influencer who wants to take some advantage, this influencer can be anyone, he can be in a relationship, he can be a politician  He could be a businessman, he could be anyone, he could be anything, so every time it gives you a good feeling, in India people get stuck on the feeling only because they have such low self- esteem  Somebody's wife does not talk nicely, if you meet any other woman outside the house and she talks to you with a little respect then you will do her work by saying yes yes sister, sister, sister, everything is fine, why do you not say those sweet words at home No one gave me respect, same thing is true with ladies, same thing is true with us, now we have to get out of this trap, I am Guruji from Gurugram, my message is, sort out your self-esteem yourself, many people become fools because of your self-esteem  They are creating people around you, they are creating leaders, the world is creating them and then you get nothing and since you still don't reach anywhere in life, so low self- esteem always remains low self-esteem and you are always in this trap. You just keep on changing, the leaders will change, girlfriends will change, boyfriends will change, spouses will change, friends will change, you should see this every time when you feel exploited that someone is using me like this  When I left, look inside yourself and see that brother you  why were you doing this and validate them, become the most favourite of your life, do not chant anyone's praises, you should not do this because what happens is that they trap you, look, listen, by doing this any leader, Bharat Mata ki, now Bharat Mata ki Everyone will say Jai, it is natural, it starts with this only and this belongs to everyone, all the leaders, if you say Bharat Mata ki Jai like this then who will not do it, you should do it, I am not refusing also, okay now we will do this, after that then anyone else  And then slowly whoever is behind them, they say Jai to this person sitting and standing, so that atmosphere is created as if the car starts, first Bharat Mata ki Jai, then Jai to that person, then Jai to this one and then ultimately ours  I have to go and say Jai to myself, how do I say Jai Amit ji, Jai Guruji from Gurugram, so first I will say some good things like this, then you will say you are the rockstar or you Jai Jai, it happens like this, hey Jai to myself  You have to be smart, chant Bharat Mata ki Jai, after that he will say don't do it, now you know that this is a trap, this is a trap Whenever you are given respect for your self-esteem, whenever you are given useless respect which you yourself know that you do not deserve, every person actually knows his status, look, it definitely looks good, it looks very good, if any comment gets bad from me too  It doesn't feel good but if something good comes then it feels good, this is the truth of life but I have to train my mind in bad comments, it does n't break my heart in very bad comments and it does n't fly in the sky in good comments, okay, but it definitely feels good this much  also deny it but this is what you have to do so when someone is giving you too much respect which you know that you don't deserve then see through that bhaiya what does he want, we don't tell him, many times at home mom says it or  Wives or husbands, yes, what do you want, it means that today the elder one is behaving like this, but we get caught up in the emotions at home because we have to go in and out of those relationships, it is okay for us, but the leaders do not understand this  You have historically low self-esteem  They play with it, say yes, it's okay, injustice was done to my father, my grandfather, it's okay, such a thing is not happening to me, I will not think like this, I am not going to take revenge for my great grandfather in anything.  If it is not for you, then everything is going well for me now, who will keep changing everything, if something happened in 1800, 1700, 1600 then it did not change, oh brother, those people, whom people talk about, were out of power at that time also  He was as far away as he is today and you too were as far away at that time and as far away at this time. You should understand my point that you can maintain an identification relationship in the class, you did your work, if you cannot do it then you can do identification.  I am also talking about the fact that if there are people with very low IQ, you cannot do anything with them, so when you focus on that, revision is bound to happen, but if you make these 8 Haj divisions historical, then we  It is easy to deal with class because it will be homogenous  Because the class of people earning more than ₹ 1 lakh up to ₹ 2 lakh are there, there are so many earning from ₹ 50,000 to 1 lakh, there are so many rich and so many poor, all of those things can be seen properly by combining them together and there will be that much  No, you can go from one to the other, you can go from here to there, there is progress, but when you define your identity here, if I identify my identity only with my caste, the dominant caste of Haryana, some people of India  The number one real estate people have become ours, if it is okay with that then it is not he and me, if it is about identity then we are just friends, not brothers, friends, understand only then this casteism will reduce, you will have a friend who is like you, who works like you  He eats food like you, lives in a place like you, has aspirations like you, his struggles are like you, he is your friend, his identity has cut the cake like this, I am asking him to cut it like this, right? No, this is from God. So you will eat the cream one, yes brother the cream one  For the second one, for this the one below, for this I am asking you to do it like this, I hope that sometimes things become too abstract, but in this century someone in our country should talk about it, think philosophers in other countries should make the public aware.  I am giving topics to the people, I am not coming here and saying that I am the be-all and end-all and I am everything and I am the only one, I want you people to think about, discuss, think and how I am changing my channel.  The tagline is Let's change the way India thinks. It's time to change the way we think. The questions are different, thinking is different. Please share and like.
