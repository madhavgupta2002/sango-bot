Hello friends, there has been a discussion on Bharat and India, there has been a lot of discussion, many videos have been posted. First I thought I should post, then the world was posting, then so many videos were posted, then it seemed that if I had something to eat, then I had  is there still something to eat you I am sir you too must have your opinion on this thing so let's discuss it just like the world has discussed about India and Bharat, which one should be there, which one is more appropriate, so first this  India is a world, you can't call it British so soon. Yes, it is from outside, but India is not like the British who ruled over the 19th century, 18th century. You can go up to Megasthenes, when Alexander came, in his book, the word Indica and Indica starts.  had gone so this is an external word, I have said it but it is not that this is a new word, okay it is very old, very old, when Columbus went to Columbia, sorry, but we mean Columbus went to find India, he went to America  So he was coming to India, Vasco da Gama also came to India, okay, so let's understand this one thing, okay  The second thing is India is even older than that, India is even older than that, okay, while saying Bharat, you may have a little more feeling, but we will understand India and Bharat in the same way as if in our country, if we say India and also say Bharat, then we don't have two names for the child.  There is a pet name, father and mother call him. When he grows up and becomes mature, then he gets a name. Some people know him by some name, then some friends also give him a name, it is okay to have a nickname.  It goes your way, it becomes Sagwan Singh and should someone say something to someone with love, love should be reflected, basis should be reflected, it should be fun, is this debate good, I will not say useless debate, once you have yours, now you will know a little more in a different way  Let me tell you, I think you can see it like this that in India, there is a spiritual element of India which we stand for spirituality and all these things, spirituality is something which cannot be understood so easily, power cannot be understood at all, that element is old.  Yes, India, even this peacock has pea lipstick, we do not want India to disappear. We don't have to make India disappear. We don't have to say that this is Bharat. Both of these can be made interchangeable. Both the names are in the constitution. There is no need to pass any amendment, nothing. It is like it can be called by that name also.  You have to see that as it is said many times you have to reclaim things and many times it happens that there is a difference between change and reclaim like I have recently heard this thing from the story so I am telling you this thing  Let me give you an example, like many things changed, our Madras became Chennai, Kolkata became Kolkata, before that it was yours, so first of all if you look at our India, like Prayagraj, before that Allahabad was changed, so Prayagraj is not changed, it is Reclaiming of something, there is no need to do such a big thing in it and even now it is interchangeable and sometimes it changes anyway like Gurgaon and Gurugram are in the channel's name, you also have Gurugram brother Gurgaon so Gurgaon is like that  It was there only, now it has been changed to Gurugram, so the village is also a gram, right?  It is there and that good by the way in short form Guru is also done many times but even today people say Gurgaon only, people want to say whatever in simple language whatever they understand, many times you have made it Varanasi before that Banaras Before that there was Kashi, so even now the old people who understand, they call it Kashi, okay, there are people who call it Varanasi, there are also those who call it Banaras, so there is nothing wrong in it, just that there should be a fight over it, otherwise India is its  There will be a registry and no one from India is there in it, so this is a little different from what happened, otherwise someone would have asked why such programs were not conducted 40 years ago because now that narrative has to be given because you should think about this debate that is going on right now.  Yes it is more of a marketing debate that is also going on like Pepsi art or there are some two brands of this kind which are marketing with each other, so we have to do clipping, whoever has united India, he has to do clipping further.  n audience further away then this one from India and this also has to be clipped, there is fighting and quarreling like this in it  It is not in the name of the country, these debates that are happening and this set that is happening, this journey is turning, whenever churning is happening, the butter has to be extracted, then a little force is applied, that centrifuge force, center force and  That tightness and that separation, they are going through date changing today in the country, you should enjoy this turning because in no story, something or the other will change, something new will come and that form will change, you have to see, the same milk will be visible  It is the same that curd is formed from milk, from the same curd you are extracting butter, that butter exists, in that also curd is made from milk, butter is made from curd, so this is a process, this is good, this is a process, it is a dynamic situation, thing ahead.  It will work, there is no need to take stress in this, no need to take it, no need to give it, this is very good because now people are saying it again and again that I have to say one thing again and again and this is probably for the first time on this channel  Tell me, to be good something does not have to be big, if these people  If you understand this then many relationships will also get better. If you are a son and you are married and now you are a husband, then to be a good husband, do not become a bad son. This is the thing that is important today for the mother who is the sister and the wife who is the daughter-in-law.  Please understand son that this is not the registry of a plot which is being transferred in our name, this is our independence, this human being is capable of giving love and respect and protection and he will give it to his mother also and if he does not give to his mother then how can he give it to his wife  If he gives it to me then this day it will go into the mind of the husband and this insecurity will end which is better than a 25 year old because in that he gets relief from stress, he has to prove it to his son, now if I go for marriage council then that is why there are examples  These ones will come out of me, it's fine, but these are not practical examples, the citizen also has to see, if I have to say India again and again, then what does it mean, I am a guest of India, if I want to say India at some time or in some situation, then it does not mean that I am India World  Bill see yes in different way I see it like this India is inside us and  India is a third name too which is people lookable and respectable from outside and I will tell you one more interesting thing about India in this, now India is feeling like this that hey India has become like this because these opposition people have named it and made it India  You people are feeling shy, let me tell you, when India and Bharat became independent, then India was D premium number is like that, that is the number of the vehicle, when Maruti came, it was in red and white colour, when it was new, it was in red colour  - When it was new, the premium was of 5000 here, the white one came for 65-67000 and that one came for 72000, I am telling you the rate of 1985-86, you guys, Lal had a premium, so in this way there was a premium on India because Jinnah ji who  He is the founder of Pakistan because there was a lot of debate in India about the Indus Civilization Industries. At that time when the debate was going on about the name, our forefathers were the ones who were the constitution that is being made, it is one of the two.  You could have kept them because India was a continuity, the name of the new baby that was delivered is different, this is the mother country, you can understand it this way also, that time was free, you are from Pakistan For India Bharat, we should become India or if we make a mistake in its name then India was at its best in freedom, only then both these things have been written and there is nothing wrong in it, why would we eat rasgulla or kheer in it, we are saying both  Took the Rasgulla, you things, yes you can use it interchangeably, if you look at the names today in English and Hindi, then we do not say President House, we say Rashtrapati Bhavan in English also, if there is Defense Minister, then Republic of Bharat, if someone writes it, then it is fine now that  In our passport, Republic of India is written because this is an old season, Republic of India is written on it, but if ever you feel like giving an invitation to someone, then Republic is written as Bharat, so it does not have Bharat in it, I like the India I Bill thing.  Why brother, wear two colored shirts, sometimes wear a blue pen, sometimes wear a white one, it won't be enough now  You see, we do all this, we also take another name and I don't understand that the kind of environment that is going on these days and it is going on like that or whatever was going on, there is another name and that name was originally given by us.  It did not happen, it has been given by someone else, now what is its origin, no one knows about it, Hindustan Ritu Hindustan, I mean, nowadays, you should be Hindustan, no one is saying that, Hindustan also means Hindustan to it and they are very perfectly  Ok with Hindustan, it is also ours, when we say Bharat Mata ki Jai, then along with Bharat we add Mata, Bharat with Mata and one more is ours, but we also have another one which is very well pronounced Jai Hind ki si, Hind ki si  Jai Hind: Whenever we say Jai Hind, then Jai Hind is also a salutation used in the armed forces, used by people who are in uniform and it is also commonly used among normal civil population, also it's a very strong word, Jai Hind  So Jai Hind is also a relief, the victory of our Mother India is a relief and when the match happens then  India, India is also said in this way, India is also said in this way and in every place where the majority religion, which has the basic sense that everything is included, worship someone, consider someone as God, worship nature,  You can do it for any element, sun, fire, earth, water, okay, do it for any tree, every animal or bird, do anything, if there is so much inclusiveness in it, then what is this name in it, I  I am saying, the name of Hindustan should also be given a little more importance, it should be called India, Bharat, Hindustan, okay, before that, other names can also be used to become original, if they are not on the tongue that much, then it's okay, otherwise these three are  It can be done very easily and India and Bharat are written in the constitution, it is written officially, so as if it has become the official name, anyone can do it, it should not be done like this that what is written on your Aadhar card, what is written on your pen, our big  okay so both things are written in the constitution both things  has its own element, different in both, that has come, Bharat Ratna means a thing that is ongoing, okay, so it tells about the continuous dynamic system, which is the continuity of civilization, it is a big thing, it is a deep thing, but India is also its own thing, it is also an old thing, you can understand it very clearly  Just say it like this that no, you are not tight about this like something, you are doing it on WhatsApp group, you are doing it on Telegram, there is continuity, tell me how did you like this video, there is no need to get into trouble for everything because when we go on choice like this  that this is the good, I always repeat this dialogue, one line, take away from this, for something to be good do not make another thing bad, if people are interested in everything, people are interested in their religion that if your religion is good, very good, Priya then  No other religion has to be spoiled, for your religion to be good, your country is very good, national nationalism, patriotism is very good, so for your country to be good and progress, no other country has to be spoiled, these are the elements which are present right now  Vasudev family was inside G-20 ok family type okay so when this essence is there then it is the sense that I should also progress and others should also progress this is not such a thing it is not a zero sum game of light brother this is here but one arc one day after tomorrow meaning  If you are trading then it is not like you lose money but somehow you get money, life means that yes everything can exist, everything is good, okay, India is very good, India is also very good, someone has given it some name.  It does not make any difference, I liked the marketing strategy but if you still take my opinion, then there are many things that you do not equate with date, I mean I am being smart because this was the opposition party  He did n't do any smartness just like that, all his smartness was happening here, he was going on the internet, but he went into such a field that it did not matter forcefully, when whatever is the name of your country, you are giving it an acronym. Now if someone applies a little bit of brain then Bharat vs Start B will start from then  Just spend a couple of hours to get something out of the ARAT, there is a program from B, you know what it is, okay, it will be done, then make it versus dog, what foolishness are you doing?  According to me, it was a little bit according to that calculation but if there is a marriage, and these aliens are formed like this, they change 10 times, change their name 50 times, first they used to say Up, then Up 1 Up 2, then their NDA, then  This is India, then these people are arrogant and all this is your creativity, think about it, its ad is running and it is just a fight between Axel and Ariel, or it is between Pepsi and that, this is just happening, we will fight a little on this,  Sometimes I do n't understand till date that sometimes we fight that Bhartiya Mittal ji is very good or Mukesh Ambani ji is not so good, why fight like this that I don't have any other business, Jio and Airtel are the service providers Jio provides a service, Airtel provides a service, keep the number of the one you like, number portability  If you want to do portability, do it brother, do what you like, I keep saying this again and again that all politicians, every party is a service provider, that brothers and sisters, if we will give you something, then who fights on the service provider, service provider, whose service  If you like it then change the button for the next 5 years, if you don't like it then change it and you get so many opportunities in between also, elections are bound to happen in your state also, those are yours and again and again no, no  Sir, write about it daily, if it is Airtel's service, Airtel's service is bad or Jio's service is bad, if it is becoming useless then change it, yes we have one day, two days, five days time to change many things, there is a notice, we can do it  There are many things which we can change in five years as per the constitution, this is a difference because the government cannot change every day, power cannot be changed, elections cannot be held every day, so just do it, you have made a mistake, you can rectify it next time, it is okay, have patience  Keep it, you can improve it in the assembly, if it does not happen in the assembly then I can improve it, not in the municipality  If it happens, you can do it in the Sarpanch, do it in the ward, how many opportunities do we have and give it to each one separately, every friend is definitely a brother, you are an enemy, you should be careful about this, this question, this society can be done like this also, you can do all the things  So the purpose of this channel is that I want to make you and our countrymen relax a bit, there are so many hypermarts, it is not that much, you will live here for 70-80 years, out of which only 40 years are less.  The last 10 years are like a gift to me, the first 15-20 years of life are not in your control, you have 40-6 years in which you have a lot to do in your life, if you have that much time and energy in it then you can invest in these things  I am a channel which provides coolness and calm, this is to me again and again that you belong to this AAP party, now if I just mention the name then you belong to this party, you belong to BJP, you belong to Congress, if you come together then Left East Communist  Tell me brother I am not Shikha, I am not a member of any political party Disclaimer I am not a registered member of anyone. Which one do you like? I like one thing of some, I like something else of some and I like something else of some, if it were up to me I would say that brother, his party's  He should become the prime minister, but this party's finance minister should become this one, if this one goes, then okay, then if my mother leaves, my heart demands this, they come in a package, they make us unfortunate, it is possible that our country may become like this in the next 20-30 years  There should be some system such that I am not like this, if this is a party then there are faults in this party, there are three categories or taxes, rest of the people are collected after asking the Bawdi and reaching home, no one likes it, okay, nothing.  If I were to ask you today for names of your ministry, whether it is your state government or this central government, then in the government there are less PMs and two government names, you would not even know the names, this has become the situation because  I don't know that name or not, I do n't understand that his visibility seems to be doing something, nor is there any feedback.  So you have to take it, I did this, now like we know the name of Gadkari ji, today on the road to N minister, how many other cabinet ministers are there, which one is looking after which one, do you know if I go to take the test here, then it means I too  I don't know which I am saying that I know how, I mean I don't have to give any exam, I need to go and gain knowledge, so brother, whatever you do, you will see understanding, you will see Sharan, now like Jaishankar ji, everyone knows the name.  Those who are visible, brother, all of them are present, so the pressure of 34 ministers is visible, rest down here, no one knows whether he is doing anything or not and it is the same in the state government as well, everyone knows the name of the minister, the rest of the matter  If it is like that then I hope you will understand this discussion in this way, subscribe to the channel, many people are giving good comments that they have stopped watching news channels and by watching this channel of mine, they get a lot of peace and clarity in life.  She is going out, I am telling her what to do in the internal space, what do we have to change  We have to enjoy, we are water, we are the public, we are the subjects, okay, we have to enjoy comfortably, we have to see, have fun and relax, we do not fight, we have to observe deeply because here from where to say India and versus Bharat, hey brother, both are our countries yes no one is different and we don't fight among ourselves like this okay please subscribe and like thank you very match
