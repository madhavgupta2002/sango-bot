Hello friends, many times a man is very happy that whatever he says, people listen to him and believe him. This is a lesson for all of us that we should never think like this in life. Who will listen to me, what idea has come into whose mind from where?  If you do n't know his address then my heartiest congratulations to Vikas, Divya, Kriti ji. She runs a coaching institute of Drishti IAS. A few days ago, a tragic accident had occurred. Three students had drowned in the basement. I had made a video of that. You all had seen the video.  I always make it two, four or five days late. I do what people don't say. In that video, I had said a very big thing. I had said why all these coaching institutes and all the children are stuck in that place, Old Rajendra Nagar, Mukherjee Nagar. I said  That is a rubbish place, no good can ever happen there. You are getting into the trap of doing this, giving that license, doing this, doing that, doing this, doing that. I told you to go to Noida, get out, now that has been made, the announcement has been made.  It has come, I am very happy that if Diva Di Vikas Divya Kriti ji is going, then others will also do it, this video is an appeal to everyone  Let it be Mukherjee Nagar, Old Rajendra Nagar, those people used to suck on rent there, they will all get settled there because no facility has been given anywhere and this is going to be a different politics in Delhi, my video is going to be made, if you want that That Arvind Kejriwal and Delhi and Delhi 's future and Delhiites are painful for them but it is a truth if they want it, if you are from Delhi then please do write this thing in the comment section but the thing that I am going to tell you  I am listening to this, what will be the benefit of this, in reality, it is not that Noida will also be expensive, you should also look at Greater Noida from Noida, the ecosystem there is still better for rent, if you pay â‚¹1 there, you will get a  You will not get a cramped room, you can get a decent small flat of one BHK or two BHK, the air will be better, the security will be better, there will be no classes in the basement and you can take the premises in a proper way, it is a very good thing, however what about the real estate  It will not make any difference, what will happen to Gurgaon, I will tell you on a different channel  I will tell you because ultimately the genre is that of students and there is no purchasing power but still you should leave Delhi because if you go there tomorrow, it will be even better there and it will be fun to live there, it will be fun in a clean and tidy place like this So even the parents can shift there and they can also stay on rent and there can be better preparation for the child, so it is a welcome step, I felt very good that I had a contribution in this and I gave importance to it from the very beginning because nobody can give an idea Stop an idea whose time has come and I always believe that there is an idea and its time has come, I cannot take credit for it alone, it has to happen but its time will come, it will come out of someone's mouth, someone will listen to it, someone will hear it  It will reach him by doing that. Similarly, if you see the ideas that I have given on my channels till date, I give them on different channels as well, you guys can tell me by texting me or connecting with me or in the comment section, yes you had said so and I always  I tell you that what I am saying, you will see it happening in two, four or six months.  That is why I am saying that in life, the size of the needle is enough to take out air from a balloon and you people also write in the comment section, the platform is important for us, we should not do such a thing that nothing happens, it is logical  Things will always happen, don't despair, now when there will be no basement, no coaching inside Mukherjee Nagar, no one will live there, then it will not happen by accident, our problem is that we have to fix everything, many times many things cannot be repaired beyond economical repair.  There is no economy in it, you cannot drive it, many times the vehicle breaks down and it has to be thrown away, you just cannot drive that, many times your knee will get damaged, you are 65-70 years old and you are not able to drive, so knee replacement surgery will have to be done.  It has to happen, now you cannot cure it by doing Ayurveda, by going here, by injecting, by applying oil, by doing some Pranayam, so the same thing happens in many things, it is very good and I am concentrating satisfactorily on this because in this, I cannot work satisfactorily with just the social thing  Take membership of the channel Chai Pe Charcha Wali  Look, I will plan something separately for them so that we can create more impact as a society. The membership fee is very low but it is a transactional exchange. If you offer Rs. to someone, or if you offer Rs. 101, it does not make any difference. Isn't it, energy gets exchanged, so it is the same thing, so you can take Chai Pe Charcha membership if you don't have membership of any of my other channels because I provide that facility with all of them, but this one is my cheapest membership They are more expensive than these, so this will be a bit more towards social issues and you will see some videos first or you will also see some exclusive videos when the members increase and there can also be members only live webinars, workshops, something or the other can happen, so it is great.  It will remain and how do we consume politics, how do we consume our affairs, what are the economic things happening, what is happening in politics, it is a great art, we just cannot run away  Because it is being discussed everywhere, it is being discussed there, it is being discussed here, they will spread an atmosphere of despair everywhere, they will do this, we do not have to have emotions, yes, they move and wake up, but anger and hatred do not take us anywhere, give justice I  Wanting justice cannot be done, one has to give an idea, people keep on saying justice, sometimes it is fine, the one who has to do justice to the case, that is it, but the common man gets angry from within and gets BP, it becomes something else in practical  Talk about whatever is possible, I always tell them, low hanging fruit, go from Mukherjee Nagar to Rajendra Nagar to Greater Noida, Noida, low hanging fruit, don't even use your mind, there are chairs, tables, tables, you will go there, it will be already ready, it takes two minutes Clapping is for Vikas Divya Griti ji that you have taken the decision because why, why to be in their circle, the fire NOC will not come, MCD's is here, go there, go here, the date is becoming like a lot, it seems like this in many places in Delhi that Delhi became Gurgaon in this affair  I have lived in Delhi, if all this happens in Delhi, then personally I will probably benefit from the investments, if the garbage is dumped in Delhi and the people of Delhi come out, then it is beneficial, Nad Greater Nad will also benefit, Gurgaon has been getting better for a long time. But still it is a matter of pain, I want to make a video for it for the people of Delhi that it is disappointing that this is happening, still I will tell why this is a problem and Kejriwal ji also has a role in this, Aam Aadmi Party, Kejriwal and  This is everyone's role, beyond that, if you want to make an open video that there is no need to talk about anything, what happens is that an atmosphere is created against the BJP that everyone starts speaking against the BJP, no friend, it is not like that, now you will see me in Bengal  While the videos of this are also coming I have done a lot of research on that as well at least talk to the Doti Haj people there now talk, I mean not one by one I mean talk in a way what is happening, how is it happening because  Mahua Mitra ji and Abhishek Banerjee look very good there, it seems so in the parliament  Yaar, it is very very good and here BJP, Modi ji, oh, he has spread his influence there and people there told me, Guru ji, you are the same, neither BJP is great, nor Aam Aadmi is great, nor Congress is great, nor TMC is great, Someone is very bad, everyone has something of their own, we too the public have to analyse everything, this is what is called an independent thing, there is nothing neutral, there is nothing neutral, if there is something wrong, then if you go completely against it, then it will seem that you are biased  Then sometimes you will go here, sometimes you will go there, the independent thing is that no one is telling you about this thought process, this will be called independent, otherwise there will be some nonsense, someone will say something absurd, if something is wrong then a voice will be raised against it, behind the raising of voice there is someone else and  did not say that you should raise your voice against him and do something, he is independent and here is youtube0 in which people like Vikas, Divya, Kriti ji played a role because they are very popular and they heard all the noise that was happening.  Someone was saying in the noise that you are useless, I  I made a video in it that Vikas ji, you do not need to give 10 lakh rupees, I am not in your basement, everyone is creating a ruckus, they are doing this, they are doing that, you are being cornered and I, although I told Vikas, Divya, Kriti ji  You people see the content in many things, I do not agree with them, I do not believe that nothing else will happen, it will be an experience, I don't agree with this philosophy, yet I defend in that video that friend, it is forcibly just a man's name and it is popular  Will he become that face, I had defended him there and I had also suggested and now like Vikas Divya Kriti ji, I myself had said in it that very learned people and scholars should never be ridiculed in the country because then  He remains a fool, so I gave him a constructive advice and that advice bore fruit, which gives me a lot of satisfaction and it makes me feel that if you give advice to someone with a good intention, then he will understand your intention.  It seems clear and logic is seen in it and the benefit is seen, it is beneficial for the society, it is beneficial for our own coaching institute, it is beneficial for the children, so I make only such content that why not that thing which is beneficial for everyone, many of our things are like this  It is where there is some fight and quarrel that this will be beneficial, this will be disadvantageous, now those things take time to resolve but where we can build a consensus, brothers and sisters, that I too, gradually feel I will become a politician while speaking like this  No, then after that it will be done, vote for crocodile, okay, party symbol is fine, then I will leave it at this, but we have to spread this positivity also, brother, solutions exist, keep the thought process clear, now it will be a lot of fun, it will be very beneficial Greater Noida should become an education hub, Noida should become an education hub, now all of you should reach there, all of you should reach there, leave everyone there, everyone should go away and Noida and whoever is in Noida, Greater Noida, UP, BJP government, Yogi ji's government, Yogi ji's  Are the officers listening, is Yogi ji listening or someone please welcome it like welcome come here Modi Ji had welcomed him when he had shifted Tata Motors to Anand when it was going on in Singur, Allah immediately welcomed Ratan Tata Ji with a rupee please start, so if we have to do it in the same way, then Greater Noida will be Noida immediately.  The doors have to be opened, come in the first year, this discount, that discount, this fee is not there, that tax is waived, this is waived now, now I am saying, open it, open the treasury, come, you are most welcome, come, settle down once, we will take care of the tax later.  Tax, okay, come once now, at least at least at least and what are the students, most of them are from UP and Bihar, most of the students from UP and Bihar come, so what is the problem, you have to catch a train and come from somewhere, I don't know, from Patna, from Supaul, from Bastar  From Ara, Munger, Tihari, from where do the children come? From there they come to Delhi. What is the difference between Delhi and Noida? You will live in a clean place, you will live like a human child, you will live in hygienic conditions, you will be a little happy, there will be productivity and if there is safety, then very  good so it's a good thing for society we all should  Feel happy some times ok as subscribers you should feel happy as a content creator I am feeling happy I am nore Vikash ji is going to do a good job there and others are going to follow suit and it is good for everybody and please UP Govt UP government should take cognizance of this, you should take cognizance, it is good for you and vacate Mukherjee Nagar and Ranar, some other work will continue to be done, whichever needs to be done, but this work will not be done, get out from here, all the students should get out.
