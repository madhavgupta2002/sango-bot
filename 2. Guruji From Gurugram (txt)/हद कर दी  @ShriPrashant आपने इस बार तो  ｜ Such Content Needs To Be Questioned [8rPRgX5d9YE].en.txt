Hello friends, this video is being made because a video short of Acharya Prashant ji has come, I will try to get you to see the link in the comment section so that there is a reference to contact, it will take only a minute to watch that video, but anyway I will tell you  yes, what is he saying in this video and I am talking about this topic, friend, you have crossed all limits, Acharya Prashant ji, you have crossed all limits this time, when we got busy with the elections, we got a free run from there because every  I used to make a video in 15-20 days and keep checking it. Now I felt that this is your small channel, nothing happens with it. No matter how big the balloon becomes, the needle is enough to take out the air from it, so I then use that needle.  I am working because the balloon has again spread a lot. That video, if you have any desire, you are married, you are a bachelor, you have a child or not, you are old or young, of any community, religion, caste, colour, anywhere you come from, it will hurt you.  This is my claim, I am in pain that is why I am making it, you tell me whether I am making it right or not He deserves the video because he will get a free run, no, in that video Acharya Prashant ji is saying that he was travelling by plane and a couple was sitting behind him and their child was crying and he was telling him  The child is crying like an animal and I am being tortured, that is me, they are not able to sleep, friend, why are you calling a human child an animal and if someone is crying, so what if the child is crying  So what kind of Guru are you that if you have such a thing, I say that a self-styled Guruji is becoming a reality, I say that within a radius of 10-15 meters of me, if any person or his child is crying, then he will become silent, tell me.  I will make you quiet for a minute or two; it may be the reason, it may be the pain of life; in two minutes that child was crying, so you just had to tell him to do wall salwa; if the child cannot do it, then you will act; the child copies him a little  He was big and had grown teeth so we would give him something to eat. As soon as he ate biscuits and chewed something he would jump into the air.  From here the pressure gets released, this is the reason for most children crying, but how do you know, you follow a big science, astrology is a nonsense thing, right, you are an old  Books, knowledge of other things, there is so much knowledge that it keeps dripping, 15000 videos have been made in 12500 videos, in each one they are shaming the same person, if they give birth to a child then where will they read Gita, where will they do some great work  I mean reading a book has become a great thing, if it is such a great thing then you have made 14-15000 videos of them, I know a lot of them, they must be watching it too and they have such an army of 5.5 crores that they are the number one YouTubers of India.  So you must have seen that the troll army will come together like this, it's absolutely fine, I know I too am doing the work of throwing stones at the beehive, but many times you have to do this that you tell me why you have a playlist  Why do n't you make 10, 20, 30 videos of the knowledge of Gita Ji?  If you have the capability to make 15000 videos, then you can make 10, 20, 30 also. Chapter number one, shloka number one, the meaning of its knowledge is this, we understand this, finish the work understanding this, the world will come and see itself, the work is finished, you have read it again and again  If you have read it, then you have understood it. Friend, this is narcissism, spiritual narcissism or narcissism of knowledge that I have read four old books. If those books are so popular and great, then make an app of it and let the public read it.  Why doesn't our country become super successful yet? Hey, you don't want to read, you read it well and then where will you go? I have read it, I myself do not condemn those books or that knowledge at all, I have read it myself, knowledge comes out from it, yes but then 2024  It will be explained as per the instructions, I will read four books, or you don't know anything, you don't know anything, either tell me directly, friend, we also sell courses, we also send courses, we also send workshops, we also send webinars, we also send knowledge  but coming into it this  It doesn't happen that when your gym is open you start body shaming everyone, hey, your belly is protruding, this tyre is like this brother, he is lifting the load, his legs are lifting it, what problem are you having, it is happening after eating his father's food  He wants to die, why are you body shaming him so much, you can tell him that hello friend, if you in case you require a gym, I have got this gym, this is the address, this is my membership fee, do it like this friend, you all are bitter about India  There are a lot of bitter people in India, they have become bitter magnets, bitter and frustration magnets because a lot of people are not getting jobs, it's a fact that a lot of people are not getting married, a lot of people are having relationship issues.  There are so many people in it that I ask why are you doing the job, those are his videos, why do you watch them now because brother he has 1.5 crore subscribers, there is a theory going around that although his videos get only 1.5 to 2 lakh views, they don't even get 1 percent of the views.  It's a different matter that it happens to me many times How can it become crores because if it is one and a half crores then brother the views should also be visible, this Chutku channel of mine also gets 26, 27, 27000 subscribers, I get 203 thousand views, which means there is some match, now I am sitting with 27000 subscribers  And if the views come in 25-30 ratio, then he will say who is 27,000 brother, if you get only 100 views, their 1.5 crore views are coming in the same ratio, if you see, one and a half to two lakh views come, then what is the percentage  It is less than % and still the message will be challenged, how much strength is there in the message, it is not there, it is necessary to question more than how many people it reached, do not give birth to these children, job is not a big thing, do some big work and big work  What does it mean, joining with you and promoting you and selling books worth Rs. 100 is that a big job, isn't it? I do this because I want to expand the organization, not you, we have a very big purpose, we want to expand the earth.  We have to save the earth for whom do we have to save it, the earth will save itself, we just have to save ourselves, save our minds and do practical things in our lives, it will happen like this friend, this is right, we should not talk about global warming  What do you want? When a child is born, 10 lakh trees are cut down. What kind of calculation is this? If 10 lakh trees are cut down because a child is born, then if this happens, then there are 800 crore people in the world, so 800 crore people will be benefited by 10 lakh trees.  If you multiply it then either the earth will become a jungle, everything will be destroyed, the earth will become a jungle, you leave any garden unattended for four months and see what happens, who is there to maintain the jungle, all this very high-fi talk to control the whole world  She will do it and all the men will feel that you are saying the right thing, it is something like this, mother at home, get up in the Brahma muhurta, get up in the morning, do your work like this, you should eat food like this, oh brother, you can do whatever you want after drinking nectar  did not come in 80 and 90 years  Everybody will go away, no matter how much knowledge you impart to anyone, but if you are a Guruji, some glow should emanate from your face, instead of frustration I say that if anyone is within my 10-15 meter radius, I say that you are watching my video, my webinars, workshops  I can stop the crying of your life, I have the power to silence a child who is crying inside, tell me what is there in you, then tell me practical things and take you all to knowledge  You are taking me to that knowledge, what will happen next? It is like you come there, this has become a cult thing, it's just a cult, just because no one gets knowledge from parents at home, they don't get a job, they don't get married sexually.  Starwak, if sexual emotions are awakening in you, then it is a very dirty thing, animals do this, so since when did animals become bad, this is physical pleasure, such extreme words, so much body shaming, calling sex dirty, calling masturbation dirty, and this porn  ko pon ko extra woh kar bhaiya  hey hey, try it and get rid of it. I am not saying that you should see it everyday, but putting so much guilt in everything that you saw something, something happened, what should you do next, grow a beard, put your hair back like this, apply gel, and now wear suit and boots.  Wear it for a while, first wear that one, now wear this one, then come and conquer every stage, then you will get a degree from IIT IM which lakhs of people have done till now, go and weave it, what do you do now, after that get a government job  If you catch hold of it and then let it go, then this is the biggest claim in India for a government job, not that if you leave a government job then it is a big sacrifice that, hey brother, it was a job so I let it go, no, I didn't understand it, it does n't matter how much bread I ate from it  If any man will take it, I will leave it, okay, hey you are in IIT, hey the IIT guy doesn't know wall salwa, he doesn't know that there is pressure in the ears, yes, when the plane takes off, where is the differential pressure, the air wave gets trapped, take the old knowledge  But Oh my God, the youth are realizing what all is going to happen  it is there but what can I say to them also like pied paper someone will take the rat like a rat will go behind it will take it down the hill what will you do then tell me there is no one to say anything, no one to stop, no one to interrupt and then straight down now  The first comment of the troll army to me is, what have you uprooted in your life? It is not necessary to uproot anything in life, although I have uprooted a lot, but still why should I tell, I am saying my knowledge, my, whatever I say is mine.  My logic, my face, the light of my face, my comfort, comment on this or comment beyond this, frustration comes and the bitterness increases on hearing this, or I am pouring cold water on the useless pan that I have kept heated, which was a very normal thing in our life, very normal  Things like growing up, studying, getting a job, getting married, having kids, getting a house, travelling, struggling and dying, have made this thing such that, oh this is a very trivial thing, today I am predicting that after 5 years, 7 years, doing this would be an extraordinary thing.  It will happen, keep doing what you are doing because you will become the minority.  All this intelligence, wisdom, consciousness, you will see left unmarried, divorced again, divorce, unmarried bachelor, some wisdom, wisdom, consciousness, you will not find any normal man already, if you are listening to me at the age of 253, then you should know that after 5 years, the 25 year old becomes 30.  30 will go to 35 look at your left and right if you do five jobs a normal job goes to hell I also know that jobs are going to hell in marriage too children are there in that too and so people say that if it had gone to hell  So why do we have to do it, oh brother it is sustainable, it will give purpose, whatever is there in life, life is meaningless, no one tells us this, these books, religion, spiritualism are also a way of giving meaning to life, there is no great meaning when there is too much science  You will understand that you will gain a lot of knowledge, you will gain a lot of knowledge, then in reality it will feel like this but we do not do it so that life can be sustained, otherwise it will not make any difference even if the population of this earth is halved  It should be doubled, I am not able to see any difference, it seems that some resources will be available, this will happen, this is just a way for people to stop each other's progress by saying that we have already destroyed you, so called we will not let you do this because right now we have to destroy the earth  We have to save the earth the earth will save itself this is the message we should not be so worried we have to bring an old wisdom in everything vedanta vedanta vedanta this is a startup please tell that you are from an IIT and people like you are from IIT  People do good startups, you have chosen this startup, it's nothing but a startup, it is a good startup, why wear this mask brother, tell me, this is our startup, we have 5.5 crore followers, we do this work, do it like this, why are you all being so shameful  Why are these bitter people being forced to reach somewhere, their subscriber, their follower, whether he comes back at 38, 39, 40, will he come to me only, it will come to people like us only, but yes it will come after 8-10 years, then after 8-10 years, brothers and sisters  we also have 5  There will be crores of subscribers but then why is it not happening right now, why not, he has not yet got disillusioned there nor has he reached there after getting disillusioned from everywhere, now when he gets disillusioned from there too, then he will come to know that friend,  It becomes known like there is a story of Buddha that he returns back to his home, Siddhartha was like a prince, so he returns back to his home after six years and he comes to his home to beg after doing alms, then his wife is there, she asks  He was asked, brother, why did you go there? He would say, I had gone for knowledge. OK, so he would say, knowledge could not be got at home, it could not be got at home. He would say, yes, it could be got there. Then he would say, why did you go there? He would say, it would be known after going there.  I got to know about it there, so this happens with many people that you will get to know about it, so like me, I am already telling you about many things, you will get to know about it by roaming around, then you guys should watch the interview of Randeep Hooda ji or Vivek  Intellectual Randeep Hooda ji is ours, he is a film star from Haryana and he is openly saying that friend you should have done it earlier  karna hai bya boo balak balk chahiye why do you want to discover he can still go through that thing at 47 48 49 what ever his age is around 48 40 because he looks young he is rich he has the money his body is also fit thik  If it is there then they will still pull off, they will still reset the meter, but brother, the rest of the people get finished, by 47-48 the whole body will become weak, where are you people waiting, where will you find someone, so please, please  Please spread this thing a little and don't fall for the question that the person who is giving the knowledge, which knowledge will bring happiness, what will you do with the happiness, then something will happen, hey, at the age of 80, one should ride a car and a bicycle, I will ask how many children should girls have  The same is not happening with our new women, go and scare them that what is the benefit of doing this, there is nothing better than giving birth to a child in this world, I am telling you this, do something  How much rocket technology you do, how many books you read, how much that you do, oh this Acharya Prashant ji which society will you serve, that society will not exist, Nannu's father, Nannu's mother is the society whose example you take of Nannu as I say Rohit  yes that is their nu if there will be no nun then from where will the happiness come what happiness, hey look a child is a form of God so as a child is, I will tell us some things about that also in detail but at this point of time I  I want you all to call out this nonsense, my subscribers, if you feel like this, then write in the comment section and share this video because it is possible that you are married, it is possible that you are living a normal life and  I am not conflicting with what he is saying but if he has said that because marriage has its own challenges, everybody knows, I am also a relationship consultant, when these things come into it, then all men will face this and if they had not done this, it would have been better not to do it.  there are many many issues if you go beyond them Sometimes if you want a webinar workshop or a long one-hour video or a long live on youtube2, then someone puts it up, although so many photos are dangerous, the drinkers will still drink, but if there is someone else who talks contrary, then I get troubled by their tone and tenor  It is the most common in the way it is trivialized, if you want to make someone slim then you cannot body shame him, tell him calmly that friend you weigh so much that you are unable to play like this, otherwise do it like this so forcefully because people like us  Isn't it brother, I have also been a bachelor, it's not like I got married as soon as I was born, I have been a bachelor for many years and I am married too, so brother I have seen both sides, well, those who haven't seen the other side can come and see the other side  If you open your mouth so much, we won't let you open it, long live the married people, okay the married people will speak again, just like they say, they chant slogans, Jai to all the married people, Jai to all the people with children, they will not say anything, what would a bachelor say, some great work done by being married  Otherwise being a bachelor is not a great thing, you name four bachelors and this one did a great job  He did it, he did it, he did it, the bird flew, this flew, that flew, okay brother, if 1000 people have done great work in this world, if you write their names in history, then 970 were married and only 30 were bachelors, you can try it somewhere  Pick up the president of any place, pick up a scientist from somewhere, pick up a philosopher, pick up a guru, pick up whichever actor you want, pick up from any place, pick up from any stream, pick up from politics, pick up from leadership, pick up a king, you can pick up actors. You can pick any professionals, doctors, Hajj were top people, they were married at 97, brothers and sisters, how long will you keep eating bread by taking the names of those 30 bachelors, just because Indian politics has become like this, I am telling you in Indian politics also, we need a person  Now I have said that there is no choice, both of them are such, the choice will come, it will come, if it does not come today, it will come at some time, make it in America, make it a stick, the whole family is needed in America  Because America knows what we have done to our country. At least our leader's family should be seen. The British or anywhere else, they know the importance of family in the western world because we don't know because our family is on our head.  When this goes away and everything comes to an end then you will remember your family, friends, family is the ultimate thing, brothers and sisters, you can change your country, you can change your citizenship, you can change your religion, but you cannot change your family, the biggest thing in this world  Family is the biggest thing of all because it cannot be changed. What is bigger than something that cannot be changed. People are changing their gender these days. In western countries, a man becomes a woman and a woman becomes a man.  Do you know what kind of system is going on where, a person can change his religion like this, you know it takes 15 minutes to change religion, you know the citizenship gets changed, brothers and sisters of the country get changed till the border, I know one  I met a man whose surname was Roy and he told me that his grandfather had seen three countries in his life time and used to call them home  The address of the house did not change, the address of the house remained the same, earlier it was Hindustan before independence, then it became Pakistan and then after 71 it became Bangladesh, so that person kept living in the same house throughout his life, the country does not have a postal address of three  I have seen the times changing, so I am saying that we have to promote one family at the top, family first, there is a big problem because people have made nepotism so dirty in politics, that is why all these families are coming into politics Structure of the family: Hey, the smallest unit of the country and the society is the family. Something is made from the family only, like there are cells in our body, everything else is made from the cells. At the bottom of our body are the cells. If you go into any structure below that, then  Atoms and electrons move to that level, similarly there is a family in the society, if some structure of the family breaks down, then the society will collapse and those who put any other thing above the family are taking you in the wrong direction. Remember how many people agree with this theory then write in the comment section whatever you feel, write and I know who you are Are you will also define what views you also have, so what do we care, the normal man in the family, poor guy, he can't even open his tongue because he is under so much pressure, these people who are standing, they have a lot of energy, friend, they can do anything  They will come and say anything, then they will say that I am leaving with my bag, bye bye tata, you will take the bag and go, I cannot go anywhere, it is okay, I cannot go anywhere so soon, so I can take the bag here. So I picked up the bag from here, said something, went there, said something, went somewhere, said something and then the roti of this thing as well, it is amazing, it is amazing or it is amazing, wow, wow, okay, please share it, it is very important, you should fulfill your duty, subscribe to the channel If I give you a little hint about my idol Ji, I want to change the way India thinks. I don't want the ideology of any political party. I belong to anyone. If my idol is Ji, then what will be the name of my party? If I ever launch it, then the family will come in  All the family people get together, family people, family party, okay, tell me what should be the name of the party, it should have family in it, the name is okay, family first, no one did it, it became clear during Covid that who anyone belonged to was not anyone, it was just family, family  It could not even happen, at many times unfortunately I came to know that bhaiya is family, no one comes, hey remember that time, bhaiya is our own, it was Dharmendra's movie, our own people are some baba, some guruji, some acharya, some leader, some  An actor is nothing, it's all nonsense, someone will take your votes, sell some copies, donate Rs. 100 to an organization, you will get calls for donations every day, hey brother, it's nothing, it's your family, there is no one above this and whoever is as he is, he should make him better.  I stop it, father is not good, children are not good, wife is not good, this is not it brother, keep yourself in setting up, put all your energy in awakening the intellect, conscience and consciousness and in listening to the hypocritical lectures of these politicians of the entire public, it is okay  You spend time listening to them, give half of that time to your family, life is heaven for us  Nasato hami nasato which one is it, this is it, heaven is in the family only no one else, just spend 40 50 percent of the time that you keep wasting on your own family, please share and like this video and take the family forward so that everyone can Jai to the married ones, Jai to all those who have children and we will cheer loudly who will cheer for you, no one will cheer for you, we only have to cheer for ourselves so let's cheer loudly and we will celebrate this, why should we do it brother, we don't go and shame the bachelors that you are not married  I am not worthy of anything, you could not be with you munna and what happened, there is nothing wrong, we do not feel ashamed or married people, we are sensitive friend, I did not get married, the other person did not get married, it was not his wish, it is no problem, it is not a big deal but All of you have gathered here and you will shame the married people that we live the life of animals, our children are animals and we cry and do this, we will not let this happen brother, this does not happen, no no no, it is wrong, it is wrong, wrong.  it is just wrong  You are not doing any big work. You are not doing any big work. What is the biggest work in life? To have children. The day everyone will come to know this, then it will be benefited the most. It will be good if you go to another 40 years and then you will go to that place.  It seems that fertility and its issues are there and ask the women who do not want to have children and they want to have children, how much pain it is because people like you have gone here and there and then they go and get that treatment, it is a very painful treatment and that  The lady still takes it because she wants to become a mother because at some point of time she realizes that bhaiya the ultimate is creating a life so if this thing is known in 2425 years then what is the problem, why do people do it this way and not others  It is said that if it is a good thing then stop speaking ill of it, so you go around giving your lectures on global warming and other things on every third video, if you follow Nannu then I will come to save Nannu and me  Leave all your channels and all your business  That if I have to do this work then I will do it, inflate the balloon every day, my needle is ready, spread it every day, whoever uploads the video every day, you have 45 crores, now how many will be 10 crores, I will keep sucking the needle every day with my 27000 brothers and sisters, ok, today you made the video  Today this indecency happened, take this counter video, reaction video, this reaction video, why, otherwise no one has the courage because brother you are sitting with so much, your organization is running, it is running in an organized way, there are people of yours and those who work in their organization.  You are doing it, right? Now you will say that I am misleading them. I am not forming my own organisation, nor am I asking them to join me. I am a capitalist man; I do not have any organisation. I do not give anything for free, I make no useless claims.  If I did, I would not have asked you to join me, but brother, you see, it has been six months, 10, 12 months, if you have become bitter, no one wants to sit with you, you cannot smile, do you call the people who cry animals or think  So brother, look who are you after?  Now you have to see that I will disillusion you if last time also I had made a video once and after that you had stopped talking to me, I felt very relieved by that because actually I too have to be taken somewhere else in life, I too have to be taken here  There is no need to get into trouble everyday, nobody wants it, it's okay but brother, if such videos of yours are made again then you should take care of it, treating the child like this does not suit a person like you, who is educated, running such an organization and a speaker of such old knowledge and those who  People have also heard it till now, like this video, share it and spread it to people, if you like the content of the channel then please subscribe to the channel, thank you very much
