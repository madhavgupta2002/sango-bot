Hello friends, understanding criticism in politics is a small unique topic in itself, we will discuss it because whenever there are political discussions, it is always there that Congress did it this way, BJP is like this, you are like this, these people did it this way, these people are like this, these people are bad. This is you know that criticism goes on, so whenever there is a discussion about two-three things about this, then this point will be useful for all of you, which I want to tell, like whenever someone tells someone about this, even a tattler says something about it  You can say that when it is said today that today's government is doing this or that, the ruling party is doing this, this is wrong, these people did it or not, then the next sentence of that thing should be that these  If people did it then what happened to them next, this is also a matter of discussion, if at any time if you look at Indian politics, if someone becomes very arrogant then someone rises and he has to suffer the consequences, isn't it so?  that he did not get any punishment or his vote bank did not go away or someone did not get marginalized  If the voting percentage did not go down or the whole thing was not wiped out, then that has to be told in front of that thing also that yes, it was done and one thing cannot always be punished because political party is like your Bombay Stock Exchange, Nifty, Bombay Stock  How many of the companies that were in the exchange 40 years ago are there today? How many are there in the exchange 30 years ago? And if you look at the indexes of Nifty and all the other indices, companies keep coming and going in them, so the index remains the same.  There is a number in the index and it keeps increasing and decreasing but the participating companies in it keep changing, similarly there are political parties, how many people in political parties have changed from here to there, if the same Congress is bad but that is the example of Congress's Haryana People accept that now he is contesting election from BJP ticket, so they cannot ask questions that if he did something wrong then Naveen General ji from Haryana, I will take the example of Haryana because it is understandable that Naveen Jindal ji is contesting election from BJP ticket.  are the congressmen are the ears of the congressmen okay congress is right now  The ticket was given to him after making the change immediately, okay. Secondly, he is a candidate from Sirsa; he has been the Congress State Committee President for many years and is their MP. Thirdly, Dharmveer Singh ji, he too was probably in the Congress before Bhiwani, then this AAP's Rao Inderjit  Yes, what I am telling you is only those who are contesting on BJP ticket, I am telling you by taking their names, they have given election ticket to Ranjeet Chautala ji, he too belonged to some other party, let's go to Congress.  Even if he was not from there, he has been imported from somewhere else, so the one who is supporting him the most, Kuldeep Bishnoi ji, he came from Congress, so do n't go by the name of parties, I mean, parties are only human beings.  There is just one person, now that person was here, he came here, so brother everything became good, so the question is that whatever criticism is there, I will tell you two-three aspects like I have a subscriber, you are Aam Aadmi Party  if you are disliking their policy then I  So I used to vote for these people, then whom should I vote for now? Here criticism is not linked with voting, there are no parties, there is not much choice everywhere, go to any place, you have to vote for one of them, but who said that the  You cannot criticize or listen to the party for which you vote. When will we change this thing brother? What has happened that if you are voting for a party, you cannot criticize it. I give so many examples to many people.  It may seem a bit like that but the fact of life is that any wife will criticize her husband for not doing the work, the vegetables did not come, the children's fees are not paid, the grocery store does not work, does not come on time or she complains to the neighbor's husband that in my house  It doesn't work in me, you will criticize the one with whom you have evolution, with whom you have attachment, with whom you have some link, now how much am I changing, this thing discussion, why should I criticize the one who does n't give me power, whoever comes to power  No, because it would be better if you keep whatever comes tight so that it works properly.  There is one party sitting here and we are criticizing the other, what does it mean brother, it could be that we want to always keep this party in power, disrespect all the problems that we are seeing, but do n't we say anything about that problem, do you talk about it with your  You do n't even tell any child to get up and do this, so what don't you like, do n't you have a relationship with him, do you not fight with your parents, do you not criticize them, then the parents can get criticized  There could be a husband, there could be a wife, there could be children, so has this politician become related to them as well, in our Haryana there is a saying, why do n't you take them, in why don't you take them  To task or in so much criticism because in the coming time, through my channel, whether I call it criticism or call it accountability, this will have to be done, you cannot say that no, as a commentator or as a common man  Some people are feeling something and someone is in power and you say that  If I criticized them, then criticizing someone means if they talk about nationalism, then they criticized Bharat Mata, if someone talks about Ram ji, then they criticized Ram ji, if someone talks about Hinduism, then he says good things about Hindutva  If you criticize them then you are not a good Hindu friend, what is this, however a good thing has happened, now if you criticize us even a little in the country, people do not say go to Pakistan, okay this is a good thing  At least it is okay, otherwise that also went on for a long time, so still very very, I would like to say that now the awareness of the public is increasing, the public should be ready to criticize and should also be ready to listen, are you also a worker of any party  So listen to the feedback that you are the one who is becoming that, we have to be devotees, we have to serve, give us a chance, we will become servants, we will become chief servants, we have to serve you, so you are the one, we are not saying that you should serve You are lying within us that Yes, we have to serve you a lot, so we are just telling you that the service is not being done properly, please serve me a little better and I am not enjoying it, if this does not mean that if you are a servant then behave like this and we will do our requested program  Listen, now many people will feel that now people are starting to get to know about it, now people are getting a little clear about my ideology because as I had told you earlier, it will take time to connect because this kind of content and all this is not happening, everybody is speaking here.  People are saying that this is ego, that is, if we look at Smriti Rani ji, either she is exactly like him or exactly like him, there is no in between, that I can go and ask Smriti Rani ji and take the example of a leader as an example.  I am telling you what you did, tell me exactly, 342000 toilets were built, everything was built everywhere, what did you do specifically, tell me what else did you do and how happy or unhappy the public is, how many people came and went, so the question is that criticism  So we will have to bear the brunt of telling the politician that the public is saying this Bullying will not work, if you ask questions then it is like bullying and scaring you and along with that unfortunately you voted for the person to whom you yourself cast your vote, then you cannot ask any question or should I bring the voting slip, how will I bring the proof, if I come after casting my vote then here such things happen  I will also show you that I have filed the election, now how can I tell you that under whose pressure I have come, you will not believe, and if you believe that under whose pressure I have come, then you will speak, then why are you speaking against him, oh brother, when you can speak against the parents  Yes, parents can speak against the children, mother-in-law can speak against daughter-in-law, daughter-in-law can speak against mother-in-law, the country is free, there is democracy, then why can't they speak, what is the problem in speaking, don't even speak, do n't open your mouth, don't say anything anywhere  He asked what is wrong, more taxes are being levied, facilities are not being provided, do this, do that, look at the politics, if the government and the ruling party already have so much power that they do not need the city's recommendation, then the government is already the king of democracy.  The government also has to  Citizens give away many rights of their free will freedom, even if there is freedom in the country that you can decide everything on our basis, they do not need any further support in that, you have expressed your support by voting for whomever in the election, only then He has been placed in power, now that he is in power, it is your job to question him from day one, why is he taking this in the cabinet, no, why is he not taking this, no, why is this not there, why has he taken this or this is what has to be done. And we can do this, we can put these positive ones on tenter hooks, they all should dance and move around like this, change this CM, you don't like it, I am telling you, if you do n't like the CM of Rajasthan, the people of Rajasthan are not enjoying it for some reason  If you are coming then tell brother that you should change that party, brother, you do n't have anyone else, why can't you say that, just because you have cast your vote, if you have voted for someone then it means you will give love, affection and respect to all his leaders, you have cast your vote, idea  The game of parties goes on according to their ideology, leaders come and go, so one  Did you understand the story on Idol Ji, did you like it? It's very good. But after that, the leader in whose name the story was given goes to another party. You will then follow him again and again. Many people do not go, many leaders move from here to there.  There are so many ex chief ministers of Maharashtra or any other place who changed the party, one party made them chief minister, their original party made them chief minister, what party can make them higher than that, only the prime minister can become, above the chief minister is the prime minister  So he was made the chief minister but still he was changed. So now what will you do with such people? Tell me what is their idol, who is going into what and how is he going. So as a democracy, we should be ready for this phenomenon in the public space.  One must be ready for criticism, one must be ready to answer questions and our leaders cannot run away by joking. My last video was also made once of Nirmala Cheetha ji in which she said, I am the, we are the sleeping partner government, we will not do like this.  Answer: Ha ha ha and you went away. No sir, madam, answer.  So you will have to answer, you will have to answer and what is this, I have seen a video of some politician, they were playing a year old video of Smriti Rani ji on some other channel, a journalist asked something, he was doing something with Dainik Bhaskar, so he said I  I will call your boss and tell him, and she is intimidating you by taking the boss's name, and I saw that video for the first time last year, I could not see it last year, now there is Ajit Anj or someone 's channel, their YouTube channel is very good, that's fine.  So I saw that on their channel and I was so shocked and that poor boy even lost his job, these politicians should boycott them, journalists should not even talk to them, ask them questions as if I am asking them, they don't care.  Just stop giving it, they will roam around helplessly, their own generals who ask them such questions directly, and didi, how is everything good, what do you eat, what do you drink, what is your energy, boycott them all, friends.  Stop watching the content is over and  Do n't go to the good journalists, you should not go, they will call you by saying namaste and say that they will get credibility, you are watching the interviews, what kind of podcasts are being given, I had told you about the whole election long ago, those who had joined after going for the last few months  I am not very happy, the times are fine, the youtubers and their think tanks also read the comments because if I come here and raise a topic in a content, then brother, it is possible that I have some agenda, they can say this, although my  There is no agenda but it is my claim that I do not have any agenda for or against a particular party but when you fill the comment section with your opinions then you are real people and when that message reaches these people then it will be  Whatever you feel like writing in one line, do write it down and it is monitored, I am telling you this and there are very few serious channels like this, I am also telling you that you are connected to this platform, you can go somewhere  You will not see any change anywhere, there is some big thing like you say, it is not moving, is it a stone or something, who is that?  We had seen the movie, Nawazuddin Siddiqui's role was in Maji Hai Kaun, he cut the stone by hitting it, so it is not that big a mountain, nowadays the matter gets settled quickly, so whatever you do, whoever you are  If you are connecting with a place, always write one word about that place like I am so and so from so and so place, that will make a big difference, yes I know it will take effort but I am also putting in effort, my channel is very popular and the place is also good  The business goes on but I am also putting in my efforts so you should also put in your efforts friend just right from where you join it will make a big difference that when you join with a real name and place then you are not a butt it is not that I have bought someone, that is you, you are a genuine person, the comment section of all my videos and channel is being read, this is my direct feedback from a top place, hence I have received this feedback recently, only from my last few videos Before I was telling you this, I too was feeling the same way, how do I know, but is it making a difference?  It is written in positivity, this is a request, do not abuse any leader about anything, it is very wrong, then the thing gets misinterpreted, if you write the name of any leader and write a dirty word in front of it, then it means the channel's credibility will be mine You are insulting me and the channel, I do not say anything abusive against anyone here, I do not create any excitement against anyone to provoke people and make them angry, I do not do that, I want to change practical things practically, which people seem to  It doesn't change, it doesn't change brother, everything happens, everything gets called out, everything changes, genuine feedback is not available in the market, even the leaders are worried that big people are giving them such fake ones, yes everything is fine, everything is fine, they have a lot of misunderstandings.  It happens, no one has the courage to get genuine feedback, so there are some agencies which check it like this and give genuine feedback, the Chief Minister changes due to their feedback, I am telling you, the sitting Chief Minister changes due to the feedback. that this is not coming by just saying it  There would be a documentation section of it, so first of all you should join my channel from inside in any way, and my request is one or two, not more than one or two subscribers, please add it, it's a journey, it's like asking for votes, that the journey is an influence If you stay connected after reaching the point, you will start seeing the difference, you will become a part of that, brother, neither did you go in the sun, nor did you get pushed, nor did you do much of that, nor did you make any noise, you kept on saying good things, kept on saying, kept on doing, kept on doing  Keep doing it and slowly slowly slowly slowly slowly things started becoming clear and these parties are going to come to power, here it is not a question of influencing votes, so one of my subscribers told me that friend this is a common  When he spoke about Aam Aadmi Party, I said that vote for whoever you want to vote for, you can condemn it. If someone condemns your party, it does not mean that you should not vote for that party. You like other things of the party and you like them but if you condemn them then  Whatever you have discussed, get clarity on that topic with your workers or leaders. Take it, brother, why are you doing it like this, why can't you do it like this, why can't we go to this level, why can't we do it like this, there is nothing in asking questions, criticizing and voting are two different things, just because I did not support anyone Criticizing him does not at all mean that I will not vote for him. In fact, I am saying that whoever you vote for, criticize him the most, ask him the most questions and call out every wrong thing he does. This is a vibrant democracy.  There is a basic need and we will have to change this thought process in this thing, so hope you guys liked it, please share, like, thank you very much
