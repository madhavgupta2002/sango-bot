Hello friends, today we will discuss that a new phenomenon has emerged from the recent election results. The chief ministers who have been elected after the election results are basically the chief ministers of all the three states - Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh - if you see, it is a master stroke.  By doing it as told, we will discuss it, we will do higher order thinking, there are two ways, on one side the section is saying that they do not have experience, then the opposition people cry about something or the other, which is good also they have to do something and on the other side  He is saying that he has made a party worker and given him an award, so that is a story that has been told, apart from these two, what is there that I see as an independent observer, what is the good for the country in that, what is the good for the common man  We will discuss what is the good of politics, see, in any state if there is a leader of any party and he becomes the CM and keeps becoming the CM or alternatively becomes the chief minister, then what happens to it, there are many camps  They start talking too much Yes, it gets created in English and many of these contractors and this money giving and this system is all set up from top to bottom and corruption gets institutionalised, it becomes easy when you change one person, right?  Then this does not happen now, this is a very good thing and it shows that a change can be made next time, other benefits of this are that the politicians who are big or who were a little less big than the big ones, theirs too will be benefited.  I was disillusioned that anybody can be brought anywhere at any time and made a person and it can be shown that if the intention is right then it is much better than me not trying to malign the Chief Minister who has been here.  As far as the system was concerned, but you, my mature audience, will understand that there is a well-oiled machinery in all these things, taking their names, their sycophants, MLA sycophants, minister sycophants, lower officials sycophants, that is the entire system. now if this one comes then this  Everyone will be happy, now who will be happy with their arrival because their system will be formed, it takes many years to form a system and in those many years, inform them and then change it, now tell them Bhaiya, we will give you this post in the organization  We will make it for the party and you will have to do this. This is a very welcome thing. It is not being celebrated as much as it is a welcome thing because those who have done it cannot even say this thing openly that how beneficial this actually will be for the country if every  Party and from this you can see one thing that those who are in opposition do not have good discipline and when their party high command itself does not have any power, here the party high command has so much power that they themselves are saying the name with their finger on lips.  One can get to know about the next chief minister in one way, that the entire double engine government which is called double engine government, will run only when both the engines run in the same gear, one is running in second and the other in fourth.  It is like a ship has two engines, right, they should run in sync, something in one engine  If there is an issue of thrust and one of them is doing it then this will happen, which means the plane will not be able to move properly, it will roll or something, I will not teach aerodynamics here, I will not take a class on how the engine thrust works, but what am I  From trim two, if there is anything, its coupling should be proper, even a double engine government will run only when both the engines run in sync with each other and not like this that its bullying is running its private limited company, so the opposition is losing it  Because discipline is not visible, now you just come and oppose, this is right, that is not right, theirs is like this, it is not like that, there is no story of yours, no one listens to you, there is no discipline within your party itself, then how to do it, I say this again and again  I say that there should be stories, there is no story at all and no one is listening to your story, you do not have a story, like your chief minister and ours, where chilli food is eaten a lot and in the state where there is a desert  That one who was his, his brother would eat it as soon as he heard about you The one who was number two remained out of it for five years and will leave the party, will leave or will not leave, will come, you guys kept fighting for them and it was openly the choice of the top command, they did not agree to that, so they neither listened to the top nor the bottom.  His bullying won't work again, the same thing happened in Madhya Pradesh, in Madhya Pradesh also, their main lotus has bloomed and there was another lotus, okay so the other one that was there, he listens to it in his own arrogance that friend, it has been so many years,  Right now the public don't have a choice, this public don't have a choice, the public changes their tune at the last moment, well one more interesting thing has happened which you people are not talking about because I do this political analysis a little late after the event.  Because other people do that, my aim is to come here and tell something new, my aim is not to tell here what people have discussed on other channels, one thing I find very interesting and you people will also feel that many MLAs  Many MPs were sent to contest MLA elections  Those were big people, that's fine, now he came and contested the MLA election and there he was a minister at the center or he was an MP, MP is a bigger thing than MLA, now he has become an MLA, now he has not become CM VM  Everything is fine, now what is his future and who will contest MP election in his place, again it is being shown that here politics is bigger and party is bigger than individuals, now the career graph of individuals can be raised or lowered at any time.  It is given here, it is not like that if you become a commander type then I cannot send you on a horse like a soldier, so this is a new interesting trend that is also emerging in this way and which  Like all the leaders are all talking in the same language, specially I am talking about the leaders of the winning party in these three states, it shows control and for anything to move forward, control is required, it is not that  Someone is showing displeasure, he is showing this  If you are seeing this then I can see a well disciplined, well oiled election machinery and this is very good for stability. Just winning elections is not enough. What happens after the elections is that you have eliminated anti-incumbency. That face has been made so, it is not visible anymore. The old face is not visible now. A new face is coming. There is a caste of new faces. It comes from that class, like you, whoever you kill in your country, they say, come here.  But he made two deputy CMs, they belong to their own group, the CM is from our own group, if you add all three then the population becomes 70, 60, 65, 70, all these are master strokes, so by calling them Chanakya and praising them like this  No, if you are in opposition, then learn something from them and learn that in such an interesting way because when these leaders were being sent to elect big leaders for MLA elections, then what should be the general first order thinking in media  I was scared that this  They are not scared of losing, they had to win, that was the interpretation, not how to do it, now the MLAs will sit in the Vidhan Sabha and not inside the Parliament and they will have all the checks and balances, so now many people will say no  This CM is new, he will listen to everyone, all this will happen, this will happen, look at the things that run from the party, the parties which are big parties and run within the party structure, there you cannot expect your CM to be like that  The CM of Bengal is the head of the same party, you cannot expect that CM to be like him. The CM of Andhra Pradesh is the head of the same party, he is Gadavar, you cannot expect him to be like the CM of Odisha, of course, if you are a head of that kind of party.  If you are having expectations then this will not happen because the CM will be changed in the party and what is the benefit in that, if the CM is not performing, he can be removed for any reason or in an unpause, then performance becomes the key and now whatever the new MLAs want  won the first election  But I am telling you that if you have been a worker for 34 years and are involved in politics and you have been selected so deeply, it will not be called a deep selection that everyone has been removed and you come here, okay, then you will automatically have a fresh energy beyond that too.  There is a need to prove and that freshness because experience alone cannot do all the work because there is a whole system to give you knowledge. Only a person becomes a Prime Minister for the first time. It is not that all Prime Ministers are like this who are 10 times old.  There will definitely be a change. Yes, it is a matter of control at the top but there is a lot of flexibility at the bottom. The message has been conveyed that no one is indispensable. When this message is conveyed in politics, then one realises that anyone can do anything at any time. If he can reach anywhere, then any good professional who is listening to me today and is even 50-55 years old and if he comes into politics and has talent, then he too can become a politician, this is my message. Can be made up to the age of 60 to 65 years  After doing it for 10, 15, 20 years, it also brings down the system of nepotism, it will bring in freshness and on top of that it has happened that the nepotism people who are running can now be picked up and called out for political compulsions or  What ever the reason and it is not necessary that if someone is someone's son then he cannot work or will not work but he is not being forcibly brought into limelight by a party saying that brother you roam here and there, something will happen to you but  It is not like that you will be given the title immediately, so this is a welcome change, how did you people like this change and according to me this kind of thing will keep happening in political dispensation in future and you will see this change in states as well in future  It will be seen that chief ministers will not be repeated. After a certain stage, big leaders will either be adjusted at the centre. I am sure this person or someone close to him will be adjusted in the next elections. It is ok but still it is a relief for the people.  there is a relief in  The terms of newness and newness always come with an energy and if for some reason that experiment doesn't go well or the performance doesn't go well then that is enough for what we call bench strength to replace you and it is not like you are running  Out of choices and as an example I would say that the discipline of the other opposition is bad and they have lost, you have already seen this but there is a state like Haryana from where I also come, now if we look at the opposition there then Haryana is a small state, it is not like there is a population of 25 crores, there is a prominent opposition leader in the state like Chhutku, what is our area where we do that but later on how many Chhutku, other leaders have also done this and they do it among themselves They keep fighting, do they fight among themselves like that, if the person above who is their class monitor does that then they will not fight, if they do not fight then there will be clarity, if there is clarity then they will win the election, but the election is not to be won, if they do not do that then there will be conflict only OK! what else  Then the one who is more disciplined, more hard working, more Chanakya type, sees the writing on the wall, puts in all his effort in the last movement and then gets more marks, then what is the reason to cry when you see the pattern  It is being said that you take things for granted that this Government has been in power in this state for so many years, look at any state, like Madhya Pradesh was or any other state, look at it now, it will go away, people are unhappy,  Now we can do whatever we want, we just want to get our car and go to the Vidhan Sabha and get crowned and then start fighting amongst ourselves as to why we are fighting amongst ourselves because it has been assumed that we will win.  If it is confirmed then who will become the king of this place, who will be crowned, the fight is for that person, hey your victory is not confirmed, the people also hold their head in their hands because of these antics of yours that if your meaning seems like this then leave it this time  We might find out here which leaders were sent, what happened, if there is a story then the election results will be known  As far as I understood from these things, mostly Ekta and Chanakya's results turned out to be correct, otherwise elections are the mood of the public which is formed in the last two-three months only. What is the feeling from long before, what does it seem that election has got no meaning  When the button is pressed, I think things change in one and a half or two months and can change five times and the biggest lesson learnt in politics is that nothing is sure and this is how politics should be and this is how it should  Be played, I personally feel the way this one party is carrying out batting, it seems like the Australian team does not lose the match, I mean it seems they will lose, they will lose, but it is always Travis Head who comes.  And somebody or the other does something, so I am telling them the cricket equivalent, okay, so there is something or the other now and that passion of not losing an election that brother we have to win and we have to put in all our effort  What I mean to say is that the Vidhansabha is very big, during the Municipality elections, all these leaders do not leave it, then all of them come and the rest of the people go on leave after roaming around, they say brother, the rest of the public says brother, when you are with you 24*7  If it is not there then let it be, although it is so tough, actually you have made the political life so tough for the politicians, that is why politics is not very lucrative, earlier people used to come like this, you used to do this and go away and the public used to see that sometimes  Now there is constant engagement, this is constant engagement and what is this and how has this changed, beyond this another great video can be made that what is this one thing that came, I will give an example of a movie from which the way elections have changed the way politicians  There has changed and the smart ones have learnt a lot from it and you can call the public stupid, yes it is okay, I do not say that the public is made fools because the public is not stupid at all, so it is rarely made fools.  But which was that movie from which it all started? If you want a video on that, then I will tell you on this channel, it will be a very good analysis that friend, yes friend, he is saying the right thing, friend, after that, there was a change like this till now, no one has  I did not make that video nor did anyone suggest it, but that was a movie and after that things changed, a lot changed, the smart politicians took a lot from it, so you people should also tell this thing that they would like to listen to this video.  Please tell me how you liked it and please share and like it. Thank you very much.
