Hello friends, this is a very important video, watch it completely because you will understand politics very well from this, there will be many takeaways from it, the whole country, we all Indians, all of us, we should thank Rajasthan Deputy CM Premchand Bairwa ji of Rajasthan who is the Deputy CM of Bharatiya Janata Party. Clapping for the deputy CM of the popular government in Rajasthan, first of all he will tell what the clapping is for, okay it is not in the government's jam, actually clapping has to be done, though it is a bit like that but still clapping is required because he is a very clean hearted man.  You do not find such politician brothers and sisters, when you see a politician it seems that he will talk in a roundabout way, will be erudite, will be politically correct, so he is a very clean hearted person but this is all the praise, now the next thing is the take away and the people who talk about it  If anyone knows what happened then it is very good, otherwise I will tell you in brief that the son of the Deputy CM, who is not even 18 years old, is driving an open jeep, making reels without wearing a seat belt and police escort is going behind, it is against the law  the whole glory of  It is a minor driving the car without a license and there is a police escort behind him. Take away one, is this the police, is it the police of India, especially in BJP ruled states like it has happened in Rajasthan, we have seen in Orissa that soldiers are beaten up  Is it just this or is it the protection of the law? The law is being violated in front of you and you are skirting it. A CA or an employee dies while working, an HDFC employee pays tax and brothers and sisters, this is done with the tax payers money.  The work is going on and he is saying, thank you Modi Ji, you made me the deputy CM so that my son can drive like this. I am surprised. I am surprised. This is Modi Ji's dialogue. I have just moved him. I say this is nothing of mine, Modi ji gets surprised at everything, he always says in his own words, if you look at his speech, he always says like this, somewhere or the other I am surprised, you are not surprised at these things, Modi ji  Modi ji is saying thank you by taking your name. He is saying thank you because you have given thanks to such low IQ people.  He is made to sit here and they shut up their tongue saying that okay if something happened then they can keep quiet, he is saying that he himself is the transport minister, deputy CM of Rajasthan and he is saying that what happened in this is okay, what happened in this is okay brothers. Sisters you tell me this then the Porsche case Pune case was also fine what happened he is driving here the police is doing the scam brothers sisters and now there will be a twist in the story now you people in the twist of this story because some people got irritated Why are you bringing Modi ji, you are against the BJP, you are a Congressman, the Congress MLA, who is a Congress leader, his son was also sitting next to him in the car, so brothers and sisters, the take away from this is that Congress is also friends with the BJP and you are in the family.  You are getting separated in the family, some like Modi ji, some like BJP, some are not saying anything, friendship has been made in this country, whether friendship has broken in the homes or not, you tell me there is tension among the relatives, people argue in the house, Miya  Even the wife thinks that you are like this, these days it happens in weddings that you are a devotee, meaning it is a promo or NT Modi If both of them get separated then the marriage will not happen by doing this and see, the people of Rajasthan have to turn the tables in 5 years, then this friendship is complete, only then no one will make much noise there and the Congress leader too has said the name of Bhardwaj ji in the interview You have to melt their burden, you will see a lot of videos because I should put them all here, the ABP news person is asking good questions, ABP people also deserve credit, whoever believes in whatever, is asking good questions, yes, nothing wrong happened  The car was like this, it was a vintage car, drive it, anyone can drive your car and now he is roaming around buying a Defender, people are making memes of it, the kids of these politicians are cutting so many glasses and unemployment is increasing so much here, you are shameless politician  Ho, you can loot the country if you want to. Okay, whatever you want to do, if you want to loot, do it, make a reel of it, why are you rubbing salt in the wounds and crazy people even comment on this, oh what is he driving, I am not driving this car But I come back again for the third take  Oh, what is this police of our country, it is there to give trauma to the common man that when the common man goes to lodge a complaint in the Orissa case at night, they do something to him that after seeing that one case, the person says that something should happen to me. If I go and get beaten up by the police, they will put me in jail and they are busy serving these people, then who is at fault in this, who should be insulted the most in this entire episode, whose fault is it of Modi ji, Modi ji  His only fault is that he has filled his entire army with such people who will now embarrass him. This idealist speaking class of the deputy CM should not be held, he should be dismissed. Vasundhara Raje was a strong leader, she would have run Rajasthan well by selecting everyone properly.  There was a lot of insecurity among leaders. Modi ji has insecurity. Some people have brains, some are a bit arrogant, some have their own kind of personality, I don't like all of them. That is why he said with so much honesty that Modi ji, thank you for making me his deputy. My son was made CM  If he will cut glasses and loot, then this is now an embarrassment to Modi ji, I do n't know who has the courage, but it is not entirely Modi ji's fault, it is not Modi ji's fault, there are leaders of both Congress and BJP, Congress leader will also defend it  He is doing this to Bedgi and it happened like that, okay you have made so many friends, what will happen to his career as well, we will see, okay is it the deputy CM's fault, yes it is his fault as well that he did not spoil his child like this because on s The rule is that if you are driving without a license, then father will be caught. Father was arrested in the Porsche case or not. It was the Pune Porsche case. Okay, whatever happened, it is all a mistake, but whose mistake is the biggest? It is the police's mistake.  What is happening in front of them should be prevented, the law binder will say, friend, don't do this, don't make a reel wheel, don't do this, call the father there, the Deputy CM, your son is doing this and it will be revealed in public, this  I am not feeling right and don't let it go, but still whose mistake is it the biggest, it is yours, brothers and sisters.  And mine is of our people, we the sovereign, we are the masters of this country, the politicians are our servants and the police is in the grip of politicians, the police beats the army, the soldiers and does not give justice to any normal man and they are slaves of the politicians  Like we see, politicians are supposed to be under us, but we dare to perform their aarti, we say that they have done Khamma Gan to everyone, by doing this we live in such a fear that if we say anything to Modi ji, now this is how it is to live in Haryana Many discussions were going on, there was someone, there was an elderly woman, so what is Modi's fault in this, brother, the leader is very good, it is an amazing thing, what is our fault, I will link it to the Haryana elections later, separate videos will come, but this video  It was very important brother, it is the fault of the public, what do the public have to do, the public has to get politicized in a massive way, I too, brothers and sisters, used to think a year or four years ago, why do we have to come into politics, but brother, now there is no way to survive in this country, they have made the syllabus like this what was it before, we used to eat and drink something outside Elections used to happen every 5 years, some things were good, some were bad, sometimes happy, sometimes sad, life was going on, but BJP did not leave the country like this, they said, son, all of you come into politics, if we talk about politics then what should we do  Yes, we all want to become politicians. Am I also a politician? If I talk about politics, I speak ill of some people, speak good of others, and from now on start influencing votes also, depending on what you like. Here I am I am not saying that you have to be anti-Congress or pro-BJP, it is your intelligence, discretion and consciousness, but start tightening them, I will tell you what we have to do, BJP, Congress, these are the main parties of the country, democracy has to be put in them. They are not allowed to do devotion, is the BJP president not getting elected, are they waiting for 20th October, will Sanjay Joshi become the president, what will happen, we will see further, you see that there are two parties in Britain, even in the US there are only two there  He does not go around taking 50 people from one party to another but he has a party inside him  There is a lot of democracy, if somebody talks nonsense, he is removed and the best person emerges from him and if there is democracy in both the parties, the filth that is there in both the parties, in terms of mind, behavior, thinking, that is there in both the parties, this  If we make it clear ourselves then only the good leaders should come to the top, then brother, after that sometimes this one comes, sometimes that one comes, it will not be bad for the country if anyone comes as per his wish, but here all the leaders who never  There is no need to go anywhere for 20 years, 25 years. Talking about the next 2047, a program for 15 years is set and an army of all idiots and if you talk to them, it feels like if you tell this to their son, then you are speaking against papa ji and you cannot tell him, why? We cannot say this. We have to save democracy within the parties. There is no democracy in any political party. Look at Trin Nul Congress, look at BJP, everywhere one leader has taken hold and done it everywhere. Even inside Congress, we know that the family rules.  But at least you can find his name there  Let us see, we have seen in Haryana also, there is some sulking, appeasing, protesting, so if some spark of democracy is visible in all the parties, I would say it is visible in Congress, but that too is very less, there is no praise, it is not passing clean. There is no cheating going on but it is very important to bring a dissenting voice into the party. In BJP, no one has the courage to speak. No one has the strength. Yes, it is very good. Everyone is having a lot of fun. Everyone is making money because of Haryana elections.  We are waiting for the results, in that everyone is drawing swords like this and then after Maharashtra, you will see what will happen, I hope it will be okay, if they do something then RSS is there too, if they want to put Sanjay Joshi 's name  Many people are feeling the heat because of the Gujarat lobby, the Gujarat lobby and beyond this, now we will have to openly discuss what is happening with many things, which I myself see, this was my opinion three-four years ago  It was there even 2 years ago but it is changing because of the new Facts are getting merged, this is what I tell you people, as if some things change, you need to change the facts and we have made such people sit on the post of deputy CM, you see, if I ask you today who is the chief minister of Gujarat  I don't know, just tell you people without mistaking it and write whether I knew it or not without mistaking it and you do n't need to get angry over it, meaning you do n't need to feel bad that you do n't know the name of the CM of Gujarat because he  Brother, he is not seen doing anything, then how would he know the name. Everyone has been made to sit idle like this, Vasundhara Raje, Shivraj Singh Chauhan is sitting idle, you don't know what is happening under compulsion, and those who came out of the Congress, Hemant Vishwa Sharma, got them even more infuriated.  The moral of the BJP workers is so low these days and there are a lot of smart people in the BJP too, why wouldn't they be, friend, I myself know so many people who are very smart but they are so drunk that they cannot be seen, poor thing, and all of them are  You made people sit in your place, brother, when you are an idiot then one thing you should not do is so stupid that you don't even know that you are an idiot  At least shut your tongue, who will put a mike in your mouth and tell you to get out, you know if something happens then sit with an upset stomach for two days, no news lasts for more than two days in India brother, if something happens somewhere, go underground  Who will ask, the security will not let you come inside the house, tell them that the minister has an upset stomach, by then some other news will come in 48 hours, the media will go somewhere else, they have so much staff, they will keep playing hide and seek outside, but Bhai Saheb, this is openly his  It means that these politicians think the public is fool and if the public too does not raise an uproar then the public is fool according to me brother, misuse of police, misuse of law, different laws for them for everything, different laws for the common man, the common man is scared.  Wherever you go, you should not see the face of the police. You are wearing the seat belt. You have the vehicle papers. You were driving at the correct speed. Whatever it was, the police will stop you. Show your power, show your attitude like this, like this and  Whereas it has been made against him that even if someone says something  If I am not doing any mistake then don't stop anyone like that, if you see something is wrong then don't just go on like this, this is a very very very important thing, call out this nonsense, no matter whose it is, unfortunately the army of idiots is more visible inside the BJP because  All of them left because no entrance test was taken. Now, in order to increase the subscriber base, I make up any theory that appeals to the masses. People with mass appeal also come to me to present item numbers because on me here  I do one thing that not many people can understand and in order to increase their subscribers everyone will abuse me in the same way, if they don't abuse then they will write such comments that decent people will abuse like if I say this to someone, those people  Like many people say that Modi ji is like this, Rahul ji is like this, then why does Modi ji say this, he deserves it, why not, friend, he is my prime minister, he deserves it, why will I not, otherwise many will write Rahul ji, why not Rahul  yes Priyanka ji Arvind Kejriwal ji everybody is happy Why ca n't you tell us in a civilized manner, it is the same thing that if you say anything against Modi ji then people who speak indecent language against Modi ji will come in the comment section, then they will scold you and filter you, I don't want such supporters.  There is no such thing as anti-anyone here, I am interested in the dialogue that is taking place, I am not interested in the controversy, whatever is there is important, who is saying what is important, all the leaders should have a basis, I said that these leaders  There should also be an Aadhaar, but it should be known that brother, see, the heart beats for the boy, it is a good thing, the people of Haryana and Rajasthan beats for their boy, witch is a very good thing, okay, I don't call this nepotism, but you are spoiling the law and order  We will not follow the order and then what are you showing, what are you showing that the children of politicians can do anything and look at the condition of the police, the worst condition is of the police, now I see this happening in the coming time that  I don't know if people would even want to join because unfortunately the way is police  The image is being created in the country that now whether one will be able to marry this person or not, what will happen, this is happening, there was a time when my heart used to beat a lot, I used to feel sympathy that so what if the friend has become a policeman  I mean it does n't matter what their life is, nobody police is supposed to be there, who will protect the law and all that, he used to do this but now if you ask an average man, a policeman should check his survey that brother, the police leadership is in senior positions, do you think  You don't feel from within that you should get respect in this country. You are on default setting, on default setting, without any effort till someone does that and they are the ones who create problems in some department or organisation everywhere. But what has happened to the police?  That we cannot expect any good behavior from the police and every big person has written such words which even I feel are strong words, I have written in the comment section, which I had said last time, I again ask that to the police  What feeling does one get after seeing this  Bhai had written that I feel disgusted, it is really a strong and bad word but then people are using it, it means they are like, there is one called do n't like, there is one called dislike, there is one called not interested, there is one that hates.  If we have reached this level, then is there no need for police reforms in this country? I mean if someone takes the data of police that the British police which were again Indians were more trained or the police of today, then in my opinion there is not much difference.  You won't see it, the job of the police is like this, they just scold and beat him, oh friend, why should a law abiding citizen be afraid, why should he hate, he should say that yes, soldiers, what mistakes do not happen in the army, those in the army  They are employees, they do not have any special doings, they too have some because if there is an army of 12, 14, 15 lakhs, then there will be something somewhere but in the default setting, on seeing a soldier, love and respect comes in the heart and it feels like that our soldier brother what am I to do  I can or I get such a feeling, a good feeling, why doesn't this come in the police, some percentage of this should come, let's say for the army, if it is 80 or 90 out of 100, then it will be less for the police, but in the police, it was almost zero.  want to give I want to ask very clearly to the audience, everyone is educated, I am a guruji, I should not be judgmental, I am interested in raising issues, police brother, someone is watching us, these are someone's children, you are doing a very good job According to me, but if you are in any organisation, don't you feel that you are supposed to be duty bound to increase that element of respect by working, I am sure lots of people are doing this, but it comes on social media, no, it is like this, a  It is not two, some good news should be seen coming, bad news is also coming, well now we cannot stop all the bad news but some good news should also be coming, see, is there any PR in this police, there is no PR of the police  If someone is doing something for the image of the police, then reforms are needed in that, I am guiding you all, write in the comment section your opinion about the police on a scale of 10. On a scale of 10, where does zero mean a lot?  It is a bad opinion of 10 means brother, I do n't know which kind of police we see, like the one in America, ok you have your hands down and they are scared, the criminals are scared, if we believe that kind, then it could be a crime.  There might be some in that too, I don't have any personal experience there, it's okay but let's imagine that she looks big to us, well dressed up, fat equipment, good way of speaking, there are videos inside the US, if the policeman stops her like this, then the guy is sitting inside with a camera like this  Put his message or I card, which means a citizen can ask whether you are a policeman or not, show me your I card, suppose to show that yes I am so and so, anyone can do anything by wearing the uniform, that is the process and  So much  There is clarity among the people there and they don't start fighting, how did you ask for it, come out, I will beat you with sticks and show it properly, I tell the paper, ok show me this show, ok my lawyer told this, they also know the law, us citizen gets what he deserves  will show him the papers, ok, it's not over here, someone stops someone, someone gives it to someone, instead of showing the card, he shows something else, someone is looking at something else, what has happened to my status, friend, what has happened to my status, many times I tell the police I say, I am saying this with great intimacy that brother what is this, we are all shocked, such a leader has done this to the police, the police is busy in flattering the leader, the whole culture is such that if we make you then this  People of the community will say taata teena, make me also Modi ji, you made me, I too have had my share of the glory, so he is a good man brother, he is a deputy CM by nature, but he deserves to be in a constitutional post, that is also sure, by the way, he is clean at heart.  That we too can enjoy  Modi ji, it is because of you that we got the chance, otherwise what chance would we have got, you should have made Vasundhara ji, Vasundhara ji knows every inch of us, Vasundhara ji did not have to make us anything while she was there  If something had to happen, Vasundhara ji would have tightened the administration and made people good, she knows it because she is the class monitor of Rajasthan, she knows who has what talent in BJP, it is like this here  He becomes chief minister for one and a half years and runs away six months before the elections. Now even Modi does not greet him on stage. Who is this CM? Do you know his name? Write in the comment section. Elections are about to come, interesting times are about to come, fights are about to come.  Don't do politics in your homes, these BJP and Congress boys have moved around in the same car, there is no need to fight in their circle, and whoever is in Congress today, may be in BJP tomorrow, whoever is in BJP today, may be in Congress tomorrow, so when  These leaders do not belong to anyone, then why are they Why are you becoming one who is loyal, you should be loyal to your parents, be loyal to your wife, be loyal to the flood, I hope the Rajasthani people also understand a little, please you are Rajasthanis, wake up and take out your pride, Rajputana is such an old kingdom, at least do something of your own  Take out your pride, whom do you make, what is the law for you, then either say this, Rajasthan, it does not matter to us, the road is open, someone can drive it, then pass a law in the assembly that brother, children of ministers below 18 years of age can drive because  His skill set is much better and he deserves it and the escort will not allow him to speed too much, his children can drive, your children will drive toy cars, their children will drive real cars, who knows, Maranadu sahab's child is coming  So clear the road brother please, you are common people, friend, these people think of themselves as kings, the king died many years ago, still that pillar of the village man is there, why is this kind of system going on there, why is it going on everywhere  why so much respect  This is happening, I say that this should be made an issue on the social media, we will not make them leaders because the Congress is also evolved, Congress will also put pressure on speaking but what do we care, this is the fact that if you genuinely want to do good for yourself and want to keep it with you  You want power as an individual consent citizen, only then you will not sing praises, you will belittle wherever you get a chance, here both Congress are also the same because their leader's son is also there, so let's see who does what among the two and if everyone remains silent  Then the public should not remain silent, the public should not remain silent, they should not remain silent at all, like the channel, subscribe, share, give your opinion, having no opinion is not a choice, do not have an opinion, become a politician, we will not discuss politics  Now we will become a politician, so which politician will join which party, no one will join any party, then even independents do not contest, I will not contest the elections, then you will not contest the elections either, you are not even joining any party, then how Politician, anybody who practices politics is a politician, they happen in homes and offices too, office politics, home politics, mother-in-law-daughter-in-law politics, so now we have to play this politics as well, we have to have a complete opinion, he is a leader, he is forced labour, everyone is forced labour, he is a thief  He did it like this, you are singing their praises and if you say with more force that it is useless, it is useless, someone will come to Congress, what is this, abuse this one too, then this one too is useless and tell them about Congress  Tell him to remove this leader, you look too closely at the party, I will only speak if you have, in my 100 episodes I had also told you about my idol Ji, we should never hate a party, all political parties are idol Ji and they need and democracy needs political parties and  One should not criticize political idols and political parties too much, common people can choose any politician, if I like BJP then there is someone from BJP in BJP, I am something  I will not even say that I like Congress, if someone betrays Congress then I will not say anything, I just say that if you like BJP and I am telling you that I like BJP 's idol ji, I like Congress's idol ji also but BJP  Those who are ruining BJP by liking their idol Ji and BJP, they will have to be called out, I say it again and again, if you like cricket, you are a fan of cricket, you like the Indian cricket team to win, then why should you  Be a fan of individual players, if they are not performing then take it out. Indian cricket team is more important and a particular player is more important. Bumrah is bowling very well but if Bumrah gets a leg injury or there is something wrong with his hands and legs  If the bowling is not good then brother you were a very good player, you bowled very well, you got that player out well in the World Cup, this is what you did brother, Jai Ram ji, that's enough, thank you very much, now give someone else a chance  That is supposed to be the process, you tell him that you did it but for how long can you suffer, if you are not performing then we have to reward the performers, those who are showing their low IQ status verbally, every person  By his speaking for 510 minutes it becomes clear how much intelligence he has, so brother why are you making these people sit, this is what you have, this is the talent, I am 100% sure that the people of Rajasthan are very intelligent, some people among them are super intelligent.  There are many Maha Intelligent people in BJP already but the very fact that you make such people, these are the ones who get trolled because any person who has got his own mind and attitude and that too not all  They will listen, they will become Vasundhara Raje type, they will have Maharani type attitude and they have that attitude because there is something inside them, they are sitting with a brain, I am saying make Vasundhara Raje the president  Friend, make Sanjay Joshi the president of BJP or Vasundhra Raje the president of BJP, there should be a strong president who will take cognizance of the party and say that yes, the party is falling into the abyss, if they take this bullet and go away, then BJP will not come to power for 30 years, does India want that BJP  I don't think so it's a good thing if we look at Congress for 10 years then we will see how the last 8 or 10 years go by. No one gets so much power, it would be better if Congress just makes it Congress now.  They are straightforward, they walk a bit, they talk to each other and the Congress people are well set up, okay, so do you want that with BJP also, 25 years should disappear, make the party so weak, put so many fools in it  I think that all the intelligent people should disappear from politics, whoever thinks himself to be an intellectual, thinks himself to be intelligent and there are many people, even I think so, we have to play politics and this is politics, today BJP is good, tomorrow Congress is good, Congress's something good  Something good about BJP, the foolish people of BJP, these foolish leaders, the foolish leaders of Congress, the foolish leaders of TMC, what do we care, once you praised TMC in the parliament, I liked it after hearing it, then even if it happens to Kolkata, you praised there too.  I did it, now why do you foolish girl, if you do useless work there then you will be called useless there, this is what is called using your mind, have independent thinking, don't use neutral words, neutral is a wrong word, you cannot be neutral and you should not be  Neutral, you have to take a side, you have to take someone's side according to the issue, but what do people think that if you say that I have nothing in Congress and I have nothing in BJP, and I am neutral, these are weak people brother  Congress is very good, BJP is also very good, but here Congress has done a bad job. They tried to remove some of the problems in Karnataka. Congress worked for 14 hours in Bangalore, it is a stupid work. They are doing this more because they are spread out.  now brother if six vegetables are cooked then one  If one person has cooked vegetables and another has cooked five vegetables, then there is a higher chance that out of the five vegetables, some vegetable will be made bad and when that person cooking the vegetables also makes a mistake, then he will also be told that your cooking was not done well today, and then he will do this  Everything will keep changing and you should become free just like these people have freed you, the children of BJP leaders are with the children of Congress leaders and they are fooling the public, the public has polarized them in their homes.  People don't talk in shops, this is how business dealings happen these days. Well, I will not buy a car from you because you like the BJP. I am from Congress. I will not come to your hotel to eat food because those people are scared of you.  I should tell them my view point that what is in my mind because they feel that we will be judged, brother I am also a working man, I also know this, I also understand, hey, we like your channel so much, we watch other channels so well  You talk about how nice this or that person is but you should stay away from politics because in politics, I will not give anything to the person whom you consider your darling.  If I say 'yes' then everything of mine becomes zero, which is giving you benefit in life, this politics has poisoned you, politics is so important that I am a good writer of a 150 page book, you will enjoy on page number 43.  It did not come, you learned a lot in the rest of the pages, there was still a lot to learn, so you tear the book and throw it away, unsubscribe, you did not enjoy it, and in whose name, in whose name, in the name of Modi ji, in the name of BJP, in the name of Hindutva, in the name of Rahul ji But in whose name do the Congress leave it and what good have they done to you, their sons are driving the vehicles, making vehicles and doing mischief, what benefit are you getting, why are you fighting for them, at least we should be like me  If this all happens in India, these politicians will not know where to go. You are seeing their condition, what is happening in Haryana, they are not allowed to enter, what have you done, what have you done, people have lost their breath, they will start fearing even in politics.  Politicians are now called politicians  Also, his mouth will open on Rao Inderjit ji, I will make it on the person from Haryana also, what should I do, I am an MP, there is filth here, what should I do, I have given the government a lesson, then why is he coming to ask for votes, then why is he coming to ask for votes now Nothing is in your control, if nothing is in your control then why are you coming for vote seeking, if you have not done anything, but the public has to ask this, then whose blame is it, it is the public's, so I hope you liked this video You guys please like, share and subscribe to the channel, thank you.
