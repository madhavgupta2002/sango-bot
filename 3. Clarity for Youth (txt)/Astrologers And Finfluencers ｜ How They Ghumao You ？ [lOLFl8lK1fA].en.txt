Hello friends Astrologers and financial influence every now and then in the coming time I will mix two-three videos of Astrologer Astrology and this one because the reason for this I will tell how they operate in all the professions I am also in astrology ok although I am in the teaching part  I stay there more than usual but I am bringing it up so that it doesn't seem like I am speaking ill of any other profession, I brought it up for that and how they operate is fine because there are predictions in astrology and all the people make predictions even though they are astrologers.  You are playing the game of predictions and I will also tell you why and how the games of predictions are played and I will explain it well, you will enjoy the practical video, so first of all my fraternity of astrologers, their fraternity is not of astrology but of fraternity of astrology, you have an exit with astrology  It is very good, whenever anybody comes to an astrologer, he comes in trouble, not in happiness, so what is his exit, that you come to me, something happened to me  And now whether your life will be better or same or worse, then these are only three situations and there is a chance of 66 out of three. However, if it will be bad, you can also claim that it would have been worse if you had not come, but then let's say that at 66  So there is a chance, and keep making so many predictions in the normal public domain that this person will get this many seats, this one will win, this one will lose, something will be fine and then claim victory and do the rest as conveniently as possible left and right, these financial effects are also done in the same way  They come and forcefully give knowledge about the stock market, they start talking so much about so many things and do so much, whenever you go to an astrologer and he starts showing off his knowledge, I will compare the two and tell you that all of these are very good and right  Even if you don't do astrology and all this but I will do it and tell you that whenever the astrologer says like this, your Rahu is going on like this, Saturn's is like this, it means he is fake, he doesn't have the knowledge, you have come, what is the need for him to explain to you If he tells you clear cut story, you will also see financial influence, showing diagrams, Nifty will go like this, here it was like this and now it is this and he will take a pen and show it like this, recently I see that he is roaming around with 20 lakh subscribers every day  He is Akshay Srivastava, my friend from People, his name is nothing personal to him, I can take one name and tell you two-four more but I don't see 100 channels, so he is Master ji, the biggest showman, sometimes you should catch hold of him, it may spoil his reputation Leave it, then say this is not right, now grab something, now grab the latest micro cap, small cap, grab anything, today I am going to expose the whole of YouTube and I am also a YouTuber including myself, listen to us carefully today, come here  It is very easy to read knowledge because whoever has lakhs of subscribers, lakhs means more than 1 lakh, after that the matter becomes one, of course those who have more, they get a lot of regular income, a lot of money, right, and here  come  Saying I am doing this, I am not doing this, I am doing this, you don't do this, this is the dirtiest and most useless knowledge. You have seen me in my videos, I do not tell anything about what I do, what is my income, what are the accounts, it is because My life experience is that I have got nothing to do with your truth. If it is like this, listen, it is like the heroes of the 70s and 80s portray poor heroes. They are rich in real life and there they are saying poverty and people associate them with it.  They are saying it is like being that leader who travels by jazz and is a leader, he has a lot of power, reach and everything, but he was once poor and poor people are cheering for him, they are cheering for him what he was earning they are right  Now and they will always be most like be there only, you are understanding, I am telling you from a deep thing, even astrologers will do astrology with full force, they will play on fear that this will happen, that will happen, without it work cannot be done, this is what you do if you are in mutual fund  If you do not invest in the equity market, if you do not invest here, then you will remain poor here and if you do it here, then you will become rich, brother, ask those who have been doing it for 20 years, you will catch each outlier in it and weave it too  That a man is like saying that one of my uncle's grandfathers, not my real grandfather, but some other cousin's grandfather, used to smoke hookah and lived for 104 years, so is that true, yes it is true, so that means you use tobacco for 104 years, smoke hookah and do such things  You will not live for 104 years because you did not tell that you used to go to irrigate the fields at 4:00 in the morning, used to do farming, used to eat desi ghee, used to eat food only twice a day, used to sleep at 8:00 in the night and used to wake up at 3:00 in the morning You did not tell about the rest of his 1500 great things, you only told about one thing, the hookah, or cigarette or whatever like this, today those who are doing their wrong programs, they also do this work  If it is applied then it will take 104 years because you are not telling that you have the ability to lose money because you have frequency band tokens, you will also play Lakshmi people do not mention it, once you have brought a fancy product, Mama tune change, Mama tune change, I am doing  This I am doing this I am doing this I am doing this I have to lower my level by acting like this to awaken the people and the youth, otherwise why should I come and act like this, I too want to show off my sophisticated people  Come let the math speak, let this speak, let that speak, however much it is shown to you, it is like high-fi, you are being made a crazy fool, remember this, no one knows what lies ahead, if the past was to be the history then  Librarians and historians would be the richest people. Otherwise, Buffett's quote is great because most of the history is read by historians and librarians also have lots of books, they can read them too.  Bhaiya investment and life is forward looking, yes you have to look in the rear view while overtaking and while moving left and right, but when you drive, brothers and sisters, then you drive by looking ahead, at 95, at 97, times two at 4  One should also look back in time, but if someone is doing a rear view investing that I did it this way, I incurred losses like this, but it is okay, this is it, everything is okay for you if Rs 50 lakh or Rs 1 crore is coming into your account every month.  Brothers and sisters, everything is okay, keep playing some game of 5-10 lakhs and keep showing off, I bought this, I did this, there was a loss because I said so, so I also suffered a loss brother, you suffered a loss, % of net worth, others suffered a loss of 50%, youngsters You took the youngsters to crypto, financial influence is the same, this is the work that astrologers do because do it like this, wear this ring, wear this, wear that, do it this way, do it that way, oh brother, the one who has so much real knowledge, he is free  I do not share it, it is a fact that I do not share it, if my knowledge is strong then you can attend the webinar and come there and judge, now come here and recommend two stocks or three stocks every day, okay don't talk about those which lost, those which hit  It's done, it's done, oh friend, this was told by Peter Lynch, one upon Wall Street, the famous 1980s equity manager of America, that any child can pick up stocks and they will perform as well, we are overrated, call any child to Nifty 100. Make a portfolio for your child today, you guys don't have to invest too much money, invest thousands of rupees and buy 10 stocks, 100 thousand rupees. Just for argument, call your child to check it, tell any 10 year or 5 year old child, son, something  You can also put your hand on 10, it's fine, you can put your hand on 10 out of 100 top companies of India and show off, it's fine, do it like this, then buy more and see about the rest.  Look, behind each of them, this company does this work, this company does this work, hey, there are corporate issues in these companies, come and teach me how to do forensic audit, you have to calculate operating cash flow along with cash flows. And along with the profit, we have to see whether he has inflated his assets in all the micro caps and the biggest scam in all these things is this, a famous case of corporate governance, if you have ever read the Google3 scam then it is quite well known but this  I don't know what all misdeeds are done inside micro cap in the ballast, and all these YouTubers come and tell you stories, hey you are doing a little bit, has got no meaning, you have to define and what is there in it, it is  For I am telling you it is for the risky, he is the biggest bad, everyone has to take risks, you are making it for the youth, the youth have to take risks, he is saying if there is risk then there is love, if there is love then there is risk, there are many such things  There are dialogues too that which one came after doing love and risk, there was a web series on Harshad Mehta, people make such dialogues in it, so people feel that if you take risk then there is no benefit, sometimes you have to see risk Reward ratio just because the risk increases dozens means the reward will increase and it will increase at a common rate that if I double the risk the reward will become double no it happens that way in life some times the risk increases as an exponential and the Reward design increases so why should you go there, I will tell you one thing, I am thinking of opening a finance channel but I am doing its due diligence that I have very little actual knowledge, how will you come and make videos on it everyday  Because those who are making videos every day, talking nonsense, talking nonsense to everyone, you should come there and tell the investors how to look at the balance sheet, how to look at the red flex, corporate governance  How to check that he has appointed all the directors in your corporate and there are related party transactions, he has made guest house in his own house and gives contracts to his own companies and takes money from your listed firm in that company  It is being told how it should be taught and how it should be taught with examples and case studies, the real knowledge is that, the real thing is that but then it takes so much effort to explain it then the person says friend how can I tell all this for free because  Anything that is very good will not be free, remember this also, in micro caps, every day there is an influencer who has 20 lakh subscribers, brother, any of his fans will buy it, then you will see it growing  You know, take that exit fit and these come under SEBI's range side, no matter how many times you tell me that no, no, I am not saying that you should buy it and this is dangerous and it is not like that, even then you know  tell small children, son don't open this cupboard, just tell them this  Don't peep into the cupboard, just say this, then what will you know, then you will say that I had forbidden you, I had forbidden you, so understand the psychology, someone has to come and tell that the whole game is of astro loggers, the whole game is of financial influence  The whole game is played with the psychology of all the people in the financial media, that is why I say with you that the public is not explained but cajoled and the public can never take a decision, the public is told that you will do this, do it like this Do it that way and anyone can come and I am saying this because no one speaks against it, everyone says that you tell yours, tell them yours, then everyone tell theirs and everyone has their own, some big needs to come and challenge that brother told this  I went or did not work, now there could be 1.5 crore reasons, no one is accusing you personally but come and accept this thing, there is nothing rational, brother, the money will be made but if you tell this then how will the channels run, how will the newspapers run  This media channel will run, how much will it cost him every time he comes  You have to show a multibagger of small cap somewhere, that means finding that needle is like a haystack but these low hanging fruits are looking good, how much will you talk about it, then it is not fun to talk about it, people, even the public wants to become rich  Public thinks like this now that I am a multi-bagger, I am not giving you any normal example of mine but there is no bragging in it, I am just trying to tell you what is luck, there is a company Lav Pola, it is 100 bagger for me, okay, absolutely advice.  There are a lot of valuations that I should not buy it, so according to me I should not buy it right now, maybe it is okay, I am holding it, I am holding it, it is 100% safe for me, if I was that smart and my investment was that much, then  I would have then allotted part of my portfolio to two customers so at that time the portfolio which was small, I took it, it increased but did not sell it, I kept it aside, I forgot it was in a demat which was dematted to another and many times you do not sell it and that  It increases, if we forget then what now  Let me show you the date when I bought it, when its market cap was so low, it was something like 30, 40, 50 crores. Now I don't know if it has become something like 30, 40, 50 crores. So Garware Valve again, it was a Ro manufacturing company, 200, 50, 180.  It was 20,000, now it is probably 3,000 plus, brother. It is not known what the company will do. The company does not know. The owner of the company does not know how much I will do, so what do we know. It is, I come here and request a few things. That someone should come and just tell people this small thing that friend your cash flow is for the last seven years because of working capital, inventory and all this, many companies in India also give bribes, now how will they show bribe giving on the balance sheet  To this politician, this is a fact of the state or of that place, do you people know, then how will they show the balance sheet, if someone shows it given to this, then he will have to do some such dressing up  Then once you get used to dressing up, you understand it, then you start doing it more, then you start doing more and more, then you start doing it for your own benefit and who will teach you those things that whenever you study accounting  The basic thing is for every debit there is a credit, for credit there is a debit that needs to be balanced so if you are hiding profit somewhere then your asset or balance sheet will bloat somewhere and there will be a mismatch somewhere, the way to catch it is this  So it seems fishy, why is its return on equity coming so low, it is showing profit but why is only RO coming, what is happening to the assets, what is return on assets, no one is telling this, I am explaining, explain  I want to tell you but I think I should reach a particular stage where I tell this because what should I tell the audience, hey bhai sahib, leave this and tell the stock, stock today I will be covering this multibagger potential i micro cap stop in the agriculture sector and guys I am there  And I'm very bullish and that's it  There and I am also buying and you buy and it is going this and this will do well defense will do well this will do well that will do well sector will do well company is doing well or not doing well what do you know now most solar solar solar  They will go after solar, someone will go after someone else, these are all fads, the game of PMS which is played in the company, this is what is told to the clients first, okay, then it runs up, then it is seen, then it comes Gradually I told it as normal and then told the public, whenever I go, brothers and sisters, you public says that the public knows everything, no the public does not know everything, the public knows a lot, the public knows everything, what is happening in these handsets now, the public knows everything  I don't know, but what happened now, the public will know in 2028, this is also a truth, but what is the fact, what is happening in 2024, these big people tell you something about themselves by putting it on Tegra groups and offload the shares first, technology  There was not this much earlier, whom all would you call and tell them to take this  Take that, take this, nowadays some will increase, some will decrease, some will be offloaded, then trap new chickens, then tell them and then give the data to any financial influencer, brother, this company costs nothing in covering the company Brothers and sisters, you are telling about the company, if something goes wrong then they will say brother SEBI is there, this is there, what should I do and then conveniently those things which you have told by mouth like I tell you Gurgaon real estate will do well  So it is neither doing better than last year nor is it doing better than last year, when it reaches that side even then I will tell you, there should be a clear cut verdict that yes this is it, this is like this, real estate is doing like this or  All these financial influencers said that two years ago the real estate was bad when it was time to buy, now they are taking it to Goa when the valuations are so high and it has been two-three years, so brother, you should not buy in the first place, when you buy, then just imagine the videos  People are coming and not just one but many, there is another one too who is into real estate  He only invests money and teaches only finance to the world and tells people to buy mutual funds, buy my courses, with this money I will buy real estate and brother, write his name also, cases are something and he tells with state face that  The ad has been taken seriously, it is a straight talk and not nonsense, they will say friend it is transparent but it is transparent but how transparent is it brother, he is saying in simple words that bhaiya I will take this, my father told me I will take this and any such state also  No, the arrow state in pumpkin is India's number one, something like this, he is making his good portfolio in whatever state it is and telling all of you that you buy all this, then don't mix asset classes, only this is good, only that is good and  I am saying mix, it means confuse or else money can be earned from everyone, everyone has a cycle, everyone has an understanding, even within real estate, commercial flats, your plots, your warehouses, 50 types of things are built and in every state, every city, every big city  A small town has a different cycle so anytime If you want to judge an extra good astrologer or a good influence then you have to see that you came into his life, he came into your life, he confused your life, he simplified it, did well, you have to judge it on a better stage, it is not a roundabout way.  On top of that, the superficial knowledge, the driver knowledge, which is called giving it up, yes I you will do this, do that, in such a case, the problem actually arises, this happens, I am doing this, I am doing this, I am doing this, I am doing this, I am doing this I am doing it brother, I am doing this, this is never a good advice because so many others can not do it, you are a very strong swimmer, you have good experience, you have a big body, you are young, you are a fast river or rebels, an intelligent guruji is intelligent Influence is so rich that there is too much to cater for everybody and it's not that you look after yourself, it's not survival of the fittest for you, it's dangerous only if it is dangerous then it's dangerous for you You should not even talk about any such thing which is dangerous, it is dangerous for 99.99% of the people, so have you come here to increase your dopamine, feed it at 01, then feed it future options also, get all the work done, you have already done non- fungibility Sage I am taking you, ask him a direct question, what percentage of his net worth, brother? If a person is spending one crore on his child's wedding and the party is worth 100 crores, then his net worth is 1 per cent, but if you have spent 50 lakhs on your child's wedding,  You also invested it and your net worth was only two crores so you put it at 25, then you are looting, then you will say no I did less, he did it only, if someone is buying a car then that is why we do not see that he  I have bought a car, hey bhaiya, how much is his income, what is his net worth, come here and give straight advice that no, I should not buy it, I should buy it, hey bhaiya it has to be done with number of, when I make it, I am thinking if I should make it  I will tell you clearly, number of months of salary, you should buy a car, you can afford more than that from your monthly salary, in this way you can take as much loan as you want, but you should not do that, that is the right thing there are two things in life, one is what  You want what you like the other is what is the right thing and it is not necessary that you like the right thing. So brother if you have a car worth Rs 2 lakh then you can buy a car worth Rs 8 lakh but people buy it for how much  You are sitting, you can see and I am telling you the total, I am not talking about how much is coming after deduction, otherwise those figures will change, I am keeping it simple, otherwise like this then what would you say about a lakh, it is four pa lakh  You will take it, yes you will take it up to five, you can take it up to six, just take it for six months, cross the limit, and if it is more expensive then you should do it for four, then four to six months, and why, by doing logic and all that, good detailed videos will be made.  It will be interesting but what is the market of finance channel or should I tell on this Let me give you the clarity on 25 things because I keep giving clarity on 25 things in this, what is in finance brother, you earn more money in finance, now as far as I am concerned, you don't see me promoting anybody, I do it myself. Hmm, take this, take this one, take the insurance from here, take it from there, take it like this, I do n't say it like this, hey yours, this one, the one who is sitting with 20 lakhs, the finance one, by taking anyone's name it would cost 12 lakh rupees. yes this is the figure now different people have different rates depending on subscribers views and all so brother if you earned 12 lakhs in one video then you can get anything posted anywhere friend you don't need your father's or someone's yes something  It goes away, there is no problem, no one is incurring any expense, you have earned 10-12 lakhs, now you can keep buying any fancy product from that, some of those fancy products will be hits, some will be flops, some of those products have given you money You are telling this to me, but it is the public  You are a fool when you say that the world has given me money, that is why you are giving name to it or any product, you are earning money, now if it sinks then your money is not lost because that  So brother he had given the money, so did n't I tell him after working hard, here comes the conflict of interest, a person earning in crores can afford to lose in lakhs every month, earn one crore and lose 10 lakhs, what's the problem and the 10 lakhs which are lost Those same people had given you crores, so what is the problem, you are in profit, then take names, give this one, give that one, but who will come and check you, someone should come and check you or you all will wait, SEBI will come, it will come  The government makes a rule of Rs. 1.5 crore but people have made bypasses for it and these ones say this is for this and I am showing you this figure, the astrologer will also show this, I am showing it like this, to show it Nothing happens after joining for three months or six months if you have clarity of mind  If you do not get any increased relief, if you do not get any benefit then that is nonsense, that should be the judgement parameter and this is happening, new people are coming and subscribing, the old ones do not watch the videos, it is seen that there is a ratio of you8 but I consider healthy that  If I have one lakh subscribers, then even 8000 is enough. But many YouTubers have gunned down to 2, 3 but it is like that now they are watching only new chickens, the old ones are tired, they are fed up, they have not reached anywhere in the comment section.  is another indicator because from where will you get fake comments, how many will you type, you have 1015 IDs of relatives and friends and even they are not ready to write anything for anyone, the fact is, you should tell your wife as an utter that  Write well about me and say that I have more work to do, this is the truth, if you cannot write it then my request to you is that please tell me in the comment section what I explained through this video, thank you very much
