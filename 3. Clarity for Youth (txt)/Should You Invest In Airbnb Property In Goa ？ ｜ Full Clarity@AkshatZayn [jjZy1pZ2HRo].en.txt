Hello friends this is going to be a very interesting and high learning video I am making this video because many of my subscribers who happen to be subscribers of this utter also have sent me questions so that's why the video is being made the topic of the video will be Airbnb and  Goa and why you should not invest in Goa and Airbnb at all and you will get clear cut clarity on this so there is a popular YouTuber who is Goa based who does finance but now mama tune changes are coming on real estate And some real estate courses and he is talking about real estate and in this he has talked a lot about real estate in a video, I will put it in the link, but I am India's number one clarity giver of real estate, now he will say  He also last time he wrote on Twitter something who has given you real estate clarity, one does not give, one has to take it and you watch this entire video till the end you tell my audience whether I am number one or not, what did he say in the video Too  I will tell you, but if you see his videos generally, he takes an escape route by telling something as an influence on everything, I can be wrong, see this, see that, like this and I will cover each thing one by one, but why did I say I M number one I turn off the keys like Amitabh Bachchan in the movie Deewar I will not give myself any escape whatever I say will happen and it will not happen or it does not happen you can whip me, troll me, write comments, unsubscribe, do whatever you want to do, clear your cut  By putting your neck in such a way, with respect, all in that it is convincing that she is not in anyone else, that's why, otherwise I am number one, so I got this answer clearly, now let's start Air BNB, he has told about some short term rentals in Goa Commercial utilization is better and property is affordable in Goa. There is no benefit in big cities because rental is lower in big cities. Some example of Ayodhya has also been given. It has become very expensive in Ayodhya too, that is not beneficial, he has completely explained that.  have said such things Also come come to Goa, do Airbnb in Goa, it will be very beneficial, it will be very good but the points that have been put in each and every thing, God lies in the details, wherever it has been discussed in the details, it has become vague, so in seven eight points  I will cover it. I will cover such points which they have not seen and they will come to know that this can also happen. I had never thought of this. So I will definitely get four or five points and if they want to answer the rest then it will be discussed again.  You can make a video or your butt still he sucks I call myself Guruji from Gurugram again who made it, I made it, okay everything has to be made by yourself, you have to brand it, you have to do it cutely, you have to do it confidently and as far as many times what  It happens many times that people get confused on the channels, hey, he has 20 lakh subscribers, hey, what are the total views, I also have five channels, you can go to Social Blade and find out what the impact is, there is no such thing, okay, so full knowledge  I am trying to make this video with and wisdom seven  Eight point, I will tell you guys, Akshat ji, his name is 2021 and on his channel in 22, as he told that he went to Goa and was beaten, everything in Goa was beaten because of Covid, so property was available cheap, rental is a function of  The cost price of your property is that you buy a property worth Rs 1 crore, or Rs 1.5 crore, or Rs 2 crore, and if the rent is divided by the rent, then the rent will be less for the expensive properties, so what are you going to do in 2024? What have you done? You cannot be a premise  ok who are you because in the video he said to me hey have you invested in Goa where do you get such talk for around 15 minutes he teased me a bit by doing this okay hey bhaiya I am crazy I will do it to you there  It is necessary to drink alcohol to know what its ill effects are, it is necessary to do drugs to know what its effects are, is there a naked electric wire that needs to be held or else it will give an electric shock, do you want to do it by losing money by playing future or options, do you want to do it? want that i should invest in goa  Get sub optimal returns lose money because I will tell you why you will lose money if you put in Goa in next five years, the facts are logical, it is not of such a lower level, it is just a scripture type debate that bhaiya someone has told some story, I will tell my story  I am telling you, you tell me, all the stories are correct, which one do you think has more probability, which one seems logical to you, which one helps you in decision making, which one does not leave you hanging, any of my videos, any advice, any take away  It is not hanging, brother, you should check it because I am a real estate consultant also, the advice is completely clear cut, if you follow that advice, that advice will be fine, its quality is good, bad, it can be judged but the advice will be clear cut at least  It should be clear, as consultants, our job is to give clear cut information, not to leave any confusion, that you should check this, you should check this, but this also happens, this also happens, so only clear cut advice will be given. First of all, he has said in the video that 200 days  It is charged on rental in Goa and you calculate it, I question this, this is the premium and they are saying that it can be 250 for 200, I am saying it is not 200, it is 150 at best, otherwise it can be 100 as well  I tell him that I am in Goa from April to October and incidentally I am in Goa, it's not like I sit on the sofa and make videos, so I did not go to Goa, I just went and came back after facing a lot of difficulties for 15 days, that's why I was waiting for you, actually something like this  I will make the video only if the video is made. Okay, so I am telling you after understanding everything completely and anyway the rice is cooked, there is no need to eat it raw. Do you ask if there is sugar in the tea or not, then after drinking the entire tea, you will not tell that  There was no sugar in it, so it could be known even after drinking one sip, so those are many days because Goa is only 140 km away from here, from here to here Goa is 140 km away from 20  There is a 30 kilometer long coastline here, in the middle there is their Dublin Airport, a new airport has come up, I am going to tell this story, now listen carefully what happened next, it is not 200 days because from April to October brother it is hot, otherwise there is summer  I will also go there, yes I will go, the hotel rates are so cheap, the rates of good hotels are so cheap, why would anyone go to your Airbnb for 5 days, 10 days, 15 days, if even a five star hotel remains closed, no one comes, there is no cleaning, then it stinks, there are issues  They go for maintenance, they have told so much here, I only want to ask them one thing that since you live in Goa, you have got it managed by your manager, so it means that this challenge cannot be managed even while living there, when you come from outside  Get it managed, brother, the rental yield that is being generated, that rental yield will be eaten up by the manager in commission, no, it is 20, it is 25, he is charging the room on hourly basis, how is he charging, how will you monitor it, you people drive a taxi  take that taxi Give it to the driver, many times the driver himself is earning money by driving the taxi, but you gave it to someone else, the engine oil has gone bad, there is a problem in the gear oil, the tyre has burst, this person took it, the challan has been issued. This has just happened, the scratch has come, this has come, this is where the money remains, yes, it is so easy, tell me the alternative choices, if you don't want to do this then what should you do and those who are associated are going to enjoy it a lot, they have organized a workshop in June  It is for some 1000 rupees. Join my telegram group. In the next five months, I will make you so knowledgeable for free that you will go there and impart knowledge and ask the right questions or it is possible that you will not go because you will become India's number two. I will be one and you all will be number two.  Listen carefully, the thing that comes next is that this calculation is a colour, I came there after meeting the fishermen, I met the boatman, they say sir nothing happens here, who will come here in June, July, August, in this much heat, the hotels are in a bad shape, five star hotels  People keep getting beaten up, who will go to Air BNB, Air BNB is not even Pan India  It's ok, I will make very good videos on that too and explain it a lot because now they are not saying that mine is working, hey, investment decisions are not in the rear view because your rates were low in 2021-22, revenge tourism happened in 2023, now in that tourism, so hotels  Look at the shares of , where have they gone from, because they also talk about shares, so you will understand where have the shares gone from, all these hoteliers, revenge tourism has happened, look at the airlines, where have the bookings gone from, I mean, have any more bookings been made?  That much will happen in 2024 or 25, that is another thing, 200 days is another thing, then the biggest thing that you did not tell is the local politics of Goa, if I tell you seven-eight points, the video will be long but you have to understand because this is big money and this target  Who is the audience and who is going to get trapped, I will also tell you who is going to get trapped in this investment, who is that age group and what is their profile, I will also tell you that, it is going to be very interesting  These youngsters have their father's money and that money will be saved, they are going to pitch it to their father also that look this is a very good idea because there are jobs, it is not being shown that going there will be able to survive, it will not be possible, I am telling you this, I am saving your money Listen carefully, we did not discuss local politics. The people of Goa are fed up that so many outsiders have come from outside. As a tourist they were very welcome because they earn money from it, but now these outside investors, businessmen and they Everyone is coming and the culture itself is changing, the vibe of Goa is changing, what was Goa for us, it gives us peace like this, Dil De Badle Mein song is playing, relaxation pause, now there that dhichak dhichak aau tunak tunak tunak  Tu tum ta ta tu and that goes on till 11 o'clock, melt it down Goa nuisance, you will find North Indians there, how troubled the local people are, look at the politics of Goa, 40 one seats, no government of theirs is clear, sometimes people vote for it four  -Five parties have been formed  Firstly there is Congress and BJP, there are three-four more parties with them, look at their MLAs, how many come and some jump from here to here, some jump from here to here, there is some stability in the way the government runs but what am I trying to say When in the coming times the sentiment of the Goan people will come that this is happening, then the politicians can change things because here it comes to licenses, they are saying that if you take the license, you will get it and then they even take the license  You can go at any time, if this nonsense is happening, then ask in the society whether there is air ban also, today the society says it is allowed, tomorrow it says it is not, your decision making cannot be done because brother you are planning to invest two, two and a half, three, four or five crore rupees  Thinking that you can't be on ifs and buts, you can't be on that the manager will be good because there they say that look your marketing skills should be good, there should be a funnel, for ay it is easy that yes I am so much better than 20 lakhs  Subscriber is coming to Goa, come to my villa, do this So you will get it, from where will a normal man get it, you will spend money on marketing sales, you will give that manager 200-250 days, then that booking will not be yours, where will you save the money, I will explain it with the example of the farmer, from agriculture, since I come from Haryana and  I also have a channel called I am the Guruji from Gurugram. It sounds good that friends have 20 acres, 10 acres, people come to me for consultation, Guruji, grow mushrooms, grow flowers, grow cabbage, because brother  Vegetables are expensive, so wheat keeps growing in all these places, cumin keeps growing, sugar keeps growing, it takes a lot of effort to grow them, it seems like a lot of money is spent in it, do you have that much time and energy or not, someone else can manage it.  If he does it then he will eat up everything from you which cannot be managed by staying local, you have given big rules, thirdly my main point is that local politics can change anything at any time, it is necessary to get into so much conflict  The Portuguese land law is somewhat applicable. If the land was so clear, then these big players would not have come. These big listed players would not have gone and laundered so many things. If the land was so clear, then the chances of getting trapped are high. You would not have got it.  It has to be clear, you have to get the license, you have to do marketing, you have to find a manager, if you find a local manager, he will misbehave, you cannot get him out of anything, local politics, that mischief can backfire, if you bring someone from outside with you, it will be costly because the person is from Bihar, UP or anywhere else  If he goes and does it in Goa, then he will charge more money, a local person may be doing 10 jobs and then he may do it for cheaper, then this is your problem just because you have a license and some scandal happened there, because as soon as a scandal happens  There are these, unfortunately, and it doesn't feel good to even say that, that is what happened, before that there was a politician from Haryana, there was also a Tik Toker earlier, and she was murdered, okay, so all these means, these rumours are spreading here brother, it  Not Easy Risk Reward  Look at the ratio, look at the conflict for the amount, you have to get it at 6, I will get it for you and when it comes to capital appreciation, they say you should look at capital appreciation, so if you buy stocks for rental also, do you buy them only for dividend or  % or would you like that the stock of ₹ 1000000 should go up to 90 and he gives it to you at 6, even then you will incur a loss of ₹ and that is not sustainable, I will tell you why this problem is going to happen friend  No one talked about Laxmideep, no one talked about the port player, this Mamma tune changes like this, everything will become Indian, the Indian tourists are not loyal, they are increasing the crowd in Goa but you tell me this, the most expensive thing in Goa  If the thing is going by air, if I take the example of Delhi, the price of Delhi to Goa Goa to Delhi air ticket is so much, if you book it in October, November, December, January, February, that air ticket is so expensive  Then after going there it does not make any difference that you are staying there for two Hajj and you have to go for three days or four days, the Hajj bill will also come more because you are paying up to Rs 10, 11, 12 or 15,000 for the air ticket itself I am telling you recently, I had gone there last month, so I will tell you the main thing that Lakshmideep Port Blair and we have all this, there is no talk of appreciation as to whether everything can be about rental. because ultimately if everybody has bought houses there because when you go to South Goa from Dabun and leave from the airport you can see that flats after flats are being built, flats after flats are being built, now you don't say that I am a Bhaiya, which region will I go to if I have to stay in a flat in Goa in Air BNB, then what is the problem in Gurgaon, the swimming pool is visible from there as well, what do you say to me from that flat, I cannot see the sea  yes the sea  It is 4 km away, 3 km away, so I will go for a walk in the morning, then I will come back, then after taking a bath, I will go for a walk somewhere, then I will come back, then I will have lunch, then oh brother, for my entertainment, I want that same sea, shacks worth 800 Rs.  It is like that, only the sea is visible, people who have a low budget, all go to see the sea and they have to eat food during the day, there is no arrangement for eating food, if you have to cook Tinda Lauki yourself and eat it, then your wife will say, I will ignore it  I will make a big sit down comedy in which I have a fresh incident that someone I know died in this way and what is his condition but I will tell that on a different channel and separately that how rubbish this Air BNB system is in India. Why is it popular in and out of contact and why wo n't it happen in India because we are different, okay so one thing is that this Air BnB many people also use proxy to convert my hair color into it, you saw in malls  There will be malls inside malls  Shops lie vacant somewhere, no one comes to do anything, but why are you open, are you paying rent here or your goods are not selling, there are employees, these things are also done, I will add these expenses or do it brother, in this  There are also limitations, all your income is counted as residential income. If you get ₹1 rent, it is calculated as 0. You get a rebate of 30 from the government. The government says that you took ₹1 rent for residential area, we will consider only 70 of yours and will impose tax beyond that.  There will be tax on everything the biggest thing is that tie tie fish will be the argument I am just telling you the argument of finance no I will show you the expenses how much percentage can you show tell me you can ask that from the CA hey the fapa sitting here Number one reality, clarity giver of real estate, I am sitting here, I am giving the clarity, you can ask him, you can ask him what is it here, I am telling you everything, you can force rental ID at 8 there. Look, there is a lot of goods to sell there, if builders build it then there is a story, goods are sold only through the story, do I tell stories, yes I also tell stories, now you are in Goa, hey brother, to sell it in Goa, do you have to pass the IET AAM exam  It is there and who knows, maybe I have those exams too, if you have to do it then I can show you my admit card and exam and marks, okay then show me yours, tell me who you are, this is personalized, I have done this, how I did, how I did it  There is got no meaning because people who are on youtube, that man with crores can do anything brother, he will do 10 things, he will get four hits and from that he will earn so much money by showing that he will incur a loss of six rupees and in the loss  He will say that I too had invested, hey, people had invested in crypto currency, people got stuck in the world, now you will give a dialogue that I am a beggar, I will pick up my bag and go away, hey, you are a beggar, you will pick up your bag and go away What would have remained behind, you have spread it by giving knowledge because there are many youth  20-30 people who are from good families, wealthy families and are not doing anything else, they trouble their fathers by watching these videos, their fathers come to us because they don't have wisdom, everyone is roaming around with information and knowledge, half-rubbish  Tell me the thing, this happens, this happens, this happens, this happens, this happens then this does not happen, he gave the example of Ayodhya ji that there are so many rates in Ayodhya, hey Ayodhya ji is timeless, Ram Lalla's temple is only there, he cannot go anywhere.  Beach in India, beach in India, brothers and sisters, there is that Mandvi beach of Gujarat and there is also one above it, from the Run of Kutch, I am telling you the geography, from the Run of Kutch, the entire Indian peninsula is ocean, not much, all of it is beach, oh, not all of it is beach, I can also say  I have been there but it is so much, it is so many thousand kilometers long, so even if there is a beach in it, then there are ten kilometers of beach, it is just that it has not been discovered, you go to your Port Blair, from Port Blair, you write to me, which is that, two-three-three  There are beaches where there are such wonderful beaches  Thing it is just to be discovered, once Lakshmandeep starts then Goa will not be such a great place sir and the math of Goa which I did brother, Phuket is much cheaper to come and go, I am telling you about the five star hotel, five star hotel Delhi ex Delhi going  To Goa and going to Phuket, staying there for five days in five stars, okay, Phuket is cheaper, please go and check, then you people will have to remove this ghost of Air BNB of Goa, I have received a lot of appreciation in Ayodhya ji  When I had told people on Ayodhya ji 2 years ago to buy it on my channel Sango Life Sut, I had told about it, many people appreciated it and bought it because my advice comes only when the cream has not been eaten, now the cream has already been eaten there  Now I am not saying that go and take it, now I am not saying that at this rate it will become a buy, yes, now at that rate everything has been factored because everything has been made but the same thing I am saying Goa  In it is not a bye am, here my aim is not to come and tell me if you have some points on them, it's a flop show, it's a flop show, try it, the risk reward ratio is not favourable for 2024  It is not on price, there is a lot of supply coming, what will happen in the end is that if these flats become so expensive then no one will be able to live here. There are no white collar jobs here, there is no IT sector of any kind here, something  It is not happening here, there is only alcohol, relaxation and music, now the music has become loud, there is no control over the alcohol, people create a big mess, tourists from outside come and are overrated and say that you should go by cycle and you should stay in the villa  Where are you going to send the child, vehicles are running, there is a high-fi resort with a safe surround environment, you can do it there, you have taken some beach, it is a cheap, rubbish beach, somewhere like Anjuna beach, Bagh beach, I mean, fishing, it is like this.  that it is normal there  Why should a man go away, it means you have taken your woman along, you have taken the daughter of your family along, that crowd is such that you will not feel comfortable and where you will feel comfortable, then the rates increase so much, who will come and tell you this  You have to go to a hotel and stay in a room there your sister and wife have to cook rotis and you have to eat tindas and gourds, then postpone the vacation, vacation is about enjoying and relaxing, not eating and washing utensils and even if you provide so many facilities, your margin will be  What is it then it would be better if you say that you should stay there, if I am giving you this much then I have not told you these figures, these calculations, I have told you half the knowledge, I am giving you complete knowledge, it is not worth it because if you do it well then money is nothing  You will be saved brother, there is a simple thing in Goa, you should see the sea, I am going with this much ticket, if I have to stay in a flat then there are some flats in Gurgaon and Noida, you can stay in them, otherwise you will go by walking the cycle, hey, go by riding the cycle  It is not safe, the roads are so narrow and the place where it is being sold is called a village, village, meaning village, not a good village but the real village, there is nothing there, it is not worth it, where is the sewerage going, where is the pipeline going  Which thing is going where, RERA is cleared or not, land is not cleared, there are one and a half crore issues, it's not worth touching it with the barge pole, not worth even going and checking, I even went and roamed around and did all this work as well  I have gone there and seen that Goan Goans are treating these people who are coming from outside and everyone is capturing them, earlier as a tourist they were very welcome, then the pent up anger will come out in politics, it will come out in two or three years, you will see the second one.  You will see Lakshadweep coming, Port Blair will appear shining, Phuket is already yours, so there is no magic going to happen in Goa, that is what I am trying to do, so if you get stuck there, after buying some villas, brother, there is no use of it.  Is You have kept that white elephant, you will live in some other city, the rents will increase or decrease, property will be appreciated, it will decrease, it will increase, something will happen, now I come to the alternative choices right now in Kolkata, in Pune, in Bangalore, in Chennai, big ones  If you don't say city, then people, you are talking about Gurgaon, I did not even mention Gurgaon, although there are 6 stories in Gurgaon too with rental interest between 50 lakhs to 1 crore plus capital appreciation plus the money will be spent in two-three years plus Mawan Construction Plus Capital Appreciation for Short Shot High Returns When Money is Going Slowly You Get Absolute Returns at 10 Also Since Money is Going Slowly It Will Work Out at CAGR 18 In Singles The Property is Given to You Your Kick in at 6  It will be done and check how much loan is available for rent for doing this commercial thing, check how much loan is available for residential and income tax benefits are also available for residential  That when you do a program, you get caught in the GST issue, you take the CA separately and keep crying, you will not understand, look, these people who are running these companies, they have not given complete knowledge, brother, you are running a private limited, running some company, it becomes easy  Because you can spread 50 raita, I did all this by looking at my example again and again, it does not make any difference, if what I am saying is logical, I am saying it logically, then what am I doing  Who am I, what flags have I planted, what have I done, I have no meaning because whatever I did, I did it at a different time, here I should know how to drive very well, you have not driven the car, and you are saying that fast  Driving a car causes accidents. Have you ever driven a car? Do you know what speed is? You already know that if you drive at high speed, drive after drinking alcohol, or drive at night, there are chances of an accident. You have to try this.  Or will I not die after getting stuck in Goa? Karrr a man is saying no, things are going very well for me hey bhaiya when did you buy the property, tell me the year, tell me the year it was the dead year of Covid, tourism was down, there was frustration so it was bye, why are you talking about 2024 and then saying  ho that I did that, it is like parents doing it, that when we used to study, our results were like this, we became like this, you cannot do it, oh brother, at that time so many children did not use to participate in the competition, poor children did not use to participate, now poor children  If the child is carrying a phone then the competition has increased, when there are so many jobs in the competition, check these 180 IAS vacancies, it has been going on for the last 40 years and how many people are attempting and how many people will get the knowledge, then come holistically  I want to tell you clearly, no ifs and buts avoid Goa Air BnB Properties, it is definitely a very top player because now what frenzy is being built up, an atmosphere is being created, India's biggest shark, top most developer of real estate, in the next six  in the month  If it is going on, we know that the atmosphere is being created, so you have to see where the value for money is, join my Telegram group, I conduct webinars, I will do some webinars by taking money, some I will do for free, but brother, I will not do anything worth Rs. 11,000, no one will do that much  It is not expensive, ₹ 50 is ours, it is a two digit coin and that too for auspicious purpose, so that when a window shopper comes, he can pay for his vehicle, you are in a mall, even if you don't want to shop, you can come, otherwise I cannot control the crowd when I become number one I have educated people at LAX through my webinars over a period of time, so those people have benefited from LAX in real time. I get value for money. Things I also tell stories. Not all stories are true, like the stories I told before marriage. All the things that are told are not true that she will do this, she will do this, this will happen, but it is a game of probability, the story that has been told here by these tubers, there are a lot of holes in it, a lot of holes and whatever I have told you guys openly and at the end Anytime any look can make a mistake  It may be possible, but since you have to see how much potential the person who is advising you has to lose money, the person who is earning 10-15 crores, ca n't he invest 50-60 lakhs in crypto, ca n't he play all the games, antique furniture, antique paintings etc.  No, it was non-fungibility, now where did he go, it is possible that he leaves Goa in a year or a year and a half, then you say now let's go to Goa, now this will do well, now you will say what happened to his story, what happened to him, why in stocks also  So this is what happens, you need money for everything HDFC, so brother give the advice accordingly because whatever will be said, no matter how many disclaimers you put like don't take it or take it at your own risk or this is for study, these people will still  Do you think moral responsibility is not legal, I also agree but a creator cannot run away from moral responsibility, you have to give your reasoning, you have to give your clear cut opinion that this is how it is, there will be no capital appreciation here, no problem  You give this to him, you give him the marketing, he just needs to know a little bit about marketing, marketing is the most life-threatening thing, where will the marketing happen from, we know how to generate views here, how to make videos, brothers and sisters, please subscribe  Hey increase your subscribers, increase them, increase them, then come in such a wide that it becomes more lux millions, I will sell you bad now because I am this and who is he, this is age shaming only, hey, I am not saying this  Respect all the elders, but as it is said in body shaming or age shaming, uncle is uncle, uncle means the uncle will not have the knowledge, I am not even an uncle, but I am saying that even if I am an uncle, I may become more technology-fed I Have done stuff which is more technological and other wise but what is that challenge, you tell me so I am saying that my content will speak like Sachin Tendulkar's batting, will speak when Magro and one will troll him only those sixes and fours  If he hits me, I will reply with that only, so I will reply with this only, I will not come and type Vivek Bindra Maheshwari like this, okay, I will tell you my logic here, I say that is the way I understand real estate, nobody is approaching it  That's the way real estate is a mother-in-law and daughter-in-law problem, real estate is a marriage issue, how is this friend, everything in real estate is linked brother, a family issue, no one is sitting with the money, no one can invest it alone and once the investment is over, you are finished.  Donkey uncle or stupid brother in law or maternal uncle gets declared whose money is lost, no one takes any advice from you anywhere in Greater Noida, does nothing to you and now people will do the same thing by putting it here, then Air BNB Goa is no more  There is no point in attending any workshop, I will tell you openly that there is no need to attend any workshop, there is no need to do any real estate service course, take my membership, you will get it at a cheap rate, it will be available at Rs 20, 50 or 100 cost per mille  will And you will get company, you will get practical, brother, you can run PG in Mukherjee Nagar, Rajendra Nagar also, then you won't get it at 2, you will go to Delhi, Mumbai, hey brother, a lot is happening in Delhi, Mumbai, brother, if you play this game here also, then go to Mukherjee Nagar Someone will play this in Gurgaon, people are playing this on sixty yards, go and check in Deal Face, people have bought plots worth 10 lakhs each, built houses worth 12 lakhs, the rent comes to Rs 1 lakh per month, rent is 22 lakhs per lakh  Not for a year, not for a year, it comes to 30 lakhs, but the return on 180 is not rental every month, but now its rate has increased, now it will become two and a half to three crores, yes, still paying 6T, still paying 6% Many locals are considering things as their own and giving them otherwise value for money is the city for small ticket size, Bangalore is for high rental, do you know what is the rental story of Bangalore, okay, memes are made there, then he checks Lincoln's profile.  Landlord takes 6 months advance, I will also cover Pune, Kolkata, Ahmedabad, I will put it there, instead of getting a white elephant of 2.5, 3.4 CR here, instead of this 2.5, 3.4 CR, you can buy five small flats in five cities where the capital  There will be appreciation as well and if ever you need it, you can sell it and the cash flow will increase. You know here you are depending on fancy and fancy products. I have told you this earlier as well, do not buy it anywhere in tourist places because there the local  Man is very dominant, people recently came up with Maruti factory in Kharkhoda, they thought that they will become rich there, the local economy will gain, they will let it operate there, they will not let yours operate there, that program will be operated that way, it is easier said than done, even the people living there  If you are giving yours, just like he is giving it, then you should understand it, so I hope you liked it, I hope it was not meant to belittle anyone or to do something like this, but come brother, spread confusion on those subjects where we are professor number one.  If it is there then it is for the clarity of the students So Professor sahab will definitely come, there is no doubt about it, when he has gone so far that I should keep quiet, no, if I remain quiet and the wrong information is coming and there is no clarity, then this will be told and it will be explained properly.  These are fancy products, you should not enter here at all, there is a lot of money, a lot of spray, even if you are sitting with money, you should not enter here, whether the money is less or more, it is for Goa, if you want a detailed video with all more facts, more facts about Goa,  Culture of Goa, food of Goa, crowded roads in Goa, in November-December every house in Goa becomes an Air BnB, every house of the rich and poor is not typed as Air BnB, it is open, they all shift to one place in an outhouse and complete the work there.

If I have to go there to eat it, I will sit in Gurgaon and eat it. Why do I need to go there and face the hassle? Just go there and see the sea for an hour and come back. The rest of the time you can go to your Air BNB because I don't need it.  I have to pay rental yard Rs 6 but that is why I have come here brother, people go there to cut stones, there is no fun there, once a person goes to Airbnb, he never goes there again, his wife does not go in his family, she says I don't want to go to the house  I had got a maid for shopping, you will get all the work done by me there, I will make a very good video on this too if you guys want because the creator likes to do what the audience wants, okay and that is what you all want  ok so how is it Click on the comment section of the video and write whatever you feel after this video, write it logically and go and watch their video as well, although the issues are the ones that were arranged and I have explained it to everyone very well and my  But if there is any counter point then tell me brother, we will make the video again. Here I do not even need any editor, here it is one shot, 50 minutes, one by one shot, this video stopped somewhere, something like shik shik shik shik happened like in your house.  I explained it sitting comfortably, without moving, without any movement, it meant shik shik pick pick and somewhere else, I do n't speak so fast in English, I don't say this, make it 1.5x so that you cannot understand my main point  You just let me say something in the figures, make some parts, so that no one can ask them any question, and wherever there is a loose hand, leave it there and take the escape route, I did not give myself any escape in this whole video, I am not a clear cut person  Goa no airbnb finished clear cut 2024  There is nothing at the rate of , earning money is speculative, it is over hyped and if you don't understand then go and travel for five days, whatever I told you, you will understand it yourself, you will understand the whole thing yourself  You will understand it and there is no need to attend any workshop, I will do the ₹ 1000 workshop for ₹ 50 depending on my mood because those career charges have to be paid, so below 100 if you want, brothers and sisters, to attend webinars and do something else Even if it is free, you can join the t gra group given in the comment section where all these notifications are made and all the information is given.

I get them and their subscribers become my subscribers and I get cheap publicity this way, people say that you take the name of cheap publicity, yes cheap publicity, everyone is cheap, even politicians, actors, who is crazy to spend money on it, I mean me  If I spend crores of rupees for publicity, if this is happening then it is good, but I used my hard work and made the video using my mind and applied logic to everything, I applied logic on each and every point, the shares taken at the rates of 2021-22 are also very good  There are all of them, buy them now, whether the payout ratio is 70, 80 or 90, whatever it is, if there is no growth, if the competitor's product is about to be ready then buy it because brother I have and hey, what is this I have and brother what are you that your  Follow in the footsteps of what ever you have achieved and anybody who has achieved has been achieved in a different time frame, today is a different time frame, nobody can copy, anybody, nobody knows how success is achieved like this, but where does success come from? how does it happen nobody knows anything, everybody gets lucky and then they come because there is a limit to the knowledge of finance, everyday they come and do the same things  But how many topics will you make? I have five channels and I will open two more and I will be India's number one YouTube in terms of subscribers on different channels and the impact I make. So I am working on it. I have no fear of competition at all.  Someone's but I am telling you people that real estate is a very important thing to learn because if there is a problem in mutual funds then you do not invest two and a half crores in mutual funds and you do not even buy a single fund but in real estate  If there is a problem, then a loan has been taken and the fraud has happened and the interest is being spent and the fraud has happened and the money is not coming, then it is very important to know and understand about real estate and nobody else is teaching till now because now theirs too  The course we are doing, no one was doing it till now and no one is doing it at the mass level that I am doing it at. What ever knowledge of real estate he is bringing is shoppers' knowledge is superficial knowledge, it is childish knowledge, it is all  T  Keeping yourself as a centre, brother, my kids are small, I have to eat in Airbnb. Hey brother, there are people with grown up kids, there are also people without kids, India is very big today, if I make a video, I cannot make a video about what is going on in my life.  According to my life, my life is different. I am a different kind of man. I have a different kind of life. That means everything will continue like this in India. I cannot impose the trends of life on myself as to what I want. I belong to a very small class. Those who have small kids, their wife can do the cooking, you need to go, they also get fed up there because you require support, there is support inside the house also, then why is Airbnb successful in foreign countries and why is it not successful in India I will also tell you that the standard outside is different, things are different, the system is different, one video would be very long, otherwise I will tell you very clearly about Air BNB, that if you want to go abroad, then how is India because in Goa you will experience such things  There are places like this in the streets  one does not feel safe, one does not see another person, you want to stage, yes you are seeing many tourists, people are according to your language, according to your that way, so that you can feel a little safe, go anywhere with your head held high, take your family anywhere  Keep it there and if some rude fellow tourist comes, look, the locals are very nice, I am not saying anything like that, but if some nonsense fellow tourist comes and you are staying in a limited area, I have experienced this  From people's experience because whoever comes there comes to do the program, you know what program happens there and after doing it, many people are left shaken, so where do you have to stay, it is a very important thing, with your face raised  You cannot stay with your family somewhere like this that I will go to Air BNB, the room next to yours has four boys in front, what will you do then, you are making noise going up and down, then whom will you go to, your experience is getting spoiled, will you take that risk and people  why are these things getting worse and he is not doing anything like that  You can complain to the police or anyone if someone says Namaste to your wife Babi ji then what charges will you levy Bhabhi ji Namaste then the person is saying have you done anything Bhaisahab I have not done anything Bhaisahab Bhabhi ji Namaste you have to act and only then you can get the number  I am one only then I am number one because I understand 200 things which people will not bring out, even though the video is long but I understand and what you do now, four Bhabhis are saying Namaste, they are not doing anything, what charge will you put by going there, actually something  I am not doing it but that is enough to make you feel uncomfortable, so with this raised face, such Air BNs do not work in India and one should not go like this and should not buy them and Goa is no Air BN B is no, thank you very much to the channel.  Like, share, subscribe and make people aware, brother, make videos with so much effort so that the ghosts of people are exorcized, these people who come to offer, sometimes they offer the world, sometimes they offer crypto, sometimes they will offer this and after that become a fakir  that we will leave and then we will say don't talk about that because this one  It will take 5 years for a thing to fail in the world, it happened suddenly, so in that it happened like, oh my god, it happened suddenly, but this music, the music of Goa, will take five years to stop, it will stop and  These are the reasons I told, it will stop because of that, so please spread it, I don't say this on every video, I am saying this just to emphasize and also press the comment section and write, I also need clarity on how you like my content Bhaiya Hey you guys, are you not thinking that I am the only one, write more those who believe that I am the number one clarity giver and those who don't believe that no no you are also overhyped like Goa, then write that too, thank you very much
