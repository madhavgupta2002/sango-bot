Hello friends, this is a very important topic. It affects maximum people in society. You have to share this video with everyone. The topic is why do you sleep late at night or are you sleeping late at night? You are awake till very late, especially because of social media. I will also add a little bit about youngsters and ponies and I will also give ideas about them. Generally we will discuss why he is sleeping late. Many people normally discuss that one should not sleep late, one should sleep early.  Benefits of waking up early Disadvantages of sleeping late Friend, everyone knows this These are childish videos okay, you know my content is a bit higher order and a bit deep so I am going to explain some deep things It is going to be a lot of fun First of all we should do  The world is ready to tell what is needed, but someone should tell us why we are doing this, this is very important because it is very easy to say this, give up alcohol, give up smoking, don't do such wrong things, you should live like this, do Kapalbhati in the morning, do it like this  Everybody knows this, eat food like this, don't worry like this, do meditation, all this  You know it doesn't happen, so the reason is that first he should learn why it is happening and then he should learn how to stop it, everyone knows those benefits, there is no need to count the benefits of sleeping on time And what are the benefits of sleeping properly? Why is it happening? The routine of people today has become such that they are not living consciously and purposefully. They are wasting a lot of time in such pursuits and things that by the evening you yourself realize it.  I did n't get anything, I didn't get anything, I came late from work, didn't eat food on time and then realised one thing that it's already 10 o'clock and me time hasn't even arrived yet, then at 10, 10:30 me time starts and  Then we don't know how two, three or four hours pass by in our me time, and even in our me time, people may not be consciously aware of this thing, but what is happening subconsciously and it comes to our mind that I have lost this sense of my mind.  So you start listening to some things, you might be listening to my videos as well  You must be listening to Gyani too, although I am also a number one clarity giver, but after listening to his words, the purpose is not met anywhere, then you get distracted and then say that oh I have worked hard, now let's do some entertainment, now that entertainment thing  He wakes up at 12 o'clock, when he messes up for two hours that he thinks that nothing happened here as well, now something else, now in the affair of that and that, depending on the age group and gender and what ever the situation, it changes for everything  It is separate, then they enter into it, so people are sleeping at 1 o'clock or 1:30, you identify it through this, after that some other attempt is made to wake them up, the public is doing only two things, there is nothing else because when it does not wake up  So then an attempt is made to awaken it, what happens is that there is nothing great here either, and then the telecast is repeated every day, then the story from 10 o'clock, then I remember your story, this is happening with everyone, the ways to avoid this are, first of all, whatever work you have to do  Have to consume social media anywhere One thing to look at in any content creator is that there are so many click baits that the matter inside is not that much, something else is promised outside, you are not going to become rich by watching any content, you are not going to become fit by watching any content Nothing great is going to happen to you with any content, the only thing is to follow that thing plus use that content purposefully, do not follow more than 10-12 content creators, you cannot follow practically, people subscribe to 1.5 crore channels but do not watch them  It is not that you like one video of someone, no content creator is taking you on a journey, I try, I have my own different channels, at least I am conscious that if you are connected with me, connected every day, then  You will feel like you are on a journey that I was somewhere and I have reached somewhere now and maybe I will reach somewhere else, this is not my job of doing grinding of the mill that I come everyday and do SIP of mutual fund, now you will make one crore on Excel, now you will make two crore In 30 years, you will become a millionaire in 40 years  If you invest, you will earn this much, I say invest for 90 years and you will directly earn thousand crores because why don't you put 90 years in that Excel, if you did so much in 90 years, then there are people like Ankur Warku and  It is necessary to take the names of a few more but they don't take you anywhere, you are not reaching anywhere and then after consuming so much of this content your subconscious feels that if you are not reaching anywhere then you will reach something else because your soul needs that to reach. Thing happiness and purpose and that feeling of reaching somewhere, something is happening that when I wake up in the morning, I get up a little smarter than I was while sleeping today or than what I was when I woke up this morning, I do some research, I do webinars, I do courses, I speak in them, brother. You should write it down because it will be like a satsang, as long as you are connected, you will enjoy listening, three-four useful things will be discussed in 15 minutes, write down those four lines and read those lines again sometime and follow it a little  Then life will change, it is not happening just by listening, this is the biggest thing and whatever time you are wasting during the day, whatever so- called work you are going to do at night, you can do that work even when you are wasting your time  Now look at how many things you are wasting your time in, and the time wastage that is happening is happening in the inability to say no, to please that person, to please that person, you went there when you were purposefully Suppose at 8009 you have achieved something during the day then you can say that now I will just relax, I will not stay awake till late, I will also watch these videos purposefully for one and a half hours, I will also give you hints on how to watch the videos In any video, within the first one and a half or two minutes, you get to know what is going to happen. Whenever you are listening to any good one and a half or two minute videos, you feel that this dish is very good.  If yes, then download it or save it for yourself. Now play it in my playlist as it is mine.  Do I have any videos now, I will claim mine, you can see all of them but it is possible that I also come on different topics, all of them do not concern you, if you are a housewife, then job will not concern you, no one should invest in real estate  If you want to do it then he will not understand it as a stock person, if someone does not want to understand a mental model then I also have a buffet, but the video which you feel that friend this is good or it is a hit and because I had given so much to me, where is he, oh my friend No one even remembers, I have already done 1500-1800 videos, so keep the ones you like. Similarly, whichever content creator you like, you keep a different masala of it and then when you are sitting comfortably, you can use it purposefully.  Consume, make notes and then do your own thing because this soul wanders from 10 to 12 on everyone's social media, those doubts, doubts, doubts are going on, that useless content is coming and going, film content and this one too, I have done it purposefully myself.  of the people of  So I started consuming something like this so that I can save you guys' time, someone said to me Guruji, you say that you don't watch pictures, you do this, so you started reviewing pictures, on my other channel I have Guruji from Gurugram  I have a new channel, on that I am doing reviews etc., of movies, of everything, so you are telling me to do something in life, and watching these movies does not achieve anything, and there will be no benefit, this will not happen, it will not happen  That will not happen, I replied to him that friend, for me watching movies is work in the office, I am earning money by reviewing movies, you are going to the movie for entertainment, I am going there and saving your time or by telling you about it beforehand  That bhaiya is it worth going to or not worth going to and after seeing my five six seven reviews I will also gain credibility, the movie which I said was bad turned out to be good, you liked it okay and the one which I said was very good you found it bad and  If this thing happens three or four times then I am a useless content evaluator for you because look, for many people, even then I can be good, okay so that means my frequency and explaining to you is that okay then do n't consume me, tell me brother I will not see your review, your reviews are like that only but many people are liking my reviews very much now they know that friend  He watched the web series, understood it, tested it, evaluated it, reviewed it and recommended it because I never give spoilers. You will never find spoilers in any of my reviews. Whatever is latest, there will be an analysis later. You may be there in the analysis but not in the review.  So this is how you have to consume consciously and sleeping late at night is happening only because your subconscious knows that even today you can use deity words and there can be other good, dirty and bad words too but you are a fool  A man can say that your subconscious is saying, hey idiot, you spent today also, nothing came out of your life, now you have not realized anything today, as if you are stuck in this mood of the world, this, the same job, the same boss, this is like this  Some?  Life is not moving forward, you did not get any idea, you did not find anything workable, look further, you may get a SIP, someone is giving freedom to Ankur Wari in 30 years, someone is giving it in 25, someone is giving it in 40 All such claims are being made, someone here, do this, do that, become an empen, become like this, become that, there will be a clear video on this also that this is also a disease that you will want happiness, in what is happiness, in how  I will tell you a little about it, my Happiness Course One and Happiness Course Two are very iconic courses, if you take platinum membership of the channel, then you will get to see them, recently there was Happiness Two Conclusion, there are six or seven, okay, you will get to see those as well You can take membership and consume the content carefully. Evaluate the content. If you or someone else does not like the content, then there is no need to go there again and again and waste time. See who will take you on the journey in the content. what are you going to do that you got involved with  Did you move ahead and get the feeling that yes, I have moved ahead? If you followed a creator for two-three months, you should get that feeling, right? So brothers and sisters, before leaving I am asking you guys who are associated with me, are you subscribers?  Platinum members are already saying that a lot of good is happening, that is a matter of expense but I am asking the free ones, I am asking the free ones, do you people feel after consuming my content cross channels that this is what I have said  He spoke in English, you are going on a journey, you are reaching there, there is a feeling that we are going somewhere, we will reach somewhere, something is happening somewhere, at least I am asking you to shed the load, I am asking you to shed the extra baggage, so if you do this  If you feel like it then stay connected and consume such purpose full content and find purpose in life and only then you will have to sleep because you should have an idea of ​​what you have to do the next day by 8 pm, only then will you be able to sleep and  You will feel like getting up in the morning to do that work for which your Eureka has come.  It's a day now but if you have wasted your time with losers saying that this is a scam, that is a scam, you have said that Sandeep Maheshwari has a big army but I have to take the name of that Sandeep Maheshwari by choosing content like that You took it, however they too have started copying my content because their content writer must be thinking that this is a small channel, take it from him, who is going to tell us, I am not telling Sandeep Maheshwari ji, if he knows it then maybe he won't  If one consumes it, he says that he has seen it but only the topics that are visible to me are the same as usual, middle class ones, just like that, I have posted the UPSC one, so people send them to me, so now I say that I am number one, I have the original clarity. I am a giver who is raising the issue, I am raising the issue in originality and I take lot of happiness and satisfactory issues that now I have told you the reason for sleeping late at night, it is very easy to say don't sleep the whole day  Take your time as if someone  He is asking for a note from you, do n't take it and give it to me for free, this is the message for everybody, what did I learn today, like on every video of mine, my request is, write a video set name, write the date, write something whenever I hear it and in one line  Write that today we learnt this, the purpose is full, we have to consume the content, we cannot sleep because we are getting all that knowledge, we are actually getting it and we are not getting that much from real people, father is not able to give it, mother is not able to give it  As far as the colleague is not able to give, there seem to be people who are willing to give, but we are not consuming it purposefully and there is a lot of noise in it, meaning that the useful thing is available in less quantity and the things around us are available in excess.  And there are many other things like motivation etc. It is fun to listen to them. I will make a separate video on which friend we will find and which friend is good for us. I will also make a separate video on happiness for now.  There was such a dose, please tell me how did you like it and further you please do it purposefully  consume content thank you very much
