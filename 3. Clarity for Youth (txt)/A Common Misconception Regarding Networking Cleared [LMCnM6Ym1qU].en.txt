Hello friends now the misconception regarding networking which most of the youth is committing this mistake, so I will try to address it with practical, you people will benefit and see, nowadays you know it is the era of network, is it told like this  It is true, yes it is true but I want to tell you what is going wrong with this network, what is happening with the completion, do you want to start your own startup, do you want to work on your own or do you want to start your own network in the economy  If you want to expand your network and also want to expand your network in your job, then you can take numbers from here, number from there, number from there, hello, excuse me sir, ok sir, people go to networking events where everyone comes and their numbers are exchanged amongst each other. Yes brother, there will be a speaker, there will be good food and drinks, there will be some event, then after that everyone will go around taking each other's numbers, the problem is that the network is yours only for those whose valuation you have done or have come in direct contact with or have done any good to them, that much  You have a network where you can roam around with number 15005000  Are you doing this nowadays you know you can get numbers, there are many such systems, just give me the number, give me ₹500 and take the number for ₹500, there are many such systems running, there is no benefit in doing this, genuinely they have to do it for your retirement. If you add some value to them, then only it is your network. Going to networking events is full of hardship because everyone has come there to build a network. So everyone will say, okay, give me your number. You can do something for me, I will do it for you.  I will do something for you no one does anything for anyone when both of them have to get something done everyday for their own benefit you bill have to make it harder they feel that this is the benefit when there will be some mentor, there will be some guru, there will be some guide, there will be devil  Here charge consultation fee and they bill you have some course and you have to do something but they say something in return they add value to you that you will see nothing will happen in free fund went everywhere took email id did cold calling sent email yesterday  dali i want you to come with you sir i Really like, you did it like this, what is he getting the benefit of, in this way he doesn't have to spend any money, he wants to do it for free sir, I want you to do it for free, but why do you want to do it for free, will his brain get tired, his network does it  What is its modus operandi, what is its algorithm, for this he wants to ask you people, it is not that long ago, from where the network has definitely run, there are many benefits of relying on it, but the solar approaching long inside place which I find  This LinkedIn is overrated, no one is sitting there to do good for anyone, everyone is sitting there to show themselves and many times what happens when you have to do a search, there is a LinkedIn profile, if you want to know about the job like I  I note on the link carefully because you want to share knowledge, if you want to share some great thing then you want to show your great thing, I am here, you have done it by setting this, then if you add any cherry, then look at it, if you add any cherry, then let me see it  Still it is of no use  That is your vanity that yes I have followers, you are doing good or not, is any good happening to you and all those who are in LinkedIn want a job of their own and if they don't have the strength later then there is no point in putting this X, everything is for you  they are moving ahead with the help of crutches and that system is such, if you ask directly then you will not know, brother it is not like this inside YouTube, in the space of YouTube because if you are making sense, although here also people move ahead by doing a lot of things  Yes, you know that I was an ex-founder, this business did not work out for me, this business did not work out, some businesses did not work out, now my business is running, I will teach you how you should do business, I am Hari, so such people also  You are using it a lot but what I want is that you don't eat the paste on your current form, how is your current form, you cannot eat the paste bread, you were a very good cricketer for many years, how you used to hit choke sixes, that's it, you even liked it a lot  You do n't have any idea, now you are not imparting much knowledge because if you don't have communication skills then you cannot become a coach  Maybe someone else is becoming something else, you can also see in the cricket team, the greatest batsman is not becoming me, I had to tell him and understand how his natural talent was, so network when you are to network install fight and fifteen intelligent individuals In whose life you can add some value, who can add value to your life, don't do this, waste of forced time, waste of brain juice, don't run after people, not them, someone will do good, some person will do good to someone  Friend, this is not going viral on social media, there are so many sites like LinkedIn, in anything every person has his own agenda and you have your own flag, if those agendas are matching then a win-win situation is happening which is called rose  Okay, otherwise if you think that from the point of weekend, you can catch hold of someone with a point of strength, either he/she is your brother, relative, friend, reference or he/she likes you, if you have good luck then it is a different matter, otherwise normally nobody is going to you help you is d message to  The butter in this is that you will have to try it, spend money and try it and eat it, this one said it is useless, this one said it is bad, someone will tell you the right thing or you can take a little juice of each and make something of your own or you can get something from that also which is a lesser thing because  The thing about less has been told so much but your less will be this much in it sir, nothing can be exactly yours because if there is variety of audience, someone is taking this out of it, then that out of it and someone else is taking this out of it  If it is being taken out from there then the date bill depends on what you want to do next but date hard work bill be brother IT bill not be straight line life story done event got 100 marks and you got it out very good this thing soft  A lot of money is going on in these networking events. The organizers of these events earn a lot of money. I also get offers to speak. I know I deliberately don't know that if I have to go then I have to pay the fee. Then I will buy that item.  The number type has reduced, you come and do an item number, take money and tell the public something like this  There is no roundabout stickiness, my sticking is such that if I am trying to make a profit and I want my benefit, then you should be directly asan pradhan, what is the need of you, what do I need of your platform, so whatever will be the right thing in your life  There will be proper networking and everything, put this filter in it, okay it is not like that only the organizer is going there, you are just enjoying the cool breeze there, a five star or four star event is happening, you are getting some food and  They waste a whole day of their life and half of the speakers there, I also attended the event, I had to speak and I would like to speak only in English, Artificial Intelligence, Oh my God, by showing slides in English.  And everyone comes after doing this, I said friend what fun it is to come, I mean it would have been better to sing a song here, the one that Tamanna Bhatia is doing with Rajinikanth, it would have probably been more entertaining, which is happening today.  Meaning, if you are wasting so much time then it will not come and you have to give that event by taking good money, it is not as if it is free  It's fine for you, you give money, you eat and drink, if something happens then don't waste your time in Dehradun, he tells you things, in such events he has a friend, that ship is above mutual funds, tell him about the work, you come and do the same IF  You will invest in this with this and this bill will happen and you will do this setups these six packs bill will come in these days okay start singing like this and do this means you are seeing like this friend this much qualification so much  It is sitting here that we can reach it means okay I am not sitting with any qualification and like this and confidence English full style complete court type and wear it well speak good English and the audience yes brother even if you are not able to understand everything while listening then it is good  The people who have come after paying a lot of money are going away and then they see this again and again and then they get disappointed because the money is being wasted everywhere like this 500, 1000, 350, 5000  There are rates here, okay, they say that the sarees are the same, this is not practical because after attending 5-10-20 shops and spending 10, 20, 30, 50 thousand, you feel that the story is not like this.  All those who are doing events, they are doing events again and again, they are just working for money, again and again. Okay, we will teach you how to become rich. Okay, we will teach you how to become rich and we ourselves will become rich. Okay, this is a practical video of mine.  It is one, if you have seen that you make one crore in it then the work that you know is simple, it is not easy to look at, what I told in it, if you have not seen the video then watch it, but it is not a cut in it, how will the government get the clearance How will the rescue come for it then what will be the problem in it, oh brother you will have to do that, how much easier is it in India, if you want to earn 1 crore rupees in a month, then life comes out, that too is through networking, in a way I am not talking about network in marketing  That means I told you how to get a job outside For this, you must watch the video which is done in between the people, if you haven't seen it, if you haven't subscribed to the channel yet then do it, practical things will be told and you will definitely reduce practical things in life, but it is not easy, it is so simple. You will also understand the difference between simple and easy, it will happen in your life too. I will give you a small example, for losing weight, eat less food, do more exercise, there should be calorie deficit, weight will start reducing, this is very easy  It is simple, it is a simple rule but it is not easy. So whatever my content is will be very simple, I bill not cleaning it, rest of the people, Alam Balam is going on in the market and many people are involved in it, so I said once You guys should give some clarity in this aspect, please do this every time, check one or half of every cricketer because it is not necessary to eat all the rice whether it is cooked or raw, even a little bit can be found out, okay? You can make your notes and find them  Your day after tomorrow is the best thing for you thank you [music]
