One question that I ask all my guests towards the end is that is their definition of success, although we have talked about success and understood it from many perspectives, ending today's conversation, if you have to give a  very short crisp definition of success what would that be success is when i can own my time and interact with people who i want to when sambalpuri and ever anybody will be so successful including the heads of the state that they will do whatever they want Including heads of the state, they will also be given a timetable. Yes, we have to go here today, okay, but still they can decide mostly the agenda of their life. If I can decide the agenda of my life, that is one second when I wake up in the morning.  no what I have to do there must be something to be done and that is I deciding again what has to be done  not something else, I am not taking my body anywhere that it should be told that it will do this work, no, my soul itself will tell that body that this work has to be done, so whatever my soul is telling my body, then if my body  If I am listening to my soul then I am living a successful life. Why do my body and relationships break? Mostly it is because some other body or some other soul controls you. Whatever troubles you are facing in your life, they arise from this very thing.  All the troubles of knowing how to control yourself are too much and that what mess or unhappiness, so in the pursuit of that what have people done to become successful because even after hearing the definition what will people do and they will cut the connection that I will not even go to work, I will not even get married  I will not do this, I will not do that, I will not do this, then no one will control me but the fact of life is that you can still live a life, you can still live a life wherever you can and it comes at a stage it  done start at 23 you  can't achieve this at 23 I think 40 42 is the earliest some people never at 60 also they are slogging that you did not come this happened otherwise you should not be a slave of time because something else is happening all the time so that is success otherwise  You can say in short the meaning of success is when you sleep at night and you wake up in the morning you should be a little richer something should be happening in your life that in 10 hours at night your net worth should increase whether it is 0.01 whether it is shares or property  Whether it is there and what you woke up in the morning from, when you are sleeping, you should be intelligent and wiser even at 001 while sleeping, so always every day try to learn something one thing new from anybody, anybody like I am just learning different ways of tying laces -  I am learning a few different techniques because I have been tying laces for so many years and my laces keep coming loose, then I discovered no, it can be tied in such a way that it doesn't open, I mean it is a small thing but then I just learned it and by mistake some video came and I was like, dude, videos are made on this too, videos are made on how to tie the laces Yes, I will also make a video on how to tie a tie, so you need a little excitement as well, if you are not getting excited everyday to learn something new, then it is not a successful life, a successful life should be, I can do as much of what I want to do with my time I have been that successful 100% lock in, heads of the state cannot control the time but the percentage is more, if you feel like doing a podcast tomorrow then do it, otherwise no, you did not do this successful Amit ji which you have done  I have given my perspective on success, it is so unique because I ask this question to all of my guests and everyone explains the definition of success in different ways, but largely some four or five  What I have found so far is that success is distilled down into buckets: contentment, peace, joy of what you are doing, enjoying the process. These are all very common answers, but the way you are looking at success. What I really liked about your answer is that when  You sleep in the night from the time you wake up to the time you sleep you should be 0.01 what ever number of percentage that is should be wiser and intelligent and when you wake up in the morning you are richer and wiser by that much or any percentage A table was and I tell everyone else Allam Ballam so I have become the topper student of your channel as well right now if someone better than me answers then tell him so this anything you cannot measure, you cannot improve a big thing if you can't  Check your weight, you cannot reduce and improve it, so we can improve only those things which we can measure, if the fever is high then reduce it  If it is there then we will have to measure 102 brother, the thing which we cannot measure, now if someone says I love you so much, I will love you more, what definition, so all these content pieces are English, everyone says it but my work in life is this which is my  Our mission is to say things that can be done, the rest is all just rhetoric. Our core objective of The Journey Within channel is to provide actionable insights such that you can take action in your life from today itself and improve your life.  The topic is The Journey Within. We help people to understand their own inner wiring. The inner self is where your belief systems are formed, your perspective on life is formed, where you process your thoughts. Feelingless, that is what I try to extract out.  I guess that with that insight people can improve their life day by day, even if it is a little, we talked about 0.00%, at least with that percentage and their life can be improved.  Whatever the experience is today, it should be better than that tomorrow, so that is the core objective, so thank you for joining me for this conversation on the journey with this podcast, thank you very much
