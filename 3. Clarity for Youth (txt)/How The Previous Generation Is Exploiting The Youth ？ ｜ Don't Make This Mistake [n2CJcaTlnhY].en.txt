Hello friends, now the mistake which scenario citizens are doing with youngster next generation is that they are making a lot of mistakes. Elderly people may be your parents, may be your relatives, may be uncles, whoever is the senior of your family, it is very important to watch this video and till  See and reach out to them. If you yourself are a scenic citizen, then you comment and you are a youngster, this happens to you, if you identify, then you tell about the unique features of the society.  Bringing topics which directly impact your life and after listening they open your notes and give you clarity. That's what I have brought, please spread it. Youth is on this traveling channel clarity, but youth is on clarity, so it is okay. I am giving this war in clarity first of all because those who will speak, those who will blame, those who will understand will understand, you have to give this video to them, you have to give this video to every elder in your life and put it on your family channel. And you have to understand it well, what is happening to those who are in their 678, they are called elderly, it is okay after 60, now these people have retired, they had worked at some time, had reduced taxes, had saved money, they were middle class.  There is the audience, I am talking about the rich class who are sitting on money which is not even 0.5% and I am talking about the lower class who are poor people, okay so I am talking about a tabla with them.  If you try to identify then the problem is that this new generation does not value the time they have. If they do not have their own money then they give it to the next generation through sons and daughters. This generation knows how to pass all the money through you and wants to do so.  But what happens in that is that their money is lost, they want their time to reduce this and that, our ₹ 400 goes back. In that, if your child is working for ₹ 2000 an hour, it is worth 4000, he has to take leave. He will have to come from office, he will have to go early, it doesn't matter to you, he is doing his own economy, he is a small businessman, someone is doing his own business, he is definitely doing it and by mistake, one population is very young, above 18 years.  This 27-28 year old girl who has n't done much in the sense of being employed does n't seem to be working but people are being driven by unpaid drivers. Do you have any relative or a child like this? You called him son, take two laddus, take two laddus, drink a cup of tea, do something for him and two-three-four hours of his life, take me there, take me there, take me there, today he is going to come to them.  Take it like this, this is happening blindly and many parents are so stupid that they have given their children to their similar friends and relatives in the circle that they will take ours, I will take my uncle, I will take my ji.  Go  Take uncle ji, take uncle ji, whoever speaks like this in the relationship, aunty ji whoever, take them, yes, I want to show them to the big lions, I bring such things for you people and small towns.  It is also applicable in me that brother, Uber is Ola, if not Uber is Ola, then the taxi driver is if not the taxi driver, and in many cases, when children themselves try to give a driver or someone like this to get rid of their farts.  If there are, then the parents become very distant or the elders become very distant. Well, I want to show you that the value of time was not that much in your time, there was more laser activity or the system itself was such that without standing in the queue, there was no hassle.  Do something without eating, there were no shortage of things, so you think that it will still have to be like this, then it will be lost, how will we go, these days all are assistants, you go to a big hospital, you go to a good hospital, there are people to show you and understand. Online booking will be done on Zoom also tomorrow  Let's go where the doctor does not have such disease that your body has picked up from the story or you have taken OPD earlier with the doctor, how does he know about you, the file knows that brother, he has some issue of lux, okay so his medicine is going on.  So the secretary is asking something, does anyone have any issues, does anyone have shoes like this, as per your report, I have seen that now as if there is a heart, now by putting something like a fund in the heart, I will see that there is something wrong with the eighth, that one of yours. One will see the cholesterol report  You will see something like this, if you look at the results of whatever tests are done, then all these things are happening, but what is happening, many times the elderly do not have time to pass, what is there in the elderly these days, that is, there is no creativity and productivity. Now people will say, why are you against them like this? Hey brother, you cannot pass your time by hanging in the next population generation, you can pass your time in the park, do it, do pranayam, it is okay, if someone catches you, he must have some knowledge of coercion. Pass your time by doing this like this, you go to the bank again and again, print out the HD and how much is it, how much is my bank balance, how much is my bank balance, go to how many banks, which is not an extra, one day when this  The population will be settled in the next 10 years. I am telling you that there will be no physical banks. Not all banks will be there. All of them will go to Java. There will be no physical banks. There will be a place to keep the servers and banks will have bill hanging. 90% of them are engineers, they should be less.  will go  The elders have given less time to see if it can be done in some other way because the fear is that the bill will be out of 10, whatever comes to them, there will be eight which may be like that, it is definitely not from the next generation and two.  I definitely have the power to do so, if you fall into two, schedule it and do it as per the time and tell them that the other vices of the next generation have been set up and I can't even dream of this. I am a social observer and also a social reformer. like this one  Take a few words from the social scientist and say something in English which is telling the society that you are wasting a lot of time of the next ones and making their mother sour. Do you know how ill-mannered he is in addressing the elderly?  I have never eaten as much food as you have in your life. Your child eats in a week. You know how his job is hanging by a thread. Okay, and you are hanging on to him, then you will say, well, this daughter-in-law has a big mall.  it's great to roam  They go to our time, hey, going to the mall is their recreation, those who are mine, they have to breathe or watch a movie or live so that they can rub Jain till the next week, if they reduce it for a whole week, after that then the rest of the time. In all this stuff, you are looking at the swords and money back, if they spend their lives in it, then they will be destroyed. Mental Health of Youngster Security Faster. You are seeing the cases, how many.  The young are facing heart problems and all the other diseases. The elderly do not have such big issues right now because once their body becomes physically weak, they cannot run that much, cannot lift hymns, cannot run and so on.  Everything is just bat, nothing else, what do you have to do the whole day, you have to take a short walk, take a long breath, I am speaking only to those who are living comfortably, those who are getting pension, which is the source of income, it is not for poor people.  video which hd  If you are of interest to everyone and that is all, then brother, please spend a little of the twenty-four eighty-eighth rupees to cover the cost of the child who is providing you, the child who is providing you the solution so that you can proceed in the manner that I have made your appointment.  Have booked there many times and learn that also, you are in your 80s, it is not visible, the button is not pressed, the mind is not reduced, I am not speaking for them because people will go straight to trolling due to old age.  40 years old is a scenic citizen. 60 years to 100 years old. You turned 60 yesterday, it happened the day before yesterday. 40 years old, you will not cry for 40 years. You have raised a child for 5 years and 8 years. You studied for 10 years. He is doing well. You were there again 40 years ago. What child? Now you want to study with him 40 years. You will definitely need him one day. 65 Note it D. Next, you can press your button.  Learn to press, learn from your grandson or from your daughter-in-law or son, whenever you are free, how to do this, how to do this on Paytm Google, once you download it, let me tell you, okay, keep less money in that account so that your  It is okay to be Jamatrana and the whole thing, you teach us slowly like this and also take the war, if you want to see that our parents do not hang on you, then you will have to empower them because every time Dave is greedy and something.  That friend, this is mine, please recharge it, now what is less? Recharging the phone takes less than 5 seconds, it takes less than 10 seconds, but friend, you are doing something less, you are busy in something, elders have no idea, so do it.  Giving it now is just a matter of mental pressure for him and he will remember that you didn't do it, you didn't recharge mom, you didn't recharge dad, you forgot us and that will make him fat, do n't say anything about your head. You poor thing will be broken into pieces, you do n't know what all is going on, you are remembering the bus, you are remembering your wife, you are remembering the children's requests, you have to remember the programs, you have some desires of your own, then the small ones of your parents.  And then you don't speak, friend, that's all I told you, oh that English proverb is sunny, straw witch is a camel with its back, when my straw was the camel's baked camel, am I the only one, friend?  Understand what I have been trying to understand. Whatever I have been trying to understand for the elderly, you try to understand. You have to learn a lot of things in your 67 years so that you can do it for 10-20 years. Recharges have to be done every day and then throughout the year.  This one of mine will not do it in a year, it is not right, I will not give the money in one go, I will not give that much, this one of mine will change, there is plenty of time for you to reduce all this, go to the hospital and check your whole body.  It's fine, it's fine, it's time there too Sitting in the waiting room is considered a pass. It serves the purpose of such a sensor. People standing in line for medicines have made their own routine in old age and in this routine they think that the next generation will support them all the time. Oh brother, the wives are living the life, niece. You are yours, drink whatever coffee you want there, think of hospital as PVR cinema and keep your check silent, if you have so much compassion in it then this disease will be mine only, everyone will suffer, your next generation will be worse than you.  Diseases are real and you probably should give them as much as you can, so how are you doing now, they are diseases right now, they will take time to get cured, how can I give you all the sympathy, this is what is happening to me, I will have to be a little strong, mentally strong.  I am not used to being alone because I need someone's support 24 hours a day and then they say, I don't want to talk, I don't want to talk, if you are interested then I will definitely come. There is no point in your words, why don't the elders think like this? Hey, you also have it.  when baby  When he was young, he used to do M, so he was happy on the bed, baby and he used to go on time, then he used to be late, otherwise it was time, otherwise the city pressure cooker is running in the kitchen, the broom is being asked in the house, the husband who is the father.  If he was on a job, did you give full time to the children? You came unconditionally, he also used to do that. You want to hold the children in your hands, iPhone or any mobile or keyboard, you cannot tell that the time has not been spent with you. Can do four-five things first  Why don't you have time, you can't do that, if you do that, brother, you start getting judged as soon as you sit, why don't you do it like this, why don't you do it like that, why do you wake up late, why do you wake up early, why do you wake up early, on holidays.  Do it, you also do it by paying obeisance and see son, it will definitely get spoiled. Why do you spend 24 hours on knowledge? If this is the only knowledge I have in consultation with very elderly people, if you have this much knowledge then you can park your knowledge.  If you are restless then do consultation and see if anyone is ready to pay money for your knowledge. If so, then your knowledge is strong. When you give the knowledge dog to the world, the world will know your knowledge, will perform your aarti and will give you consultation, then your children will also come in line.  If the child is going to do anything, we tell him that he is going to buy a flat, this money will be wasted, he is starting a business, he will also be wasted here, he is going for a trip, he is buying a car, why are he buying it so expensive, why are he putting it there in the school, why here.  I didn't wear that many clothes  Why do you buy, why do you go here, if you check so much, then you will run away, please do not give this pain to the parents, do it for the next generation's time, your time is free, your time is absolutely free, it is not cut, it is not cut, it is like din ye raat song, Sridevi.  Song Mr. India's Katte Nahi Katti Din Aur Raat Now That I Love You Is Too Old To Eat He Can't Be Less Than You Are Right You Say Many People Don't Go Bada Maa Because Not In India What Is It For The Elderly  why not something  Said brother, watch the video without any stress, I am going to give a lot of time pass to the elders, I will do wow mins in the future, I will do good ones for the elders also and do n't put me in their category, hair is running, shirt is running, age is very young, okay Dear brother, brother, you also have a lot of energy in me, how come you have so much energy, my energy is because I am very young, okay energy is not a Buddha man, so do not identify with me, you make me sit and then call me body.  There is pain in my body, it is okay, there is pain in our bones, it is okay, the pain will be bandaged in the body, it is okay, so if your parents are in their sixties, they should take care of them comfortably and peacefully. Okay, but I believe.  60 There is no need to serve the parents of these 70s right now, one thing is definite, in the coming time, those 80s will also become 90s and till 8085, you will have to keep yourself mentally occupied. They have creative productive thinking and do not waste the time of others. Break your notes which are FDM, spend them and whatever is yours, we will leave it for you and go away. Yes, it finally breaks, similarly, there is a message for the elderly, be it money, wealth or property, it is Chhath Jati, it is okay, it is Chhath Jati, but you cannot go to the provision of after life. In after life, all the property here is in a draft or story in Bitcoin.  You can convert it and take it to the next life. He takes it and takes it away and then he is leaving behind saying, ' Son, see, it will be converted into 100 Bitcoins, I am leaving 20 and I am leaving with 80 for you, you also tell me.  Man, great because you have taken 100 Chhath, Chhath goes, Chhath goes, it is not necessary for anyone to become more of a hero. Hey, we have done so much, so you did it for someone, someone did it for someone.  Don't do anything, very first story, my ideal is very big and you will have children, you will become one day, the whole world speaks like this, you will know for whom, I am going to tell everyone, no person uses property and money for his children.  He works for himself, less for his social standing and so he used to work less so that the children don't say, 'Oh Buddha, why don't you do it? You have completed 60-70 years of life, you have done it just to show that this is my kingdom.  Here I am Raja Chholavan, okay, so you do all this for him, okay and the youngster should know this and he also has to do it and gradually you who are listening to me for 20-25-30 years, 35 years, this  You will also do the program at the age of 60-65. Today, your parents are making you big by doing this and showing you that there is nothing, every man is property because if property has to be given, then we will give it, then while we are still alive, both of us will tell later and then we will say friend, would n't we have lived?  Don't give because they live in big WhatsApp, don't give otherwise he won't ask anyway, now without asking anyway, there is no time, every time is the same do you have, you have told me the day before yesterday, he is not asking you because he is asking you.  He doesn't even like, does n't respect or like. Hey brother, he is not even taking care of his health. He is your son, daughter, he is under stress, he is being abused at the job, he is having a lot of issues, he is 8.  He is spending hours in the gym and is not giving you time, and by building such a body, he is not even becoming a model, then you can complain to him, do you spend so much time, you laugh, give us some too, you can journal his time, then look at his profile.  So see what she does, what she does, what is her schedule from Monday to Friday, what is her schedule from Saturday to Sunday, how is her life going on, she has to sleep for 168 days a week, if you spend eight hours a day with six people, then it is 60.  sleeping hours  Out of the 100 hours that are awake, one has to take bath, eat, wash, drink, do all the jobs, jobs, children. Now look at how many hours are actually there and tell them how many changes should be made in the schedule, but in doing that, the parents feel that they are taking care of their child.  We are begging from such a corner, we are not such helpless parents, it doesn't come like this, if I do n't come, if the mirror asks, then don't ask, oh brother, what are you YouTube facilitating? Me, you of some help, you are right, parents create situations in such a way where children stay with them, less work is done, a lot of things happen in communities and families, there is a lot of peace there, this is a big cry within the middle class, where  But your employed child is also doing a job, everyone earns their living there and in the community where there is such a system within it that people go and come back with less pay, it is better there because it looks the same, it is a relief.  There is drama all day long, son and daughter, and because of this, the situation has been created in such a way that it will appear that you are doing business, you are going, and you will have to talk about other vices for business. How much nonsense will you talk about, son and daughter? How are you about food?  Lia son, how are you and which class is Chhotu in and what is happening with Rohit, what happened with Neha, what happened with this, there will be a report, everyone is ok, everyone is ok, you are fine, we are fine, what should we talk about, what should we talk about? Yamuna Nagar plot, Kheda plot or send it in my name, you won't be able to talk like this, don't talk about our property, you can't talk about money, you don't put like this in the stock market, you ca n't discuss the stock, thank you.
