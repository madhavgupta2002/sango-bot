Hello friends, do you want to increase your productivity? I am telling you about this for the people who are in 20. There is a YouTube channel named Ankur Badi which is very popular. I recently saw a productivity video released by him. I have my opinion on it because 27. He has lakhs of subscribers, I am feeling that according to me, he has given a very wrong message, so I am telling him by keeping an eye on him, I am not criticizing him, okay, many people are there, no, you tell yours, it does not happen like this, there is a discussion,  The topic is that if a big influencer says something on a big level, I am going to tell you at what level it is wrong and why it is wrong, listen, whenever there is a big influencer, it is requested that how is his life going and at what point is he saying  But what are you doing, tell that name because the audience that is listening is not even close to that, for your productivity you told 10-12 points out of which you want the public to download 56, basically that sir game is of that person only  if yes then that would be one  No, my ads don't come, I do it like this, this is wrong in that it means that you should not put up after up to monitor productivity, the problem is that the youth actually does not have any major work. So he does not need to be productive and do all this, he needs to idiot, secondly he needs to sleep, thirdly he needs to see that he has to go and if he needs to go somewhere, then  Everything can be dropped and he should catch it, then its scheduled video people went to get water because you are young at the age of 24 you do not have to go into any discipline in terms of this scheduling, these officers, businessmen, entrepreneurs who have reached that level whose  All that work and time should be donated to those who are rich, may God bless you to reach the point in your life where all these productivity hacks are a must, you must try this, it is a bit of second and third order thinking  try to understand what i am saying sometimes this is happening here  I'm saying that when you're 23 24 then be alive you have the possibilities just be show date I have to go do something 14 15 16 hours to reach the story tux figure out something which is earning earning ability establish cash flow that if your scheduling  I became dependent on him because papa had told me to go here to pay the bill, mummy had told me to take father along, he had said this and I made a good schedule that you are not going to the story, in the middle of all this if you get a chance to meet the matter  If any lecture goes by, or any webinar goes by, or someone is giving you knowledge, or any situation goes by, or if you get an opportunity, then everything should be dropped, you should not be speaking and restricting yourself because whatever it is, whatever knowledge you have, you have this  Look sir it is cut copy paste of the world, bluntly big youtubers will say that you are doing this, you are doing this, mostly you should check those which are in English  There are books which our Indians do not have time to read, by doing it in Hindi, by joining one time, that history is being told through the story, the original thought process which is applicable to India, applicable to Indians, applicable to Indians, our ecosystem and situation  It is not being told in a categorical manner and the youth who actually does not have any guidance, today a boy of 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26 years of age likes it but brother, will it increase productivity, what will it increase by doing this?  This is happening, my studies are done, I don't need to study again, now I have put these small things in it, okay, put this on the computer, put these correct views, do something, do this, oh brother, that gives more stress in life Look, the thing that I remember is important, the one that I have forgotten but it is very important, someone else will remind me, the thing that neither I remember in life nor does anyone else remind me of, is so important  It is not even important because it will go bad, if it is something important, you can do it like this everywhere, people keep a to do list, it never ends in life and the story does not reach, after writing 20 and then 18 cats  Then it made it 25, then it gives the satisfaction in the short term that you are doing something, but even without doing these 18 things, maybe one thing, maybe that one number, maybe that one person with whom you can talk, you can create a network, some opportunity comes  You have a story, child power, this is D message, don't stress yourself, you match, this because I am a youngster, many times when there is a consultation, sometimes a conversation, when I go to meet relatives, then you speak directly because what do you say, show me the phone, show me the big ones  These are good phones, do it like this, 140 up, this up is for controlling this up, this is for doing that, this is for this one, this is for this one and this one color, this is for doing all this, a small diary.  You can also note that your  Was the money asked about the accounts of these people, they have nothing in 20 years, they have only 2.5 lakh in demat, two-four CPs, they have a little money, it is nothing, your syllabus is all about productivity and all this  It is definitely needed when you go to your Fortis and you have reached a certain point there, otherwise it is not needed there either, then this productivity is very much overrated and don't get bogged down in it, you just look at it like where are you  R reaching and see in every math, there should be a direction from you that I have to reach here, am I reaching here, don't micro manage it so much and don't micro manage your life because if you have made some schedule and you fall asleep in the afternoon then  Maybe it is butter, what do they do in motivation that I am in India day after tomorrow, I am feeling tired but I have to win a medal, then how are you living in middle, as many medals as you want, then are you in date, are you like date, why do you take any example of someone's life  Do n't take the example of politician or film star or India the day after tomorrow Neither the YouTuber nor your life is completely different from that story of someone 's life, it cannot motivate anyone, this is the truth, whenever you take an example, I do it like this, I do it like this, hey, I also do a lot of things like this, but my life is like this  -by doing this my life situation is so different that there is no point in giving you knowledge and it takes time to make effort to get rich from date stage and everybody has to go through date stage so 20% of this is brain storming at that time but interesting with mentors  Interactive intelligent people having intelligent friends not wasting time and having an attainable goal attainable gold this is very very important otherwise it itself will not reach you people like this cooker buland this story will not reach you people so next time whenever you make an schedule make it very loose key  Yes, roughly I do this mostly in the afternoon or in the morning when I feel like doing this I do this. It is very loose. Don't live life like a robot that I wake up like this in the morning and then I do it like this.  This is how I do it, take it, it will be done friend, what a life it is, I mean everything is under remote control, I am underweight, I have to work hard, take care of my health and keep doing something, don't micromax it too much, this is my personal research, IT  Work and those who nurture this knowledge also tell them only that CCTV cameras will not be installed near them, in fact they have to be kept in such a Sufi way, now what is the problem that if someone has reached then the person says that now friend he has reached here  If you go then you must be thinking about his life, it is not like that, many people's lives have been very right filed, but only this is visible and whatever is told in between is visible, I hope you people got a different perspective and in this way, I think you are a  This is a trap of this video and you will not put any knowledge in it and I am again, this is not to condemn the making of this, but a lot of superficial content is being made, the story is not being recognized, the story is not being recognized, practical and note things which  Practical and durable and understandable thank you
