Hello friends, today's topic will be that investment in gold can be done through these methods, we will discuss this a little, I will also tell you my favorite method, you can put a repeat in the comment section, so we should use gold in our portfolio.  According to this, 510% should be bold. There are ways to buy it. One is to go to the shop and buy physical gold. It has its limitations - storage, security, and purity. These are the three things. On top of this, there are making charges, plus it tastes tasty and requires a lot of investment.  If you are looking at it then it is not necessarily a good thing plus he gives something to his wife in his own way, you give something in his neck, give something in his ears, after a limit it is okay, on the back of no tuition he goes to the locker and from locker to locker  It keeps getting transferred and even give anything much and as they say it is free, earlier it was considered as Stridhan (stridhan) also for safety ladies did not have anything of their own, earlier Vaishno bank accounting and no demand nothing to sort see  There is some physical gold in our families which is 10000 times more. I will not deny it. But if you also want to buy gold coins, then you will see that the current rate of gold is 5104. Then you will get 6112. Check today's rate. Do it by Google, okay, so in that if I have already given 20%, then keep the return, then it is with the idol, okay, so according to that, it is not a good investment, for peace, letters should be given and taken a little, okay, this trailer of G  People also believe that it is good according to the calculation, they believe that the thing is right and it should be so, but this does not mean that if I want to fold my 3% portfolio in physical gold, then you do not have to keep it in the way I have invested.  There were problems, I have listed them to you. The second method is ETF, exchange traded fund, demat of exchange traded fund. If you go there, there are big fund houses, you will get their gold of different houses. You can get HDFC's gold if you google it. There are five of their gold houses.  let's give it okay and you can take it it is patient backdrop  Of physical activity is very much in it, if you buy it anytime on daily basis, then this management this story incurs a little loss because it is done in its name, gold investment has to be shown by keeping physical gold, then take your money, appoint subscribe button more returns So this festival z30 go to your house, see how dangerous it is, if you buy pills worth 1 lakh then go again next year for â‚¹2000, whatever its value will increase or decrease every year, 2% of it will keep going, which is the third and last  Which is my favorite, Sober and Gold Bond, this is the shoot of Government of India, whenever the video is being shot, it is open till 24th August, you can buy it, I will make a separate video on the side for the method of buying it, if you guys  If you are interested then what is this sobering gold bond Sharda Bhawan suit karda government what is the biggest benefit in this that unlike physical gold and tiffin every Muslim this blinker income tax and service loop okay you will have to pay income tax but in this you will get income  Tax  It is best that you do not have to pay any amount, so if I buy sovereign gold bonds of Rs. 1 crore, it is fine and it becomes gold, sometimes I had to give Rs. 2 crore as an example, so it makes you a professional, it is a big deal and secondly, it is a big deal  By adding you can find the path of looking for a gas but ATS can test it, the government also gives you interest in it, situated at high, now if you want to understand this with equity, I will tell you two best pimples, okay, so this battery will go long  Anytime in the term, look at the returns of good in eight years, write a story, fuel in ATS, look at the TRP blast funds, it gives a new sentence, do not compare tweets, you get ten percent return in equity, do it at the same time, okay, so one on that  10 per cent becomes taxable, so you will get 9 percent of the activity and if you want 9 percent return in this and from gold bond, then 2.5 percent, so government interest is 1.5 percent, so if I deduct that 9 percent, then 6.5 percent will be saved.  If gold gives me a return of six and a half percent, then I reach nine percent, then if it gives you a return of ten percent, then sixty five percent returns from the board's returns Aftab Activity Liter Your Touching Mackay Equity Returns I don't like all this but  I'll tell you how much percent of subscription should be there in Sara that any physical situation comes, anything should be there on the screen, like anything should be there in your portfolio, subscribe to subscribe our, but I can tell you guys that if you buy it electronically, then the outline and discount  You can get it at the rate of Rs. 70 which has been issued by the Gram Government.

You will keep getting interest, so it's something which investors need to look at, not that it means that physical gold has a limit, I think you should learn to keep it at home and also in the locker Not only this, there is a limit on the number of things to be kept and from making charges, breaking charges and GST on them and GST on that, by getting the tax done, it is written in a lot to me, if it is too childish then the end user can be used as collateral also in  Times of need is okay, because of this there is something which Ajay due to the investors but it's something that those people who are knowing this are not nibbling the back a little bit in their mind, so I request you people to see how this thing is, the Government of India is the best  And it is a good instrument and investments in other acid classes, if you are liking this type of video, please request to like it and write something good in the comment section, okay, different gas stomach small investment spaces, those who  You know that there is no revision, I had heard this lightly, I listened to it carefully that it must be completely new for the people, so for those for whom it was new write that and for those who knew it but it was not new write that, yes we also came to know that  type like with voice  It is to take, many times I think that if someone has a daughter or someone has a son etc. then we can open it or want to take it, then the second group is to collect gold because if you want to open 20 poles on the marriage of your friends  You will buy it on the same day and keep it at the gold rate or at any price because your daughter will like the design after so many years, both of these start on this the lady said goodbye to you, it is your daughter's birthday or it is your daughter's one day  So you put something around it and what happens many times is that grandfather gave the money, mother gave the money, grandmother gave the money, maternal grandparents gave the money, somehow some money came in the name of the child or you put something from your side, masculine friend  And for 5 grams how much gold can you buy with it, listen, from one gram you can buy up to 4G, so desi means there is no need to pay this much, in the family, okay family means in this way the charges are very high but Dussehra  20 grams third whenever it comes you can easily buy me one gram so nothing is ok so that means  As you buy it, he will really become a don and that 8 year, 9 year, 16 year old, so if the eight year old child turns 24, then you have to buy 200 grams of gold in his name, you are doing it in his name So directions where you can mentally dietitian goal returns confusing returns having different that stock market quality suits John, he catches it he says there are returns from opening otherwise in last 20 from 2000 you can see my subscriber telegram group or  Which can be done in my description or in the comment section, so it does n't matter much to me if you are growing taller, then in this golden 102 years, if you went to 1948 in 2019, then the habit of voting is that of going to one of them again  If you do it solid for two-three years then right now it is running between 28 and 5000 rupees fine and in 338 it was just done in one year above 35000 when you do it  So it used to be 35 per cent, then if you measure it like this and in a pro time, then you will get FD returns of hundred percent because the government is paying the dry person, there is no tax on it today if you have a period of five or six percent.  So tax is levied on that as well, you know that days are cut and then the person becomes unemployed, this is gold investment and please share the video with your friends, those who want to share it with women, share it with teachers, I do a lot of consultation in gold and my friend is well into the actual gold digger, true or not, create space for teachers, I mean it's not that I am feeling like this, so I request you guys to also demand from the teachers to open their hands of their digital gold Play this beneficial physical gold, according to me it is not right to keep it more than a limit, thank you are a
