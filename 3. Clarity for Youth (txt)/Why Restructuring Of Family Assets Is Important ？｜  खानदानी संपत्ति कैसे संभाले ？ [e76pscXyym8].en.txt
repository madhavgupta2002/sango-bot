Hello friends this is a video for war but it is a very important topic to discuss this with their parents restarting of family assets is very very important war is not talking because one is ok second is d previous generation is feeling d youth i bill tel  You are I am taking the premise of a middle class family, okay I am not addressing the very lower class on the upper class because there are no assets there, but even in the middle class despite low cash flow, a salary of 50, 60, 70 thousand is fine and 1.5 lakh  But d parent me b setting, I need a driver, you want to watch movies, you need clothes, you want to eat food, you want to travel, you want to travel abroad, you want to visit stories in India, you want to do charity, we also want to give a wedding, wear good clothes, you want to eat and drink, some health  One has to take care of oneself, one has to drink juice, one has to do massage, like ladies who are in the front, they need a masseur, does anyone have arthritis, some of them, everyone needs money, okay cash flow, you have a plot of three acres or  kothi or story, some house or story, something that is there, you do n't have the power to do all this if it is not throwing cash then give what is happening and because I get a lot of issues for consultation, I have resolved them a lot, now today I am telling you a  I am giving you a template, suppose your parents have both something and dear sitting on it and no they are old, okay and they don't have many means of earning money, I am also earning money from there, we have done some HD work now what is that who can get a tax on this flat which has gone into khasra condition, now its juice has been extracted, it was once worth 2 lakhs, now it is worth 2.5 crores, but Kara Bhai Sahab is giving only 18-20 thousand because the localite is giving it for more than 20,000.  I am not giving much because off locality is not even getting 2% from the same place two days ago or day before yesterday, so the date for acquiring new assets in between for such assets is called restarching of assets, now two to three things are required in doing this  There is a problem, one problem is that as soon as we suggest the younger generation, the elderly junction says that you should talk to us till now, after us the father of 68 years saying date will happen after us after 32 years because the father can live till 90 more  D mother is five years younger than him and he lives for four years and D father is male who lives for 94 years and if this is 64 years or 63 years and if this is 9480 and 30 years then nothing will happen to him for 30 years and one more thing has come  When parents sit idle, children get busy in their lives, they know that there is nothing to do with all this, then parents are not able to handle it because those assets are falling, in a way they are ending, then children also get affected during this period  In my life, I took a loan, I took my life, someone went to Canada, someone went to Mumbai, someone else went, it becomes like this, the better thing is to sit and sell those things and do something else.  And it should be bought in a new place and invested, even if it is capital appreciation because nobody is able to think of converting a crore into ₹ 2 crore, specially the older generation because they feel that where will we be, for me it is ₹ 20,000  What happens when you transit, whenever you do this thing and put it in construction or story for the people, then their monthly income gets band and that one-  It may be two years, the band will remain, you have to understand that the income of the capital that you have generated or the money that you have, you will get it from the boss, there will be capital appreciation and here the children can get their own loan or they can also give some money to him.  Buttering up the assets, I will give you an example, a job or a house worth Rs. 1 lakh, what about buying a good plot, decorating it and making a strong story, your own vidya, father's money which is for sale, your own loan, son and one-half of those taxes Two of you on one side two on the cara  Keep two chaddhas for yourself and the one that is part of your loan, that thing of your father's, got transferred to two floors, he got it and it became a solid asset, its inheritance will have value in future too, but what is this in that  A job of Rs 50,000 is not a small one because I don't know where I will reach, where will you reach, brother, by selling one floor there is a profit of Rs 30-30 lakh and it is ready for sale in 10 months, work day and night and if you stand on your own  Being a contractor, construction contractor, you are a plumber, you should not do this work, you should not do all this, you will not give Rs. 27-2800 per square feet, what are the margins of all these things, how to do it, on what basis to do it, I understand in detail because this then  What happens is that it is proprietary knowledge which is the result of hard work, it is not given for free, but I tell the minors that I will avoid individual consultation because what is it right to tell each person, so I will tell this thing to the minors.  I would like to do dedicated education on the comment area you will find a real estate info group on WhatsApp you can join it, whenever it happens it happens every week and you will get to know according to this topic you can do and  Then you can make your own template that even if you have a great area in Delhi, say Uttam Nagar, then also it is necessary to restructure from there, what is the problem with the parents, why don't they let us do it, why do they keep sitting idle, I have seen that they are 92 years old parents.  Then his child turned 668, then he got the asset, the one of 66, then he sat on the asset, till 90 that story did not get destructed and that was the status of a family, it gradually started increasing at a low rate because somehow just  Design decision paralysis is happening in the family, this is something which should not be foolproof, you should further divide this thing into two-three smaller properties, it is okay in small properties from where the rental can be done, something like this  Such as these  Be it construction, my construction, year or life, the value of inheritance is good, I have seen many parents, elderly parents also, HD of 20 lakhs gives you 56% return, you get ₹120000 for a year, you get ₹10000 per month but if you take ₹10000 for the whole month  If you take it, then next year there will be 20 lakhs of FDBC and not 21 and after 20 years, 20 people will do story eating in this 20 lakhs HD, this value will be there and you yourself will go to de- realise in four-five years when There is inflation which is there and it will increase, the interest that you are getting will also keep decreasing, so it will be better if you say that friend can we buy a house in 20 lakhs, yes, how can we buy our own private real estate investment trust I will tell you guys in the next topic, it will be a very interesting topic but here I just want to give a hint that you can invest your 20 lakh rupees in someone  He can give you 25% share in a property worth Rs. 70-80 lakhs. Now who will buy that property worth Rs. 70-80 lakhs? Your next generation will make its own payment. Some of it is your loan, some of it is yours, Rs. 20 lakh is your straight forward 25% share. You also invested 20 lakhs in your mother's name, it is a thing worth 80 lakhs and yours is 25%. Now the return that you will get on this 25% is rental, after taxes in many places it is up to five which is less than your HDD right now but the capital appreciation is  This is happening which is creating your security but if you look at its 25-year cycle, then the rent will double every 8 years, so the rent you are getting is 3.5-4%, debt bill becomes 8% in ATS IT bill becomes 16%  in these 16 years and give 32% in 24 years whereas if you play this program in your HD then it cannot happen, it is up to 6 ₹ 500 all four will be zero and  That money is not flowing because you have taken it, here you are getting rent, what is happening in real estate, look you have a real estate, its capital value has to increase and it pays rent separately whereas HD you  If you do this, its capital value will increase, if it increases then you will not get anything in interest and you will take the interest, so its value will not increase and you know the cap for increasing the value, right now it is 6% and 5%, it will decrease further So fully, when the government over the world is printing notes, are you wanting to be in these notes and how will you do the financial assets, the property is also in his name, he is the 75% shareholder and you have your share too, if he  We did not pay rent, now look at your children, if you cannot trust them then this is even better, if your children betray you, you will get salvation in this very life for sure, you will get it, that means if you are thinking that the bank will not sink, the economy will not  Nothing will happen, I will keep getting 6%, there will be no 2% inflation, money will not be wasted  But if I buy a property with my own blood and get it registered in my name, even if I pay 25% of the amount, it will still be a fraud. That property is in your name, he cannot sell it to anyone else. Similarly, your photo may also be put up in the tehsil.  for selling and he has also taken a loan, be careful, he will give you the property according to your share, now in those families where there are so many trust issues in this and even that is not there, then that is a different story, but in 90% of the families there are no issues Everybody trust the next generation next generation is also very good okay you all do it together like this I will keep telling you guys how to do it further okay so my request is that you guys please my request is that you guys should do that which  There is an info group, come to it and there I understand these things with actual examples and actual numbers, so it takes a little effort to understand and some drawing has to be done, here understand under the example bill note be date because in that  what questions  If you are asked about this then there will be doubt about the story, you will give the story also because what is the biggest thing in understanding something, what is the problem on youtube that if anyone understands anything then the premise of this can be dated  And most of the time this color is never calculated by friends but it is wrong to believe that because when they take the mark, they take only this much mark in it, then after that the calculation will be correct or you will use roller 72 or  You can put your P*R*T/100 or Oneplus R to D power and compound interest or any other formula, it will work fine, show it in excel but the question is the premise, as the premise says, you will also get the returns of the mutual fund  If you have given 15% in the market in so many years, then it will not give 15% in the next 15 years also, brother, this is the base effect, as your growth will keep increasing, then it will not give date, this is an immediate shot, do not think that you will get more, okay, so you will learn this  we are real  State no one is teaching no one Shikha Rahasya note n single I am also on youtube that's why I call myself real estate clarity life number one note because brother in law is no number you ji din number you are understood to be a writer learning to enhance by the way video  They make rent versus buy while moving, rent versus buy, they become very common, it is fine for you but you do not have to learn in 360 degree perspective, real estate is extremely important but you are very important, now there is the next generation, I will also make a video in future that this generation will never buy real estate  Now tell me, this is what has been happening, we have bought it, we cannot buy it, I will give you examples and I will also tell you by doing maths in it, we cannot buy it at all and those who cannot buy, house is big for them, you friend always talk about house, okay my five-  There are six things because Sir, you get peace in your home and there are members like family in your life, you have to meet them, Sir, it has to meet sorrow also, okay but it has to meet happiness also and this is a possible thing, it is your thing dates are written before its name.  The word is written real, okay, real thoughts rights, real state, okay, so learning and understanding this is very compulsory, and it is not being taught like this anywhere else, okay, thank you.
