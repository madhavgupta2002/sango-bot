Hello friends this new year I am revealing the biggest secret for those who are employed, the secret of not feeling unhappy in the job, no motivational guru is going to tell it openly because I am not a motivational guru, I am not a clarity giver, neither the senior people of the job nor the HR are going to tell it  No one is telling, no one is telling, society is telling, many people are unhappy in their jobs, why are they unhappy, that is a basic reason and those people are more unhappy and if you identify with this situation, is that the thing which is causing unhappiness and by doing that this New Year, this 2024  Stop doing this, try it for three, four, six months and tell me if you found joy in your life or not. Okay, this time I will make a separate video on this as well. Now I have changed it. In 2024, those who found joy in it after listening to it, write fire.  A A G means if you are happy then Aag is fine so write this also in the comment section do not be emotionally evolved in your job those who have become very emotionally evolved are suffering the most if they have a corporate job  Bhave Even Government  Even if it is a job, do not get too emotionally evolved, this is the message, you have to do the job by detaching yourself from it, if you do this then you will get abused at the job, you will get scolded, the target is not achieved, you will not be a bad person, something is happening that you do this  Just like there is work of girlfriend-boyfriend or marriage or any close relationship, people are doing their job like that. I had done so well that day, my presentation was good, I have been working hard for so many days, my boss does not understand me.  The organization does not understand, brother, do not put these emotions, they have not opened your SBI bank account, savings bank, yes that entry was made in the passbook, on 29 so many, on 291, the credit, so many good things, if there is a little problem now, then after debiting, the bank balance is still positive  If no one is keeping such account then you are not the same, if your boss is unreasonable then it is okay, you are emotionally sad, we get sad when we do too much of our work, what happens is that we put our emotions in and become emotional  is this good  All the people who are part of the system, the system which is called Illuminati, they will make you, they will connect you emotionally, this is their job, without that connect emotionally, your juice cannot be extracted just by paying salary, they also know this, the employees will play some game or the other Employee of the month, employee of the quarter, best employee, the award goes to them. If you are that kind of employee, employee of the month etc. then you should think that your life is going haywire, there are many bachelors who are not able to make a relationship with any boy or girl outside.  As for him, he is expressing his emotions here, I have also seen many memes that my job is everything, no no no, job cannot be everything, even then the one with mid-range will not let him fire, his parents will not let him fire or the child will let him fire  But these bachelors are being exploited more, so this 2024, create a boundary for yourself, you have to create a mental boundary, in this, no boss of yours can check, the basic job of the boss is to take care of the people above.  To flatter, to whip you, to get good results and to move up on that ladder, whatever ladder is called, CD ladder, corporate ladder, it is a different matter that it has nothing to do with whom that ladder is standing, he is not able to escape at all, that too a lot  People are climbing up the ladder, it is not known that the ladder is standing in such a way that nothing is going to be found even after reaching the top, the ladder is just a means to reach somewhere, one cannot reach here, everything is here  It is like going up the stairs, climbing the stairs, I don't know this will become a deep topic in itself, those who have enjoyed it, okay then write this in 2024, my new thing is that joy has come, there should be joy in life, joy, fun and joy in a day  I will also make a difference, now I have moved towards joy, it is a new year, the channel is doing well, the feedback is good, so there should be progress, so now you have to take your life towards joy, you have to concentrate your emotions on joy  you can exploit it exactly you can see this in india asint text  Now, I do not do that in that paragraph, it is told to do the job with detachment, in fact there is a term of Government of India, google it, now Karma Yogi, it is very deep in itself, you have to become a Karma Yogi, by making a lot of emotional attachment in your job, you have to Expectations come to you and a forced sense of ownership comes while you are not the owner, the owner is someone else, the owner does not have that much ownership, he wants to sell his stake at Rs. 12, 15, 20 and get out, the gardener is not that evolved like a servant  The emotional attachment has evolved, our company is my company, hey bhaiya if you do not take it from HIB then it is not your company, if you are not a shareholder then it is not your company, you are a servant, by being a servant you think that you are good by calling it your company, it is not like that, you should force ownership  You should not take it when there is no ownership, you are not being asked all this, just work, do it detachedly, no one is saying that if you are getting ₹1 then do not do work worth ₹1 and absolutely  If you do work worth only ₹, they will throw you out and that is also a wrong thing, I am not teaching you to do wrong things but do not put emotions in ₹1, the work is worth only 60 but I have put emotions worth 00 and then there is my disruptor I was not respected, I was treated like this, I did not get recognition, I did not get it on the presentation, he got more, he did flattery, this is how it happens brother, the one who does flattery will get it, he is doing work as well as flattery, so he is above us  Yes, you are saying that I do n't know how to flatter, I don't know how to do it, if you don't know this then that is your problem, you should learn it, bosses also keep changing, so don't make unnecessary emotional attachment, do your job by detaching yourself and this is not forcing you in every situation  Do not take ownership of it. All the business gurus, all the motivational speakers, all the HR people, all these knowledge-teachers will come to the company and teach you the same thing. Have a sense of Ownership, one day I will expose this as well, I will make a video properly if you want and it should catch fire, meaning fire means you will feel joy, you will have a joyful moment inside it, friend, just like Narayan Murthy ji would have said Work for 70 hours, what is the difference between him and you brother, what is the basic difference between a person who is the owner of a startup and a person who is employed, I will tell you this, the day you will understand this, you will know and recognize this difference and internalize it, then  You will not find this emotional term in a job. Job is not a place where you go for some emotional satisfaction. Like, subscribe and share. If you want to become a member of the channel, then become a member. This is a very good workshop on decision making. Comment  You will find it in the section, if you want to take that, if you want to attend the workshop, if there is a recording of that, then you can see it because it is also linked to decision making in some way or the other. Once you come to take a decision of life, then there is a lot of trouble and pain in life. Even they get away a little  The fee for the pizza is ₹ so you can see for yourself, it is a workshop of two and a half hours, there are mental models and templates, so this New Year, start changing the thought process at that level, if you want rest in life, do your job by detaching yourself from all the emotions  Do not evolve all the tantra and mantra, they will try to forcefully attach you and give you forceful ownership and you do not have the ownership, it is like that famous mother-in-law and daughter-in-law situation, mother-in-law says if you want to work then son, it is your house, but if you want to change the painting then  It is my house; if I have to put up curtains, it is my house; if I have to put sofas, it is my house; if I have to call guests, it is my house; if I have to work, son, it is your house; it is your house. The ownership because I am a marital consultant, no example would ever go without my mother-in-law and daughter-in-law. Otherwise if you have understood then you mean the mother-in-law is the owner brother whose husband owns the house or the one who has it registered in his own name is the owner rest you are the owner it is okay for working the curtains are for changing and he is not  I hope you enjoyed it  It is a joy to hear this original topic original content original example I got excited to make this content okay please tell you guys thank you very much
