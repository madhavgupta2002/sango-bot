Hello friends, today we will discuss the concept of silent lay-off by companies. This discussion has started now because recently a report of a very big company of India has come that 42000 employees have been fired but there is no hue and cry if the announcement is made to 42000 employees.  If it was withdrawn then it would have been known only on the day it was withdrawn but now it is being known by reading the annual report in which it has to be mentioned how many employees there are and that was till 31st March and now in August there is talk of 42000 which is a huge amount so take it silently. What is happening in the layoff, sir, I am not telling you about this company. Generally, what happens in a silent layoff is that instead of firing the employee himself, such a situation is created that he leaves on his own and is unhappy.  Or he may not get promoted or you should come clean and tell him that you could have done it and if he misbehaves too much then you will be fired and then you will not get the credentials that the next company needs  Then if you go there and say that the problem creator is he, he did not resign from that company because after resigning you go to one company and join the next company then you can also tell the story and specially if the previous company did something too much against you  If you do not do it and put in your good word then you will get the job, you will have hope but if you have come after fighting then that will not happen, so this is happening, so what can you do now, you are a helpless man on his job, so you can do this if  If your situation is getting very tight, then go and have a clear talk with your boss. Tell him that you want to fire me. Don't make me suffer for a month and a half or two months, because many people are suffering for two or three months and many others are leaving.  People, he thought that he wants to fire you and is saying something to you and you are working hard and burning yourself out and messing yourself up, so ask this clear cut question that you are also firing him, what is the scene, tell me a silent take off.  quitting is better than quitting okay quit  Quitting is a different concept that is even a better concept another warning which I want to tell and what is happening you tell me people who are in this category wether they agree or not and there will be learning for other people also that at the age of more than 45 years No one is happy to keep 45 years, which means if you have worked for 20-15 years, then this age will come when your salary becomes so high that sometimes even after taking 5-10 increments for so many years, that even after taking them out,  You can hire two employees of 28-30 years of age in your place and they can work with more authority and your light is getting extinguished because at 45 you would be facing mid life crisis anyway, children 's requirement, parents' requirement, your own desires, so this is a new concept  So if you are in a corporate plan, your life as if at 45 your shop will be closed, shop in the sense your job shop, your work, you do something  If I do that, I would like that people who are between 40 to 45 years of age should start preparing. In fact, the moment you hit 37, 38 and you have 12, 13, 14 years of experience, then you should see how many more years you are going to last, because if you are a  Blue Blood Pedigree What do you say Blue Blood Pedigree in India, IIT IM, any big networking, good MBA, it is not from outside, and your network is not like that, it is not blue blood, like this is something made up of blue color, it is not like that of yours  Blue so brother then your program is going to be in 4546 thank you there can be many exceptional people in it depending on whether they are very talented or there is a requirement in the sector or the performance in the company is good or the management is good it can be 10 20  But out of this but at 80 you will fall in towards this I will soon be conducting a workshop to guide changing jobs upgrading realizing your value and  I will tell all these things to you people, if you want to attend that workshop, it will be a corporate workshop, then give it to CW on the given number, also Independence Day offer is going on, you will get it in the comment section of my courses, enjoy the discount and  Please buy John sa, it seems more suitable for you, there are many choices, you can also become a consultant after listening to some things and the rates were very low anyway and beyond that a discount was also given, so now there is no reason not to watch it, so tell in the comment section  You will get it, please see, thank you very much
