Hello friends again interesting topic is two disincentives for charity, you know people talk a lot about charity, it is a big thing in the society, these people also talk about charity, in foreign countries also charity is a fashion, and I get relief by doing that.  Audience, the practical thing that I tell you in your life, to give you happiness in life, to give you progress in life, you should see that instead of calling charity charity, what I am going to tell you, you should do it for a couple of months and see. And then tell me brother if you want to donate a lot of money then do it, I don't mind that, it's fine but they talk too much, instead of this you should reduce whatever system you have below ₹500 or ₹1000, wherever anyone asks you  He is asking for ₹50, asking for 100, asking for 150, asking for 200, 300, up to 500, whatever your system is, put a cut off according to your supporters, my audience, I want to believe that ₹500  If it is up to ₹1000 then if you are taking anything from someone, you are taking service, he is asking for something, you are taking something from him, then do a bargaining band there and think of it as a charity, go and find poor men and beggars.  And I do n't know, he is not even doing any work, I do n't know, he deserves it and not also, he is sitting like this and begging, so you don't deserve something at a list from whom you are taking services, whatever these are the services given below, which I am telling you  I am saying that at least this person is working, he is working in the sun, he is working hard, you should not feel any pain in leaving him a little and what is the matter with that, this chik chik chik calculation of yours, did n't I come one day  Don't deduct his salary for two days, went to Nick's shop, it was 75 rupees, gave 100, it was 50, gave 75, he is the child of the fourth question, our society is moving in this way, I took 10 things from him, it is worth 50, Rakshabandhan will come again  Diwali will come Don't bargain, friend, don't do it. You want to go for a special charity or you want to organize a langar or you want to do some food bhandara or you want to show off in doing that, I want you to get peace or you think that it is  The purpose is more and on net daily basis you will have 30 to 40 interactions in a month, there will be a vegetable ready vendor, you will bargain with him, brother get it right, I mean vegetable for 80, no no give me some coriander and mint, from all these you can extract juice like this  People are like this among the poor and then they collect so many stories and then after beating drums and playing the story, you will do some hypocrisy of charity, why is it necessary to do it, leave it, don't put this pressure on yourself only that I have to donate and do a good deed.  I want to help someone in my life, don't make rotis like this, he is taking ₹500, yes take it, ₹500, no no, take it only 450, if not, then don't do it like this, hit your cut off if it is more than a thousand Bye Joe  Mend my words, I am not saying this here, you keep wasting money, but no story, someone came to repair the fan, someone came to clean, someone came, some printer came, some electrician came, there was a sewerage problem, you had a plumber came, something came among us  These people meet many people to bargain, then we want to go for a different story for charity, we want to keep some larger message and want to take a photo of it and then want to show it to ourselves because when you have a little abundance  You will show this mindset to others because if you start living what I am saying and save a little bit of ₹10, ₹20, ₹30, then you will be able to adjust with inflation and everything for your entire life as long as you are alive.  Also 50 thousand ₹ 1 lakh work people kids and where will he go, it is not known and in his name you got the vibes of the people from inside which you kept the troubles in your life because it can happen in these interactions  Someone who will even misbehave with you, because about this time I had also made a video, the new pain of the middle class, the lower class will not be very submissive, they will also argue with you, they may even abuse you, it can go to some level  If it spoils your mood, you will feel like this from within, something is fine, bitterness will also come, frustration will come, feelings will change, time will be wasted, that is not worth it, so those who have the spirit of charity, give it, brother, those who do not even have the spirit of charity  And those who want to keep it tight around their gums, there is no video for those below them, please keep it with Marshall, okay, those who want to keep it with big mosquito repellent, you can keep it like that, they cannot share knowledge with them Gyan can be distributed and it can be explained to those who are open to this thing, yes friend you are saying it right, we do a lot of charity and we try to save a few bucks everywhere and especially people like you are doing it  No, it was time for him to know, when he went down he lost everything  Two, you should get all ready and go out, this one who is pure from inside is from the middle class, especially among the middle class ladies there are many who are housewives or take out the last bit like this, they think that this is our earnings, it is not your earnings madam  Everybody send your leaves because these workers are spoiling the account, many women of 60 to 70 years of age have pain in their knees, pain in their body, pain everywhere in their life, but they have to save a little, story and for whom should they save it  Those kids are not clapping, the husband doesn't know anything, he doesn't eat, money keeps flying around, yes you incur loss, I do n't know the accounts but this 25 paise and 15 paise, I request all the women to make my audience 50,000 their own, 500 Wherever it is less than 1000, do not create much trouble in your life because no one can cause you a loss of ₹500 because ₹500 is a total thing, something will happen for ₹50, that is what I am saying  Yes, and think that we are doing charity because we are not doing any more charity than this, this is also a truth, no I went to the cow shelter and gave Rs. 500 on his birthday, friend, this is not charity, it is a small thing  Whatever you are giving there, definitely give it, but you should merge that and this. In this message, I am not at all saying that you go and donate to the cowshed and see, you donate clothes, which you so called have kept in your mind. They are doing it, I am not telling them to stop and so on but in your daily routine when it comes to actually quitting like this then your hands should not shake like this that if something like this happens to me then please please do this spread the cheese and like thank you
