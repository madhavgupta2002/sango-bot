Hello friends, there was a lot of demand for this, I want to give a lot of clarity on this to the youth, I am Rich Dada Pur Dada with the very famous book written by Robert and many ISP videos have been made of him, a lot of knowledge has been given, link to real estate  It is linked to assets, it is linked to financial education, it is linked to financial freedom, there are many things and many people have read it and many people have read it, yes I have also read it, I have also read it, yes yes I want you to make it a fair part as well  There is a lot of this in India, in India, this note works and what is the difference, brother, what is the note and how is it, there is a little complex, now I am going to explain that in this video, you are going to enjoy the real estate thing a lot.  yes, I am going to understand it very well, till today no one has understood it, I mean no one might have even thought of this video, if you get to hear such original content, then do the clapping for the topic, please like this video today, I mean  I am taking Guru Dakshina in the beginning, brother please like it, everything is right, you all have liked the book  He also has assets, there is a rich grandfather, there is a full grandfather and liabilities and I will not discuss all that, you have already done that, I will do it in the basic essence that it is work, we own 15000 apartments in that and rich you are not  Pay tax around pay tax and here they are five to six lines of their consumption office content which is very repetitive and it has become very popular in India and now it is failing and people are reading their books and explaining it in this way it is top working in  India debt role was played, I have also in myself, I have earned a lot till 2015-16, last eight years with it, it is not working, I bill you, basically what it is, you bought a house, took a loan on the house, interest on this loan  It goes that the income has come from this house, daily interest, daily interest, whatever amount of interest I used to pay on the second house in area 24, whatever amount I used to pay, 2530 lakhs, 50 lakhs, even 1 crore, that too is from my income. Having mines used to give me income tax benefits, so people are smart and rich, which in India also, there were very few ATS banks, not many, now what has happened, you have become smart, Brijni, smartness has come to India, earlier it used to be done by the government  It has been banned, now it is such a thing that it has hit the business model of only 0.5%, not only point five but point one, the day before yesterday no one in India even came to know, brother, how many people buy two houses, how many buy 10 houses, 100 more than that You could have bought a house also, you would have fixed it for 2 lakhs, this is the biggest problem, not outside as you do, you should understand again that if I bought a house, then if I have income from 10 sources, then my income is fine, then if I am paying the price for it  If I pay 40% tax on that, I am alive, yes there is 40% tax as well, you guys don't think about it, it is just that, many who earn more money were paying up to 42%, last year they were paying up to 42, 43%, so that  from the lab  If you had their mines, then if ₹100 was going to the bus, then 43 rupees would go back to the person and he would have to pay only 57 rupees to the bus, rest if he had paid in cash, rent or event, you know everything about the system of India  So they were buying the property of the dhaba and this model used to work but now this model does not work and this is because of the taxation rules in it and which are different for us, this is a big message, a good learning, yes everything work, anything which is done through cash.  You are an asset which takes money from user liability debt is very good. Okay, if you turn your car into a taxi, then it becomes an asset and is useful to you. If I am driving a knitting machine myself, then I can stay in my house myself.  If you are living there then that is a liability, it is an asset when all those definitions, qualifications, all of that is very basic, but the thing that was bigger than that was because every time I have come to the point that now you must have seen that Indian YouTubers have started bringing them to the big level. ones  Ranveer Alava who does podcasts, he has come on the show, I had seen him on YouTube as well, he had come on two shows and he had the same specs and now he is Ranveer ji, he is like in Allahabad, he is always a fan, the other one means something to him as well  If you want to get it out in a proper way, then by becoming his fan nothing comes out of it, I forgot the 15000 apartment, it seems that in India also there are 15000 people, it is not possible because of debt tax, by taking it people will become rich, so buy 10000, there is no problem in that  but that model cannot be copied, so it was important for you to tell this thing here, but it can still be corrected, but the style cannot be followed by that model, I cannot do it single day after, but this is the work of Shakti Lal who  Most of my audience is a normal middle class person who has a job, does some small business, still he can earn maximum profit through this, I conduct many webinars on real estate, I participate in them  There is a real estate channel special real estate channel song and  real state if I never took its prince name on this channel so tell me real state is my youtube channel state you can search and subscribe it there you will get information there are some videos there are some things in that way I will teach you formulas that yes do how many How can this be done because every time in our country you say apply some formula, the government comes and changes it, then that caste, then you have to find something else, now how much loss was that government suffering and what else  After doing that, no one will ever discuss this on this platform because a rich man cannot cry, because he is a rich man who is buying a house, he can go and say that this is my business  It has been made a model, all the people will say that it was a good thing that they taught them a lesson, the public is the one who teaches a lesson, the public has become unconscious, the Overelastic ATS has now become its robot, because they are following it, what you want to do  But brother, this happened 8 years ago Thoughts are the same, what is your financial status, take away from this video and this learning, what is your financial status, today you are poor or a little less rich or you are limited to this level and here people's programs are getting spoiled, then Radha is disappointed  Don't do it because when you reach here you too will have to bear this pain, you also have to ask the question that brother, will we keep paying this tax, maximum 42%, yes we are enjoying, you enjoy, tomorrow your turn may also come, this is very sad  And he can even do a left right and go but I have a pending video that if I have to do Namaste friends only then why should I sit in Gurugram and say Namaste friends, why don't I go to Germany, but Guruji, why is he in Gurugram?  But why is it not there in Germany because there are different taxation issues and in Dubai there are no taxes at all and I am not going to talk about patriotism here, patriotism is there, it is a passion and I don't want that, I am talking about practical things as well  I will tell you the date dispite  Wattiver sadden okay it is good you stand in India okay there would not have been any patriotism angle in despitae okay he will become a moral science teacher he will have a very first order video I love my country I will not leave what happens I will say very much  It's a good thing, I am not condemning him, that is an important thing for me too, but the style, if you pay so match what you pay and you also enjoy it that I am getting something special, even then you should stand Bharat this am addressing you me  Yes, NRI audience this is addressing you, I am the NRI audience who has gone from here, why should you go back, raise your voice, why should you go back, I will also tell you that properly, if you want that video, then brothers and sisters, that video will also be available and one more thing  And I want to tell my audience whatever your financial status may be, the money hasn't come yet, it's not a bad thing to know that money will come but when it comes you wo n't know what to do, I want to tell you a small story on this.  By telling me this thing I finished the bill, what happens with the money, when it comes then how does the mind set change and how does one of the things happen which you know I am an astrologer also, okay so Vastu and all these things also  I do it, I will tell you, okay Vastu Astrology Vastu, so you tell me to identify, have you seen it, has it happened to you or have you seen it happening to someone else, then do write, otherwise it will happen to you when we live in small houses, that means we  We are relatively poor. Wealth and poverty are relative. It is not absolute. So it is never full. In front of Mukesh Ambani, we all are poor. No matter how poor one is, it is a matter of relative importance. So when we have small houses and they are tight, then you get an award in that.  Got some trophy, child got that medal, got some certificate, okay, if we get any such thing, we all get it, you must have got many people, we keep them decorated in such a way that there is no space, not even a wall to display them but  We keep them as our stories, if nothing else, we will keep them safely in a box of ours.  that by hugging her to the chest it is like periods happen and many such things were in my photograph, I was retiring from there or sorry, someone was getting posted, someone was getting farewell, all those memories were kept by you by doing this  And I also get those farewell gifts from there, people get small trophies like these, some mementos are also given by the elders, they are kept as keepsakes, okay and those memories are there for you in your life and you tell the story  The story goes that if you live in this house, you will understand that such people have never existed and they will never exist, my house becomes bigger, the horizon becomes bigger, the money becomes more, that the society throws away the head  Are a rich man, he doesn't get caught up in the memories that he got this, that, that, some certificate, that, some medal, if all these things are important for you in life, you get all these things from Jain story, then you are poor only because of your thinking, you should think first, you  You can become rich from here if you don't have to do a job and money is flowing in abundance so be careful about your degree brother Why okay I hope you are getting this point I am not spoiling it with people I am telling you very very clearly it is an in mind set every I come in clear brain which some system has put in place with its best practical Worli examples which are in India  We do not take examples from foreign countries. When I and those foreigners have to write books, they write from their own examples. We copy their knowledge. If it is important here, I hope you liked this thing and you know the difference.  It was told that brother we cannot do it because now the government has also added interest of 2 lakhs in area 24, there was a time when even 40 lakhs were earned, 40 lakhs were earned on a loan of 5 crores, so I have a loan of 5 crores  I am investing in eight properties and my income is Rs 10, so I could have deleted all of them from my income and created more assets and could have gone to this point. I have invested in 15,000 apartments only and have achieved this in the last 40 years of investing.  40 years of investment he got this rich 1500 apartment using debt but that has changed our love so now that has changed we cannot earn money many times you people feel that it seems that our system which is made  He just wants to keep us in the middle of it, that he picked us up from poverty and put us here, this will be normal class, this is your capping, just stay in it, it takes life to break this ceiling because above this, I mean, there is so much degree of difficulty.  The man goes and says, brother, is this all the work? If I earn ₹100, 18% of it goes into GST. I talk about digital income, whatever digital income comes, if a person earning digitally, like me or anyone else, you will be charged ₹100.  It does this through which digital money is transferred, service, consultation, any kind of this allam-m which is going on, listen carefully on ₹ 100, GST on ₹ 100 became 18%, so GST of ₹ 8283 became 100 GST and then on that  40-42% tax if his income is above a certain level, then brother, the person earning ₹100 is keeping only 40%, you should understand that if he is coming on 40 platforms, then that platform is on Razor or some other platform, hosting platform  The group that you want to keep or that side white, its cost will also be seven to eight rupees percent, so don't be surprised when you get in the digital, many times people multiply it, hey Guruji, you so many people ₹ 100  The ticket is ₹10,000, no sir, stay tuned to I-Bill, we will know about it in the next video, if you want, we would like to tell you how it is going, are you enjoying learning and you can give your feedback and subscribe to the channel yes we can do organic growth my marketing budget is you guys only okay you won't see me running any ad, this is how I went Google doesn't do ads okay my organic I believe in Ayushmann Khurrana model of movies okay congratulations for 18 crores Yes, 225 crores was nothing, it's okay, the rest of the movie has released, movies worth 300 crores come, 150 crores is taken by the star, his marketing is worth 50 crores, it's not that kind of thing, thinking this I want to tell you people, be very organic, don't be  Extremely happy with anything which is happening with me.
