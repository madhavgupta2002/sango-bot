Hello friends, this is a very important topic for the youth. If you understand it well, the topic is do you fail to keep a promise? People take a promise from you or you make a promise to the world and you are unable to keep it, due to which you feel very guilty and feel bitter.  People get upset with you, you don't feel good about yourself, this is happening with many people, if you identify with this situation, please ID me and say yes Guruji this is my problem or I am seeing such a problem  So once we will get a lot of clarity on this that the youngsters are very unhappy because of this, so the clarity of this is that you have to first of all do this introspection, why are you promising, see, you have to make a promise, the girlfriend gets the promise done, the parents get the promise done  Yes boss, you make me promise, what is it basically that you will do this work, you will come to that party, you will take me out, you want to take out some commitment from you, life has become so busy these days and you are not able to manage so much scheduling  Owning time is the biggest thing to promise If you promise anything in life then the biggest luxury for it is that you own your time If you are not owning your time because that is what is happening most of the people in their 20  And 30 they don't own their time, so if they give a commitment to someone, he will say no, this is not to be done, this has to be done, that is why there is frustration and then the anger is taken out on the boss that the person to whom I promised, the person to whom I promised, because of this  I was broken, what happens many times, I promised something to my wife, see, I am giving you knowledge by squeezing everything from a 360 degree perspective, I promised something to my wife, my mother asked for something, ok, I have a stomach ache, you go and see a movie  It is okay, I am telling you a simple thing, I am telling you about houses in a practical way and in this also I will tell you in the end that if you have to make a promise then whose promise should you never break, this also  If I will tell you, then first of all stop making these promises, first of all, make any promise, say I will see, it will be seen, no no, how do you commit like this, tell me on your time, this is what you have to say, say I am a servant, servant man means I do a job or  I am a student or whatever I am, you may say that I do n't have much control over my time, lot of people say on my time, in that situation if this will be the option for me, I will try my best to do it but I cannot promise the moment  You start talking like this to your father and mother and girlfriend and wife and spouse and boss and anybody, any boss will say that this is a good presentation, what is it like nowadays, don't give me any work at work, oh no friend, there is not much work  It is just that much, first of all, if you do just this much and give me work, then the first pressure is that even this much work was not done, before you, the people who give me work have to wonder why do you call someone and say this  This is absolutely correct, why don't you tell me that this is a brain-intensive job, you are the best among all  He is a worthy man, be ready mentally, physically, emotionally to be in it and this is very important and if you do this then you will get this reward, there is no wisdom in the givers and the takers because he said that this is all it is  Now for how long will you do this little work, I will do it tomorrow, I will do it the day after tomorrow or whatever you say, then it will not be done then it will become the scope of work because which work is given like this within the office space to the company and  At the organization level, the work is given very well, the scope of work is so much, the money it will cost, due diligence will be done on the project and that whole analysis, at the small level, the work is available at the employee level or in homes or among themselves, you assign tasks to each other  Who does so much due diligence that how much it will cost, someone will say friend do it like this, don't do it, drop Bua ji there and come back, now who knows there will be a jam there, who knows what other issues will there be on the way, how much time will it take  It will seem that how much time will be wasted for that, for everyone who  The man is giving work to someone, there is only this much work for him and what about you, father will give you this much work in a week, wife will give two in a week, mother will give one, she will have two-three works of her own and the boss will have separate works for everyone  This is so much correct, people have become so fed up by doing so much, then they are saying that there is no balance in life, you can put anything on your head, if you try to balance it like this  This is a thing, I should keep it on my head, now if I try to balance it then I get stressed, so I am balancing it, just now I was sitting quite comfortably, I do not have any stress, there is no stress, now as soon as someone touches me Who will say Nalas, yes life has become like that of the British, by taking all this knowledge brother, I don't want to do it, it will be my work, I will do it, it will be my life, it will be life and work is also life and life is also work and no work life is separate because if work life  If things are different then there is nothing left in life, everything is already done, you have to progress in your life, your growth  Where are you finding time for this? All your time is being stolen. Never promise anyone. Just promise me something and you will give me the money. Tell me one thing. You also earn a salary. I also earn a salary. Do you need money?  and I can give you money then how are you living a life hey don't give me knowledge friend let me give you money if someone says this then tell me now you will not even get knowledge you will not get money anyway now you will not get knowledge also  Go, if anyone asks for a loan then the answer should be no, now you will say no, no, if I need it, why would you need it, you do n't behave like this, why would you need it, you save your money and don't take it from anyone forcefully  We are living life today in the year 2024 as we were living 10000 years ago, 200 thousand years ago, that when that lion comes, the whole community is here, if we don't help it today, then tomorrow it wo n't help me, so we should help it  We are not living such a life in 2024  The work was done without anyone's help. Hey, are you teaching wrong things to the society? All these weak people and those who waste your time and exploit you, they will write in the comment section that you are teaching wrong things, a wise man will say this  So you are teaching a very right thing, all those who are robbers of your time will be irritated by this video that what kind of knowledge has this person imparted because the entire youth has become so fond of it, because what happens when you are young So you feel that there is a lot of time, it is something like if you have crores of rupees in your bank, let's say you have 10 crores, then out of 10 crores someone takes away Rs 10000, takes away 10000, takes away 20000, takes away 00, takes away 500, you are not afraid and do not feel any difference  So what happens in the youth? You have a lot of life left in the future, but it seems there is only time because time is not passing, half the time you are just reeling because there is no purpose in your life, so whoever comes will take away some of your time. so take it  Go, you also take it, you also take it, but brother, such a stage will come in life when you do not utilize this time properly, then you are not reaching anywhere, now you are making people promise that you will not become like this to me  He will give you time, he will give you this, he will give you a promise, then you are not getting anywhere and this is happening like this in the society, it is happening like this in the whole society, then he is saying that when we were on your stage, we used to waste so much time  You were with the world, which we call doing good to the people, now if you are not doing it then you are selfish, so whenever you have to make a promise to someone, you should never break it, it is for the child, that too for your child  Because breaking a promise to a child makes him very uncomfortable and it makes you very uncomfortable because the child's emotions crash immediately. You have told the child that you will take him to the mall or to the movies or you will take him for an outing or you will get him a gift and then he may wish to do something because  He is helpless, no one else is helpless, parents are not helpless, wife is not helpless, I am a man  I am addressing you, you can change the gender, boss, no one is helpless in the organization, a man gets caught, he was exercising in the gym, the next day the same problem is going on, till now they were giving him so much stress that it seems as if without him  It will not work, he has gone up and will never be seen, work is going well but there is only one child, your child, whose work will not be done without you, so the promise given to the children should be priority number one and for the children and it is not like this for them also, the children also  These days papa is very smart, promise him everyday otherwise I will also have to make promises to him as per the need, which are dual, which are justified and which is okay, do not over promise there either, but never break the promise given to the children.  When a promise is broken, it leads to childhood trauma and then that relationship never lasts. It has been seen many times that you kept a promise to your boss who could have screwed you over, basically if you broke any promise, you tried your best to keep that promise to him.  Kari is just a child who can't do anything to you at that time, so he  If you have given that last thing to the child, you should not give it to the child, you should give priority number one to the child and give the rest to him, tell him that Bhaiya, look, it is like this, how will my health be that day, what will be my mood, if I don't know, then I will not come to your party.  You will have to come, you will not come, say no, I will drive there at night to have dinner at such a great party, I will take care of my whole day, if I am tired then I will not come, either you do this, get me a lot of holidays, you have so much  That is strength, okay so live life practically like this and don't go where you are in the mood to go, don't go where people have to get angry, if not today then tomorrow, if not tomorrow then the day after tomorrow, okay don't go and donate your kidney to every person Can you not give it to me? Yes, I will give it to you just like that. You also take it. You are also sitting with two. If everything is fine then anyone will keep asking for anything. They will keep asking for any promise. Promise me, promise me that not in childhood, God, promise me such a childhood  I used to talk in classes, okay, kids talk among themselves, promise not to tell anyone, I wo n't  I don't even know myself and is this not true, is this not true, these are professional commitments, you went somewhere and you promised someone about 5:00 pm, you are sitting somewhere at 3:30 pm, very good place  You are in a very good company and having a lot of fun and learning a lot about life and you want the experience to last long because you will not get such an experience again. You had made some bad promises to someone 5:  why are you doing 00 o'clock because possibilities of life are not like this but if you don't promise like this then it won't work, hey just try it, live this life for two-three months and see if it wo n't work, if it doesn't work then see from the beginning why do you think so  You are thinking no no but if everyone does this then India will become a happy country, which we keep roaming at 126th place in the happiness index, even after having everything, there is food in this country, the weather is good in this country Everything is God's grace which is called but still we are not happy, then when  That index comes out, then we call it false because Pakistan is above us in that index, so we will say, hey how can Pakistan be happy with us, they have this 1.5 crore problem, yes after that 1.5 crore problem  That country is happy with us and we are unhappy but we are not ready to accept this because we get the ranking that suits us, like if India is ahead in business then we get that ranking also which shoots up  My report card, madam's number is correct, no, it is just a region, the government cannot raise it in this happiness index, it has to move up on its own, you have given us ration, 80 crore people are getting food, you are getting water You are getting some air but still you are not happy, okay, so it means that you are definitely spoiling each other's plans, why are you doing that badly, why are you doing such things, your oaths, your promises, your promises, memorize them in English and make songs quickly.  It has happened that you broke the promise, you broke the promise, your promise, stop making such promises, stop making promises  Do n't make promises even to yourself because what happens many times is that you tell yourself that I will go to the gym, this is new, that too is a promise, a promise to yourself, don't promise too much to yourself, work on actual things, don't promise yourself  I promise I will do this I will eat well I will do this that you will eat well You promised but you should promise that I will maintain my emotional stability I will maintain emotional stability and stay happy then maybe I won't have to do this emotional ting Instead of restricting your food, you should control your emotions and these emotions get shaken because you made promises to yourself, the promise is not getting fulfilled, you told yourself that I will go to the gym, oh I will go to the gym, it is a good thing  But if you are not able to go, then what will you do, so brother, take a walk there, walk somewhere in the office, do some alternative things, don't be so harsh on yourself, this is the message, the world is not forgiving anyone.  You should forgive yourself, stop making promises, say I don't promise, I will try, I will see and make that your priority and never take tension on anyone's promises, you are not worried about going anywhere, you are not worried about coming anywhere  No, you are a happy person, do whatever you enjoy, and slowly people will start respecting you for this because you have that ability to say which they don't have, and slowly people around you will start changing at first  You will be in trouble that this is like this, you are like this, you are losing one thing, you are like this, you are like that, then others will say friend this is also getting cut, right, so this is us, we are getting into a mess by doing this because at The end of the day it is about are you happy and satisfied or you are unhappy if you are unhappy then you have to do something no if you are happy then keep going what's the problem people who give you comfort in life, give you peace, give you pause  interact with them  You are doing this and you are not making any promise to the rest, you are not making any promise to anyone, neither to the good ones nor to the bad ones, so I hope this message youth will apply in their lives, how did you like it, there will be a webinar info group in the comment section, do you want to join it Join one of my workshops called Art of Decision Making.
