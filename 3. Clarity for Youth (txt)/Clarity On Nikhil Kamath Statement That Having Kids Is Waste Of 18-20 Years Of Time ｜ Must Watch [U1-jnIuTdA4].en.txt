Hello friends this video is about clarity for youth, who doesn't know that Nikhil Kamat ji is the cofounder of Zerodha, a statement of his came which was widely circulated by my subscribers, so I will give clarity on this very well, his statement was that I don't want to have kids because  I don't want to waste 18 to 20 years of my life. So, I will try to explain the war in a very simple and civilized way without arousing unnecessary emotions or creating any such ruckus, and very lovingly, so that there is a smile on the face and people can watch it without taking any tension.  If you see it, you will get complete clarity. Whatever clips and videos come, then the people who are opposing this thing, what is it today, the protest is no longer civilized, people write wrong and dirty things below, like this, your father wrote this If you had thought about it then you would not have been born, if you do it like this then you will never get clarity, brother, if you don't like the person who said something then talk to him comfortably, this is the environment  Now this is my political channel  Someday I will give clarity about what kind of environment has been created in the country, this is also a fact to react like this, so let's start on that matter, he took two Ajmans, what were the two parts, first of all, baby sitting of children aged between 18 to 20 years  I have to do this and having children is a waste of time and in the meantime I can do something else and the second thing he took was that in old age when one eye grows then if she leaves me or misbehaves with me or does not respect me or  If they don't serve then what is the use and what is the guarantee that they will do it, so he gave two messages, okay, so I will give clarity to both these messages as well, but I will say this now because I will say it in the beginning in the video because some of you will come to know  Hey, too his own, who are you to tell anyone what children should do or should not do, whoever wants to do it will do it, why are you even discussing it brother, these questions will come from whoever is coming, tell me right now that friend you should come and gain knowledge  The elder one starts distributing and saying that the children are not giving me time to do it  It is his wish not to waste it, I want to tell you that when you come to a situation of influence, you are the owner of thousands of crores, you have social media presence, then such things have no effect, if he had told the same thing to his mother  If you had told it to your brother, if you had told it to any of your close friends in the drawing room as part of a discussion, then what was the problem? Who are we? Those who speak also have a private life, but you did not do it like this. You chose to do it on a platform and tell it.  So first I would like to ask a question, brothers and sisters, what is this need to justify coming from within, if you don't want to do it then don't do it, what is the need to tell you that it is a waste of time for me, because people like us will come and question it, because it is normal  They will not let it be normal, they will not let it be normal, so the majority opinion will be that yes, marriage and children, you have this hunger for validation from within and I will link it up with marriage as well because many people say don't even get married, so both things  There will be clarity on this topic as well  There will be clarity, firstly today I am not able to understand that all these bachelors are running this country and want to enter everywhere, there is another bachelor, there is a narrator, I am not able to remember his name, if you know him then please tell me, it is very good, he  She says she is young, she is also not married, she is also giving advice on how a marriage partner should be, when the right one comes then do it and you have to live with him/her for 50 years and 60 years, okay and if you want to get married then how to get married  If it is there then I will tell you, the next topic will be when to do it, how to do it and what to look for while doing it, I will tell you that, okay then it will be a separate topic otherwise it will come under this, so in this we discuss about children only, half children  They don't do it so that when you become old, no one takes care of you, it is incidental, if something has to be done, if someone wants to take care of you then he will do it, otherwise there is no government, otherwise there is no social security, otherwise it is your money, there are many people  Those who don't have it, then that is no reason and yes, he is the right one, he says what is the guarantee that  Yes there is no guarantee that he is right but you are not doing it why you are doing it because it gives you a chance to experience life again you were once a little baby you grew up growing up something happened to you according to you  What went wrong is maybe your parents didn't listen to you that much or your teachers didn't listen to you, there might be some lack in your education or you wanted to do something according to your life, so when you are 25-30 there are issues that you didn't enjoy it that much, if this had happened you would have had a  So you are getting a chance, that is one and if you enjoy it a lot, then you have a template, if you have money, if people like Nikhil Kumar who own thousands of crores, if they don't have children, then one thing will be taken away from those children  No, it's not about that he has not said anything like this to girl children by opening an NGO worth Rs 50 crore. Well, I think so, but if you tell me, I will sponsor education, not for myself because it's not about money and education, parenting is  Not only about this, it is about creating a character, creating a personality, having a I will not again use the word legacy because again I said this that no, I do not want to leave a legacy, I do not want to leave my name behind, yes it's okay, the name should not be used by anyone anyway  It does not go further, nobody among you who are listening to me does not know the name of your grandfather's grandfather's grandfather, you may know the surname, you may not know the first name, you may not even have your photograph, you will not remember, so there is no such name  Not only this, I don't understand much till you are a very great, famous or from some such family where your ancestors have done something great and if there is no documentation then there is no issue of legacy, it's about experiencing life, it itself is that  A small child grows up gradually and when a girl grows up, she has to experience life with her, that is the reason why you have a child and this is an experience and someone between 18 to 20 years of age  One does not have to baby sit for years and since when did men have to do it, since when did men start baby sitting in India till 2024, so this has not happened yet, yes sometimes you may have to do it a little bit but in the first place like this, not for 18-20 years  Kids do n't baby sit, it's okay in the beginning, they keep sleeping, they sleep with their mother, then they also play with their grandparents, then they have their own life, then they also go to school for 18 to 20 years  What baby set will you do for a year and the child is also going to school for seven to eight hours, then he has his own daily routine and once the child becomes a teenager, turns 13, then in any case the parents keep complaining that they do not sit, do not meet, do not talk to them  It is not like they are going to be 18 to 20 years of your life and the second thing is what else will you do, friend, if you will not do this then what else are you doing, no, I am doing my thing  Hey, the kid is also going to school at that time.  Hey, you have to work only for 89-10 hours a day, after that there is Saturday, Sunday, Holi, Diwali, New Year, Bhai Dooj, Rakshabandhan, all these, when you have to get married to have a child, then there are all these other faces of life too because what happens when Nikhil Kamat says this he if you look at his face now I cannot get very personal but a little personal he does not seem to be an extremely happy person there is no happiness on the face then it is frustration when you do not do this thing and it is an intellectual challenge This knowledge is given by making someone wear a mask of ' Prashant' Prashant 'Pareshan Prashant' okay so Acharya Prashant is like this, he also seems to be very troubled when he is angry, then there was confusion about the name Prashant Pareshan, but I used to say troubled  I was going to do it then it seemed like I was not trolling you like that but it was not like that then they also behave like that why am I telling you this, you should look at me, you should understand me carefully that why am I making the video and  Call it my ideology or what my messaging is, what message? First of all, if you like the message or it strikes you somewhere, which I am sure it must be striking a lot of people, then please spread it in your groups because it has taken the form of a pandemonium.  It is not taking the form of an epidemic, it is taking the form of a pandemic, why do you need to justify this, you want to get married, you don't want to have children, you want to do one, you want to do two, you do n't want to do six, do whatever you want to do, but when will you come and say it?  Or no, all this nonsense happens and then by making their own cult and they say yes yes yes we agree with you, love you, they will not let this happen, that is wrong, that is wrong, no one with kids ever comes and says this normally that you should have kids while walking around normally  Okay, it is a very good thing, people do not say anything because they say such things, friend, these are natural things, many people would say this earlier because the children used to be very big, population was high in India, so having a child was not considered an achievement, okay, because it used to happen anyway What should I do, tell Acharya ji Anybody can do it and if you think so great then have a child, many times what happens is that by having a child you become a little great, it is not that the girl has never taken any responsibility in life, many will agree who have daughters and whose  I have sisters who are married or who have their own wives, who knew someone who had been in a relationship for two, four or five years before marriage, how she was, I have seen her change overnight, I am a great observer of society, I am very  I observe the same girl who it seemed like how will she manage her expenses, what will she do, seeing her become a mother, I mean all the hormones and that child takes away all the responsibilities and I have seen a lot of men, boys are boys and women are not married.  Even if you do that, a 35 year old or 38 year old woman would be a little mature in her mind, behavior and way of living her life. She is not married, she probably has a kid but she is a woman and she will not be that out of touch with relationships.  You might also know, you might also have an idea about emotions, but this man, he  He remains a juvenile until he has a child, gets married, if he doesn't get married, he remains like this, he remains a 42 year old Fukra panthi, making such videos, doing friendship, drinking, roaming around and debauchery, there is no purpose, nothing because  That and then come and tell the world that I am living my life bhaiya you then at 47 our Radi old man has a lot of respect for me I at least got married late for what ever reason but after marriage asked brother what to do lots of babies directly too  I want to have a child brother, now whether it happens or not, I will tell you later but I never said anything like this in messaging, earlier also there were many bachelors, there were bachelor leaders also, they came and went, meaning and they never did anything like this  I did not say anything, even great men have been against marriage a lot, even today this about families and not having children and why so much messaging is being done, I do not understand, should the whole country become bachelors because for 18-20 years  It is wastage, 1820 years of yours will go to waste and if you do n't do it then you will utilize it but then what will happen to that utility, what will happen to it, I have had my experiences, what experiences have you had, you went for a trip, took photos, did trekking, mountain  I went cycling, did manji jumping, this is how you can count 50 things, take 50 anything, did white river rafting, went to the beach, went to the ocean, did a cruise, visited a foreign country, did water sports, did adventure sports  What else will you do friend, there will be 50 photographs, all those activities will be of two, two, three days, I told you 50 activities which are done beyond limits, it will happen in 150 days, now what is thrilling, you have even done sky diving, now tell me, it is all your money  You have done the work, now tell me I am talking about 50 tasks, not even one or two, whatever I told you, I told you 10-12, but keep thinking about its list, keep thinking, 50, then what is it now  Life is not very long, it is not short, this is what I want to tell through this video to all the youngsters that life is very long, in youth it seems that it will pass, we see friends, then those friends, now like Nikhil ji's age is probably around 40.  It's going to happen now that he's married like that, the rest of the people don't see him that much now, they do podcasts with youngsters and they give this kind of messaging which is very wrong and I want to ask that all this which  You are messaging, suppose he got married after 5 years and then he said, oh I was right, actually this, you have ruined so many people, friend, because people who are rich can always recover in their life very easily, people who are not very  Rich people who are middle class, it becomes very difficult for them, you tell me, a little fat belly, less hair, grey hair, 44 years, 43 years old man, now he is now middle class, he doesn't have much money, now he has realized it and his shop is closed.  Isn't it now  Who will do that to Nikhil Kamat ji, even now he looks physically fit, he has a lot of money, so anytime he wants to change his decision overnight, even after four years from today, he will do it, so that's why I am giving a message to the youth  Do not follow these people, first of all what is the problem in India, if someone earns a lot of money then that is success, now that success will be talked about in everything, whenever you have to look at it like this, what do you have, that is not it  When knowledge is there, it should come from the very facet that what is being said, concentrate on that thing, on the fact only that what is being said, who is saying it, it should not be a thing, the rich is saying it, the poor is saying it  The middle class is speaking, anyone is speaking, any gender is speaking, age is speaking but the focus should not be beyond that, the focus should be on knowledge, what is being said and that is being questioned because what happens is this They will put intellectual touch on this mask  Some people will say, go for the knowledge of Geeta ji, do some other big work, do great work, there are no such great works and today, brother, the way society is going, especially our majority people from Sanatan Dharma, are going  I am not making it a religious religion, you know what my take is, I am not in that category, okay, they are in danger and all that, I am dispina, which society and community are you taking them to or not, child.  Don't do that child, it is not a pen, it is not a pen, it is a child, now I can tell you with any example, we only ask about the child form of God, in Ayodhya ji, whatever has happened with the Ram Lala temple, so in that, the five year old form of Ram ji is there  The form which is being worshipped is God-like in it, Goddess is seen in God's dividend, child form of Krishna is worshipped in small baby and above that is that energy and that is the God, no matter how many stories and stories you have.  If you are like this then basically understand this thing, don't run away from your route so quickly and no one should come here  I am not talking about compulsion here, I am saying that many times my hair are grey, I am just a few years elder to Nikhil Kamat, I will also be younger than his elder brother, I will be equal to him, okay so I am not saying anything to me  To the youth, hey what do you know uncle, many times mistakes are made, Gyan's hair do not turn grey with age, that is why I am telling you, I understand all these youngsters' requirements and I am saying this with great sincerity and great love affection, don't Fall under the true narrative Just ask what is that need that should be called out because there is no peace You have taken a decision that you don't want to get married You don't want to have kids That decision is taken OK now why are you seeking validation  for this because it is keeping you restless every night whether it is right or not so you want to tell others and then you want to take a feedback yes bhai and then you want to look at left right and find so many people like you for numbers now married person is not having this inside se desire ki yaar mere ko aisa chuck maine shadi kari the right kya maine  I did the right thing, he doesn't say it like this, I have had a child, I did the right thing, he does n't ask, nobody is asking this and no married person and a person with kids is going around with people who don't want to do it now, today there was a time ago aunties  They used to do it in houses, aunts and relatives used to do it and big pictures were made of the wedding, who are they to tell us, they were all right but they have given up that generation and the rest who are like us nowadays, even we are not  I have also changed myself, I don't forcefully say do it, do it, don't do it, I always make videos when someone comes and says that not to get married, is a great thing and not to have a child is a great thing, I am saying to have a child.  is a great thing Getting married is also a good thing, it's okay if you want to do it, do it, if you don't want to do it, it's also fine, but not doing it is not a great thing if getting married is not a great thing, then not doing it is also great  It is not a thing, but a child is life it itself, life is sustained on the planet, something is fine and you can call it a purpose in life or you can also call it that you come home tired when you are hit by the bitter frustration of emotions outside.  One child is okay, now many people will say no no, I am raising him for my own happiness, I am not raising him for my own happiness, I am raising him to enhance my life experience, if you are doing all these things then understand this basic difference That's it you are having a kid not for your selfish pana because you can always say that I don't want this selfish pana, I do n't want any inheritance, I do n't want any service, no he the way he is speaking he is speaking s  Like a corporate guy who is looking at my profit and loss, I will buy shares, I will open a demat, this will be beneficial, this will be beneficial, if I do n't get any benefit from this then I will not do this, it is not like having a child is experiencing life first hand.  a life grows in your hands okay because when you're a child you did n't experience it in that way now when you become a parent you experience it like that when you become a grandparent life is a second chance first chance or the one you had your  The baby is fine and then after that if his baby is fine then he again becomes different and has fun then one should try to go in that direction, all the grandparents who can be there should be told to do yes also we will also help and have fun well then your  At the time our focus was here and here, your focus will also be here and here, but our focus will be on the baby, you earn your money comfortably, do your job and do it, we are there to the grandparents, a message to you also.  so if you are a female who is about to know have a baby or wanting to have a baby if a youngster is listening to me please forward this video to all your family members they should come out and support all the time ki bhaiya hum main hoon na hum  Isn't it?
