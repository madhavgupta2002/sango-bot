Hello friends, there was a need to make this video because I got this message, which you must have read in the title that Guruji do you know Nikhil Kamat on stage, so I want to give clarity on this because youth get such doubts, nowadays there is a lot of noise  He has a lot of influence, you are hearing a lot of stories, so my job is to give clarity for the youth and the name of the channel is also the same, so I want to give clarity on this thing that Nikhil Kamat does not have a house, it's a statement, so he is very rich.  Man and he have a dozen, so I will give you two-three aspects on this, you tell me which one you liked more and in the end what was your opinion on this situation because basically it still comes down to rent versus buying a home, ultimately I will take a little note of that  I will not go in that direction, I have made videos like this before as well, but I will give this take, Nikhil Kamat is not married, yes, so what if he is married, yes, he is not married, even if I am not married, then maybe I don't need a house  I don't read but then he is very rich, he is not married, there is no wife, to tell him that he should buy a house, kids have to play here, that is one second thing, it is a second thing, I will tell you another aspect later, does Salman Khan not have money, Salman Khan  He is really a popular actor, he is staged in Galaxy Apartment, in the same house where there is a small house for God knows how many years, he is also seen in interviews etc. If you place two sofas, you cannot place them face to face, meaning it is so small and he is Been staying there for ages look at shahrukh khan shahrukh khan yes shahrukh khan is also very rich but then shahrukh khan has got three kids wife sister staying with him family has that kind of system so this is a very now you want to if  You want to follow Nikhil Kam be very sure that I will not marry till 37 years and I will have thousands of Karos ka company that is one thing which I want to tell the second thing now  I want to tell you that there is more higher order thinking. Nikhil Kamat is in the business of stock brokerage firm Zerodha, so when he says that look Bhaiya, I am not staying at home, I invest my money in stocks, you too can invest in stocks.  If you put it in mind, then he has a purpose of not staying at home, he can buy thousands of homes and he can stay on rent in exotic places and he can travel the world and stay in five star hotels and may be travelling in 365 days itself For all you know 150 days and staying in the best of the locations, you will get peace there as well, for you a home is a residence and if any landlord says go away and vacate the place now I cannot hammer a nail, I cannot do it here.  Nikhil Kamat, become complete, then you should follow him completely, he is a 10th class drop out, if I am not right please go and check, he did not do 11th, you are busy preparing for exams here  You have done all the degrees, you want to clear IMB, you want to clear IIT but you are not able to clear it, you are taking drop year, you have taken three drop years, hey brother Nikhil Kamat did not study after 10th, so I am not shaming Nikhil Kamat as a bachelor here  I am Nikhil Kamat, saving and shaming, what ever he is doing, he is an intelligent person, he is doing it, what ever but look at his purpose, what will he do in the house, why does he need a house, think about it yourself because he is not going to buy a house  There is benefit in it every time I want to tell you the youth please stop following anyone on such things everybody will start getting older every person is doing that thing which is beneficial for you whatever is beneficial for you you should get married without taking a house  It is happening, take it, keep it, if you want to invest in the stock market, invest but leverage cannot be used in the stock market, what leverage, that future option and that little long one, can you invest today 10 lakh and borrow 90 lakh and invest for four  It will be seen what will happen over the years and if that becomes zero then the money will be over in real estate, you can use leverage, we tend to follow all these stories, we hear about Bill Gates and Buffett, he is a very humble living person, this is not humble bumble, that is his stage.  In the same house for so long and that's it these people are all smart Bill Gates it's okay yours but Buffett also has such followers in India white do it is that friend do n't hate him people are very jealous of him recently Guruji on I uploaded a video on Virat Kohli on the Gurugram channel, Praising Virat Kohli for something, you should watch that video. Hey brother, why are you jealous in the comment section, only Virat Kohli has got competition, if you want to compete then compete with your sister-in-law's husband, your brother-in-law That person becomes a natural competitor - your wife's relative or your relative or your siblings or your cousins, beat them all, you are jealous of Virat Kohli, you are simple, look, normally you shouldn't compete too much with anyone  ok you should do it yourself but what i am trying to do is to become rich know that you are angry with them for their good life they know it so they try to portray certain now like he will show that he is going from here to there on his cycle  He has four jets and he keeps flying the jets, he goes from here to there in private jets, but he will show the car like this, still travels in that car, he got the photo clicked and all the other programs are with him, he may be owning hotels for  All you know they may be owning everything but then don't be too much impressed by all these things, someone is humble, someone is rich, someone is arrogant, someone is humble, someone is very humble, by doing this he was telling something about Amitabh Bachchan  There was an interview with some big stars in which Amitabh Bachchan told him and I am forgetting that I think yes, yes, most yes, it's Shahrukh, only theek hai, he is told on record in the interview and Amitabh told him that brother, I have to keep you like this, yes ji  its my fault  And this is very irritating because just because some person is rich, why should he always be like this and why should he always be like that, yes, yes, sorry, okay but then he said this is the price you pay, so who is not paying rent  how is he doing this he has got nothing to do because you are not having thousands of crores if you have thousands of crores you can do anything you are no longer that road hawker bug who you can go out wearing a grey t-shirt every day  Maybe you will wear a grey T-shirt everyday and if you are a normal person then maybe you will not attract people in a way and it's a fact reach there and then no, people take it as a way that no, if I wear a grey T-shirt everyday then I will do this  It is not that I will become no, you are not going anywhere here, so now you should not follow, if you want to follow then you should do it completely and in totality  can never follow because you will never know anybody full story like Nikhil keys I told Nikhil why do you want to do something after 10th do you have the guts to do something after 10th and you cannot do 11th 12th you must have graduation you must  do this you so when there is a you must then you must have a house also add this thing also in that list only that yes I can't follow selectively then then I must have a house because then I intend to get married at  27 have kids at 2930 the second child at 33 and that it will give the house will give me stability it will give me some social status and it will give me some continuity because no landlord will evict Nikhil Kamat from the house if I am a house  Malik and I have a big house and a big flat and something Then and he is paying me good rent and he is really a celebrity and I have an agreement with him, why will I tell him to leave my place, but to you, landlord, the rent is increasing by 10, no, I am increasing it by 20, this time it is increasing by 25  I am increasing it, no, you should not get out, you have damaged the wall, your complaint has come, you were not making noise, you were creating a ruckus, there was music, no, no, no, get out, my son is getting married, I have to give him a house.  Now if you go out then you are like what is this friend I will keep changing the house these days getting my AC fitted, getting the TV fitted, getting the geyser fitted, getting the chimney fitted, whatever such things are there, 00 things inside the houses  There is a dish washer, this, that, the people who get it fitted charge so much money, friend, first get it fitted, then remove it, fit it, then remove it, this is the only work left, then you take your child to school, then get your wife a job, this is what you want for your  There is something called a variable in the equation of life Keep a constant, have a constant that yes, she is my wife, she will remain my wife constant, this is my house here, I work, I may change the job, I will leave the boss, I will not leave my house, I will leave my wife, learn to make life constant carefully, who  Which ones will be my constants in sea life, will they not be mine, Nikhil Kamat can afford to stay on rent all his life, not 2 or 3 per cent rental, I was seeing a video of Sandeep Maheshwari, hey, it is rarely available and financial issues  Sitting with someone, hey bhaiya it will always be % rental, sometime you can catch it 30 years ago and 30 years later but nobody talks that the house appreciates and becomes double, so if the house is worth ₹1 and the rental is for ₹ then when it is 200  If it becomes Rs. then the rent becomes Rs. 6 is also 3 per 200, but brother  The one who bought it for 100, he is saving ₹ rent and then when it becomes 400 from 200, even then there is % interest i.e. still it is ₹ rent but the one who bought it for 100, he is getting ₹ 12, I have one thing Tell me friend, I took the lion of NHPC, suppose you accept it, okay okay if I but it at ₹1 and NHPC gives me.  Dividend per year the dividend is how much 10 per for me but I suppose I am giving an example, okay and if it becomes ₹1 now and some more in ₹80 90, okay I don't check, I don't check every day and  You should also not check your stocks every day it's a bad habit ok if it was for ₹1 and now it is giving 1.4 then also at 1.4 but friend tell me am I getting 10 per cent returns as dividend on my investment and am I  Getting 1.4 is the basic problem of understanding because financial influencers will say in this case it is technical in case you sell your stock, you will get 100 and in 100 again you buy it will become 100 and now it becomes 1.4 but yaar I bought it for 14  Brother, I have eaten as much as he did in 10 years NHPC has given me dividend in the last few years. It is more than the stock price. For me, the cash flow of the stock is zero. Meaning, it has given me more dividend. I am not supposed to follow it. It is a government company. Here, I am not recommending it.  HPC I am giving an example I am not talking about stock here I am talking about an example that why do people say that there is a flat of 3 lakhs in Janakpuri MG in 1988 and its rent comes to 45 lakhs per month why it is not counted counted age  150 on and it is counted as 3 because if you buy fresh then it is of 1.5 cr so in 1.5 cr you will put 4.5 thread whatever calculation so yes it is three thatchi will remain okay but the game is over right if I  In 1995, the rent should have been invested in mutual funds. Why didn't Varku ji ever do the calculation and give it?  should take this example from this video, put it because he is a great this thing guy because it is good, he shows it well, he has his whole team, I do n't have any team in the team, if not from above, then I would have come after learning, okay  If anyone wants to learn this video then there is no copyright violation, which I am saying openly, any knowledgeable person can do it by learning all this, no one, and today I am telling it on record that my people are already doing it.  My people are stealing such content from big YouTubers, I don't do anything to them, nor do I tell them, nor can I say anything to them because they are so big, so today I, a common man, am telling the common subscriber that you can use all my content wherever you want.  Look, I am never going to do anything and people don't bother me, it's okay, at least the message has reached, okay you too can make shorts of it, edit it, make messages and this is a big thing that I have done because I really feel like doing it.  I have to make a financial channel because when I make it then  Many shops will be shut down and my aim is not that because I do not want to wear the mask of moral science teacher, social reformer etc. anywhere. I am a realist and I say clear and practical things but no one follows anyone completely. I want to tell the youth practically that you should do only what is within your capability but whatever you are able to do, you should learn by getting confirmation from it, this is the only truth in life, the one who cannot exercise, has 100 excuses for not doing exercise and he  He takes 100 examples due to which house cannot be bought, cannot buy, there is no money, mother and father are not giving, money is not coming from anywhere, father in law is not being kind, wife is not giving money, wife is a housewife, does not do a job, cannot take it, then he gets his confirmation  Here he takes notes, those who buy this house, they tell their story, everyone is looking for their confirmation batch and there are so many case studies and examples that you can follow anybody, you can follow Salman Khan, you can follow Shahrukh Khan, I want to follow  Mukesh Ambani ji, such a big house, everyone will live together but on separate floors, so my ideal is 27 floors, brothers and sisters, cars on five-six floors, servants on five-six floors, one floor for one grandson, swimming pool for him, there should be another floor for granddaughter.  The daughter's children should be born, the other ones are also going to get married, the elder ones are also living, a full family, mother is also there, friends, parties, this is the fun, something or the other happens when the wealth of the rich is in the air alone, oh that  The fun will be there at home only, right? How much fun can you have by going out? If you have a very big and nice living room in your house, yes you can do everything sitting together, like I give people an example, people say today Everybody is busy in their rooms, hey bhaiya you build a nice house, make a cozy house and don't be judgemental, everybody should sit like this, in the family the son is sitting, he is engrossed in the mobile, the daughter is sitting there, the wife is engrossed in the mobile  Here you talk to mummy ji on your mobile with someone here and in between  You can also talk to me in between, why are you being judgemental? Someone has something in his ears but he can be seen sitting nearby. When you see your child, your loved one, your wife and everyone, I see anyone like this now  I was not giving a very personal example, if someone is getting happy after watching the video of a cat, is laughing, laughing ha ha haha ​​then you are like it, it increases your energy, friend, keep watching it, but it will sit around only when the atmosphere is such that  You must have made it, house is very important, all the happiness is in the house and the second most important thing is the woman, the wife, she is the one who makes the house, other rods don't even make houses, now I will take it towards wisdom, intelligence and then  Those elders of Prasad ji whip me, don't say such things, okay, I will give rest to my speech here, okay, I feel very scared, that Sandhi Maheshwari had to remove the video, he had said something, okay, so okay  I am scared, yes I am scared, there is victory beyond fear, so please this one  I have given you clarity, you guys have to do what you want to do, no one follows anyone, there are a lot of youth, they are smart but they call their Jaan Badmash, there is a word in Haryana, Jaan Badmash, what is the English word for Jaan Badmash, anyone?  One who knows English very well should write Haryanvi, normally no one among you would be able to write, write it, people of Haryana listen to me a lot, video Jaan Badmash, tell me also what is Jaan Madbash, ji youth is fine, give deliberation, just fan see. They have to do only what they can do, okay, and in that they will follow someone, not to justify it, if you want to get married then grab that person, if you want to get married, those who do it are becoming less in number these days, okay, so this is called confirmation bias  I have taught mental models very well. They are one and their thumbnails are green in colour and my paid members will get them by clicking on the join button. Their demand is very high. They were free for one and a half years, so people bought the free stuff and the price came down.  isn't it as soon as those trees are gone aha ha subscriber  Press that join button and now see, this is the fun of doing something, if you keep saying it is free then it has no value, now it has a lot of value and people are enjoying it a lot, you will get to attend free webinars, you will get to see old content as well  You will get to see all the interviews and I will do regular webinars, those who want to join them, you will find a webinar info group of subscribers in the comment section, so you can join that as well, thank you very much
