Hello friends, a strange trend is going on and I will guide the youth because this youth is directly evolved in this. People from 18 to 25-30 years of age are a big part of this trend and what is this trend is not known to some people. Considering them very great in the domain, elevating them and those people too play to the gallery, maintain a high morality, then after taking them here, again bringing them down, that is one second, expecting undue from them, then this is the way to make a video  The inspiration behind the region is Vikas Divya Kriti ji, she is a very good teacher, I don't agree with many of her views, that's okay, but the deaths that have happened in the basement are a different matter in Rao Academy.  but he has endured a lot of trolling, does he deserve trolling? He is a person like me who doesn't agree with what ever most of the things which he does and how he positions himself, you can say that I am their  I am in the opposition but I want to say with disdain that he deserves that the incident did not happen in his basement, he has something else going on but he stands there with a larger than life image and children say that people come to Delhi because of him, so he  We have to bear this and in this they are trying their best to give Rs 10 lakhs and money for the death of the children. I am not saying give 10 lakhs, I am saying give 10 crores to someone, but if it is your mistake, here people will blame you.  There is a feeling that by shaming you, by becoming a moral science teacher, by judging you, by attacking your brand value, they are trying to extract it from you and you too are playing to the galleries because you cannot come and say it clearly like I say that give knowledge for money  Le bye bye tata there is no relationship, no guru, it is just a consultation you are idealizing Divya Kriti ji and all the people associated with her and I am giving guidance to the youth, you have to understand carefully that the person who cannot become rich himself, cannot make you rich  first of all this free electricity, free water, free education  The second thing that is free, what did Vikas Dikrit ji do, he told the children of Rao to come to our Karol Bagh store and we will teach you something for free, you need new students, you are taking advantage of their helplessness that if their shop is closed then all the  Students should come, I will give them some paper vapor or something like that, some test waste and once they enroll with me, then maybe later I will also give them a bigger course at a discount, it is not that I am thinking like this, I have no guarantee  No, but this offer which is free offer anywhere is a wrong thing, it will never give you anything, you can be looted by paying money but nothing great is ever going to happen for free, know this, if you take free knowledge from someone then how will you earn money yourself  Will you charge? If you have acquired any knowledge for free, then you have the moral right to pass it on for free. Yes, it should be given for free. There is no respect for everyone. Brothers and sisters, how many times should I explain to you that you gave money to the school. Vikas Divya Kriti ji is a teacher, you cannot see him becoming rich. Some of you are a guru, some are religious men, some are very nice, chubby.  A good man with good things seems like me, I should think like that about myself, no one can see us becoming rich, but this Juba Kesari, he can earn thousand crores, he is selling liquor, these Instagram2 many  Many girls make reels, what do they show, they can earn money because they are [ __ ], [ __ ] can earn money, alcohol can earn money, abuses can earn money, another Ranveer Singh's Bedi ad came, that was with some porn star, I don't know who  So he was selling some medicine, okay, this is something like this, he can earn money, he will get full respect, Deepika Padukone ji, she is a big star, she is authorized to do all these things, but some religious person, some guruji, some Vikas, Divya Kriti ji, some big  If you go around in a car and earn some money, then this should not happen because this is a good work, do not earn money through good work, you can earn money through bad work, you can earn it through gambling, you can earn it through robbery, by taking someone's money, all this  Money is allowed in our society Earning is Divya Kriti ji's fault, I am putting this in this situation, why are you becoming a moral science teacher, why do you come and see, talk softly, do it like this, hey, speak simply, we will take money, we will take money from thousand children, we will take money from 50, corporate social responsibility  Under this, just like other people also give, we will teach you for free, it is just clear, why do you get so Apollo jettic, you don't, they say that someone was saying hey, their English course is for 280000, I say it is a very cheap course for you to become an IAS  You want to become one, Khan sir is teaching you for even Rs. 7000, go there, someone else might be teaching you for Rs. 20, you have come to Delhi, go to a five star hotel and say how come the food is so expensive, it is not a five star hotel, why are you crying  ho, are you deceived, no, it was written in many comment sections that why are these entitlements of children coming because I am taking classes here for the subscribers and we the public, no one can take a glass, by saying the opposite, the subscribers will leave and run away  This will happen, that will happen, that's the fear  No, this is the fear, they are writing and their videos are coming, if they take so much money then they should give guarantee, guarantee that they will pass, guarantee is that we will all die, rest of the guarantee take from your father or mother Take a guarantee of something, when you get married, the boy is saying that I want to take a guarantee, any girl's father wants to take a guarantee that you will never shout at her, will not talk rudely to her, will always respect her He will earn money and he will do it and the girl's wife is shouting, take a guarantee from the girl that you will cook food, you will do it like this, you will be happy, who gives a guarantee about whom right now that I have no guarantee about myself that how will I behave after four days about any of my things  If he gives a guarantee, he means that any Olympic coach will make a student come and learn from him only when he guarantees that son, you will definitely get a bronze medal in shooting, only then will you come to learn. What sense of entitlement is this of the people, the Indian public and the middle class?  What else is the problem? I am telling them that you should also take coaching and you should also become rich. Has anyone stopped you from doing this?  The exam is not passed. You think that 80000 is too much fee. You have no idea how much is the rent of that system which is running. You have no idea how much is the next expense. How many teachers, lecturers are paid? Is its net worth  Is there a profit margin? Are there any challenges in it ? If a situation like Covid arises where money is not coming in and still people have to be paid, then I, like an entrepreneur, can buy a room in Mukherjee Nagar for Rs 8,000 and you can get a five-star hotel for Rs 8,000.  If you get a five star hotel room for one day, you will get it for 30 days and what else do you want for Rs. 8000, this is what comes to my mind, I am surprised, I feel that for so few rupees  Of situational awareness people, these will become our IAS, these will become our IPS, these are our rights, they do not know what is happening in life, how to do it, they have so much sense of entitlement, you have so much sense of entitlement You can read it at home, you can read it in your book, you can take notes from them, you can read it online, you can read it in the hybrid model, but the problem is not only of the children, but I want to say that the problem is of Sandeep Maheshwari, the problem is of Vikas Divya Kriti.  The problem is with some people like Acharya Prashant because they do good work but why do they wear the mask of moral science? I spend 1 minute on my YouTube, if you want then do n't spare even Rs. Don't spare even Rs. Brothers and sisters, subscribe to the channel, like and Also press the join button if you want to earn money and do your RR in life and want to cry and do this then go to these people and then troll them, no one can control me, Guru ji I respect you a lot  I needed some help from you, it will cost money but you are selfish, so you want something for yourself from me for free and I am selfish one, I am asking something from you, I am wanting to give something to you because you only want to approach me  Something so you are wanting something so in the name of giving you something I am wanting something so this is an equal relationship but if you want it for free then I am selfish this is amazing morality that is why the war in our country is not going anywhere go to America Try taking someone's minute for free, then go to America, Singapore, you get nothing by smiling and saying I love you, I like you, go and see, I have great respect for you, give me coffee, no one is going to give you coffee, you will get it in Starbucks like this I love you I  Love Starbucks I love the coffee I love the aroma no because what is the problem, they have grown up watching such movies because the children of today, their parents have given them wrong values, son, your father should read such movies  He may or may not have earned anything, but he had earned a lot of respect, respect is a big thing, your father's name is Master Dinanath Chauhan, then he becomes Amitabh Bachchan in Agneepath and then you can see what mischief he does because he has such a loser father No two tuitions  I got educated because I kept on earning respect and the one who teaches tuition is insulted like this, the donation of education should be free, good liquor should be bought with money, education should be free, amazing brother, all the dirty deeds, all the intoxications, all the cheap things, there is money in them. Yes, Jupiter, Guru will die of hunger and the crow will eat the pearl, why Kaliyuga, brother, why can't Guruji travel in Mercedes, you should feel very happy, your Guruji, remove Guruji, consultant, teacher, all of you, you learn from your mentor, some big person, I will guide you in those good things.  If he is roaming in good condition, he will take you around as well, he himself is in poor condition, so you take free knowledge from the poor person and you have to become like him, he is Juma Kesari, you will not say anything to the Juma Kesari people, we tell them, they can sell anything  Come and do anything rude, these are IPL matches, the cricketer will earn money, hit a four, a six here, he scored 15 crores, 20 crores in IPL, hey your Pat Cummins who was stepping into your World Cup and your  I was feeling a foot on my chest, you give him 20 crores and go to watch his matches, and who is Pat Bastard, the Australian Pat Bastard, okay bastard, you are giving it to him and here if one of yours earns some money, it is a big problem.  Let Pat the bastard earn, you have no problem, he is not only earning money, you are watching him, you are liking him, you are trolling him as well, he is earning money everywhere, a little shame from you, use your brain a little subscriber  I am trolling you people, not everyone, but those who think like this and keep this kind of 80, even such data is not wrong, everyone wants something for free somewhere and that is why now they will make it 10 lakh rupees.  I gave it, it will never happen and if anyone sends the video to Vikas Divya ji, he will say why did you give only 10, you earn this much and if you gave 10 then what big thing did you do, 10 and if you gave the money every time, then it means it is your fault too Hey brother you write to Divya Kriti ji Delhi Administration I am Greater Noida Gurgaon and  Hello all children, let's come there, you will get good rooms and good air, the area is also good, boycott Delhi, boycott MCD, boycott Delhi government, boycott everything, boycott Mukherjee Nagar and Odd Rajar Nagar, the people of Delhi are earning money and giving you city services.  If you are living there then why do you live there, they say it was in the basement then why did you go to the library, if you were not in it then what should we do, what should we do, then this is what happens with helpless people in life, you should get your fees back from there  I had to take it but everything is acceptable, if something happens then it is going on otherwise, so pick it up as it is, start a campaign right now, boycott old Rajendra Nagar and Mukherjee Nagar by hashtag, leave them, bye bye tata on your own, thank you for Kota also.  One day, hey, it is the medium of technology, friend, you do not have to shake hands with the teacher, thousands of children are sitting, they are sitting behind, you do not have to touch him, you cannot even see, in this video, you can see me clearly and hear me clearly what  You can see that the 20 children sitting at the back and in the front understand something and listen, and in such a crowd, will anyone read? Study it peacefully, do you want to parrot something? What do you want to understand? Those preparing for UPSC, what do you want to understand?  But why do you teach this high moral science and it also becomes this, just say it straight, it is an institute, take the books, I am giving you knowledge, you just give me money, that's it, if you enjoy it then it's great, if you don't, it's okay  If he is selling the course and giving it away then what will happen with it, nothing will happen with it, yes I have a pre marital consultation of Rs 400-500, it is super hit, should I take it from this, why are you asking me, no, but I am not telling you why not,  There is no guarantee, there is guarantee about only one thing, we will all die, why are the teachers giving so many explanations, learn, if not learn, don't learn, you go to watch a movie, you eat at a hotel, you say this before eating at the hotel Do a little test only then if it is good then I will tell you, I will not understand the review, how does the review system work  Do you guys even know that in digital, reviews can be managed so easily, you know how many reviews come, so you should keep in mind one thing that you do not get anything for free and since it is running for free, that is why you  You cannot do any of your work, you are so judgemental, every time you come you will judge me, if I do not make videos in high production value quality then people judge me, so whatever is shown in very high production value, it earns more money.  It is not they who are earning, we like them, so why not, I will do everything just to make you look good, by managing my production quality, I will make sure that the products reach most of the people in a reasonable budget, I am teaching this to you only because you judge me  Many people like me, I teach this technique to kids, this technique is also a very big technique, you judge it, what is the problem with that, when you start, if your production quality is also not good, then you will never make it because you judged me, I am saying here  I am saying that this will work for life long, there will be no education, no one will lag behind, some great animation  You will not come to acquire any knowledge, earlier the guru used to sit under a tree, neither the tree would move nor the guru would move, everyone would sit below and take all the knowledge, it was the gurukul system of India, the same one used to explain maths to you, the same one used to explain English to you  There was no teacher at that time who used to teach Hindi, Sanskrit or whatever and he also taught gardening, astronomy, astrology, everything, he was the only one and he used to sit there and teach cooking and also taught Surya Namaskar and he did not have any Shashi Shiksha  They did not come and India had 25th GDP in the world, now here the country is poor, thinking is poor, people are poor, everyone is poor and now there is a fight here, everyone wants everything for free, hey, it was not available for free even at that time, the children had to do labour there  The child had to grow the food there. Even today this system is running in many places, where big gurus have employed people on 101 jobs, they complete the work for salary and they are still happy because they get food.  If you get it, if you get it then you will never get anything for free, so you have to have some expectations This trend of pushing someone up is very bad. Why are you pushing him up, why are you climbing higher and higher? Those who climb up enjoy it a lot. When they were climbing they were giving respect. Did n't you see with what mindset you have gathered these people?  So, I should bring everybody together, many children are impressed by me, many youth are impressed and they might impress me and take me somewhere and then if anything goes wrong, hey brother, don't associate with such people, they are losers.  I want to tell you that you are a loser, you want everything, you can neither pay money nor charge anyone, you will keep roaming around like a poor person, the rickshaw puller is better than you, he does not say that it will cost Rs. 100 to go there, that's it, you tell the rickshaw puller a lot, Bhaiya  -Thank you very much, please drop me there for free, don't you say it, you know you have to give it to the rickshaw puller, only those who are in the field of knowledge want it for free, brother, if free knowledge is available then it will be a free job only, why do you bargain with the school person  I don't do it, the school fees are so high, why don't you tell them this friend  Why are you charging so much fees, you are not paying much to the teachers and this school of yours is 40 years old, you did not build it yesterday, whose money will you pay, why charge so much fees, if you bargain a little you will not do it there, there is no hospital there  I will not bargain with the doctor saying that doctor saheb, 5 lakh rupees to open a market like this is a good idea, you have already completed your studies, you too had studied 30 years ago, the fees were not so much at that time, you will not pay there also  You will put everybody in jail but you will give people a upper hand in the system here, that is why no one is coming, all the scholars will leave the country, Divya Kriti ji is such a scholar, she is a very good scholar, I respect her, I do n't understand some things  So we can always agree to disagree and what I am saying is that whatever I don't like about his words is not right, it may be that my thought process is wrong but if children in the country are ridiculing Dispina in this way then why don't they  They make it and don't respect it just because someone charges money, okay Brother, without money no one will come to clean the house, even for sweeping and mopping you have to pay, so whatever you want to say to your guru or teacher, lecturer, consultant, tell them, they will be available for free, now if you want good service then you will get it  If it is not available then discuss it further, no one is refusing it saying that you are paying 2.8 lakh I will not sit here, so sit in some other good safe place in Gurgaon, don't go to any other place, Mukherjee Nagar, that place  This is all I have, so you have to come there, if you are compelled, then your compulsion is taken advantage of, it is a simple thing, nothing is going to happen by crying because there are children sitting there protesting, I have to address those children also  I want, we are sitting here, we will fix it, Mukherjee Nagar is never going to be fixed, Old RJD Nagar will never be fixed, let R City be rubbish, old places, low line places, no one can come and fix it there, even the Prime Minister says if you fix these, it won't happen.  That place is not worth going to, it is a useless place, something might happen to you there  So for Rs. 8,000 will you get a five star hotel where you can have a view from the back and a view of the swimming pool in the front. You won't get rooms like that, you will be living in a ghetto. Have some self esteem, get out of that place if becoming an IAS is in your destiny.  And if you have talent, you can become one from anywhere else too. Don't these South Indian people become IAS? Does n't anyone come out from Chennai and Kerala? Is no one from Tamil Nadu coming out of UPSC? I don't see them studying in Old Rajendra Nagar, this Old Rajendra Nagar and this Maximum people in Mukherjee Nagar are from UP and Bihar, maximum are from UP and Bihar, I cannot see the rest, find your own place brother, why does everyone have to come here and after coming they have to cry about poverty, hey brother why are you crying about poverty Yes, brother, where will you get a room in Delhi for less than Rs 8000, please tell me where you can get a room that has AC installed, they do not tell you that it has AC installed, geyser installed, attached toilet, you do not have to stand in any line, you also get a bed  I have paid for the mattresses and the electricity bill too in the same  If it is included then what will be the problem in it brother, at least buy a yard for seven to eight lakh rupees, if you don't want to pay and if you assume that your parents are poor then it is not the fault of the people of Mukherjee Nagar, Old Rajendra Nagar, they will still have to pay Rs 8000  If you do not take it then do not study but this thing should not be taken because of my poverty if someone subsidizes it from outside and you are taking the help of reservation, you are taking the help of reservation, those who cannot take it, they cannot take it now why were you born  You grew up in a family where you don't get reservation, how long will someone keep crying about this and the crying never ends, brother of Yut, whatever you focus on, your life will be ruined, you will keep crying, RR says no, and you will keep doing the same and you will see this  that you will see it practically, yes what is this world, I want to tell the youth in this world, nobody knows you anything about me, everyone has tried their own thing, no one came to teach anyone, he came to give for free, all their own people died.  the heaven that appears  You can see them in heaven as well, they died on their own and only then did they get heaven, you too will have to die to see heaven, I am not saying literally but people will literally have to work hard unfortunately, no one is going to come and do anything or stop them  It is not going to happen and nothing is going to happen even by sitting on a dharna, someone will come and make promises to you by sitting on the dharna, nothing can be done, neither if some vegetable is prepared badly, it is not going to be rectified by sitting on the dharna.  No, the next one will be fine but here vegetables are not being cooked, first of all there is that infrastructure, I will do coaching in Delhi only, I will do it in Rajendra Nagar only and I will improve the infrastructure of Rajendra Nagar only and I want a room here only and I also want a room  You want one worth Rs 9000 and it should be breathable, there should be a balcony, there should be a view and there should be facilities as well. What are you doing friend, who will tell me? I am surprised. Do you have low IQ? Do n't the youth have intelligence? A little harsh.  It seems so but these emotions are getting awakened because I am seeing them  I am speaking and I look at them like this, the kids who are being interviewed, the news channel people are going to me, I feel like, oh hello, you are becoming an IAS, this is the knowledge of the public, you will become like this and then Your heart will beat so much for the public and as soon as you become one, you are selfish friend, you are the biggest among all, when you are here, you want something for free, then you have to do something here, then you don't want to do a job and if someone comes and tells you then this  Classism is happening, it should not happen like this, parents need to use their brains, stop sending their children to Delhi, they are very toes, they will not get any benefit here and they will come out as big losers, the chances of becoming a loser are 99.99% 075  But still the selection rate is not the same, all the people who come to UPSC and if you take the reservation angle then it is even lower, the one who doesn't get reservation then his chances are even lower, so don't waste your life at least daily, if you have to waste it then do something clean  place tax  Okay, if you have to waste something then do it in a clean place, if you waste your life in a bad place, you will feel more bad where the air is good, the water is good, mummy ji, my friend, you are getting mummy's food, you are getting completely clean clothes in the house.  The house is clean, I can see my father's face, sometimes I can see my brother and sister too. I have this book, this pen and I will make notes like this and teach you the exam. I don't have to go anywhere. I get my food on time.  There is no one to go to Miss, you don't have to wash your clothes, underwear and vest yourself, if mother washes them then you must be washing your underwear and vest yourself in Mukherjee Nagar, you must be getting the bus ironed yourself, you must be going to eat food, then if she is unhappy in class then brother it is better to stay at home  Read it, you will save two-four hours and if you get a clean life then there is a higher chance of passing here, this is Mukherjee Nagar and these people have done another scam, these people are huge, I hope you have some good videos till here  I am watching from and whoever understood this thing, brother, see this All of their cases are open in the name of IAS, then this will happen, they say that these people of ours were selected, listen carefully what do these people do, 10 lakh children give the exam, 15000 of them do the prelims, their children are among them  No, even among the 3000 out of 15000 who qualify for the interview, their children are not there but he calls 100 children out of 3000, calls someone for mock interview for Mock Inter and claims that they studied with him Hey, if 100 children out of 3000 do their mock interview, then brother, Haj was getting selected anyway, this is a big scam, a separate detailed video will be made on this, like and share this one, thank you very much
