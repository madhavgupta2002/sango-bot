Hello friends, this is a very important topic for youth. I would say that people below 40 years of age or even those who are 45 years of age should also take note of it. It is very important. You have to spread this message and there is no competition in it that if you get to know about it, then someone else will also get to know about it. So if you are lagging behind then let's start with seven things which youth should avoid doing and if you avoid them then you can become rich and these mistakes are being made, I will tell you seven mistakes, fourth, sixth and seventh are amazing, it is amazing, you will enjoy it, it is quite original  Content is one or two things, you may have heard it, let's start from the beginning, which you may have heard, but it is important to repeat it, but you may not have heard some things and you have to do it. Which are the best two out of these seven advices?  If you want a number, please tell me that this is the number and this is your best, please tell me, as a content creator, it is very fun to get your paper checked from the subscribers, so the first thing is not to invest time and little money in upgrading your skills  I see that people of 22, 23, 24, 25, 28, 32 years of age want to invest, they want to invest, they want to invest, increase your salary and money making capacity, when you become old then that capacity will not increase, there is a time when it can increase  Now, by doing a SIP of Rs 5,000, Warku ji has glamorized it so much that you will become a millionaire in 90 years, and by doing that, this mutual fund, this stock, this multibagger stock, hey, if you do it, then 50,000, 10,000, 200, 50,000  No, it will become long in the long term, there is too much focus in this, I am saying just do it and get rid of it, buy an index fund, buy some ETF, do it and get rid of the rest of your energy in learning more things which you can monetize, if you are thinking about investing  If I have to learn a lot then learn so much that you can earn by giving knowledge to others because if I earn Rs 5000, 10000  I am sitting with Rs. 200 and up to Rs. 1 lakh and I am learning it myself, so brother, only Rs. 50,000 is working, Rs. 20 lakh is not working, now FD of Rs. 50 lakh will any day give more returns than anything put in mutual fund  Which is like 5 lakh, 10 lakh, 15 lakh, try as much as you want, but after 40 years it will happen in the long term, all of us are dead, okay? Leave the dream of 90 years of SIP, invest in yourself, another thing is coming which is missing out on  Real estate because by getting into the debate that whether this is good that is good not realizing that real estate is an assured expense you will have to pay rental but rental rate is always at Rs. 3 it will remain at Rs. 35 4 life long because if  He is on this base pay 3 so when this base increases the property price doubles then the rental also doubles and after that Even after 50 years you will hear the same stories, so don't listen to them, the property which was worth 20 lakh rupees 20 years ago has now become worth one crore rupees and still gives 000 rent  If it comes then if the rent is 000 then it is % only but how much rental did the person getting 000 rent 20 lakh get, tell me whether it happened on 15 or not, brothers and sisters, we should not miss out on this thing, we should not get into the debate on this that  Hey this is like this anyhow take money from father and mother and save the marriage from mother in law and father in law and take wife and husband home in the beginning he will give you a lot of freedom in the future you will have the courage to say no in things, let's go ahead in the third thing which is not Children and youngsters are not able to understand staying in one place, opportunity will take me there, then I will go there, I will go there, rolling stones are gathering, no masses choose your karma bhoomi, be initial two-four  It will not happen in 5 years but by 30 at least be very clear where you are going to make your money and stay in your life by changing your family, living at six or eight places, father is here, mother-in-law, father-in-law are there, he is there, she is here  My brothers and sisters are here, the children will be here in future, I am here, my wife is here, nowadays people are doing even these jobs, then you will keep asking the airlines for money for coming and going, you will keep paying money to the railways and the opportunity cost will keep going down because you will set up separate homes  So no money will be saved, living in one place is very important, I am telling this to the government people also, the wife is a government servant, the husband is a government servant, you are living far away, a separate video will be made on this, if you want then tell me, living in one place is very important  It is important now the fourth thing which I had said is very important which ones did I say fourth sixth and seventh now this is going to come listen carefully the fourth thing which I had said was compounding yes we know about compounding friend I don't tell you about compounding  Staying 1 P r to the power n, this compounding in relationships, which term is this, compounding, compounding, that is, we have learnt it, I know, they do not understand compounding in relationships, youngsters will keep running after frillless relationships, living in boy-girl, then it was changed friend,  They have changed their place also, the place is not same and hence the network is also not same, there is a lot of compounding effect of their relationship, make less relationships in life but stay with fruitful and intelligent wise people, you will find them and there is a lot of compounding  A relationship that gave great returns, more than the returns that came in real life because of that relationship, that was Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett's relationship and which other relationships do you know like this, you will see a lot of actor producer actor actress okay  You will see such compounding in businesses, you will see many such relationships that took you from one place to somewhere, some years ago there were two men in Gujarat, one used to drive a scooter and he used to sit behind with a poster, it was many years ago brothers and sisters, more than 35 years ago  Now who is she and where have they reached, where has the compounding of that relationship taken her, brothers and sisters, tell me who is she, relationships can take them anywhere, understand their compounding, today keep in the back of your mind through this video, which are the relationships that  It is compounding you and which takes you down and you keep changing, the sooner you get married, the sooner that wife or husband comes to you, the more you can concentrate on further things because that compounding effect of intimacy will start coming soon  And all the things have to be understood by taking a leap of faith and the youth is not understanding that they have become a ghost out of fear of 498 because a separate video will come on that, why one should not be afraid, what are the benefits, but today this is as a concept.  I have introduced it and apply it in all relationships, then comes the fifth point, we can call it in short language as inability to say no, but if I explain it in detail, then wasting time in running errands, we understand small tasks as mother-  Father would use them as servants He was picked up from the railway station, dropped there and came back. The work can be done in 10, 20, 100, â‚¹5,00,000, 000, if you don't do that work, our parents feed us and keep us entertained till that much, you will be able to become a man and this will have to be given to your parents.  I want to make a child and the parents also feel that it is good for nothing so let's get something done to recover it but this is happening with a lot of war, small tasks, many times the wife also traps me in such circles because I address  I am doing this for people up to 40 years of age, have you seen one thing, the religious wife who is there, wives, I am talking about middle class women, there will be big things for them to help in the house, if they are housewives, they will come with brooms, cleaners will come  The utensils seller will come, I am talking about the middle class, not the poor people, if your husband cannot give this to you at home, then you must remember that you are poor, no no, we are very much out of choice, if you are saying this out of choice  so % are you  Otherwise, everyone comes to the house. In many, everyone has hired a cook or a chopping lady. Some ladies who dry bedsheets or clothes gradually outsource all the work. The husband comes after earning money, there is no outsourcing of that. He still has to take his wife to visit his relatives where he does not want to go and is tired. If he is going out for his own trip then it is a different matter but the husband is tired of doing such things where he does not feel like doing them That husband spends two or three hours on Saturday or Sunday, attends a workshop, attends a webinar, relaxes, makes some notes, books, adds value to his life, the wife will say, now you go from Monday to Friday, then you will be the boss's boss You were obeying my orders, now you will not obey my orders or else I will obey you, meaning this looks very youthful in it and I am not saying this against women, I am giving you examples, it can be applicable to the female gender  Also that you may be asked to do such Mundan things, if you can outsource them and earn money, you can earn big money, you also want to earn, learn to say no to time wasters, there is a party at my place, there is a Mundan ceremony, this happened today. B I am going to everywhere and cannot say no, one has gone, the other one also has to go, the third one also has to go, there is traffic everywhere, brother, do your own thing with your families, I said that families should stay nearby, whose are the rest?  If you call the friend of the friend of the friend of the friend, then most of these middle class youth are wasting their time. The moment you cross into 40, then you realise that there is not that much time left in life, then stop wasting this time.  You will do it but you will have this feeling friend, if someone had told you earlier because that relationship did not go anywhere because I had told you earlier about compounding of relationship, there can be only three, four, five or six useful relationships which can be compounded by many people who are living in very great positions  I have arrived, they have kept one and two only, one and two with their family members  One or two of our outsiders and through that we can reach places so I hope you also understand this thing, the sixth thing is very important in which this mistake is made, so on IC 95, people doing may be more youngsters, okay and what about youngsters who are not so youngsters  Also doing goal based investment, this is the way to loot money from you, goal based investments, who is he Rohit with Sharan and he, you have to go for a trip here in two years, save this, buy a car, save this, buy this, do this, this Miz Mable way  This is the way of living, you will keep going, you will be 50 years old, everything will be fine and nothing will be left, no that retirement is also the best goal, put all your effort in increasing and earning money and the capability to add value to your life is the life of the world  I should earn money from it like these people are earning, where should the world make gold based investment, you can earn more money from it, doing epic [ __ ], doing this, do this, do that, do that, do that, make money yourself  Earn so much money that you don't even think about the expenses, brother, you have to go to a foreign country, how much will it cost, 5 lakhs, 10 lakhs, hey, it is like this, earn for 10 days, earn for 15 days, go for that and then you will get used to earning big money.  So this urge to run away left and right also reduces because when you start understanding money, then when you buy an i, you do n't say that it is worth Rs. 1 lakh and I am saving for it. Yes, you calculate it like this, I will do the calculation and tell you, suppose you want to buy a phone worth 5 lakhs, then brother, it is like this, if you want to buy a phone worth 5 lakhs, then you will get it only after deducting tax, whatever money I have earned, that means I will get 2 lakhs  You will have to earn because it will go into tax at 33 and 30 per cent so you will have to earn 2 lakhs, ok but the 2 lakhs that you earn should also be savings, so the savings are based on how many hours of my work, so start taking out the phone in hours' time two for example if your  If your salary is â‚¹ 1 lakh, then you cannot save more than 50,000. For that 1 lakh salary, if you work 200 hours a month, then you save another 50,000, which is equivalent to 600 hours of your work.  Calculate the phone cost of 600 hours in this way that if you get your mill grinding done for 600 hours then you will get a call and suddenly you will say that friend, I will buy it for 20000 only, 130000 is saved, 130000 is saved, so I have saved my 550 hours, these 550 hours would have been spent somewhere else  If I invest then I can do something else and earn more money. Every time when you buy something, do n't think how much it costs. Think, calculate my rate of earnings, then calculate my rate of savings and buy things from the savings only. Whatever remains is given to the government, the petrol  I wasted the electricity, I wasted whatever I spent on clothes, whatever is left, will you buy from that only, won't I take a credit card, interest yes, so calculate that too, calculate the interest, that too will be taken out from the savings and the interest will also be given on the money that is saved  If it is there then you will come to know that you will not spend a lot of money unnecessarily, you will not have to ask anyone how good it is, I had said that sixth is very good and seventh is the final which will be a lot of fun, youngsters are making a big mistake, they are travelling, I am not saying not to travel  We do it but we are doing it in the wrong way, let me tell you how, we will go travelling anywhere, we will go to Goa, let's talk about India, some destinations are going to Goa, someone is going to Jaipur, going to Agra and tell me some other place of Indian tourism, Kashmir is going to Himachal  This is going to Kullu Manali area and then this one from Mussoorie has come, Nainital has come, Uttarakhand has come, this one is going to the South, Kerala is going, these are Indian destinations and if you take some foreign destinations, many people are going there to visit in the wrong way on  You are travelling, I will tell you what is the right way of travelling, wherever you go, don't just go and take photographs, be curious, where can one get paintings, where are miniature paintings, where can one do business, where is this yellow house, where can one get sarees in Varanasi, which place in Karnataka  C type sarees are available on the Ranchi side, which paintings are there, where can Madhubani paintings come from, local art and craft, bring numbers of 50 people, do business later, collect things, from where, what thing can be sold, Maheshwari saree is this  what is it, what can happen inside Madhya Pradesh, how can you tap with other countries, you can make blogs and photos of that place and also earn money from youtube3, then it is fun, you do n't get to travel, you just go and come back  When you go and come back after eating, find out about the food, what are the benefits of the food, put its photographs, its blogs, travel blogs, photographs, videos, friend, you should know the way of travelling and go to all the places with ease, spend some time, one or two days extra because it costs a lot.  Your place to visit  You have to come and go, don't run around like this, just go around doing that Kabaddi Kabaddi Kabaddi Kabaddi Kabaddi Cuttap, touch ahead like this, Kabaddi Kabaddi, don't go like this and a day will come that when you will learn to earn money by travelling, then brothers and sisters, go around  It will increase even more and by travelling, tell me that if you go somewhere, ask about real estate and gain knowledge about it, gain domain knowledge, wherever you go, such a big book or a class plus or someone's book, like nowadays there are notebooks etc., any one is good  Take a notebook, take a good register and fill it with notes, then scan it and put it in your computer, so that if the book gets lost, the data is not lost, write it in your good handwriting, not your good writing  If it is there then get it written in wife's handwriting, sometimes the writing is not good, like when I go somewhere then I dictate notes, I do not understand my writing, that is why I have to make my videos like this, I cannot make them in writing.  You will not be able to understand your writing, you will have to read it like this many times  Many times one goes for pointers, so what am I trying to do, look at travel in a different way, think that it will be a trip here, it is a trip to Bhutan, now people will come and go, not many people have gone there, so how did they go, how did they reach there, what a good experience  Was it a bad experience, where money could have been saved, where good investments could have been made, do a review, learn the local economics of that place and also bring relations from there that whenever I call you send the goods to me, brother.  Order any item and monetize each item, make a website and put everyone's stuff on it, if you want to use your brain more then everything of yours is sold on this amazonbusiness.in, there is a place between Gandhidham and Bhuj, many heroines wear it  The suits from there are of 500, 600, 700 rupees many years ago, bring them to homes, it is like this that if you buy 15 suits, then you think that I will do business or I will gift something like this, the family members rob it like this  relatives are your own  K means wife, his wife's sister or someone else, they have so much craze for someone, like take them to Rohtak, take them to Jind or Jha, what is that thing that ladies like the most, see how nicely I am explaining the same point  The seventh point is very important. Ladies like the most that they wear something that no one else has worn. So, if you bring those Bandhej things from Haryana and I am forgetting the names of many sarees.  They come like this, you get them pressed later, oh amazing, where did you get it from, where did you get it from, I mean here even if you give it to him for Rs. 5000, he is ready to buy the thing worth Rs. 800000, then you have to create a supply chain, you have to call him for the paintings  I want to talk about things, I want to talk about mud art work, anything, sky's the limit, next time whenever you go, go with your eyes open. Youngsters, even in travel, there is money and happiness in everything and this is a mistake but  What is your focus? Just sitting here now  No, you tell me exactly, hey, next time keep your eyes and ears open, talk to the taxi drivers, sit down, what is here, what is there, what is this, what is that, give Rs. 00 extra to the taxi driver, he will take good things, good, cheap supply chain sir. I take you sir, I take you, I take you from there, then you should have 15 numbers, whichever city you visit, 15 number is of the hotel owner, stay in good hotels, always stay in a good place, only then  There will be a way to earn money where you can save a few paise or a few paise, those are the places where there is some crowd as well and many times while travelling you will meet fellow travellers, I will tell you one small thing and I will finish it with a  Great tip I have learned a lot because of that I travel only in economy class in the plane because there is no business class in the plane and it is very expensive, I do not travel in business class but even in economy class, there is a front seat beyond which there is no seat  There are no seats there is more space like 1a 1b  There is a seat number 1C, okay, the first row in which you can take out the seat and eat something, then you have to pay more money in that, always try to book that seat by paying money because in that the chances of you finding an interesting fellow traveler will be high.  B he too must have paid more money, the person who is ready to pay more money for comfort, you can do something by sitting with him, whoever these money saving people are, avoid them by chirping and screaming in life  When I did the company in a relationship, because that is what you have been taught, this is a good thing, I am not saying here that after taking money, you should start doing this, that those who are doing this in front of the mare, then make a relationship with them, I am like this I am not saying this, I hope you all have enough sense to understand that I am not talking about those who are wasting money, taking away people, doing such things, but those who do not live uselessly, those who understand good things, try to  you should try to be friends with them  Learn from them, try to be sponge around them and do that. I hope you will do these seven things in your life and you will enjoy it. You will get immediate effect. There is also compounding of all these seven things. The effect which will be seen in the first year will be seen in the second year.  The effect of the first year will be the effect of the effect of Chakravarti interest, this is interest and interest by the time, you keep doing following these things in four to five years, you will realize that life is changing, you have not wasted any useless time, if you are taking knowledge on investment Then sell that knowledge brother because nothing is going to happen by just consuming it and the knowledge which cannot be sold and no one is ready to give you any money, now like this is a video, if knowledge is given in the video then it will be known from your likes  From the views and comments, you will get to know what my status was and which one did you like? I had taken a promise from you guys earlier that out of these seven, whichever one turns out to be your favorite, you would say that I had not thought of this one.  From now on I will  So write down their numbers like ten and three and four and two or one and seven, whatever you understand, like the channel and subscribe, inside the comment section you will find some small courses, Jansa wala is very cheap  If you can understand it more, you can take it after looking at the topic, again it is compounding of learning also and it will be very beneficial for you, thank you very much
