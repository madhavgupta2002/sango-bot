Hello friends, the always popular debate rent versus buy will be settled once and for all and you will get clarity from India's number one clarity giver before anyone doubts it, if anyone wants proof that I am the number one clarity giver then today the proof as well  I am going to give a discussion on rent versus buy, we will discuss house property, the youth will get clarity, you will find my two and a half year old video in the comment section, look on YouTube, I cannot make it 0 years old and many people have also seen my video, that two and a half years old, April  There is a video of 21, you can see it in the comment section, I had made a prediction about the property and in two and a half years the same thing has happened and all these fin influences which are increasing are fine, two-four are main in the first few and they also increase rapidly, it is a good thing  Hey, they are spreading all these misconceptions, I will answer them in their seven points, once and for all again because many people are connected to me and say, friend, tell me the answer to this, counter attack, counter action, entire youtube2, it is easy to tell, finance with sharan, he is against the rent  one somebody  There is someone like Sahil, there is someone like Sinha, there is Ankur Warku ji, there is Akshay Srivastava, there are mamma tune changes, I am telling you by name, okay and there are others also, there are financial people, there are many other people, rest you can add the names, 101, these are there along with it  The answer to all those videos of his is that you have clarity, I will tell you very well on seven points, but first of all I will tell them that people are crying after following his advice, those who have been doing it for two and a half years, what all things have gone but still Along with these, I will tell you in points, first of all, a house is not an emotional decision, buying a mutual fund is an emotional decision, buying a house is not an emotional decision, buying a house is a strong decision, I ask you brothers to do a SIP of Rs 10, 20,000 in mutual funds  Sisters, is it an easy thing or a difficult thing or is buying a house a more difficult thing, then of course you will say yes brother buying a house is a difficult thing, of course because SIP is 10 20 30  Make it 40, buying a house is very difficult for anyone, this is the generation that does not want to do difficult things, commitment is not there, even getting married is not easy, but it is difficult, if you give the option of living-in, people will run away from SIP.  Give her the option, she will run away, there is something to be done and if you hear the old stories about its confirmation, then I will unravel each and every thing, I will unravel all the points, the video will be a little long but there are so many videos on this and so much discussion, so many articles, so many  There is discussion on discussion groups, every single thing that they say, every single thing they tell, I will explain it in this way and that and even then I will not say that equity and share market is bad, I am not going to do this versus that. Haryana  They are the ones who eat rasgulla as well as kheer, it is not just one bowl, they eat both the items because this creates a problem of and versus which one is better, so I will tell you the method in that way that doing exercise in life, eating good food, maintaining relationships  Work hard, these are all difficult things  Easy things are their escape routes, so commitment is needed, yes, you know how strong financial discipline becomes, your commitment has started, so now you will work properly and will not break your duty, you know that at the end of it  you will get it and its calculation now the second thing is that you say hey where is your job the second thing of yours will keep changing then will you do it by taking a house do you not know that yours is more important I am in Gurgaon village I have got a job in Gurgaon I have a house  I bought it and I don't have to pay rent. Now if I have to go to Bangalore, this rent will be added to the rent of the house, I will pay rent there. This is my arbitrage, my hedge happened, English, whatever you want to do, do it. Rent was more here, it was less there and here.  It was less there and more there, something happened, something happened there in my inflationary times, it is something like you gave a car to someone here and took someone else's car on rent there and gave it on rent here, like this  Look who told you that  You will never be able to settle for a job and will your home come to the country? Do you need to go for a job if you already have a home? Can't you take the same job in a bigger city? How much percentage jump should you get in the package?  I am for you to leave the city, maybe your wife has a job here, maybe your children are studying in school, maybe your parents have an ecosystem beyond this, and a detailed video can be made that can go out  It is not even necessary, the third thing is the most important, Maths Evolved, I will teach it very simply, I will not tell you any Excel or Fuss, even if you know Maths of fifth or sixth class, you will understand, I will explain it so simply, you always ask, you get 3, you get three, brother, in Gurgaon  So in many places the rental interest is at 4%, but if you say 3, then I will accept 3 for 3 only. I will not use any of my superlatives to prove my point like you people do because your interest rate is always at 10.  They never diminish  Still I will tell you, there is a house worth ₹1, you are getting rent of ₹3 per year, rental is ok, very nice, then you should not buy it, okay this is the story, yes you should not buy it because you will get this much there, you will get this much here  You will get this much, the story is oh brother, in 7 to 9 years that thing worth ₹1 becomes worth 200 and that rent becomes of ₹ but the rent of ₹ after 8 years and 9 years then tell the story that brother there is a house worth ₹2000000  The rent is ₹ 3 only but should it not be taken, yes we should not take it, you told it well, then another 89 years of time passes, a thing worth ₹ 200 becomes ₹ 400, a thing worth ₹ 200 will become ₹ 400 and the rent which was ₹ becomes ₹ 1  Now the ₹ is gone and there is 400% again brother, how should you take it, you should see this now  They will say that if something has doubled in 16 years, then this is not a return on 10 or 12. Hey, count the rental also, that is 3, so count the starting price of 3.25, 3.54, that too is big for the person who bought the original.  He bought it for 6 rupees and it became 12 rupees, no no, that is at today's price, oh brother, today he bought a flat in Janakpuri in 1988-89 for Rs. 1 lakh, its annual rent comes to 45 lakh, so his rental is 175 rupees  D is there no no no we will not calculate like this it is worth one and a half crore today so I will do it for today this is just psychology this is all this is just an illusion of maths because any person thinks for 30 years no wealth creation real estate is for wealth creation this  You are in this pursuit of income and that one Sinha who sells it like this in Bihar, you sell it, why sell it, sell the property  What will you do then, go and visit Switzerland. You have bought a good flat from Manwan Construction, it has a life of 100 and a quarter years, you have bought it, it is running well, it is giving good rent, why do you want to sell it, it is all about cash, are you using ITC?  The shares which you have bought at cheap rates, whose dividend is due for you today at 15, those which were bought at your rate, let's say today's dividend is at 4, then what will you do by selling them, NHPC, you had raised it at 12144, if today its dividend is 3  It is at 4, it is at 5 for you, so it is at 20, why should you sell it, it is held there for 20 years to get returns from mutual funds and share market, people want returns from real estate in 3 years and 2 years to get real estate Why don't you calculate it for 20 years? This maths which is evolved is very bad and there is a simple thing in this maths which is called leverage in English. Today you have to watch this complete video and forward it to people because  This debate should be settled somewhere. I am saying it again and again on every point that equity and mutual fund are extremely great things but it does not mean that real estate has become bad. It is not necessary for something to be bad for something to be good and both  I will tell you at the end how to use it and I will tell you one very big advantage, I will tell you two advantages which till date no one has even mentioned in the discussion because arguments are there in peer groups, they are there everywhere, okay so  Leverage Leverage If I buy a real estate by taking a loan of 90% by paying a down payment of 10% and it increases by 10%, then I get 10% i.e. ₹10 lakh if ​​I want to invest in the stock market.  So where is the leverage? Leverage in futures option is 10, 15, 20 days settlement expiry, you can make a little profit in it or you can also get completely ruined in it and you should not do that, you guys know that otherwise if on delivery based basis  You are buying mutual fund units, you are buying your shares, if you are buying it for 1 lakh, then you are buying it for 1 lakh only, even if it gives 100% return, then it is only on 1 lakh, you cannot do it like this with the bank Go to any reputed bank and tell that bank that I want to buy a property, it will give you a loan for the property at 80, 85, 90 and tell that bank that I want to buy shares of your bank, give me a loan, see how much loan it gives, ask it  They have the power to ask about the shares of their banks which they are running on their own, go and ask these equity guys, there is one Kamat ji who runs this Zerodha, if you go to him again and again, he will always set his cut, I am an MPI guy also  I am an ARN, you can mistake me, we do all the things, 70-80 percent of the work, take everything, this as well, this as well, today I am doing education, there are a lot of advertisements of your financial products in the mainstream media, so someone  The real estate guy doesn't come and tell me Story: His goods are selling as usual, there is a fire, he says leave it, let them say whatever they say, it is okay, collect the mutual funds, you will buy a house in 20 years, otherwise what will you do with him brother 22 2  If you do not buy mutual funds in 24 years, then they tell you to buy the same house in 40-42 years, no, buy that, then you can buy it later and even your father will not be able to buy it, your child will not be able to buy it in the family of the city  Then go inside and stay 40 kilometers away, yes you can take it outside, it is open, they have ruined you people and no one can say anything against them because see where the two years of rate and rent went and the property went but today  If you ask them about the rent, the rent has increased by almost 60-70% in the last two years, check anywhere in big cities and the property price has also increased by the same amount, so the rental amount is still the same, brother, if the numeration has increased, the denominator has also increased, so the number Denominate  The answer is the same, so the logic which they had for two years, see, that logic will always remain the same, look at the graph, the graph will keep moving like this, the numerator will increase, the denominator will increase, their logic will remain the same, among them there are Kamra ji or one or two, they would say that I am a real estate  I do it, I share the knowledge with you that you people should do this, with your own money which I earn, by taking all the courses and all the knowledge, I buy real estate myself, if someone says this, I am sad about it, I have respect for them, I only say clear cut things, so this is the lesson  Okay brother, I will tell you further, the fourth thing is fear, hey, you will not get it, it is under construction, it got ruined, it got ruined in Noida, firstly Noida Greater Noida has created fear of real estate in entire India, no one has any uncle, maternal uncle or paternal uncle, if you are in North  If you are an Indian or any relative who is not trapped in Greater Nada, but you tell me that we cannot compare real estate with equity. If you are buying penny stocks, if you are playing futures options, if you are buying random things, then your money is invested in the stock market.  You also get trapped in it and get ruined. You bought Asian Paints in the stock market. Okay, you bought Hindustan You bought Unilever, where did you incur the loss, tell me when did it happen, now you will buy speculative stocks of poor quality builders and such penny stocks, every time you will give examples of poor quality ones in your real estate and your brothers are getting ruined in the stock market  People are getting ruined in real estate as well, people are becoming very rich in real estate, people are getting rich in stock market as well, people are getting rich in both the places, who said that it means show it selectively here, there is inside cow, by shining and that too this  He runs a fund mand, okay he is saying that my mother's tenant has not paid the rent, so the real estate is bad, that means if any unruly person issues your corporate governance, you can take Dewan Housing Finance Limited or Allen FS.  Look, these stocks which have been ruined at some time, not just one but thousands of companies have gone down by thousands of crores, then that is bound to happen, if you did not do your due diligence and the tenant did this, then you should have seen that there is a problem in Gurgaon.  that this boy and girl live in  They do not last, the tenants leave within eight months, that means it is difficult to take out and keep them, so everything is happening here as well, there is an example, if you are a fund manager, there will be this problem in your mother's house, then now you can invest your liquidity  We will keep it because liquidity is very important, liquidity is very important, by making such money first of all the person who invests liquid money in the share market does not earn any money, the money which remains lying in the market for 10-15-20 years is the one who will earn, this nugget has come out, nugget has come out, nugget has come out This target has come out, this target that all these do cos are there, no, no, to earn money, they themselves told me that the market has gone up, now get out, now put it in, now get out, now its target, now its target, hey, is it a good stock, good company, let's go.  It is increasing at 12 15 20, keep lying in it, put this target and get out, you have to earn brokerage only, you have to earn brokerage only, tell me one thing, I ask the mutual fund people, you are a mutual fund, one guy invested money in you  every year you  You take it at Rs. 2 after the fund management expenses, it's okay, you take the expenses yourself, okay, if someone invests in property, someone gets him a house, then he takes brokerage at Rs. 1, does he take it at Rs. 2 every year and if you invest Rs. 100  If the mutual fund has made it 96, then money will be invested even on 96, if it is made 110, then money will be invested on that too, you always have to earn money, so the direct way for you to earn money is to always put that money here, always put it here, you have to tell the story  it is that brother always keep this always keep this then you will earn money because only when there is always money then only you will earn money you are understanding you are understanding that when the money remains lying under any pretext then because I have to keep taking out 2 rupees from it always  You have to keep taking out the money from inside the house, someone is taking out your house like this, you have bought the plot, bought the house, built the house, done something, who is taking out the money from that, if I get you a house and come every year, knock knock sir  2 but why give it to me? Hey, last year he didn't get me a house, you could have given it to me if I had asked.  I had given it last time, did n't I say that I will give it this year as well sir, it is always a must to give, once you got me a house worth one crore, now it has become worth 1 crore 20 lakhs, your house is still being built and next year when the amount increases further, then it will happen  Even if it decreases I will come, I will come every year sir you understand I am not talking much at all I am giving examples rent can also be invested in mutual funds once the asset becomes yours let's move ahead okay this is the benefit which  I am going to tell you that no one would have ever told you how to buy a house quickly, when you buy a house quickly, how can you buy it in 23, 24, 25, 23, 24, you don't have the money, I will teach you that too, inside the comment section, you will find my real estate telegram group  If you do not join, I also have my real estate channel, you should subscribe to that too, I teach these things and bring live opportunities, there is no need to spend in the wedding, neither the girl's family nor the boy's family has spent half the money on the flat, 50, 60, 70 lakhs  all in the wedding  Look how much they spend, they buy such expensive jewellery, they keep it in a locker or in the mother-in-law's cupboard, everything can be bought if there is intention, and if there is no intention, the children will buy it, we have just done everything, many people should take advice  People are saying thank you to those who bought it for their children, now the child cannot buy a house when he is in college, he has to play SIP when he gets a job but if you have bought it for him or have bought it earlier, then You just gave him support, then took a loan from him and transferred the property in his name, but you kept the handkerchief first and the property increased by 203 lakhs and your child or your family got the benefit of it, but this as a family is not a thing  I am not doing the thought process, 40 to 50 percent of people are busy playing mutual funds. 2 lakh, 4 lakh and 5 lakh and they sit everyday and watch their money control pay and post, portfolio increased, decreased, increased, decreased and this financial money is being consumed.  They keep doing it all the time because that porn is being consumed by the youth  Youngsters, teens, early 20s, 40s, men are making financial pawns. It has increased or decreased repeatedly. Yes, buying a house is a confirmation bias. You cannot buy a house. You don't want to buy it. You do n't have money. Whatever the logic is, you will listen to them. Counterview  It will be painful to listen, so I am just telling all the counter points, there is one more aspect which I want to tell, the sixth aspect is a great relief for the wife, the wife will never tell you hey husband you can leave because he is 40 years old and he is 42  The 37 rupee note has dripped, he has gone to the gym, the boss is giving him stress, what will I do with your mutual fund portfolio, 12 lakh, 20 lakh, 30 lakh, 50 lakh, is there anyone among you who has not bought a house and his mutual fund and  The stock market portfolio has become worth Rs. 2.5 crores, it is very rare, it is very rare, they are earning a lot of money, it is very easy for them, it is very easy for Kamat ji, now you have a company worth thousands of crores, you have to take it home  You can live anywhere you want, you will show this to prove your point that story I believe in this story but you have your own house, a nice big one, where all the family members live, no one tells you this 121 141 161 Stock brokers have single storey houses and all the promoters of these big companies also buy their own houses when they sell shares. You can be one of the biggest promoters of big companies.  I'm just forgetting that there are 100 houses in the US, 100 houses Sibu, Sibu, I think the name Sibu is if I'm not sure, they kept selling their shares because the stock did not rise for long, they know the company from within, what to do with whom  He bought his own stocks, okay, it will be a great relief for the wife, the biggest relief in the family too is the house, it is not an emotional decision for her, when you take an insurance policy, term insurance, is buying term insurance an emotional decision you Answer and it is a practical decision because unfortunately cases come to me, they bring demat, they come but that is not there, my husband had invested in 100 places, he does not have a house, which one to sell, where to sell, some are lying in demat form  Some have hard copies, some are missing, some are here, there are 10 bank accounts, they have created a mess and that house is not there, then the last point is the most important point, the seventh point, today brother, marriage is not happening without a house, so people say why to get married  Yes, if you don't want to do it then people in mutual funds are not getting married without a home, today I am talking about the middle class, I am talking about the upper middle class, they are saying that brother we should have a home somewhere, where will our daughter go home  If not, then the person who has been working for 10 years is saying that he is doing mutual funds and neither the mutual funds are visible nor the house is visible, the house is security, the house is safety, the house is everything and the one who took the house in 23, 24, 25 years  He took the loan at the age of 35  After becoming free and the owner of the house, you can show your eyes to the boss at work. Are you sitting scared of the boss? Why are you most scared of the job at 40? Of getting fired from the job because you do n't have a house yet because of that mutual fund. You are sitting with Rs 30-40 lakh and you know that you are not getting anywhere with it, and you got fired from the job, then you know that at this age you may not get it again and this is your helplessness that is being exploited because you are following  Some advice why you can't make multiple properties when multiple properties yes I had made one with Robert Gayo Saki that was a big hit but I will tell you exactly that the one with Robert Osaki does very fast churning in the US but in India also the cycle is a little  Even after growing up, how can you make 4-5 properties in 20 years? If you want that video, I will make it in future so that they get a reply and those property experts will invest it in mutual funds. Just imagine that in 1988 in Janakpuri, if someone  Brothers and sisters, he took a loan and put Rs. 50,000 in it. The loan gets repaid in six to seven to six years. Every time they do the calculation for 20 years and show it to you. Take the data of any bank from hdfcfund.com. Get almost all you can  Go for another property by using leverage and it can happen in India. I will explain it in a different way, you should understand this thing once and for all. Please read the real story, it will be in a link, subscribe to that channel. You will see it very soon, next weekend only.  Meaning whenever you are watching this video, within a week within a week I will bring that thing for you, within in one week I will bring it live that brother here is your financial planner on 6 7, they say high percentage on 3 and money  Yours will also go in three to four years. Cheap property in top location of top builder in every respect and rental at Rs. 6-7, you are cash flow positive on day one. Here the property increases your cash flow positive, leverage is also not too high and loan also  Very  Not much and then again you can go for property, I will give a live example, what is the point of people coming and speaking like this by giving this arbitrary example because what is the problem, they are in finance, only in finance, so they get that thing  Speaker brother why not everything, why can't you just imagine if the person in Janakpuri, which I am repeatedly taking as an example, the DDA flat in Janakpur, when he repaid his loan up to Rs 9596 in a year, then if he started getting that much rent  Brothers and sisters, if he had started investing in mutual funds and would have been investing till date, then in 2023, not only this, he has taken capital appreciation of the flat which may have been stagnating for 5 years because it has become old, but his mutual fund  Think about the level to which the fund money must have reached by investing in SIP. Why don't you do this exercise on Excel that in 96 its rent was 000, then it became three to four today  Suppose the rent is Rs. 35,000 to Rs. 40,000, so if I assume the average rent of Rs. 22,000 in the formula and put the return of Rs. 12 in your mutual fund, then it will be Rs. 12,000. Now see how much is there in the market and it will always come because you have generated income in the long term, but who thinks so much like this, who will think for 25 years, you are 25 years old, I will tell you this here, 5000, 7000 crores will come, crores have got no inflation  What will go where, it has no meaning, if someone had told you in 96 that it would be 23 crores per crore, I do n't know what you would have thought and today see what has happened, so this is what is the message to you, please subscribe to this channel and subscribe to real estate.  Do this which is my pure real estate channel where in I bring opportunity in top seven cities of the country top seven shares you know  Which country has real time real estate opportunities in it, I bring you that real estate telegram group, you can join it and that video which I mentioned in the beginning, whoever doubts that I call myself Clarity One and I am not that when you You will have to spend time watching that video because you have a doubt that I am not number one, I told you that if you don't have any doubt then don't watch it, but if you do then you want to watch me, you have explained it in such a lovely way, with so many examples.  Yes and the same thing of play out of demand supply which I had explained with such a nice example, so I will do my own clapping, you also do my clapping yourself, I am doing it with proof and you should watch this video today also, how will it happen in future if  Brothers and sisters, you want a prediction for the next two and a half years like I did in that because the situation has changed now, but what is the future outlook for the next two and a half years, then I will make a video again but for that you have to give me a little respect and honour.  come on we need it come on that song  Again, you will have to give a little feeling of a rockstar, I will have to give some feeling, increase the likes and give the feeling that I want Guruji, I want the counter attack, it was very good, what kind of a counter attack was it, so put it in like this, the adrenaline increases a bit, hey, due to dopamine, everything will rot  If it happens, okay then get it done, tell me all the examples that I gave, it is wrong, during Covid, the tenants had come to know the reality, they were sitting with 50, 60, 70, 80 lakhs, that is why this real estate also ran away because now this was an emotional decision, emotions happen.  My wife told me that the tenants would have to be Covid positive if they even entered inside. The treatment of the house owner was different in the society during Covid and that of the tenants was different and the tenants were not so poor. I am giving you the example of a society in Gurgaon. I am a good salary, three, three, four lakhs, two and a half, three, four lakhs, this much salary is normal in Gurgaon and give them treatment, got was ask them only after that like  Hey, Covid has come, we are the first one to book, so this pattern should be real, you should know everything, life design assist on Excel, I say it again and again, there is no benefit in Excel, you can only see the cash flow in Excel, you can do the analysis of the company  Discounted cash flow and all that happens. You cannot guess anything here. Life is a cricket match. The run rate can be anywhere. It can be 120 or 180 or even 350.  So I hope you guys will share this and like it, thank you very much
