Hello friends, this is a very important topic, you should not disclose your income, you may also have this, you may also have asked someone or you may also have been asked, please write your ID in the comment area, ID means there is such a thing to identify you And what happens many times is that it happens on our own, there is no push to tell us, so the rule for both the things is that you should not disclose your income, you have to pay it to the government, you have to pay tax to the government.  So I am telling you the reason why this has to be done. Okay, now I will not do too many such shoes and old things and all this in it because it is youth on clarity, the channel is different, I will tell you from a different perspective, so you should understand, the moment you disclose it to anybody people Bill slot you give a little always judging and give bill hit some comment or put you decorate if there will be more income then del expect something and you bill definitely every something hey this much income is there in the room he is driving in this car hey he is doing so much  he is wearing such clothes hey he is doing so much your children are doing it in school the world will increase your expenses by talking so much you will not understand it yourself and I see this problem when I give my financial consultations to people or who  I have seen his portfolio management, such expenses have been incurred in it, today take the medical council, today take the astrology, today Vetiver I do so I think when I go inside the kurta then it comes out that means they are light aqua so much  So what you have to do is that if I have a package of 20 lakhs then it is not like that brother, your package of 20 lakhs is more than that, check the tax in it, see how much is the variable income, see how much is it, you also do not get 100% because your target is meet  It is not there and it actually counts it under CTC but check how much is going into your account in the bank, it got deducted there, it got deducted here, it got deducted there, let us think of our income of 20 lakhs that an income of 20 lakhs means 1  Lakh 70  It has already become thousand so you are maintaining the expenses that way because first you told the people that well tell your wife that the dog is more than the wife now if you do not want to tell your wife about the income then tell whatever you have got in hand, if you don't even give enough to your own wife Tell me what I am saying friend one should not lie to one's wife friend many times tell him every man should save a part of your salary for his wife that if your salary is this much then her salary is this much only that is why it is matching  Indians want to know everyone's salary or income, that mine is this much, his is this much, if his income is less than mine and his children go to school, then mine will also go, if you are understanding then now this can happen inside his circle I am spending on the school, apart from this he neither goes out for a walk nor does he do Zoma Tomato nor does he do anything else, he neither goes out for a walk nor does he do anything else, he does one thing, you took care of the school, you took care of the child, we took care of his car, we took care of his clothes, all of them  You are doing some of your programs and then you think that friend what has happened to me because you have done your own Because in moment you oil ur income you are big and everybody bill want your income you open n bank account or open demat account you buy property you do anything everybody bill from 5 to 10 lakh 10 to 15 to 20 to 25 and many times what  It happens when you start earning more money and start earning new money, then how do you get your self- steam, which happens, I have been witness to the emotions that you go through, okay, through various things, that is called friend, 3 lakh rupees there  Give me the money, I am late, he is asking for 3 lakhs, someone is asking for 2 lakhs, now you do n't have the money to pay for the notes debt, you do n't have any money to pay because the notes debt were not useful to you, but you are investing them for useful purposes. You have arranged your income schemes with the intention that this will be mine, I want to buy a flat, buy a plot, I want to buy property, this is my school, this is my code, I want to study as per my wish, in this way you should make him a human being.  For  You don't have Rs 3 lakh to spare and the person who is asking for Rs 3 lakh could be someone close to you, could be a friend, could be a relative, could be anything, but if you have done so much wrong then he will  Then what were you going through, you are in the bill, you are on trap, if someone asks you about your salary, tell me, I am managing, don't ever answer in a straight forward manner, no, still how much work do you take, how many children do you take, ok, you tell me this, human being, okay  And that is a shirt worth ₹5000, see, I am saving ₹1200 from it, so I bought a shirt worth ₹3800 for 1200, which is worth ₹5000, so you tell me the income of 1200, dog, what did you get from that to me for ₹4000 So 250 now you have not done any calculation that what is income tax, what is GST, what is the rent of the shop, if there is sales going on then what is the net amount, that is your shortfall and it is giving you times when you have lost  If it happens then it means whether it is your job or your business or anything else because he is driving a taxi, how many children he has, oh I did not know how many children he has, I ask you people this simple thing, you deposit money in the demat account  You invest money in mutual funds on your own. If I ask you for returns, no one can calculate and give it to you. It becomes so tricky. When was Dell, when was Capital, now it is Reliance, it is nominal. At the moment I will sell the bill, then I will have to pay 10% of Maraco Capital.  You will need that ₹1. I have tried some of the best apps, I have to check their algorithms, they fail, they fail, it makes my brain go crazy in calculating my own returns, I invested ₹1 lakh and it returned 3 lakh in three years.  If this return becomes lakhs, then you can calculate it very easily. This is the formula of P*R*T. This is the formula of 1 + R to the power of N and you can calculate the formula of its component. But my brother, sometimes you put in, sometimes you take out, sometimes you book a loss and sometimes you make a profit.  Sometimes I booked and then put in a new one, sometimes I put in more and sometimes I put in less  Have you ever taken out a fan, it makes your mind go crazy, give it to yourself, this is the fact of life, calculate your own income, this note is this, if you are earning more, give something, a rough estimate is relief and here I am going to make a lot, let me make it in a separate video, but I will tell you this  I am telling you that please do not disclose your income to anyone, keep it to yourself, whoever asks, tell me that you are managing, he will say no no, we are getting to know a little more, still we want to know, so give a figure which is the actual figure  Whatever welcome you got of him, if you see any fibers, many people have a habit of keeping guns on the garden, relatives and acquaintances, they give guns as Rakhi, what kind of feeling did you get from here that I, that Gabbar, kept it with Kalia and if it will go on, then I have to tell you now.  So brother, the amount that has come to you after deducting your cut, tell me it is ₹ 200 less than that in your actual hand, ok it is that much, then in the next comment I thought it was this much or if it is this much then why don't you do it like this, then lie down that, then this  Why don't you lie down, this is a big bed habit of us Indians This is for Indians, in other countries this thing is considered very big and if you don't tell it, you will be directly asked how many you are, whether you are getting married or not, you will always have to tell because the girl is coming to you, you will have to tell that  She started asking about Form 16, she should also ask about ITR, these are the situations, you will have to show the allotment letter as well, you have booked the story to show yourself after 3 years that yes I am a very eligible bachelor, this situation is different because there  Relationships are being formed by your birth but other distance is that now the people who are in government jobs have relief idea of ​​salary, in private jobs it does a little variation so don't worry about telling this people that I have not taken any package at home People are ready to tell everyone what is the package, CTC and what is the actual package, so my request to the audience is that they should have the confidence to not tell and they should not keep jumping around and asking questions, then brother, that will rock.  can you have any of your  The business went well, the training went well, you tell him, the next guy will start extrapolating and say that if your brother scored 80 runs in 10 overs, he will definitely score 400 in 50 overs, who knows he might get allotted at 180, you are also thinking that I will score 400.  I will take it, he is also thinking that if you get allotted on 180 then he should check his expectations, after coming home he told his father that I will get 99 or 100, then when I get 92 also, thoughts like decent marks D day after tomorrow note this, you are very happy then  Tell me whether you will get a score in 90, the paper went well but you cannot know much, then when you get 92 it seems like a good number, then he says yes it is okay, so these are important human emotions and psychology, understand it and please do not tell him anything else about it And give me two shares front table, is that okay or tell me yours, it's a simple thing, what is happening, if the person is intelligent he will get the hint and if he is a fool he will get the hint  If I don't find it, I'll open it and tell you, okay
