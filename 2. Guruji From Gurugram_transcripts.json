    "title": "02 Amazing Ideas For Modi Ji To Implement [kdSJLcF_v7c].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, this is a video, if Modi ji can listen to it, so that the message can reach there, give two advices or opinions or suggestions or requests or ideas for our respected Prime Minister, you can put them in any form you want, whatever I would like to give, I would like to our respected Modi  Yes, this time announce it on 15th August and let it happen. If I were in Modi ji's place, I would have done this depending on the circumstances. Now let's talk about the circumstances first because before giving advice we first see that  Where are the circumstances right now, politics will also evolve in this, economics will also evolve a bit, everything will happen, suddenly I am getting such a feeling, you are also getting this feeling and if you have this feeling then tell me that somewhere 240  The narrative is shifting after coming to power, isn't it? The opposition is asking more questions, bridges are falling, the atmosphere is a bit neat, I would say that some game of luck is also going on, it is too much, and there is a lot of negativity in the parliament.  Even within the government, the opposition has had the upper hand, it seems as if there is no point in saying that if we take the example of India, Pakistan, India or any other cricket team, then the Indian batsmen are Indian batsmen and if the Indian batsmen are from BJP, then the bouncers are not scoring runs. This is not happening, if this is happening then on 15th August you should think that power play is coming, it is okay, there is a chance, this is a chance to hit sixes, like Dhoni ji, Modi ji can do a few two things, if he does this, this is my wish  This is my wish, from two I can go to two and a half and even three and I want that the announcement should be done first and even after that whatever happens should be told quickly and it can happen like this, I will make some predictions as well, that is my wish.  No, it is okay but I feel that this can be done, I will tell you first and then I will make predictions, see, it is so accurate and so many people say that no, the prediction is made by an astrologer, brother, the prediction is correct that it happens from within, so  I will also make a prediction, if it is wrong  Even then there will be advice for getting whipped. If you people feel that I do n't know what I asked for, even then people will get whipped. At the cost of you knowing getting trolled, I will still muster courage and tell this to our respected Prime Minister two things, the first thing is Universal Income Scheme. Announcement for Indians, everybody will be shocked, but once a start is made, these farmers have invested in 10,000 schemes, all of this will save money, fiscal deficit will increase, hey Keynes is an economist, brother, you will have to do it, if you do it, the economy will kick start.  I should give it to women only, do not give it to men otherwise they will smoke beedis, cigarettes and drink alcohol, that is fine, so some such scheme which makes big money, there should be an open announcement like this, Pakistan, US outside, I think we should not talk about all this This time let's talk about India, it's enough, it's been done 10 times, what head gear will he wear, what will he wear, what will he wear, what will be his language, I will analyse that, I am going all in for Modi ji that I  I want to become a devotee of Modi ji by telling him this on 16th August, but if I tell you two-three more things, I am also telling you another thing, first thing do this, second thing do something related to this regarding the house, make an announcement that everyone will get a house. Where will we get the houses, it will be seen, announce them, this housing scheme, this housing scheme, it is not like this, a big announcement is needed, brothers and sisters in India, there will not be a single person who will not have food, clothes, house after two years, this government  By making such a promise and making a big announcement, someone will say Jumla, hey brother we need some Jumla, make such an announcement from the Red Fort that it reaches America and the whole country becomes like this, now you will say that nothing has been given to the middle class in this, hey brother middle class  The one who is a Shaini will earn, he will earn by taking shares of Ultra Tex Cement, he will earn by taking shares of Kajaria Tile, he will earn by taking shares of Housing Finance Companies, he is in the middle class, if he wants it completely in his pocket then he is not middle class, he is in the lower class  class because there is a definition in the middle class  There are classes for the brain as well, it is also done according to IQ, when there will be such a kick start in the economy, then it will be visible, the system will be visible, then I will tell you two universal things and two and a half thing as well, then I have to make predictions further as well, this is an interesting video, make this  It is a lot of fun to stay here, 15th August is coming, the season of Tohar is coming, the atmosphere is getting good, this energy of the country is also there, the change of 15th August will happen right now, this energy of the month of Shravan was different then  When the second one comes, I am telling you according to astrology, it will be fun, okay everyone who is coming should pay attention then let us listen to two things, firstly there should be a big announcement, a grand announcement should be made like this, meaning the opposition should not be left like this, what has happened to Modi ji again Tata three because they are saying this is happening here down below and the devotees here are already sad but the other people who were also there, they were not enjoying saying this, this is what they wanted, Rahul ji give them the khatkhat and home with a bang  Give it, you will have to give it, but you cannot give jobs because what is there in jobs, jobs will come from economic activity, if you do these two things, the economy will grow very strongly, if you want to do something on income tax, then you can do that, if anyone  If you want to make a big announcement then you can do that. I am giving you the third choice. The fourth thing is Agniveer after a day or two. Please make it seven or ten years or back it off a bit. This is not bowing down. This is not losing. This is accepting.  yes your stature increases, when father listens to someone in the house, then his stature increases, I am not asking you to listen to everyone, I am not asking you to reduce the strictness also, I am not asking you to reduce the discipline also, but many times Listen, but don't listen to everything because when they listen after writing on the wall, they listen like a pit and then they cannot be believed, the last video that I made recently, the government had made some improvements in the indexation of cost, that this  You people must be interested, what is this, what is this, what is our  Also the middle class had to take a beating because they are the ones who are roaming around with most of the property, so now that it has been done right, it is a good thing, so now let's talk about this diction and I am telling people what I feel a little bit.  You may not like it, but I feel that you are talking about politics, this is not my demand, this is not my demand, I feel that on 15th August, some such schemes, all these are theories, everything can be wrong, I have no idea.  There is no source, it is okay that I am speaking on the basis of the source, I am speaking this on the basis of my conscience that by making some great announcements, by making very great announcements, this kind of atmosphere can be created, good elections are coming  They are winning in Haryana, Maharashtra, Jharkhand and out of them I am saying that it is minimum necessary for BJP to win two elections, it may win Jharkhand and I can see both Maharashtra and Haryana losing today, this is not my wish  I am telling you, I am a political commentator, what do you want from me?  I am giving you an advice that if Jharkhand is removed, then if Maharashtra loses and Haryana also loses, then a huge atmosphere will shift in the other direction. It is very important for one of Haryana and Maharashtra to win. I don't know which one will win. I don't know if both win.  It is also looking tight, it is looking very tight but an atmosphere has to be created from here and a third thing can happen, you will get some system window to remove Yogi ji only in September, hey why are you trying to remove him, why do I want to remove him, I want  I have been the Chief Minister of UP, Yogi ji should remain for 50 years or 20 years, I don't know how many years he can remain, what problem do I have, what problem do I have, he is doing good work but such an atmosphere is being created, what is being created about him  I do n't know if there are political compulsions, so this is Modi ji's window, Amit Shah ji, this is Modi ji's window to create an atmosphere of big announcements on the 15th and from 25th-30th August to 15th September, OBC leaders or any other leader like I  Don't have any fun, Maurya ji or someone else is doing some equation, caste equation, this is a difficult time  it has to be done but now listen carefully to what happens after this, I have told you this story but I also make another prediction, I made this one like this, I make another prediction, if the speech on 15th August will be vague or normal that we have given women  It has been given, this has happened, earlier it was like this in our country, now it has become like this and the country has to do a lot of power, and the normal speech that you understand what a normal speech is, this is not some extraordinary announcement, the rest  There will be some speech or the other for an hour, if it is just a normal speech, it's fine, and nothing great looks or happens like this, and after that, there's no feel-good factor till the evening that it's the 11th, 11th, 11th Independence Day, PM.  For Modi ji, it will seem that this is how it is, then after that speech of mine, there will be another prediction, then if not this one, I feel this should be done, should happen, but if that does not happen then  I will make one more prediction, what is it and after that we should become very clear, it will become very clear and I will analyse my speech, in the speech there is an analysis of body language, the content of speaking and what head gear is he wearing Where is one looking, what is the sentiment and how loudly it is said, how much enthusiasm is there in doing this, all of that is also analysed, yes brothers and sisters, like right now no one is saying Jai Shri Ram, so it is becoming clear that  Some energy levels have gone out from somewhere, otherwise it should have been done, it has always been done, I do n't know why it is not being done in my video, every time I feel like saying Jai Shri Ram, we should say it earlier Earlier, everyone used to say, used to listen, no one used to say or listen, so I had promised that in almost every video, whatever be the reason, Jai Shri Ram should be said once, you guys also write Jai Shri Ram everyone  Because friend, we never had any selfish relationship with Shri Ram ji, we have an emotional connect with him even today and earlier also  It was there even when these people used to speak, these people do not speak, it is there even now and it will remain even if these people start speaking again or it will remain even if they do not speak, this is the common public, this is the idol, this is the idol, so the speech can be given later.  It will also be analyzed, but I want that it is something like that, if the lion is a lion, then a feeling like that should also come, a feeling like this should come, something like this should come, if it has not come due to some reason then  That means now some more forces have come, there are some more compulsions, forces I mean forces from within the party and the country, do not force them, okay, if those forces are like this, then that speech is something which I am very very looking forward to the speech on 15th August When Modi ji's election comes, you all must watch it and try to analyse it. I will also try to analyse it according to my understanding. Something big should happen because right now the cornering has become very strong. Every BJP worker is watching with disappointment.  it is modi  Amit Shah ji cannot give a speech to Modi ji and Amit Shah ji, Modi ji has to speak but both of them are batsmen, you can think of it as Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma are the Indian cricket team, if BJP is the Indian cricket team then it is fine, although Amit Shah  G's son is running Indian cricket, according to me, he is running it well, people keep talking about nepotism and all this, but it is okay, the country is earning money, BCCI is earning, the World Cup has been won, there is transparency as well as the cricket team  If the change is happening with a big mind, then I am not interested in cricket, however, it is good if attention is given to other sports as well. So, we are looking forward for Modi ji to do something like Dhoni ji scored 15 runs, 16 runs, 17 runs in the last over.  If you want then do something like that, if you are looking for excitement for this, the morale of BJP workers is down and Modi ji says that should come all guns blazing, that is that opportunity, there is no bigger platform than Red Fort brother.  There is no platform above, in this country the Prime Minister is a very top leader  He speaks in the Parliament, he speaks in rallies, he speaks everywhere and also speaks his Mann ki Baat, but brother, the Red Fort is the Red Fort, the Red Fort and on top of it, the Indian flag is fluttering, the atmosphere that it creates is different.  The atmosphere is there, you can say anything at that time, at other times we can think that this is what BJP leaders are saying, at least they are saying this for their party, they are doing this, they are doing that  But when the whole world listens to the Prime Minister of India from the Red Fort and India too listens to its Prime Minister and it means Happy Birthday, then this time it is my wish that the head of the country should do something big and good on the Happy Birthday of the country.  He has given two advices that it should be big and he should not talk about economics right now, the economics is not that bad, it is not that bad and he will have to do anything less than some big ticket announcement, some such announcement, he will not do that small thing.  Now it will not be possible to sing about what has happened, that we did it this way, whatever we did it that way  So the country has formed the government for the third time, so I don't want to talk about it. Whether Modi ji's speech writer is listening or someone else is listening, the focus is on what you have to do. I will take complete notes as per the time.  I will do it, if there is a 60 minute speech, then how much time is given on what is to be done and how much time is given on what has to be done, that India was like this, it was like that and we did this and that, if there is more discussion on this  So brother then it is not okay, a 60 minute speech should and you should, I have one more request to the speech writer and whoever is listening brother don't talk about 2047, don't talk about 22 years, 23 years later so that this doesn't happen.  Talking about the year ahead, every year Independence Day comes, the next year will come, the next year will come, the year after that will come, so brother, talk about one year, whether this will happen or cross the limit, talk about 2 years, talk about 2 years  Let's talk about this 20-22 year old thing.  Means all this becomes a matter of showing dreams, this should not happen, that should not happen, in the morning the husband is sitting in front of the wife, it should not happen that kheer gets prepared and malpua also gets prepared and it is raining then with some paneer  Even onion pakodas should not be made, it should not happen, you should make it, it should not happen, so that thing seems like this should not happen, it is a request program, it means you cannot come and say like this,  It should happen that they are going to do it, the poor housewife will never be able to say anything, whom will she tell, it is she who has to do it, okay so sometimes the wife says that it should not happen that you cook the food today, she said this is never going to happen, okay so I hope my  There is a very deep feeling inside that the enthusiasm should remain high and it is the job of elders to keep the enthusiasm high and it is only those in power who let their morale down, so people like us, all the creators who come and try to do it.  That guess is ok so let's try to do this so you guys also write that  Yes we want this something should happen and there will be benefits. It is not possible that when the eco system goes up, it is not that there will be no benefits. There will be benefits. Yes, those who use their brains benefit more and the economy of the country becomes very good.  According to me, it will do it and all guns should be blazing, the entire cement sector, steel sector, everything will run on efficiency at 100-25, everything is being built completely, that old and new era, it is a picture, not a story that we Indians do not write, we have such a feeling  It should come, such a one should come and only this can be got by us brother because the biggest person who does the work and tells is the prime minister and who else will do the opposition above him so to find out the mistakes and to check the question paper, the person who checks the question paper  He can check, he can give the number, it is his job, he should definitely do it, but he cannot do it on the ground because he is sitting in the opposition, he is the one who will do it, do it, after this the opposition will be left speechless, what will they say, we were harassing you  You did it before us, it is a good thing, do it, build houses, give it to the economy, so according to me this should happen, it will look very nice, I hope something happens brother, it should not become like Ty Ty Fish, okay, there were some good things in the budget. In this budget, it was not explained to the people but they could not understand it and people feel that if it comes in my pocket then it is good money, money comes indirectly also, if it is good for the intelligent people then so did I because the popular sentiment was against the budget  I told him that it is an okay budget, it is not great but it is not bad either, even now I am saying that the budget is not bad at all, it is not very great but it is not bad either, it could have been bad and as bad as it is being said.  It is definitely not that bad but who will explain it to them because the views come in this way, Lallan top people put up anything like this, if this happens to them then people will come and see it because Indians like to indulge in self-pity. that something is happening with us, okay so move towards positivity and positivity  Making demands is never easy. Everyone in the family is sitting together crying. Play a nice song. It sounds great and important and after that everyone's mood becomes good. Yes, yes friend, you play a song and if someone brings tea and pakodas from outside, then Please take Chai Pe Charcha membership and let's hope 15th August is coming, we will celebrate and be happy, I will also give ideas on how to celebrate, okay and 15th August should be celebrated in a good way, many years ago it used to be celebrated very well, then in the middle people got  People have started considering this as just another holiday, so I hope this time the Prime Minister will hit sixes and fours in his speech. We are looking forward to it and I hope this video reaches out to him in time and some are looking forward so that this is one of the disappointments.  Definitely it is one and you all will believe, everyone will believe it is one and I feel that in a few days even the opposition will get disappointed because ultimately they too will become like this so the opposition should also make some such announcement  Do it in a way that the opposition also gets irritated, hey, what have you done, elections are coming, what I think like about BJP is, I want to tell you one thing, what I like about BJP, I have never seen this thing in Congress, BJP people should not give it  Never go down without a fight, if we lose the election, then we do n't lose so badly, normally the Congress people just give up, it's okay brother, I have eaten and drank a lot, I am sitting peacefully and enjoying myself, this election is bound to be lost  We will go later and see later, then I feel bad about the Congress, okay, if that fight has been given in many places in Rajasthan, although of late Congress is changing a bit, okay, of late there is a change, but then what is the BJP  BJP will never show that we are going to lose, which means even if we lose, it will not seem that we will win, something will happen and people will keep saying okay, so this is the spirit, this is a good spirit, according to me it is right and this is also something considering the spirit  This has to be done on 15th August, otherwise brother Maharashtra and Haryana went, Maharashtra and Haryana went  Then he is not going to come to Delhi in 2015, after that nothing is known about Bihar either, 2015 said 2025, okay then if you lose so many elections, then that will happen in Rajya Sabha, then the pressure will start increasing and what is the problem in increasing the pressure for us  However you increase it, it becomes a kind of negativity, it is not fun, it means that pressure should increase, but at times it should feel that if you are winning then BJP will have to do a little bit, otherwise your Rajya Sabha seats will also reduce, then the story will end  There will be a twist and my again request is this is my personal opinion again who is going to listen to me so much but friend don't remove Yogi ji friend please he is good for Uttar Pradesh that is my personal opinion okay Yogi ji is good for Uttar  The state of Uttar Pradesh is a state with a population of 30 crores and what happens in UP affects the whole of India. So personally, I may have some complaints about some things of Yogi ji and people may also have complaints. yes but overall I feel  The question is whether he is going to run a state of 30 crore people or else say, divide UP into four parts, that too is not a bad thing, okay, that thing can also be thought about, in my opinion, instead of taking  Yogi ji is out because there has been a lot of conflict between them, if you want a separate video on that then you can tell me that there has been a lot of conflict between them, even at the cost of losing seats, they should not give them any thought that we are fine and that According to me, it is not good for the party, it is not good for the ideology and I feel that such things happening in such a big party is not good for the country either, then why should this happen, so let's see how it ends.  You will find out now, I have made three-four predictions, till date, all of them have been correct, okay, but to be wrong, I always keep challenging myself that something should go wrong, something should go wrong, it will go wrong  So I am a beggar, I will apologize here, it went wrong brother, it went wrong, I will try again next time  Okay, so we don't have to go anywhere, so we will come here and apologize, friend, we had made too much of a mess and we would have made a mess of you all too, nothing like that happened, but let's see, let's see, time will tell. Thank you very much, like the channel, subscribe and I am also telling you to take membership of the channel, take the membership and subscribe so that YouTube becomes 1 and the message reaches more people and if the message reaches more people then there will be some benefit somewhere  It must be true, I feel so, I mean it's not just me but the society as well feels so, so if you feel so then please do, thank you very much"

    "title": "02 Important Questions For BJP And Congress ｜ Will Haryana Change The Tide ？ [A2ebGpu6nyE].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, Haryana's elections are at their peak, a lot of campaigning is at its peak, but I want to tell my subscribers through this video that there are some questions that I want to ask and you people also have to ask these two questions for Congress also.  And there is a more specific question for BJP, there is a specific question, there may be some uncomfortable forces for both but if it is necessary then the first question goes, the first question goes to the respected party Bharatiya Janata Party and for them first.  When we ask the top leaders only because they are campaigning then Modi ji says to Modi ji that if Congress comes then the son-in-law will loot, if earlier they had looted then the question is that the double engine government has been running for the last 10 years.  Why was it not done? It is ED, it is CBI. If the Chief Minister was put in sitting jail, then why are they afraid of the son-in-law or the son-in-law had not done anything? There can be only two reasons, there can be only two reasons, so in this case. What is the reason that the son- in-law has not actually done anything wrong, he has not done it now, so nothing can be done, we were telling such phrases and are still telling you that the robber will loot the one who looted earlier and now you are afraid that now  If you loot then your Bharatiya Janata Party government is running at the center for 10 years and is running in the state, so why did nothing go? This is the first question. Okay, the second thing is why the achievements of BJP's 10 years of state government.  He is not being counted in anything. Neither the Prime Minister is being counted nor Amit Shah ji is being counted. Khattar ji is not visible anywhere. It is okay that he is a very big person in his own right. So what is the reason behind this, a huge achievement of BJP.  I will tell you what could have happened or is there or is there something but I will also tell that they do not have the courage to speak, this is a wonderful thing, this will be higher order thinking, will you give it to the poet like this or the clapping of the poet?  Will you do what I am telling you here? Elections are coming and I am praising BJP. I am surprised at myself. You people are also surprised that you will praise BJP. Now yes, I will do it and I will tell you only that it will run off.  You know what ever, it will be fun, I will praise BJP at the end of the video. Okay, before that, now I want to ask a question to Congress. Congress says O.P. Old pension system will come, so I want to ask that which was done in 2004. You will bring the old pension system for those who were recruited later. When it was closed, how will it be accounted for the money that has been deducted from NPS for so many years? Whether to say or not, how will that money go, where will it go to them, whatever they have deducted? That was inserted, but what will happen to the element of government which was to be inserted, that too is given, this is also given, if only two are given, then it is so beneficial, how beneficial is it to whom, how will the finance be done because Bhai Saheb also said in Himachal Pradesh.  went to Himachal Pradesh  It was said there, it was not given, I agree, Himachal is not that rich, Haryana, Haryana brother, it is a cool city, not a city, it is a province, it is full of money, it is okay, Haryana gives as much GST as UP gives, Haryana is rich, I don't think there is lack of money, but this  Implementation is difficult, according to me it is not right, I am not a fan of OPSEC, sometimes people become friends, this is what we have to drive away, I am Asrani, half of Sholay is left, half is right, the rest is left.  Those who went and still survived are the same, you people are okay, those who survived after being half left and right are okay with you, Congress is saying to do 2 lakh recruitments, it feels very good, BJP has done a very good job that recruitment.  Whatever it is, this post was such that it was not worthy of being filled, the money of End children are not coming like this master  They are taking fees, closed them and posted them, consolidated the big schools, no other school would have two such schools in such a distance, it would not be a good job politically, yes master is very strong political, he would have at least 200 votes in the street inside the village. Okay, so she is playing, that is why now BJP had decided and it would be a mistake not to be able to speak in this manner, but BJP should do that you are a party of cities and the party of city people, not the party of village people. If this had happened then BJP would have been in the fight. BJP remained confused in this election because whatever good has been done by BJP, through this video I am telling people that BJP has done good work but it cannot say that because if the votes get scattered then you  Am I anti villagers, am I anti communities, am I anti teachers, am I anti that, no no, I am a Guruji man, I want the right thing to be done, the right thing will benefit the majority wherever there is 100.  Out of the 80% profit, that thing should be done, 20% is lost because resources are limited in our house, even in the country, province, if you go and give ifo to a small child, then the remaining three are sitting like this in the whole house.  Also, if you keep giving something to only one person, then it has to be done jointly, so according to me, it was fine, but you cannot claim it, okay, one more good thing was done, in the implementation of which they did such a thing.  Did it because BJP focused on this idea. Well, some bureaucrat gave praise to that bureaucrat too. The basic essence of Parivar Pehchan Patra was that many people are taking advantage of illegitimate schemes in Haryana and they don't deserve it. Many people are like this. So create some identity by linking everyone's Aadhaar in the family identity card so that whenever you have to take any government schemes, it is linked to it and your income can be known from it like classical. Do the thing of your mind and no income tax payer with brain, discretion and consciousness can ever prove it wrong that if you want to buy a car worth Rs. 10 lakh, 15 lakh, 20 lakh, 25 lakh, 30 lakh, one crore, then you can buy a car through family identity card.  Give the letter, he will link that if this car is owned in your family, then in someone's family, brothers and sisters, if a car worth 10, 15, 20 lakhs is bought in the name of father, mother or children, then  Should they get some scheme of Rs. 000? Should they get free ration and rice from the government? Shouldn't they get it? They also have the power to buy your car. It's like if you are visiting Switzerland, then why don't you put Rs. 000 behind the schemes?  It should be that M was the same but M was this, so I could never explain the benefit in it and people kept saying what is the benefit, what is the benefit, you have made a wrong entry, you have made a wrong entry.  That's why I said that if the execution is bust then the whips are coming right. The idea of ​​the government was good, the idea of demonetization was also good but the execution was nonsense, I didn't know how to do it, that's why I didn't know how to do it, I do n't have the capability to do rotor thinking, I do n't have the idea, someone gave me the idea.  It felt good to hear the idea, in Chavadi Bazaar, business ideas are available by the kilo. People also say to me that I also give, but the whole problem is with me and others.  I will also give the idea properly on my other channels. Is there a problem in the execution? If there is no execution then the execution has not been done. According to me, it was a very good thing. The property ID card was also mismanaged.  People have cried terribly because the execution was bad It should go to the blockchain level of Property ID It's happening in UAE It's happening in Dubai I'm Into  We should take real estate to the blockchain level so that it can be completely secured, whose property was it, when did it belong to anyone, how was the security done and we should go in that direction and should go towards technology so that they stay here only. Now it has become such that any next government will never be able to correct these two things, so that is the popular one, I am saying that the genuine man, the poor man, whom genuine  There is a need, open the coffers and open them for that, but if 90 out of 100 880 people are not deserving, then reduce their taxes. Brother, Haryana is not a poor state. Right now, people are rushing to seek elections in Haryana, to seek votes from the workers. There are so many big cars here, but if he doesn't have any skills, then despite being the best, he couldn't do it and if you tell me about his achievements, then he has nothing to say, Neel.  Bate Sannata, that Hooda Hooda Saheb is our Deependra ji, he can still tell stories, brother, I did AIIMS, brother, I was in medical college, but I did AIIMS in Jhajjar, brother, I did IM, till I cried, brother, you did everything till you cried. Hey brother, this is Haryana, I did it as much as a fist, then it became common in Rohtak, so it is not possible for Hisar's Chhora to come, it cannot be done, there is no benefit, it is just this much, I did it in Rohtak.  Make Rohtak the capital. From my side, she is crying loudly about real estate, but how do the results come? Do you want to talk about the results as well? Constance, will you do one thing that these people have done very wrong, I am very upset.  You have done saffronisation of Haryana with BJP, religion has not started in Haryana, its reason is that you have not understood Haryanvi even in 10 years and I am not talking Jat.  Where people are not and you are Jat and I am talking about Haryanvi by speaking, Haryana people of 36 communities are a little different, these are nice, they are okay, they don't understand, they come in the heart, they don't understand, okay and BJP has failed very.  Bad in that, even in 10 years, you have not been able to understand the religion, you know all those things, whatever happens, whatever happens, you are not there, brother, 10 years old.  You should have been fighting inside, brother, you are on one side, BJP, either the farmers don't know what you say, brother, tell the farmers whatever they have to say, otherwise what are you saying, but you are on one side, double the income of the farmers.  We will do this to the farmers, we will do this to the farmers, Kangana is speaking with a loud pea mouth and this law should come again. Once it is clear that brother, we do not like farmers, okay, earlier also BJP was Maniya's party, BJP is the same again.  Some and big but still the core is the same, so don't confuse your core, when even your Baniyas will not vote, even Brahmin brothers will not vote, no one will vote, then yes you would have sat down and done something because at the time of religion which  They were doing things, that caste has come in between, now people don't even know the syllabus, Jats have been converted into Muslims in Haryana, what happens sometimes, Haryana shows the way to the country, Modi ji's rice was not the same in the Rewari rally in 2013. And I was present in that rally and what a wonderful atmosphere it was. I am talking about 2013. Okay, what were the people and what was the enthusiasm. And brother, I am also quite loud, my voice is quite as loud as the workers used to cheer. No, they left Gurgaon fed up, today I am telling you that they were fed up, Congress arrogance, corruption, Modi ji, Modi ji, I still remember this, at that time there were no phone phones, otherwise, they made some video and audio, that doesn't mean anything.  Yes and all this was not like this, I remember it was a B phone or it did not have data or it did not have GB, there was some trouble, I do not remember, it has been 11 years but brother, it was the beginning, why am I telling that thing to Haryana? Because Haryana leads India. Yes, Haryana is not 90 seats, Haryana is not 10 seats, Haryana is not 2.5 crores, Haryana is an emotion and here it is said that the government which is in the center in the last 60 years is in Haryana.  It is said like this, it is okay, this has not happened in two-three years, I do not believe in this, I say that the government that is in Haryana comes here, you understand my point, this is Haryana to Haryana, Haryana will show the way and BJP will insist on money.  Put this put Don't go down without a fight and I am very very sure Gujarati and Amit Shah ji and Narendra Modi know this, he has roamed in Haryana, he is not even replying Namaste to Khattar ji, now Modi ji was friendship, that, that.  Friendship became expensive, Modi ji, after 5 years, even 2 years ago, he would have changed Naib Saini ji. If you look at the face of Naib Saini ji, many people like him, you have not understood the people of Haryana, the people of Haryana are like this, they scold their leader.  If you scold the leader and say something wrong directly and the leader listens to six things out of 10 and if the leader scolds you wrongly in four, then you are a popular leader in Haryana that brother, the other one has heard six of them but the next one also has power because  If he listens to all then you are the leader of the week. I am giving out the paper today. Psychology of Haryana. Six things. People of Haryana, why don't you ask for votes. Will you tell me? What has come like this? Haryana is very lovely, no matter how it looks, people of Haryana are not afraid.  Is it from someone and should take advantage of this thing, leaders have a clean heart, forgive in two minutes, if you apologize then it is right, not arrogance, if you will remain in arrogance, then come brother, I will do this for five days too.  Four days are left, give it a try, BJP people will also go and apologize with folded hands, this will save the mess from being cleaned up, many people will say, brother, are you an agent of Congress or are you an agent of BJP, you only tell me. Whose agent am I? This is my claim. I am Guruji, I am a man. Whoever takes my knowledge can take advantage of it. We want everyone to take benefit, everyone should benefit. Okay, so Congress should also ask questions. Let BJP tell you, fight.  show me your tricks friend  The election will be won a little, BJP has made it independent here, every other person in Haryana is speaking, the man from Haryana is so smart, he knows why you have fielded an independent, go and apologize, Kamal Gupta ji is the Prime Minister of BJP, candidate from Hisar.  Did he hold a rally there, neither did he greet him, nor did he take his name, nor did he call him on the stage, nor did his photo appear in the poster? Why was Modi ji in Hisar? This question is a very innocent question, to make Savitri ji Lal ji win.  It is mine, hey, I am the biggest leader, so I will not raise my hand like this. Oh brothers and sisters, he did not even say to put a button on the lotus symbol. He has to put it on the symbol of the lotus. Why did he not say that Kamal Gupta ji has to win and if he loses by so many.  If there is a candidate then Savitri Jindal ji should have been given ticket to his son in BJP, meaning the public is such that if he is a son then mother is fighting from there in BJP and he is not there but if Kamal Gupta ji has also been given ticket then BJP will have 89 votes.  There is no candidate so one of them has surrendered. 125 BJP candidates are contesting for Gopal Kanda from 89 seats in Haryana and the people of Haryana are very smart but if Haryana loses then it will be the turn of the tide and  One should realize this thing through an event and then from inside like a gun, it is said right from inside BJP, so 8th date is there any advantage by making it 8th according to Numol, is it 8th October?  Do n't do it because that day is also Air Force Day and there is a grand air show in Chennai, so all the news channels should show the air show instead of showing Haryana's defeat, which is happening, as I had predicted so many days ago. I analyse, brothers and sisters, no one does it like that, is the result of the 8th just like that, and the chosen four days were delayed due to this and luckily your people missed many more holidays and those days were delayed in such a way that then prefix suffix  back and forth small  He took leave and went away and the atmosphere became anti-you. Either you should have kept the date earlier and then changed it. Yes, I know, I remember I told you to do it, but now it seems that even after doing so, he may have given wrong advice at times.  It is not like that because later when we come to know what is happening, it looks like a flip flop. I would like, brothers and sisters, that some leader should emerge. BJP has kept many leaders for a long time, Rao.  There is no benefit in keeping Inderjit ji. Such leaders are emerging in Ahirwal. Weak leaders are not getting any benefit in Ahirwal by keeping him. They still say that this has happened in Gurgaon, Gurgaon has become a garbage dump.  I am so dirty, what should we do in this? We are in the center and we told the state government like this, Hey brother, then why are you coming to ask for votes?  Why are you coming and campaigning? Bolo bhai mere dore kuch na hai then what is the difference between you and us, I am also speaking, I request the incoming state government that brother, if we also speak, then why are you MP?  Make us for this, we will raise our voice in the Parliament so much that if I am the MP of Gurgaon, then Gurgaon should become Singapore and whatever will happen,  Government, but it is the same, then how come you are not like this, you are speaking to become like this, you did not say anything, Aarti ji wanted to get the ticket, that was the only interest, Rao Inderjeet, you have no ambition, Rao Inderjeet, the leader who has no ambition. Never ignore that leader, never ignore such a leader who says, I will become the CM, I will do it like this because we need a person who is not able to ask for anything for himself, what will he do to you brother in the elections?  Do you understand that whatever leader of BJP is there today, it is not like we will do any good, Rao Narveer ji is showing good body language, it is a compliment to him, if you watch the video, he is showing good body language.  The language is good, we will see who will win, the election is very tight, I live in Gurgaon, the channel is from Gurgaon like this brother, I don't know who is winning, no matter how much you talk to people, it is not from Gurgaon.  It is known that the wind is like this or it is like this, rest of the things are fixed, however, BJP is saying that if you ask any five seats, no one can tell which BJP is going to win by shot, including sitting CM's Ladwa seat is in danger.  Anil Vij ji's seat is in danger. Abhimanyu ji's seat is in danger. Even within Gurgaon, there is no certainty as to who will win. The matter is tight, but the people of Gurgaon or the people of the state have to see what about whom now.  These were the questions, just ask brother, how are these people doing? These people were like son-in-law, you can't even count your 10 achievements in 10 years, 10 achievements or this government run, you have created something.  If you people had built four flyovers in Gurgaon, if the expressway of Dardar has been built, then Gadkari ji has done this to the state government, till date the service lane has not been built, the site of the landfill has not been built till date.  They were not to be found in 103 sector and were to be built here and there, but it has been removed, now it is not being built, but sometimes they will build it here, sometimes they will take the land fee there, sometimes they will take it there, all the builders are scared, the whole public is scared, what are they doing?  Hey friend, this is the situation going on. What would you say about the Waste Management Act? They had imposed the Emergency Act. What happened in Gurgaon, because of that Act, it turned Rena into a garbage dump. Will some work be done? Agniveer of some kind was engaged.  Yes, the children here had the opportunity to join the army, they did this, look at the accounts of the wrestlers, they have disgraced a community which is only on pride, to which I can openly say, Jats are fine in Haryana, what should they call Jats?  Don Kya 2 A 16 Instead of saying Kya, instead of saying Cha Dni Aa, there are some sayings like Jaat, Jat is called Jat like this, Jats are just adam, such proverbs have been made as button Jat.  In Stand for Justice Action and Truth also a community which lives on pride had to speak only two sweet words like many do not speak with love. Grandmother used to say son has eaten churma and asked if he is happy whose churma has been digested these days. Would have given some respect also.  It is not given that if you keep it by rubbing then you have kept everyone by rubbing it, you have made it Haryanavi, why did you do it, why did you do it? Jats from UP come here to make you happy.  You could have done a little, you could have told some story but you thought that I will win the rest of the votes. After telling them all of them gathered together, they showed that the community has leadership traits.  If it is not found even after ringing, I appeal to all the 36 communities of Haryana to give a thumbs up to a good person. If you are not able to find a good person then go and vote for the one who is least bad among them.  Must be seen, vote on 5th, vote on NOTA, press the button, there are two horses in the race, focus on one of those horses, do n't be a bottomless fool and there is one more request to the people of Haryana, a lot of money is being thrown away, your honor.  To buy tickets, I am not clear about one information in this, many of you will give clarity, see, Guruji also needs clarity in many things, I want to ask that people are saying.  That votes are being sold, some are saying even 000, some are saying 2000, some are saying 10000, all the talk of votes is going on. I want to ask in practice how it is actually bought. Suppose someone wants to buy my vote and gives 000.  Gave and I replied yes, suppose I am speaking as an example and then how will that proof be that I have given it only, meaning how will this be, I mean technical.  Is this an error because if someone is dividing two candidates and someone takes both of them, then how will there be a proof? Is there any system, brother, which I do n't know because I am very curious, I am very surprised as to how this is happening, can you give me an idea?  Guess how the political parties which are running in the air are running in Sirsa side also, they are running in two-four i.e. five-six constituencies, they are not running in all of them, at least one expense.  There is a lot going on so there is no dearth of money in Haryana and if Haryana is spending so much then it has to be seen who is the poor and who is the poor then to whom is this 5 kg rice being distributed who has come from Bihar and settled here.  Who are the plots being distributed to? I can see so much money being bought. First of all, I would like no one to take money. Many people say no. Take the money but don't vote.  Don't give to these people  S. A. Astrology is telling me, don't take this money, it will come out 50 times through blood. Many people say that Aam Aadmi Party's Kejriwal shouts slogans like this, brother, take the money from them, vote for us, I am Guru ji telling, man, their money.  Don't take this money, it's not like you can get a crore, no one is giving one vote, but don't take this money, your age will be 50 times as soon as you take it, the astrologer is saying with folded hands with love, don't take money from anyone but one.  asking about technicality  I wonder how do these people take the money and ensure that they vote for us? It means curiosity. Is there any mechanism there or is it just based on faith that if they take it then brother will give it because these are the last two-three days, anyway, this is the Shraddha.  It is the time of Navratri, do not drink alcohol during these times, after drinking alcohol, I will vote for someone, do not do this, this is not the time to consume such things, so have a little sattvik mind, whoever you think is a good person.  Make him win, I feel like taking the name of half the candidates, make him win, but till now I have not done any campaigning, I am not campaigning for anyone, but there is one person who is the only person from the same party, who is giving hints somewhere.  Look at him, he is the right man on Viwari's side, sometimes he does not match the thinking of the party he belongs to, I say, it is absolutely nonsense, the thinking of that party, but sometimes what happens is that the party is wrong. yes man is right  What happens sometimes is that a person is wrong and the party is right. I personally believe that humans should make the right choice. The day we humans make the right choice, politicians will automatically be forced to choose good candidates rather than these.  No winning candidates or caste equations or compulsion or whoever threw more money then go after the person, go after the candidate and this is what the public should do. The candidate should be good, your criteria is yours only.  The parameters are: Check which candidate do you like and the good candidate will win. The party which has fielded good candidates will win. And this is what we want, this is what we want, so let's see what happens and do put this question in the comment section.  Do ask and the results will be awaited very eagerly, however, opinion polls will start coming on the 5th itself. Opinion or exit polls will show what happened to whom and how much, and if you enjoy these elections,  Let's stay good and after that there will be Maharashtra elections and let's see whether Haryana will lead the tide again. Haryana has shown the way to this country. All the major events take place here. It is a small state. Kurukshetra has also chosen this. Has anyone done this till date?  Asked that brother, this Hastinapur was in UP, okay, Hastinapur was there, then why did he come to fight in Kurukshetra, they used to fight with their shoes and did not give the field or is it more here, no one asks, this Panipat is in Panipat World History of India in Panipat  The history of India has changed three times - 1526, 1556 and 1761. Apart from that, there is another battle which is Battle of Tarai. It again comes in the area of ​​Karnal. If you know, in 1191 and 1192, it had changed the course, then Haryana is the only such state in India. Who decides the destiny of Hari country and as a Haryanvi I have a stake of pride in it and I think whoever does it will do well.  And it will be good, we will see what will happen, we will know on 8th October, we still know on 5th October, but brother, we are saying that BJP should make the match interesting, BJP people should apply force, where are your leaders, where are your leaders, where are your leaders.  Chief Minister of 1.5 years, he doesn't even come on the stage, he does n't even come to bat, what is this, I am surprised, yes, it is okay, you should have changed it 2 years ago, it would have been a mistake, what happens sometimes, only then they say. Many people say that there is a family, they call the family members like this, Modi ji does not have a family, but no one has a family, if someone goes into his mouth in the name of a friend, then it is visible that the state is going away because of friendship.  Modi ji's friendship in the matter has cost BJP, Haryana is the most powerful state of India, where governance has a Chaudhary feel in itself because Haryana is all about Chaudhary, every person here is a Chaudhary whose  The one who has a Chaudhary Hut on Chaudharys is called the real king. The Mughals did not mess with the Haryanvi people, neither did the British before that, they used to loot Balban's camels. Whenever they used to go to Hisar, they used to loot the camels of Rot Kale Balban. Now they used to loot them.  All things in very short notes of history because it's a dozen make too many great this thing but we are a very good student of history and maybe I want to become a teacher also.  I would like to share some interesting history for you people which you have not read but it exists and can be checked by doing it also through any good book. Arjun Kadyan ji is a naam g karna, his is a book on Haryana. I am completely blank, I don't know which one it is, I don't know the name of the author, Arjun Kadyan Book on Haryana is very amazing book, every Haryanvi should read it, I have read it, I have made notes and it is very good about the people of Haryana.  In this you get to know what the people of Haryana are, if my prediction is that if any province in this country, in how many years in the next year, I don't know, if it can become as per Europe then Haryana is the best qualified best qualified to become.  Age close to Europe, looking at the income of Europe, it will be too much, okay, it will not be there even in the next 25 years, but if there is anyone within this state, then it is one, the size is limited, governance can be good, there are hardworking people, proximity.  There is already money to daily, it is not that we have to get out of poverty, there is already a lot of money, a lot is going, so I have a lot of hope from our Haryana, you people should also be there and India needs to watch Haryana and Haryanvi, it is okay, don't think that  This small state is worth 2.5 crores, what is it, which is more interesting than Maharashtra that I can tell it will set the tone for Maharashtra also and now  Last over is left to start. If you want to become Mahendra Singh Dhoni, BJP people, then see something, do something, there is still one advice and sometimes what happens is that nothing has to be done, even today you have to join hands, if you join hands then vote bank will be on 5.  It will increase in five, you can avoid getting cleaned, you will have to apologize publicly, apologize as they say, I am not speaking like that, I am speaking with love and even an apology is not an insult, a person from Haryana. Brother, it would be a mistake to say sorry. Brother, it would be a mistake. If you don't understand, then this is all I have to say. People are sitting here with big hearts, it is not like that, but try. Ego and arrogance are something wicked, people of Haryana.  They do n't tolerate at all, they don't tolerate it at all, yes they themselves sound like this, but the people of Haryana themselves are not arrogant, they are very sweet, the people of Haryana are very sweet, it seems to people that Rude 's voice is like this, what to do now brother? So much blood has been shed here, love, blood in the soil here, blood in the soil, which Sultan's song is this? The amount of blood that has been shed here has not been shed on any other land in India, so some people start learning comedy in these terms of adversity and  They do not cry, they are not afraid, it is okay that the people of Haryana are afraid, if they are not afraid, then this is one thing, it means that the people of Haryana cannot be scared, they can be misled or misled, and being misled is also not a good thing, I will suggest to the leaders. Amuse the people of Haryana, amuse the people of Haryana, they are very lovely people, okay, and make the match interesting, it will be fun to watch, this is the good taste of democracy, okay, BJP is known for it, BJP is known for not going down without a fight, BJP is  Some one great thing I like about BJP is that it does not give power on a platter like Congress, Congress is like this, enough is enough, brother, take this, brother, take it, this is not in our power, brother, like this. They have surrendered here in Maharashtra, where in Madhya Pradesh we all surrender, the Congress people, the BJP people do not do that, that is good they do the fight and till the last moment it seems that the reason will put a will pull out a rabbit from.  The hat is fine, it seems that we also feel that no matter how many analysts there are, they will also play something like this or the meaning is correct, then Amit comes in the name of Amit Shah ji. And AMIT in English, you can search the meaning of this name and write it in the comment section, you will know from the meaning, what is its meaning and write it in the comment section, then you will understand it yourself, so let's see Amit.  Shah ji will be able to do something because more people are coming to his rally and people are not coming to Modi ji's rally. I am surprised but not so surprised because people associate Modi ji with Khattar ji. Amit Shah ji. is not  Friend of Khattar ji Khattar ji, now has Amit Shah ji ever been promoted? Joke, only one rank is left, for him Khattar ji knows everything, but for Amit Shah ji, still people like 'Chal bhai hai mota bhai', they would have listened.  Something is right but they are not listening to Modi ji because Modi ji and Amit Khattar ji have become one, they have kept Khattar ji missing. Okay, so this is some mistake made by BJP and if they had done this correction earlier then it would have made a lot of difference. I feel like this Naib Saini  Had it been made a year earlier, it would not have been in such a bad condition. What do you guys think? Write in the comment section and what do you guys think, people of Haryana, who is winning and how many seats are coming to whom? We will also take cognizance as to how many out of 90 seats are coming to BJP and how many to Congress. The remaining seats will be of Independents, so please do write in the comment section. Will you like the channel and the selection in Haryana is on top.  If you are sitting in Orissa then it is Sanu's side or if you are sitting somewhere else then it is Sanu's side. Haryana is very important because Himachal is with BJP but not already in Punjab.  BJP has nothing to do with Jammu and Kashmir, they are not coming to Delhi, Aam Aadmi Party is not going to let them win, so brother, there is another state around Delhi, Haryana, if it goes, then what will be the next number, brother of Rajasthan?  Sir, after becoming the President, Modi ji had to leave, so in 2027, even those votes will not be there, so put in some effort, like, share, enjoy and write one more thing in the comment section, if I write you as an agent of BJP, then write BJP. Agent of BJP, Agent of BJP i.e. BKA and I look like Congressman, then write that, if I look like Congressman and Guruji L type, then write Guruji, I consider myself Guruji, but according to me  What do you people believe in this and tell me if it is okay and if you enjoy it then do tell me. Even if you don't like it then tell me. We will bring some more enjoyable content for you people. Like and share. Thank you very much."

    "title": "02 Interesting Political Observations From Haryana And Bihar [moKU2uOl-BE].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, I will tell you two interesting political observations, one in Haryana and one in Bihar. Let us first start from our state, the observation from Haryana. The interesting observation is that the cabinet portfolios have been given in Haryana. A new government has been formed. What is interesting in it is that the Home Ministry.  Both Finance and Finance portfolios which are the most important portfolios are kept by the CM himself. Normally this does not happen, historically because the Home Ministry is in charge of someone else.  Finance is also there and remains idle, so it is interesting, that is why I said, how good it will be in the future, time will tell, but now there will be no other power center in Haryana Government like Vidji, he has been given such a transport ministry. Earlier it was the Home Ministry, now I do n't know how much resentment they will show, how they will show it. Aarti Rao ji has been given health, yet it can be said that yes, it seems to be something big. Other wise, it is Sharma ji who lives from Gohana, which gives him  Jail Ministry is only the Jail Minister, if you see, very small ministries have been given very small things, CM Saheb has also kept 12 different things for himself, that is, Haryana will be run by CMO and it will be CEO style like a corporate.  There is a CEO style inside, let's see how the power center will be, it is not a multiple up, now it cannot be said that it is from that place, it will not be like this, it is a new model, let's see how it is, I have very high hopes, that Bhoodan and  all this  These kind of things are also under CM Saheb, so that means whatever things are there, they are with CM Saheb only, other people have also been given something or the other, yes, you are also a minister, mostly you would have been given a car, a bungalow.  I have got status and all that, there are so many ministers, so this shows that there is no great thing in becoming a minister, sometimes this is a fact, so this was a new interesting, second interesting, let's go to Bihar in Bihar.  Interesting what is happening in Jan Suraj, you must have heard the name of Prashant Kishore ji's party has been launched, out of which he is giving assembly ticket to a retired Vice Chief of Army Staff from Bihar and he is an interesting politician coming out of Bihar.  Will come where the whole system was run on the basis of caste and Prashant Kishore ji had promised that he will show his candidates by beating them and the leader from Bihar is a Singh Saheb who is standing now. Sinha Saheb is right, so a person retired from a very big post, if he is bringing him in like this, then I would call it the beginning of a fresh politics, that is, the second thing of his is another good thing about Jan Swaraj that his Every month, every year, sorry, every year there will be a change of President, like we used to read in history, there was a time for Congress, not every year, it used to be Adhi, in 1929 it will become this, in 30 it will become Jawaharlal Nehru.  Sometimes someone else will become one and we must have studied a lot in GK, you must have studied history, so this is the kind of system that the original Congress had which is coming which is very welcome and in that also we will change it by the turn of upper caste Muslims.  Dalits and OBCs, there is rotation there too. Another interesting thing that seems to be happening is that it will be like the concept of primary in the US elections where you can vote for Republican Party.  Or before becoming the final candidate of the Democrat Party, you have to contest elections within your party as well, in which we have seen that it is okay among ourselves that this and that always remain the same, so in the same way, six months before the elections, such an election.  This will happen in which party workers will vote off-course and a candidate will be selected from it. If such things had happened in Haryana, then Congress would have got 10-12 more seats instead of the high command sitting on its own.  Before dividing the last movement like this, this democratization of political parties is very very important for our democracy. It is not like Supro keeps saying what is the command, what is the higher command, what is the command, she will decide or one leader will be outsourced. On the franchise model, if you distribute it in this state then this person becomes your nearest licker, then whoever is your actual worker in that state.  The one who is following your ideology, is walking in the sun, has no power left, otherwise if this model works, then it is the spark of the beginning, it will force other party people also into helplessness and today I am  It seems that if you are in Bihar, then if you become a worker of Jan Swaraj and follow this thing genuinely, see what happens, many new ideas come, people come with very good feelings.  Are But the stories that the main thing is in the execution have been heard, but what happened like Congress had conducted a survey during Haryana elections but distributed the tickets in such a way that where the survey was distributed in the name of survey, it was a wrong survey and lost there.  And the rest of the seats were distributed in the same way, somewhere we lost by 32 votes, somewhere we lost like this, dividing and dividing seats is very important, so the way Prashant Kishore ji is coming towards that. Initially there were allegations beyond that this is BJP's B team or someone big has its money and where is it coming from but all those things are also going away now, now the contest that will take place in Bihar will become very interesting. Because there are already many players in it, Nitish Kumar is a player in itself, BJP is a big player in itself, Congress comes among the smaller players, Ram Vilas ji's son is there, okay his party is LJP, that too is JDU, a big party in itself and  he is  CPI(M) also runs there on its own and there are many small parties too, one of which is Jitendra Ram's and there are many different parties and along with that, independents are also very important there, there are individuals like Pappu Yadav, Apna.  They win in that already crowded place, their coming will be an additional interesting thing and they can definitely influence the election, in whose favor will they be, what will happen, although they are saying that we are the only ones.  Now such a new party will be formed to form the government. If elections can be formed so soon within a year, then it will be very big in itself, so we will see in the coming time whether this kind of party that is being formed is politics. Like the channel and subscribe, you must have seen some more videos also, I come here from time to time, doing my own little world, there was a video, I got a lot of love from you guys, I really liked the subscribers like this.  Videos will keep coming like a snack in between, on politics channel like there are current events and issues, they will keep coming beyond that and you people will keep enjoying if people are in the comments."

    "title": "02 Serious Issues That Middle Class Needs To Raise And Put Focus On [azPSu2WrnL8].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, two serious issues which the general public needs to focus on and discuss and start discussing and asking questions. I will tell you about two things because the attention of the public is diverted somewhere else. A few days ago, Anant Ambani ji's wedding was held.  India had the World Cup, then now the budget has come, now again there will be some elections, in between that, there were issues of Kavad Yatra, brother, all this is not of much use. I am telling you the useful thing, now listen to it because it gradually affects us a lot. The first thing is the increase in terrorist activities in Jammu and Kashmir and the martyrdom of many of our soldiers. If you look from June 78 till now when this  Video is being recorded till 28th July so many of our martyrs have been martyred. There have never been so many in such a short time. The figure and number will look like this around number 15 but isolated incidents have become very high and these are the incidents. If you check the different incidents that have happened, you will come to know that there have been 10 to 12 incidents, the number of injured is different and what is problematic this time is that not so many from the other side have been caught and killed. That is even a matter of concern and there is something else in it which is considered to be a public private thing which cannot be told in the public domain due to sensitivity.  The action is taking place by sitting, this time they are saying whether they are militants or all the trained soldiers, retired people there or who else and what are the issues in strategy and tactics from our side that these are happening one after the other.  One thing is happening after this because what happens is that security forces and armed forces get martyred, everyone has a lot of respect but at some stage mistakes have to be made and higher ups have to be asked.  What are you doing because sometimes it seems that politicians are so much busy in elections. I feel that the number two leader of our country is so busy in UP, Yogi and his are going on and in the upcoming elections.  That brother, there is no focus here when how has the enemy country changed its tactics at one place, if there are 3040 people in one place, like what happened last time inside Uri or in Pulwama.  So they know that the threshold has been crossed. These thresholds are not crossed. Two people, one person, it seems as if a car has met with an accident, the bridge has broken, then that does not make news in the country, right? Even at the officer level, junior officers and soldiers are getting martyred, so there is not so much noise, one comes from within, gets published somewhere in the newspaper, there is a little anger from within, but by then the next news comes because one  Do one two one two one two one two now we don't have to accept even one two and there should be an uproar beyond this and these news channels Godi Media have changed the tuning if you see in the last two four five six days they have also changed the tune.  I know that now there is no benefit in supporting the ruling party, this is probably for all you know, but we have to pay attention to these things too which are important, there will be no discussion on these during Kavad Yatra.  Now, by the grace of God, what is going on perfectly, no such big issue has been raised as they were saying that it would happen. BBC has given a very good report on that, there is absolutely no problem at the ground level, there is no problem in the entire brotherhood.  Everyone is doing their own good work as much as it was to make it and I had made a very good video in it, I was the only one, someone may have said that many people don't watch the whole thing, I had told in the end that everyone should get Dada's photo installed.  Get your PAN card and Aadhaar done, I had also said the same and nothing is going to happen and that is what happened. The second issue which I want to raise is a very big issue according to me. The second issue which I want to raise is carefully.  Listen, those government servants can also join RSS. RSS has been considered a cultural organization. First of all, it is not registered. There was no rule in 1966 or 67 that they were not allowed to join.  It has been removed. We know that RSS is the parent organization of BJP. If we can speak, then it is political. Even if it cannot be done on paper, it is political. If like this in the open, government servants are like this.  If you go, then he will become a carder, then he will become a carder, then to tell all the political parties, come up with such an organization and tell them.  Join the state government which will not do then it will be seen it is something like no like adding liquor is not allowed ok so how do people add through proxy they will remove the soda or remove the CD back piper soda or something and there are actors in it  Will come and add, everyone knows what is being ad, join everybody, do the outsider, do this, do that because RSS has a very big role.  In postings, in promotions, in appointments of Vice Chancellors, this is an open secret. No one can say that it does not happen, and who has links with whom, only they will go up, so this has become a formalization, it is not that this  Were waiting for the rule, that affiliation still exists and it is not that it does not exist with other parties but there would be some degree of difficulty because now it can happen that if we accept this  There are 100 officers and out of them 70 have joined, there are associates and photographs have been taken, so these are ours, those who don't join are not ours, those who are not ours, then what will happen to them now? People will feel pressurized tomorrow.  If a new one comes then it will also be like this, it will be a scheme, yes, join it, your conscience and wisdom will be awakened, join the organization here, it is a very good organization for the country because what has happened to the government.  It seems that RSS has become very angry because that statement of Nadda Saheb had come out that we do not need RSS, BJP will be very big, then it has to eat the cake, then Mohan Bhagwat ji also gave speech and lecture.  Well, I have heard about it, and what now is that this is my personal opinion of RSS, okay, I do not have any data on these things, there is no trend visible that many children want to come with them.  They want to come like earlier it used to be that let's do some exercise, we are getting to learn something or something like that, now this has to be done directly by government officials, Congress has created a bit of hue and cry on this but the public has said something.  You haven't done much, you tell me, start going wearing white pants and that pant and that cap, this is office dress only, what happened when I joined the organization, I can wear dress now, like this shirt, this is my big I have this channel  The logo has been made like this, I am promoting myself, okay, this is mine, this is mine, I am not doing it for anyone else, okay, if you start wearing that too, then there is allusion in it, no.  Because look, there is no such dress for a government employee to go to the office which is inside civil, I am not talking about the people in uniform, anyone can wear what is inside civil and the world wears white shirt. what's the problem with that white  Shirt, now wear that pant, tell him that it is necessary, that it is the same, and take off the cap and keep it, and if you want to wear it sometime in between, then wear it, it is just fine and we are not facing any problem with this thing, how because of that person, he has no  A government official may have a personal ideal because they are all children of humans, they have the right to vote, they have their own opinions and their idol may also be that of their family, but how can you display this thing publicly?  How can it be that I am associated with it, then the work of all your officers will be done in the same way as we see the Speaker in the Parliament. You know, Speaker Sahib, he is supposed to be Speaker Sahib, but you know, all those officers are  Also, if they start looking like this then how will the public feel about it? Tomorrow if they come to do something against someone from BJP or nothing is happening somewhere or there are only people from the opposition or because these days what is there with the elections.  Address  It becomes a question of which ward gave where, that he gave and this one gave, this is against us and against him, now the officer has also been made to sit there, it is supposed to be neutral and the athlete appears to be neutral, look neutral, so let me tell you, it is a matter of saying. Nothing happens, everyone has something or the other. Opinion is fine but you should appear to be like that because they do it and then the judges also can.  Do it the lawyers can do it The government lawyers can do it Every buddy in the government organization can do it now in the government organization If I am the officer and I have joined like this and attend activity I have control of 500 200 people under me Chapada Se  From the clerk to all the people in every system, I will tell them through gestures and gestures that if you are going then you will  If you don't want to go, then this is AR. Do you understand what I am talking about, how arrogant it is to formalize it. Hey brother, we were secretly talking about it, what can anyone do with it, can anyone do anything with anyone, Amitabh.  I liked Bachchan, I liked Shahrukh Khan, I liked you, you can't go and change, there is some big opinion and ideology, and in the same way, any person can have their own opinion, but there is something within your duty, right? That when you will separate it or not, brothers and sisters, I am supposed to be neutral, RSS is political, even if it is not, it does not mean political, it is a cultural thing, oh man, amazing man, no one is speaking ahead, oh you, join me then.  Leave the job, become a preacher, walk on the path, what to do on these two boats, who forbade you to join, only after retirement, or are you busy with a job in between, do you feel like joining politics? Bye all. Means join RSS join any party and as soon as they do that, how many IS are there which are their points, this one has now become Lieutenant Governor, one IAS has recently been made, if you google who is the party then now it means it will be like this that if this ideology  If you are here, then while you are in the service, get associated with this ideology publicly and prove that yes, this is what we are and after that you will also get a reward. We want to show that no, it used to be like this only.  During the time of Congress, it used to be like this, I am not denying it, I am not a fan of Congress, when did I say that it would not have happened with Congress, it did not happen earlier, but brother, so much brazenness, so much in your face because no one came and interrupted it.  It's something like that, no, there is no interruption. If there is no interruption to anything, then it happens. Yes, it definitely happens, meaning, it is like that, yes, it definitely happens. It is something like that, yes, is there a film industry in this also? Yes, this is what happens in this.  Would  It is like this, it is like this, it is like this, this is the casting couch, it is like this, it happens there when we accept everyone everywhere in life and those people, it happens, yes, it definitely happens here, that's it.  The country will also accept, why are we accepting now? Why can't we say that brother, this should not happen and if it should happen, then work openly, otherwise Congress should also open some ideological organization of its own, okay TMC.  open it up too They have also opened which one, tell me their name and yes, there is an order that they can join, tell them, then make them a platform, become an open worker, wear the cap of a common man, where there is a government in Punjab, it is of a common man. Come on and say that if there is a common man's government, then all these government employees are common people, if not then tell me, my idol ji, come to Karnataka where there is a Congress government, then there they also say that you can wear ours or not.  wear it and see this  What is happening? I am surprised. What is happening? Are you not surprised at what is happening openly? How is it happening? Why is it happening? Have you not raised your voice against it? You have the nerve to do politics.  Then why don't you ask RSS, there are many NGOs from outside also which have this culture, now what does it have to do with money, what is the rest of the place, the rules are very strict, a government employee cannot do this, he cannot do that, it is not like this. Can do big rules are fine but if it can do this then this rule should be removed. According to me the original rule should be imposed again. What is your opinion please write in the comment section. Thank you very much."

    "title": "02 Things Which Middle Class Should Stop Celebrities From Promoting [N-OJ-Hri8OA].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, two things which celebrities are endorsing in India these days and according to me should not be done, give your opinion in the comment section, spread this thing and do not be influenced by these two things yourself and call out these things.  There is a need and I will tell you a little from the name, first of all, these are betting apps, these betting apps are absorbing the time of a lot of youth, they are sucking and are not taking them anywhere, there is emptiness and this means one.  In a way they say legalization of what they say is this gambling type of work, this is the work of course in the digital space, these entrepreneurs have to see that especially many people will say no, this is how it happens in foreign countries, why is it there but not here in India?  There are a lot of empty people, there is a lot of emptiness and you will fill it with these things, look at this drum of 11, the World Cup is going on right now, people are busy in 9s or don't know. What money are the teams being formed and not one by one? 10 10 15 15 teams are being formed or channels are open which are telling, brother, select this team today, select this team today and the public is busy in forming the team, brother, so much effort.  If you hit somewhere else, you will earn money. Crores of people have downloaded it and crores are engaged. Hey, if you have to do something then you make this app, why are you getting sucked? This team of 'Into This' will be formed and this is a talent and there is no big factor in it and youth has time to release this and call us as parents, call us as elders, this thing is not spread in the society, second thing is who I am.  I am very against this, the things like Gutka etc. which are marketed like that, by doing this like Juba Kesari and Itna Mere Ko Ajay Devgan, still I don't feel bad that much, I like two people. Looks worse than Shahrukh and Akshay Kumar's. It's fine for what ever reason. Praise. Say, I forgive Ajay Devgan for his mean body language. It's fine. He has been doing this for many years. Personality is like this and he is not.  Claimed himself in any other light but Akshay Kumar and Shahrukh Khan Bhai, so many pictures have become hits of yours, so much money have you earned, what is the need, I am not able to understand, what is the attraction in it, I am not able to understand pai am  Surely he must be paying the money, oh man, go and dance in weddings somewhere, the season is coming and do all the work, how low is this brand, I could have said that I like Shahrukh very much, I had not done this even I would have  Respected Akshay a lot, rest of his many things are very good in life, which are interesting but one thing is important and you see Akshay, you serials, he makes a lot of movies, that kind of toilet, a love story.  Made Padman, it has a lot of cases, all that remains, friend, I am not able to understand who are your advisors because the brand also has its value, that means you go to any government office and you see those marks, generally people spit.  It is so unhygienic, everything is useless, which one means it has become sexy, it means something to eat and drink, cleanliness thing, still a little of that energy drink, although all that is also nonsense but that  Do everything better friend, if earning money is like money, now today I am also a creator, many people come to me for ads, networking marketing and this sir, promote that some Fukku FM, this and that, I will tell you about that also sometime.  That we should read books, not listen to them. No one has reached anywhere by listening, but I don't feel like it. I feel responsible from within. I also know that money is not the whole thing. All you have to do is come and say, do you want to read books? I read this book like this, show the book to such and such, I read books like this and you will get to hear this book here, it is not done by doing like this, I will make a separate video on books, how should I read, which should I read, how should I promote, but then I promote  Myself, sell your product to yourself, do something of your own, this is very lazy, I think these people have so many products, look at Shahrukh, look at Akshay or even look at the cricketers, already you are promoting a lot of products. Okay, so why is it necessary to include this thing in it? Suppose you are earning Rs 500 crores, then do something else, or tell me, these people give so much money that there is little shame in being humiliated, come like us and do it right away.  Will you go normally? I don't like it, I like to do it to anyone and everyone, but why are you giving a chance to this kind of SA creator, I know what creator economy is and I can extrapolate your popularity.  Following and how much we get and if the offer comes then how much you would get but still I am saying that when like us you can concentrate on your brand image which is very important in front of your brand image.  If we can be conscious even if we have things like given ahead, then what is your compulsion? I want to ask this question through this video and you people who are viewers, subscribers and are listening, tell me what is your take, how do you feel.  that means that one  I would like to appreciate one person here, Sachin Tendulkar, he never indulged in drug addiction, although it means cold drink, cold drink, when to drink a lot, but there was a time, everyone used to drink cold drink, then Ramdev ji came, he took cold drink to the toilet.  Told the cleaner and then no one comes. More normally, that's fine, that big cold drink will still not be there, but Gutka is straight Gutka, now and like who is there? Virendra Sangal also I think he comes and with what face you come friend means I agree retired, money is always there, it is a good thing if you get it somewhere, but I am telling you, I know a lot of people who operate in the digital space. And there are opportunities to earn less, it is not so, if you keep your image and image right and whatever image you have, it will increase and then due to different brand, its value will be invested in something else, then according to me, consciously. All the celebrities should be rejected, they should be called out, go to Twitter's places, if the condition is bad, if the condition is bad, then attack these athletes. You can name and shame them, what is your problem, your picture is being seen, the Pathan worth a thousand crores is gone, the soldier worth a thousand crores is gone, the dinky will come now, it will be worth a thousand crores, so it doesn't pay, isn't it straight?  The question is to their marketing team, their sales team, their management teams who bring them brands, make them collate, they also have a message that we the middle class are now in big trouble, there is a lot of trouble, whatever else you have to do, you  Do it but these athletes are coming to betting apps, so many celebrities are coming to betting apps, cricketers are also coming and these other people are also coming and beyond these, the crackdown is also being tightened.  And yet these are coming, just look at what they are promoting, just take a look just because some ad has come to you, if you need to do something then ask, it is written on it that it is addictive, this will cause this.  If the children are engaged then don't worry, if this celebrity comes and says this, I am not even a celebrity, I am coming and saying this, I know that I can create so much awareness through this video that  It will be 100% beneficial for 500 Hajj people, this much number of views will definitely come, at least it may be more, if you cooperate, then maybe even 5,100 thousand people can be benefited if there is awareness that we do not want to waste our time.  If you want to delve into these things then I hope you will understand this thing and share it. If you have not liked the channel, if you have not shared and subscribed then you can do so. There are some issues like this which I raise.  Chahu and you people please share it, these are social issues, we should raise, discuss, share, once these will become talking points and once this news will reach because somewhere through social media, through forward tweet and its point.  It reaches because whenever it gets tagged or something like this in the form of a video or it will be productive then let's leave it. I believe Akshay Kumar ji has left it but his old agreement is going on. under their aids  It is still being watched so I feel Akshay has better sense has come for what ever feedback he must have got now they will see that means she is not coming next year because once there is a contract if you close that contract is that much  Till the day it will be shown, don't make any further contract and I have a direct request to Shahrukh ji that please friend, what do you mean, you are getting spoiled, okay, we have to make our own, it takes so many years to make. Suma Kesari and Akshay are like this and Ajay Devgan is in the role of falling, this one seems to be in character, I will tell him to do that one, keep going because to do all this, you need an attitude, but the mass are the big celebrities who have more influence.  So you should definitely avoid it and if Kajol ji is listening then please tell Ajay ji that you guys have been working hard for so many years and have done good work. Okay, you bring things related to your causes because you are religious.  You bring things, you bring other things, you bring good things, then why do you do this thing with him, then he becomes a complete tie tie fish, according to me, according to me, stop this one, okay, enough of this.  Okay, then stop it and do n't promote anyone else, then that celebrity will keep on going down, no big celebrity will come, what do these people do now, they took Ajay Devgan, after Ajay Devban, they took Shahrukh Khan, that and something else happened, then those two alone.  if needed then  He said that he took the player, he is health conscious and people follow him, he will come and say this, then people become guilt free. Those who eat and spit on joy, they think that Ajay Devgan has normalized it, Shahrukh has done it.  When Akshay did it, brother, when there are so many big people and they put Rajni dirty world in their mouth, which world comes below me, Rajni Gandha Khake, you are like that ad from a foreign country.  Don't the foreigners understand that they enslaved us, then we are enslaving them by eating tuberose. Hey brother, you are not enslaving anyone by spreading this filth, you are making fun of yourself, you are making fun of the country and this Bedi is AIDS.  They will have to be called out after eating something, the world does not come in one step by doing anything, it is okay that they have eaten the world in one step by doing this and look at their marketing, this will be a thing worth one, two, three or four rupees, how much will it cost?  I have never bought one, you guys tell me what would be the idea, such small pouches would cost only so much money but if such big stars are affording them and paying them such huge fees and yet they are coming shamelessly.  So look at how much their sales would be and how much would be their margins. Also calculate how many people they would be destroying. How many crores of Indians would actually be eating on a daily basis.  They should be able to afford these top ten stars in one ad. Till date, I have not seen three stars in any ad like Ajay Devgan, Shahrukh and Akshay, their people do different things, sometimes two are seen but these three are seen in some other ad.  If you have seen then tell me, that is, you are sitting with big money, so I hope you will share the awareness, thank you very much."

It is okay to tell things to your children too, so if you have taken a photo with a celebrity.  If you get photographed, will people grant you a higher IQ? They know that the celebrity was roaming somewhere, he went and got cheated, recently I saw that Shahrukh Khan was going out somewhere, doing something like this, they watch the clippings, okay, so there is something in it.  Big  He was doing such a trite thing and he was also irritated friend, he also eats expressions or why are you taking selfies, leave them aside, don't give money to everyone, it is not worthless to anyone, he is bringing happiness in your life, he is doing entertainment.

You will follow my words and write in the comment section that there is truth in your words and we will follow you. Give me more happiness and more, I am a satisfactorily giver, it's over, I have taken my own feeling and now I have to do things, so you also do this, only when you do it, you will go somewhere higher and will be free.  A lot of time is being wasted. Don't take selfies with anyone. Don't take anyone's autograph. Don't follow anyone. Don't sing praises of anyone. What is this? Dream 11 Fantasy Team This will win, that will win, I will follow this one. Don't follow anyone.  Do n't brag, even who are mothers, they live in the house of neighbor's child, some are living in the house of someone else's husband, no matter who is the wife of someone, I do n't even have this job, she is very good.  You don't know the starry story of his life because I only give so much consultant consultation, I know the truth about the houses of the whole world, I give it to big people too, so from outside it seems that inside the matter is a problem for many, so it is worth living in Au.  There is no one, this is a message to the middle class, your life is very good, you have been married once, you have two children, purpose fulfillment work is going on in life, the rest of them are not among the 99.  And you are living among them because you feel less about yourself, it is not less, your life is very good, everyone is living middle class in India, if you don't live in this then you will save a lot of energy and time. Second Zero Error Syndrome, there should be no mistake. Well, this is the conditioning of the middle class. For 30, 40, 50 years, a child who has been scolded and ridiculed a lot for committing a mistake in his childhood, what is the result? I recently spoke to you in a Sango Life Sat.  Although he is uploading the video on my other channel, in fact I may have worn the wrong t-shirt, this song Life Satras is a bigger channel of mine, it is fine and on that you can take platinum membership or it can also be downloaded from Workshop Pup or from the app.  You can also get youtube1 subscribers, people will watch, in the beginning they just want guarantee from the reason why I am telling the middle class, this release is not going to convince you, no one is going to run after you.  In the consultation which is highly paid, it is also told that this thing can be done like this, you can do it like this, it will not work, it will not work, it depends on your idea and details of execution can be given, no guarantee can be taken.  You have to try it, but what guarantee does the middle class need? There is so much fear before starting anything. I am saying that whatever is not costing money is okay, whatever you cannot sink into, you do not have to take a loan.  Normal youtube, if you are investing Rs 2 crores somewhere, then you should be afraid and should ask, it is understandable, but there are many such things where nothing is spent and yet you are not ready to try because you want guarantee of everything, I will join the gym.  I will become thin, it will depend on you brother, whether you will come to the gym every day or not, how much you will run, how much exercise you will do, what will the gym owner do, how can he take a guarantee, he can just say that you will come for one hour every day and then you will do the work.  It will not work if you go home and eat samosas, kachoris and all that chaat papdi, then nothing is going to happen there too, that is why stop asking these questions and all this. Third thing I want to tell you, again this is the biggest problem and it is related to this.  This is related to the second point but it is a different point, not being able to start from scratch just because you have taken commerce or you have taken science.  They are stuck in a similar job, do something unrelated, new and interesting. There is a lot of hesitation and fear in doing any work. The middle class, the lower class, the poor class, they have no fear of anything, but the people who are in the lower class, they have no fear.  Don't be afraid, he wakes up early in the morning and distributes newspapers, then he cleans the car, then someone goes and works on the motorcycles of Sugi Zomato. In the evening, in these four big cities, he does n't say no, no, no, I just car  But I only know how to fold clothes, he also knows how to give newspapers, he also knows how to do delivery, he also knows how to do something else in the evening, but now they don't since someone else will catch hold of him and say that he has to do this work, that 15-  Friend, you can do it in 20 days in a month, tell me which work is difficult, in which you need a degree and license, if you want to become a doctor, it will take 5 years, if you want to become a lawyer, it will take 3 years, but if you are not doing other such work.  There are some practical tasks that can be learned by you, like small business ideas, execute them, do not think again and again that no, no, no, I used to do this because I do a lot of variety of work, hence I always like to start.  Whenever you start something, you feel very light in it, like I have a channel, the big one has close to 2 lakh subscribers, Sango Life Sutras, this one has clarity for youth in it.  There is a small channel with 55000 subscribers and it is very real, subscribe to that too, when you start a new channel and it grows, there is a lightness and a different fun in starting a new thing because there  There was a kind of content, it was for that kind of people, it was for the elderly, here I have to tell something to the youth, okay, so the content here is of a different kind, so you can like it.  You have opened a dhaba and it is doing well. Then you opened another small shop and said in it, 'My dhaba is doing well, this is the only thing I know how to run. It is doing well, now you have to do something else, new thing.'  Whenever you start from scratch, you will get a different kind of happiness, you will get a different kind of fun, this is the message, please start sometime, if you want to learn astrology, now to learn astrology, you do not have to be a science or arts only. Must be Commerce or 12th pass or MSc or PhD. Anyone can learn it. Anyone who is educated or a little bit, anyone, anything. If you don't want to learn, want to learn cooking or anything, you can hold anything in your life.  Well, I will even guide people to learn something like tailoring, sewing clothes, this is going to become a big art. Hey, you will make us tailors. This problem of middle class comes again. Anything new is new. Before starting, we put a name beyond that, it means that the tailor will also call Manish Malhotra, is middle class okay or will he remain in 'O', the clothes made by him are useless, the heroines who roam around wearing them, be among them, learn something from someone, something new. Start something new, don't be afraid of starting something new, and what is the matter with people again, there is a lot of expenditure on education till the age of 20, 21, 22 and that expenditure of education does not take us anywhere.  I am not making anything, I am getting a job worth Rs. 30,40,00, people are fine at Rs. 99 and yet we have to pay 5% of that child's school fees to learn something new in 25 years, 28 years, 30 years, 35 years.  You are not even ready to spend, if your child's school fee is Rs 0000, then can you spend Rs 5000000 a month yourself in learning something new so that you can learn something new?  Learning brings betterment in your life or you can monetize it or you can focus your energy on it, then this is again a bonus tip that I want to tell to the middle class that be not only be not be afraid of.  Starting Something From Scratch But You Will Only Be Able to Start If You Have Kept That Learning Process Which  People forget that is what mostly I heard from Housewives that we used to study and work there, then we had a child, got married, then I took a break from seven to eight years, now I have taken a break from that thing, I think I am the same.  I could have done or will do the same, now how should I do that because I will be 38 years old now, so how can I go to the job that I had when I was 25 years old, now who will give it to me? Hey brother, you can do any unrelated work. You can do one thing, you can do a thousand more, so this is the larger message to all of you, please please try to do these three things, how much will you do, tell me I will just do not be in love  Off anybody, it is a waste of time and energy. No one feels like following someone after taking a photo. No one likes it. Okay, if you want to see so many photos, then look at your wife's and tell her.  Friend, I have a craze for seeing a lot of photos of fighting girls. You can make me a portfolio of 50 photos of girls. I often laugh at people while talking to a good photographer, but I am talking practically about my wife.  Look at the photo, tell her no, I want to see the photo of a sexy girl, then make your wife sexy. Tell me, brother, you become me, if you are not feeling it, then come with me to the gym, take that walk with me, the marriage becomes better, or do you want to live with your wife?  Of Stay in my life, stay in my husband's life or stay in your life, it does n't last, I have to see someone's photo, I have to see this, I have to see this, I have to see this, I have to cry in his eyes, if not that one every time, then that one, I do n't know where in the feed, who is mine?  It has come to my mobile and account from Malaika Roda ji every second or third day and when I come out of the gym, it comes to me somewhere because I also do some research, it is not that I am searching, but I am not searching at all.  i watch my video she comes to her i three I scroll in a second but I know she is coming Mal and look at her views 3 lakh 5 lakh 10 lakh Malaika ji Malaika ji she is building her body from the gym, you have to take a photo from the back, you have to take it from the front, see people Many times we feel a little disturbed that oh what are you talking like this but this is what you are looking at, why is all of you showing that, open that one, that one, I am telling you, I don't want to see it at all, tell me how openly.  I am there then I don't know from where it comes in my feed, I do n't want to see such things, I am sharing the knowledge with you that such things should not be seen, but still it comes, once it comes, it means no matter how many hands you have.  You walk fast, while doing this I am looking at my shorts etc. like is it okay or I am doing some research on how much is the retention time, I will not make it technical but it means that I have got 200 views on youtube.  Have come  Seeing this, Malaika ji said Malaika ji and her dog, I am not criticizing them. Malaika ji, I am endlessly criticizing them, their dog or the people watching them. What benefit are you getting? How much happiness do you get?  There is someone in your house who is married and someone who is not, so brother, do it and focus on each other, he has 5 lakh views, I have 25000, it is a great insult in the house, so it is okay. Gyan Gyani Baba becomes clarity giver number one, you have 15000 views, seeing this the dog Pomeranian is getting so many views, he was not climbing inside the car, he is climbing, so just a video of him has been made, it is a big insult, no problem, ok What are we, what is the work of the wind, it is the work of the lamp to move, it does its work, okay, I do my work, this is a poem by Kumar Vishwas, maybe if someone is right, we have to do it, the wind will move, it is the work of the lamp, everyone has their own.  You have to do it, okay, so please don't deliberate, even if you don't waste your time in deliberation, many time-wasting situations will come, I am telling you, some friend will come, some situation will come, something or the other will be seen or you.  Your heart will be troubled, you will do something somewhere else, you will do it but be conscious, do not praise, if you want to praise then do your own praise, do not praise others, when everyone will start praising themselves and your  If we start being happy then this will reduce the number of useless people which we have oppressed. Sir, these have come, they have come, they have come, sir, they have come, they have come, move away, tttttt, move the car and leave.  What will happen to any minister for me in the month of Sawan? And that is just a joke of the minister. Yes brother, he will get the boy changed. I am telling the real time posting of Haryana. This is not a fictional story about the boy. Minister will get the posting done, sir, no, that posting is not available there these days, do n't do it like this, there are rules and regulations, it is a law, okay, get her a job, it means get her a job, means she has some job, no job for her, yes.  To get a job these days, you have to go there, you have to give the SSC exam, you have to give it like this, there is selection there, this one is good, okay, so and so's is from my aunt, this one, get the contract, this one from the road is from the small road. No sir, its contract is also issued on the road like this. Nowadays tenders are issued, there is an auction, there is a tender, there is no exchange of girls, there is no job, no tender is given to you, why should I run after you, go to Susare, go to Susare.  I am a slang from Haryana This is not a fictional story The poor I will say to the lower class because I have to rub it in the middle class mouth by doing this  The poor class is very smart to teach many times, not to be in love with anyone, they know who is of use to me and who is not of use, so they do the same, it is okay and they do not live in love with anyone from their heart. From inside they have a nagging feeling that he has something which I don't have and I have to take what is middle class, whatever I have, it can only be this much, it will not grow, hi is his car, hi is his clothes, hi is his looks.  Only then would she remain the same  The middle lower class is coming, it is increasing, there is a warning to the middle class, and friend, in this way, we will move ahead, we will also move ahead in these days, it is okay, these are on their own way, if you audit carefully, then please the person who is your  It is of no practical use, don't be in his care at all. If you want to sycophant, if you want to take a favor from someone, then it is a different matter, then do it, there is no problem in that, yes sir, that works, that is Indians.  I know it very well, I am not refusing but forcefully, don't be like that in Fukre Pan, I hope you all will understand this message and please share, thank you very much."

    "title": "04 New Castes  In India [KamA-3fftY8].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, four new castes have come to India, I am telling the latest test, it is going to be a very amazing video, the results of the elections have just come, their analysis will also be done, what is in store will also be done in the future, watch it without any stress, enjoy and watch this.  The kind of analysis I do is my style, what is there for me and my viewers, so these four new castes which are told by the top leaders, the first caste which is the new castes like youth  So one caste is our own youth caste, second is women power, women power, two third is your poor people, poor people and fourth is farmers, so I do not belong to any of these four and that is my core audience too. Today it has been defined very well, so what is there for us if we are not farmers and we are not poor and that woman power thing, what is there in woman power thing that we gave a gas cylinder and gave something else.  This Nari Shaktik is the same, isn't it? She gave me some scheme, dear sister, gave me Rs. 000, she is the same, so if the woman who is beyond herself, then that woman is also not in it and youth is the one who is dreaming, that is, she has to find a job.  If he is doing something great for you, then the top leader of the top political party has defined this, which is very good, that OBC OBC was running.  Caste census was going on, the whole system has been abolished, that system of SC, ST, OBC has been abolished and the public has told that because it was shown and it was said that it will be started in Bihar, now it is like this, it is like that and that.  Told that an attempt was made to divide this country, on top of that, on top of these things, now this one is one thing to divide and another thing is to classify, so now this has also been classified and it was also told that most of the  Who  It is there in it, it is there in it too, but I am not discussing these people because the world is talking about them. If you want an eye-opening video on farmers, then farmers should write because I have a burning desire to make that video.  To share with you people because no one has the courage to explain like that, so we will analyze that video separately. Today we will analyze this one that brother, if we are not farmers, we are not even poor, we do not get this cylinder.  And dear sister Hajar wala  Work also because it also has qualification, is n't it? Everyone is below the same level, so brother, then how can we take advantage because the government's focus is on this, one can cry, the typical cry of the middle class, what is the income for me?  No no, we do not need the support of the government, that is why the government is not giving it, so there is no condemnation of the government, there is condemnation of the new political party and no condemnation of any leader because that is the vote bank.  If we concentrate on these to the maximum then we are less because these are the four people who are the maximum in India, so how do we benefit, how do we take advantage, then we have a way to take advantage of it in two-three ways so that these people will benefit. So, how can we take advantage of that benefit? We have to think like that, second order thinking. Only this thing will be told how to think that it will benefit the bottom of the pyramid, the poor will be a little less poor, the farmers will benefit, the women will benefit.  There will be some benefit to the youth if they get a job. Brother, while we are sitting like this, I will also say 'Laat Saheb' which was used in old times. We are sitting comfortably like 'Laat Saheb', we are not struggling and my audience is the same.  The rest of the channel are my other channels, Clarity for Youth is for youth, which is like Sango Life Sutra, Real Estate is right, there are separate channels for astrology, there are more channels, their audience is separately defined and there.  You are most welcome, but if you are not the Lat Saab type, then you are not my audience. Now I am telling you this openly, here is the audience who wants to earn money by sitting and thinking, not by blackening their hair in the sun, not by turning it white.  If there are factions like me, it is of knowledge, not of struggle, not of sunshine, if the edge is less then the one who thinks is individual and the one who wants to earn money from knowledge is the subscriber of the channel, here the stock market is one stock market.  The waiting period that was going on in India was that it will be seen that after May-June, FIIs will come first, the stamp has been put, hat-trick has been done on Hindi Hotland, if you look carefully at the map of India, they will make a color in it and show that this is the biggest party. Where is the state rule going on? If you see, if you see, you will see Haryana touching Rajasthan here, Haryana touching UP here and Rajasthan touching UP, now MP is visible below MP, Gujarat is visible here. from gujarat  Maharashtra is stuck to it and then from here to there, below Madhya Pradesh, there is Chhattisgarh, then Uttarakhand is also stuck to Uttar Pradesh and here to Delhi, it is the whole in between which is called if.  If there is a fat man then his whole stomach, all this, all this setting is completely set, okay, and in this, something or the other will fall in Bihar and Bengal also, okay, according to the votes, now this certainty has started coming that and that one who  the thing was the word  That its guarantee is like it is said, Tiger Ka Hukam, I am seeing a new slogan in sync with it and I am very fond of its marketing value that its guarantee is fine, like Tiger Ka Hukam or something, do you feel its rhyming?  So tell me, I am finding a lot of brand value in this new slogan and some how I tell you my state Dispina Being a devotee and being a devotee and being this party that party I am nothing to anyone, okay, I have decided so far  I said that I have not done it yet, but still I am feeling peace in my mind, as an investor, as a stock market investor, as a real estate person, there was a feeling of restlessness, the restlessness will set in somewhere, now what after this result comes?  You guys, brothers and sisters, are feeling less uneasy in your personal life. I am talking about personal life. I mean, yes, it has also come, so I am telling you that there is as much peace as on election results and that is enough. I am a patriotic person, I too am fine, had I won the World Cup, I would have enjoyed it, I wouldn't have got so much peace, it is his pain that he did not win, for a person like me, who does not watch much cricket, but after this selection, I feel like it is fine, it is ok, friend.  Okay, prepare lunch, now let's work ahead, the world has moved ahead, otherwise it was happening like this, I don't know what will happen, now it seems that yes, now what do we say next month, there will be a grand function in the month of January, which will make everyone happy.  peace will come and end  I am looking forward to that personally as Sanatani, I also have to visit and am seeing that, then that picture will come on 25th January, the fighter will be something even better than that, then two things are absolutely game changers, one will be an event on 22nd January. Which event of January is it, write down 22nd January 2024 and then there is the picture of 25th January and now slowly it is coming to light that then the other leaders of their opposition. They are also going for a holiday. They should go for 10-12 days. According to me, it is a good thing. Working 24 hours a day doesn't suit everyone. Anyway, it is okay so they should go. Everyone should be relaxed. They too have calmed down now and can take a long breath.  The country is fine, it means fat, whatever, yes, now I understand what is our work, let us concentrate on our business, so now the core audience of us is mine, brother, the stock market is one F I's are going to come, consent story.  The poor will increase. When one becomes a little rich, one will use good soap oil, one will buy something to eat, one will paint the house, one will get a home loan and there will be no financial inclusion. So much is happening, if the money is coming, then there will be a lot of banking sector, financial sector, private banks.  One more thing I am telling you is that when FIIs will come in the future, they will not invest money in your Rs 100,500,2000 crore company. 70000 87000 are invested in companies with a market cap of Rs 1 lakh 1.5 lakh 2 lakh crore. These are the low hanging fruits. I am seeing more of them going into blue chips. The run up of small caps is quite high. If you see, the run up of mid caps is also there.  Right now, inside the large cab, attention will be paid to the big banks which are low hanging fruits, whose names, if told, they will say, ok, you are telling me this, I mean, everyone knows this, or Nifty.  Yes, BSC is in 50 only, BSC is in Nifty 50, okay, so this Indian story seems to be going towards Amrit Kaal with Saree in the next 5 years, pay attention to your money, those who have money, pay attention to money, on these discussions  Don't give it because you are not going to get anything anyway because you have defined the syllabus, brother, there is no exam for you, so you all become like the moon that you have to take the reflected light of the sun, we mean direct.  Meaning, just like the light comes from the Moon, it is directed towards the Sun, that is, it is reflected, it has no luminous power of its own, if the Moon does not shine, it is cold, so now the direct benefit is to be taken in such a way that see where the money is being given.  Is cement being given in infrastructure? Which are the stocks of cement because that is the focus going beyond that? If it is going in financial inclusion then which banks can do good for you? You will increase consumption.  If the soap oil thing increases, then what are the stocks that can be there? Beyond that, pay attention to the real estate sector. The government is also giving affordable housing and all these kinds of things and incentives and all that and more on what is to come.  If she insists then what will happen to her when the dear sister is like, now there is a culture of freebies, now if the other party distributes it then you distribute it to the Revdi yourself, then that means you are giving it to your sister, which is also?  Very fine because if money goes to women, I am always a fan that if you have to give free seeds then give them to women because if you give something to a man then he will put the beedi cigarette in tobacco and if 000 is in the woman's account in alcohol.  Okay, if even Rs. 2000 goes, then she will not spend it on herself, she will spend some on drugs, she will spend on children, she will spend some on the family and she will get some benefit in the direct positive economy.  So no matter which government or party it is, when it provides a free bus service to women or gives some money under Laadli Brahmin, I am for that because it kick starts the economy, whose economy is there, there is no middle in it.  The class likes it very much, hey, he gave free seeds, he gave a lot, you see this, the biggest issue in this election, which I felt could spoil the economy, was the OPSO pension system, the discussion about it.  Now it has ended because a lot of it was being made, especially in Rajasthan, a lot of money was being encashed in Chhattisgarh that if they get this, this will happen, this will do, then the people there, because everyone is not beneficial, it goes to only one section now.  If he is there, then by doing this, he will not make any noise, if he is saved from that, then this thousand 2000 and after doing all this, it is fine, it does not put so much load beyond this, because this  Life in the scheme is long anyway, there is never going to be another Hajj, so the value of one Hajj will be equal to 0 in two years or four years. If inflation is going on then it is still okay. OPSO will keep increasing, okay so this is a good positive thing.  We have to pay attention to investment. We have to pay attention to real estate. As the people from the lower classes will come and their power will increase, they will come to big cities and will get help. If the government will help, then they will need real estate. They will not be able to buy that much. No government is making the rich to buy real estate only, but they will definitely live on rent, so if someone owns real assets, he will make a lot of money, so if you are in the lot-sap category and you are in the lot-sap category.  There is no shame in being in this category, no one is born a lark, that is also a struggle in life and every body wants to reach that stage in life where they can earn money without having to spend too much time on their own. In life, those people should observe this channel of mine for observers because when you observe the trends in life, you see the observed and then from the trends, you figure out where you are going to reach and how that knowledge can be monetized.  So it is very fun like a hobby, discussing in the air, this is good, this is bad, let that come, let it come, being a brother is what has to be, no one can stop it from your and my individual desires.  Nothing has to happen, it has to happen as per the wishes of the people, now one is the other, there are two factions, one is winning, in politics, one is not winning, simple things, the one who is not winning has no story, they do not know how to tell some stories. Many people say, no, it is false, this is a phrase, oh brother, it is true, it is true, there is something, a little true, a little false, sometimes happy, sometimes sad, a little sour, a little sweet, sometimes something has happened, there is nothing here, blue divided silence.  Here it is, just came like this, did it like this, then went on leave, came again, tell me now, why give me, because now you will be tired, does not get tired, next, does not let me get tired, next, this is a great story, now this will happen, now  Let's see this, now let's do that, now it is going to be like this, people say that it is fun here, so where people are having fun, people will go there, now not in that, why does this make it so much fun, it will be like this.  No, it wo n't happen like this, then that word has come, isn't it a guarantee because  India runs a lot on guarantee. Brother, how much guarantee do you take? Yes, guarantee because when you buy something, there is a guarantee behind it, so whoever is listening to me, I am telling you that I am a consultant, Prashant Kishor, I am not but still I am telling you if  People of a particular party are listening to him, this is a very good line, hold it this time, this is the election line, this is the guarantee, just hold this boat, it will sail beyond 400, I cannot say but it will definitely cross 300, so hold.  Let's keep this thing and the upper middle class middle middle class which is my core audience or the rich people, don't be unhappy, the rich are not unhappy, the rich are there, they know how to do it, but the one who is my audience, I am the progress of the lower one.  If it happens, it is your benefit. If it happens to you alone, then it is not and the government or father, whatever they call master, my father, the king, helps only those who need it. If you do not need it, then you are fortunate that you are above that thing.  There is no need to be sad in the fact that your own brothers and sisters are being helped. With the help of those same brothers and sisters, if they are here and you are here, then if you are linked to them in their progress through the stock market of the economy and  The Real Estate and Everything So as they go up, they will also take you up, it is not that they will go up and you will come down, it is not that those who are thinking like this are not thinking individual.  You are not thinking. My aim is to make thinking individual through this channel and there is no negativity spread in any video. It does not seem hopeless anywhere. I do not do this to anyone. Hey, this is not dirty, we have to take everyone along, everyone should come together.  It's okay if someone comes sometime, the writing is on the wall. It does n't matter whether you like it or not. It doesn't matter whether you like it or not, the writing is on the wall.  You can find it, you can concentrate on it, by crying and doing more devotion, by doing more clapping, there is no benefit in doing more, he is winning, he is winning, very good, look at yourself, what happened to me, what benefit did I get, what benefit can I get, what is the next announcement.  What is going to happen, what can happen, what will happen with that happening, what things will increase, what is the meaning of women empowerment, what will be the benefit if more money comes into the hands of farmers, if something happens to the youth, what will be the benefit if poor people get some relief?  there will be benefit in that Where can there be benefit, exactly how can it be, if you reach that place in advance, then as soon as there is benefit, you have already reached there that come, let's go, let's go, by doing anything, you will automatically be on top and you will  If you keep discussing like this then there is no use, I hope you guys liked the video, please share it with people, like it, thank you very much."

    "title": "05 Belief Systems Which Middle Class Needs To Break [hV7vVXAYyuo].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, five belief systems for the middle class which the middle class needs to crush immediately if they want to go up in status in the coming times or want to remain in the same status. I am going to tell you five belief systems to crush for progress in your life. Listen to the five, how many of these would you like to crush and agree? Write down the number, the first, the third, the fifth, the first, the second, the fourth, whatever or all the five from the first, then the first one, before this, mine.  A video has come, Why Middle Class is Now Shirley has given information about that phenomenon of becoming poor, now I am coming here to give the solution and it can also emerge as a great series, if you people want to subscribe to that video.  I will also give the link to this video. There has been a lot of good response and comments on that video. The first believe system which the middle class needs to crush is self- victim hood.  In that comment section of the middle class, you will also see more general conversations, we are being looted, we are paying taxes, middle class is that class, if there is rich class, middle class is lower class, only middle class is that class which is rich.  There is a bird in the poor too, there is a bird in the poor, there is a bird in the poor, it is natural, there is a bird, there is a bird in the poor too, because they have fun, they get free seeds, this is so  You don't even pay tax brother, you become rich, it is difficult to become rich, it is easy, you become poor, you take ration, you take help from the government, you all have to remember the middle class and the big problem is respect and  I am speaking with a feeling of empathy and understanding. It may sound harsh but I am speaking only for the benefit. While a father is teaching a small child to ride a bicycle, he runs away holding the seat from behind and when the child learns to ride a bicycle,  When a child goes to school, they leave him or you must have seen that they remain attached to the side of small children, when they learn it, then they remove it. In the same way, the government is the father and if the citizens are children, then the child who is  He has not learned to ride a bicycle, he will keep holding him, now he is enjoying being held all the time in his life and does not want to ride a bicycle openly, aha ha, I do n't want to ride at all, I will remain poor, so it's okay then stay poor in life. won't be able to enjoy all the joys  But the middle class is that child who has learned to ride a bicycle. Now he has learned to ride a bicycle but he is saying, \"Father, why didn't he hold me, I have to ride the bicycle myself, why am I not getting the push, don't ride.\"  Don't ride a bicycle then go down, how to go down brother, the self-victim of the middle class will have to come out of the hood. The rich also pay tax and if they are saving the tax somehow, then you become rich, do business on your own land.  held a gun  I am from a middle class that you have to be 30 years of age for the IS exam, you have to give six attempts in UPSC, you have to give 10 attempts, the bank balance is zero for 30 years and garbage comes to mind, that knowledge whose monetization is worth Rs.  No, that knowledge cannot be used anywhere. Harappa Dar, what happened in Harappa Mojdar, how did the Quit India Movement happen? Sitting remembering everyone's date. Turmeric Valley happened in 1576, Katu India, when did the partition of Bengal take place in 1940, the middle class knows everything, go to the US, our people are winning all the quizzes to reach there, the middle class has all the knowledge to work in it.  There is no one and he enjoys being in the self-victim hood just to show his knowledge. You have to break this belief system. Do n't go into the self-victim hood. We are the ones who pay the tax. Only the middle class pays the tax. Then it gives, don't give, don't earn, do n't give tax, open it ready, open it, you open it ready, the country is free, neither is our democracy, nor can anyone do anything, neither do you have to sell tea, you have to sell it, or you have to do a job, it's your choice.  No, we were told this syllabus, father and mother told us to study, do this, life will become like this now, if it did not happen, then maybe they had told us wrong, now change this, tell me what will happen after crying 24  The cry of the hour is that reservation is the biggest problem. If reservation is removed, then middle class. Hey brother, how many total jobs are there on reservation. I will make a separate video on reservation. Even if you remove the essence of reservation, everyone will get a job. Then everything will be fine, then you will pay tax again.  Then again they got sick, then those who have jobs are happy, everyone is happy, there is a lot of confusion in the middle class and what is that problem, I will tell you about the belief system which one needs to be.  A second belief system is the middle class's need to be crust syndrome, we have to become something, my child should become something, we have to become something, we are not interested in earning money but in showing that we have become something and that marriage market is also of the middle class.  Marriage Market There is no marriage market of rich and poor. The marriage market that exists is only of middle class. Yes brother, what have you become, you have become a government servant. Abuse the government in everything, but get government jobs.  Everyone wants the rest of the government. Everything is bad. Roads not built, no infrastructure, no public health. Politicians have eaten up the money. This scumbag is dirty. This government job is wanted by everyone. Everyone is interested in it because if you want to become something then in the future if you become something and you  If you tell that, you will remain at the same level. Do such work that you cannot tell. I know such people, they sell newspapers at 5 o'clock, they sell clothes on vehicles till 6 o'clock, at 6 to 8 o'clock. Now I am not saying that you start doing it, come to the comment section, then I will do this, listen to him, you can do some other work, you will have to use your brain, there is a lot, there will be videos on that also, not all in one. Can tell 5 to 6:00 pm Newspaper 6 to 8 pm Cleaning clothes on the car 8 to 11 am [Music] Earns 50 700 Haj Ash Krishna Kumar 12000 Brother, he is doing five jobs worth Rs. 12000. He is doing five jobs worth Rs. 12000. He is just catching up. He just doesn't know where to invest the money and how to save it. He will come to know as soon as we tell you, so don't be in the trap of becoming something now. What will this person say? Newspaper hawker, Jabang delivery boy and Ube Rolla driver. What will they say? He is not interested in getting his slaps. Women are like that, they are four hours of beauty.  She is working at a parlor and then she has opened something of her own. She is doing all this. Third, the believe system which has to be crushed is for the middle class. If the wife works, then who will raise the children, what will happen to their education? This is the disease of the middle class, only brother and wife.  If she works, what will happen to the children's education? Who brings up the children of the maid who comes to your house? I do n't know why we adopted the belief system because it is not possible to maintain the life without the help of mother-in-law.  Mother in law saath rakhni nahi paspass rehna nahi jo mein channel all the videos of real estate, I am tired of speaking, staying close, son sister should not stay with parents and comment who will take care of the parents, I am theirs to take care of them.  It is not necessary to live in the next room of the room, I can live in another house at a distance of 7 meters, I can also live in the flat above and to take care, money takes care, no son or sister takes care, nurses and doctors take care.  Is  Does the attendant take care or takes care of the money earned? It is the misconception of the people that he takes care. No, how will we maintain two houses? We will take the money on rent, son, you adjust yours, give him something, those are my videos, then they will be long. This will happen because I have to crush the believe system and I am making this very passionately. To make the middle class aware and awake, you have taken it in a commercial. In 55 years, you would have taken it for the child.  So, in old age, your son would have stayed with you for free. What is the problem of living with your son? You will live next door, you will stay in your house, you will not have to pay rent to him, why would he go to Bangalore? He runs to Bangalore only then, the one who lives in Gurgaon in Delhi runs away because he has a mother-in-law and  Mother doesn't want to be with him so he goes away with the excuse of someone else, there is nothing wrong with doing wife's work, children grow up well, women who work also grow up, their wives are called home makers.  Don't give respect by speaking. Housewife used to speak, wife used to feel bad earlier. They came up with the English term for middle class. I am a home maker. If you are home maker, the girls and ladies and women and women and mothers and sisters are working.  Are home breakers What are they giving India has less female workforce participation than Pakistan People of India should be ashamed of this Bangladesh is at 32 India is at 19 and in the middle class This is less than 9 per cent. Even in India, if you pick up 100 women and look at them, then among those who are going to do jobs, there will be more people from the lower class, as soon as middle class is created, there is no need to work, no, husband will earn, if husband earns, then middle class will come.  You will become a poor class because those who are poor class are coming up, everyone works there, they are used to everything, so you have to break this belief system. Fourth belief system, I want the best, middle class wants the best in everything, if they want a house then they want the best.  Needed  If you want a job then you want the best, you want to educate your child in the best school, do n't know which is the best school, I will make a very good video on this, please write in the comment section, this is the biggest stupidity of wasting money because in the hospital, Money is charged and no one bargains with what is charged for the school fees of a child. You will have 10 Diwalis, right now you have to give 20 diyas or 25 diyas of ₹1. Beyond this, women are  You will be seen bargaining and saving a lot of rupees, but you have to pay 12000-15000 rupees a month on school fees because brother, we want to give the best education, so I will break the myth of best education that today India  I have the best education anywhere and beyond that, how much money should be spent and where does he go to get the best education? Then finally, what does he do after going to Canada and what does he want to go?  I will make videos beyond that too, you must watch this belief system, you have to break it, you don't want the best, you want what is appropriate for you, you have to get a finder that is appropriate for you.  It is necessary because one has to show the best. Hey brother, take whatever is useful. If you keep doing best in everything then many things will not be taken. Everyone cannot be taken as best. 100 in every subject.  If you go to get 10000 marks then you have to fail in many subjects, this is also a fact, so this is a belief system, I want the best, don't go for the best, take decent things, okay, the last fifth will be made in the form of a series, for those who  Have not subscribed the channel, do it, many people are doing new things also, that previous video should also come, hope you watch it. The fifth and biggest thing is that the young generation is roaming around with this burden. I have to fulfill the dreams of my parents or my father, those are the outdated dreams of your father, there is no use even if they are fulfilled, my son is like my father, let's say he is a clerk somewhere or a group officer somewhere and works in the secretariat somewhere. They say, my son becomes an IAS, my daughter becomes an IAS, this is my dream, they are making life pleasant in the pursuit of dreams, dreams are not being fulfilled or they are saying dream, dream big, this is all a coaching system, isn't it, see the videos.  on this day  It was only for this that Modi ji was filling the nomination, that DM is the returning officer, he is sitting, that is a clip of one second, where the Prime Minister is sending and all those meetings like this, the name is his own and one is for his nomination.  There is a person and he is sitting like this, that is half a second, that means there are 543 constituencies in India, in which becoming an IAS in the PM's constituency is 4500 IS officers.  Look at its ratio, what will happen and elections are held in 5 years, but calculate its probability, then 890 will come in front of the point, but it has just shown for all you know, you will not become DM of Varanasi, you will go and become Daatewada somewhere else.  Then what will you do and what are the chances of becoming that? How many become IAS, clear UPSC, first only 180 are made, out of which 90 are from this one and 90 are from that.  In that 90 also, the golden ones have come and on top of that 12 people are giving children, so what is the probability if your child is at 8th position in his class in 10th or at 6th position then how many sections are there in lakhs of schools in that section? At number seven, don't put the burden of dreams on your children. It is only the middle class that puts the burden on your children. A poor man does not say that he dreamed, he says, 'Brother, do whatever you want, don't put the burden of my dreams on me, I have nothing.'  If there is a problem, the child can do anything and he has nothing to lose, but mostly our middle class is living in fear, no, this should not be done, if it doesn't happen, then what will happen, that all these diseases are, first of all, self- victimhood.  I live in this disease again, I have to become something, then my wife will not work, what does it mean if my wife will not work, you are playing a cricket match, there are two batsmen, one batsman will not score even a single run. If the other one has to make it, then if he gets stuck and does not score a single run, then if the over changes, he has to bowl only six balls, then the made in over will be out, then brother, how many runs will be scored, now even if one score, the other one will pull it.  If a woman works as a teacher then she will get Rs 30,35,400 thousand in cash, neither will she have to pay tax nor will he boost her SIP or loan, so some adjustments have to be made in getting women to work and Then it happens because the husband does not want to carry his towel in the house because he is so poor, then the woman says, brother, you have given me so much work, now how should I do a job on this, brother, with all the work he has given, he must be able to do both the jobs.  If you go to do this, there will be help at home also, children will also take help, there is a period of two, four, five or six years, those small children start walking and start going to school, after that, the woman sitting in the house is coming from the middle class.  throughout my audience  If there is any woman of middle class who does broom and potting utensils, then write in the comment section. Yes, we are middle class, my salary is Rs 2 lakh, it is Rs 1.5 lakh, whoever is in the middle class, and my wife does broom and poaching.  Those who prepare food are also becoming extinct. Middle class women are also preparing maids and a stage will come when the woman of the house who is educated is already here.  Her father is an angel and has passed all schools and colleges and has scored higher marks than her husband. Her ability to earn money is less than that of the maid who is working in her own house. This is the matter of most concern.  I am telling the rates of big cities. In small cities, people can divide by 2, divide by 1.5, whatever figures I am saying, but there the purchasing par patti formula is used.  But in a big city like Delhi, in Gurgaon, if you see, Meds are earning 25 30000, check your seven crores, crores, crores, sap sa koti, 4000, 4000, 5000, 4000, 5000, fast, fast, fast, 45 minutes, 50 minutes, 600 in the morning, starting from 6.  11 Then ask about all those things in the evening, interview them and their husbands.  Some are doing contract work, some are doing mechanic work, some are doing auto rickshaw work, some are doing so. If this belief system of the middle class is not broken then it is going to be a matter of concern. This is writing on the Wall, how many people could understand this? Please write SA, it is ok if you understood and if you don't understand then write NSA is ok and please share with your friends. Thank you very much."

    "title": "05 Important Questions Answered ｜ Must Watch For Subscribers [ERJydEIfWX0].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, this is a very interesting video, it will be a lot of fun for the subscribers, five questions are being asked a lot, some of them are direct, some are awkward, I will try to answer them, first let me tell you the five questions which I am going to answer in this video  Yes, the first question is Guruji, whose side are you on, like a pot without drinking, you do this and that, sometimes here, sometimes there, what is your purpose, what is it, I mean what is happening, then I will tell you this, secondly that there are some things against the policies of Rahul ji and Congress  You don't speak in the name of Modi ji, why is it so? This was also asked to me in the comments, so I will answer on this as well. Thirdly, you talk a lot about higher order thinking. What is this higher order thinking? I mean, I will answer on this as well. Fourthly, it is very interesting.  You must listen to this because it is a very clear question that BJP versus Congress which is better for the middle class, a clear question, I will try to answer it, you tell me and if you liked the answer, do listen to it, if not, then how, if not an ideological video  You will know that I come every day and do something  There should also be clarity, otherwise many people, even new ones, keep thinking what is the agenda, from whom has he got the money, whose betting is he doing, so that too will be known, you will know a little bit in this video, in the fifth I have something on anti-defection law.  I gave knowledge to some subscribers, I had made a video recently, so I will give clarity on that as well, that I had recently released my video about how many seats Cha June is getting, so he will answer these questions, listen carefully  So first let's start with whose side I am on, so whose side am I on, so are you a pin bandi boy, are you a pot, okay you are a bottomless pot, it might seem like I am enjoying the taste of politics, I am enjoying the taste of politics and the people of Haryana  Mostly people enjoy the taste, okay, there is no need to put too much mind into it, but there is no need to give them so much respect, you have to see that they are service providers, as it means it is very good, the one who has good service, Take it, it is number portability, Airtel is not providing good service, so brother, take that.  If you are not enjoying it then go to etel, do they fight among themselves, just think about them like this, if you get the answer then enjoy, whoever is saying whatever you want, whatever doesn't seem right, tell me the person saying it.  Someone or the other is needed, now the second question comes that Rahul ji is less on Congress and more on Modi ji, so I want to explain it very well, first of all, Rahul ji does not have anything so much that anything can be said against him, he is the king who has the power Speaking against him is not even the correct word, questioning is the correct word because the one who is in power should question him, but here I would like to ask a question as an example, Rahul ji said that he will give Rs 8,500 to every woman.  The big public says that the country will be looted, where will the money come from, this will come, that will come, but has Modi ji said this? Modi ji definitely said that they will take away the buffalo, they will take it, they will take away the mangalsutra, thankfully he did not say that give me  we will take one of the kidneys okay because the way the debate is going on  It is going on, anything can be said, that's okay, but why did he not say 8500, why did he say what will happen to the fiscal policy, what will happen to the fiscal deficit, what will happen to the country's finances, he did not say this, the public is saying it but he did not say that the Congress people are doing this  What are they giving for free? Why are they giving Rs 8500? They did not tell the women, you should understand that what you are protesting against, even Modi ji is not opposing it. Brothers and sisters, what is the policy of Congress which the BJP government has  Did you stop MNREGA? Did you stop MNREGA? Modi ji had said in the parliament mockingly that I will keep it alive and beat the drum but it was released during the time of Covid and after that brother this is a different good policy to keep some balance in the country's economy.  Kokin, who was an economist, has a theory that the state has to spend money and do all this. So it is not that MNREGA has ended. The highest allocation of MNREGA has been done by this government. That government did not do anything.  no policy basis  He created it and ran it, he is very good in execution, he was very good in expanding it, he was very good in ideas, he does not have any ideas, what original thing did he bring, he brought demonetization, you know whatever was of Congress, he took it forward  We did it further and it gave a very good result. Yes, the names of the policies became different. Add Atal in any of them. Atal was our Prime Minister. He had a Citizen Service Centre and all those who used to call it Atal, call them Atal centres.  Say that the concept was his and this would have been good politics, if someone has done something good, do it even better, so what should I say against Rahul ji that his policies which Modi ji is not speaking against, will be implemented in the future when I will join BJP and Congress.  The answer to this will be found in the future and if he comes to power, he comes to some state, he comes somewhere, then if something wrong happens then he will speak, but today, the one who is in power will be spoken about the most, now you have a match going on in which all the bowling is the same.  If you are thinking about another batsman who was batting 10 years ago then  Now I was wondering what to say about him, whether his batting is good or bad, coming to the third thing, people keep on talking about higher order thinking, I will say a little about it as an example, a report came recently, you must have seen that in IIT, 38 per cent of the students are getting admission in the IIT.  There was no placement so now it is spreading that it is not happening even in IITs so people are going into this thing, oh this is not happening, this artificial intelligence will take away the jobs, all this is creating a lot of noise, okay and IIT at 38 Its data came out through RTI, some IIT professor took the RTI and IIT gave the data, people did not get placed on 58, so this is the first odd thought, if somebody tried to do some higher research on it that brothers and sisters, on 50  If there is reservation, out of 100 students who come to IIT, 50 come from general category and 50 come from reservation category and if you add the other one in it, then that 10 is there on that too, that means 60 are those who come under upper caste, who are from economic category.  Those who belong to the weaker section come, so these 38 children who are not getting placed, how many are there in this category, this is not politically correct, it is a bit embarrassing to ask too much, 30 children are from reserved quota who did not get placed or it is equal to 1919  Is there any different result in SC, different result in ST, different result in OBC, this is called higher order thinking, not much about how much reservation is helping and how much it is not, this is called having an open mind, this is what it means  It's not that I am saying to end the reservation, someone is saying to increase it to 85, that is a different topic of discussion, but when one says such things, one feels scared that we will not even analyse it, it's not a matter at all.  We will not do it, going to a deep level to understand and explain anything and think about it is called higher order thinking and that channel is for that only, this is youtube0 and things are not understood, although I also do stand up and sit down comedy, big people  we can enjoy even without watching  If you watch it without any tension and without feeling like you are being taken somewhere forcefully, then you will enjoy it or you will watch it with a spirit of learning or else you should be rich in life to understand the things of the channel, I will also tell you one thing that you are rich If you have very fixed opinions, you cannot do higher order thinking that anything is told to you, it is something like your mother's face is made up, you come home, if you are married then your wife must have done something, this is first order thinking  but it may be mummy's mouth, it may have been formed because of something that happened four days ago, it may be nothing, then go deeper inside, think of something, then why did the wife do this, then why did mummy do this, then what happened, but what is this In everything, the brain is put under pressure for higher order thinking and you have kept your brain mortgaged to many people, many people come and take away your reels, your boss takes you, your desires take you, your yearning takes you towards life  There is a lot of stress in life, the stress reminded me that I will also do a workshop In the off month if you want to join the workshop especially for those who work in corporate then write CS, corporate stress is mostly on corporate but it will be for the job also but its orientation will be mostly for corporate job so you can join that  So let us do higher order thinking, now let us come to the fourth question, it is very interesting, Guruji, tell me, is Congress good for the middle class or BJP, now I have told you about higher order thinking, if we do first order thinking, then BJP is good for the middle class  It is good, straight forward, what does Congress do, Congress is actually engaged in doing good for the poor and all the programs are for the poor, for the poor, by the poor, everything is like that, BJP is a party that will do good, I am the one who tells stories I am forming my personal opinion, no need to feel bad, if the ideology here is right then BJP will tell stories, will also do good, but they will give 8500 like this, they will give it like this, they will give it like that, if they do not do it like this, then it is good for the middle class in first order thinking Because this money belongs to the middle class taxpayers.  This will be given for free if no one gives it out of their pocket then it is BJP's habit what should happen, you are crazy about someone I am crazy about love, someone is crazy about someone, it was a picture, someone is crazy about someone, I am here to break your love I don't come for this for anyone, I say that you have love for someone, we will also tell you some counter stories, on listening to those stories your love will increase or decrease, something will happen, okay, if it is decreasing, then you are getting more sad  So brother, don't listen, it's okay, if it is increasing after I told you then increase it, even after I told you it's not decreasing, I tried a lot with someone, it's still a very good thing, if your belief system did not crack, then this is lower, first order, thinking higher order.  Thinking says that if I can earn more money through the consumption market, through businesses, through all these because wherever the middle class is doing jobs in isolation, these people also come in their consumption, from soap and oil  From scooter to Honda, see where the share has gone from in the past You can see the share price of Bajaj in the last 2 years. I am talking about motorcycles because people have not yet been able to afford cars. So, whatever the government does somewhere, it has a spillover effect. Keynes was a great economist. Read him.  Trying to do this, all the theories of Keynes cannot be correct because even if the state takes everything, the state does not have unlimited resources. But to say that the state has taken all the resources and will not spend even 20, 30, 40 or 50 rupees, that will destroy the economy.  Many times it will happen like this, in old times when there was a drought, the kings would build monuments and get ponds dug. If you look at the old history, we have only read about Hindus, Muslims and Mughals and these atrocities, and you want to read about such things nowadays.  Well, I don't know what actually used to happen, I don't know, there used to be a small state in Rajasthan, if we call it Rajasthan then we would say Rajput, from Rajput we would say Mewar, from Mewar we would say Rana Pratap, so we know just four or five names. Brother  They ruled for 700-800 years, even the Rajput kings did a lot of work but they never told the story through documentation, you too know that today they call Udaipur the City of Lakes, where is Udaipur, how did it become the City of Lakes in the middle of Rajasthan Someone told me that after that I will teach you these good things also, then you will say that Duggal sahab has now become a historian, Duggal sahab can become anything, okay, so if you talk to me like this, then I want to tell you that  I think BJP is good for the middle class, it is okay because it is a straight forward work, but BJP is following the policies of Congress and I feel that the implementation is good, Congress's ideas are good but the implementation is bad, like I am telling you  As an example, I will tell you, there is an opinion, you should tell me if you found this opinion right, I am going to post my opinion about Yogi Adityanath ji and my opinion about Akhilesh Yadav, about UP, now listen carefully, what is the opinion of Yogi Adityanath ji  Discipline Law  And order and this thing which happens, such control is extremely good, extremely good but the person is all the focus is here, the focus is here so he did a lot of good as well, secondly the focus was on delivering the scheme to the beneficiaries but governance, truth, infrastructure and all that, something beyond that  Akhilesh could not do much, it was better, Akhilesh's Pakistan was ruined, things were bad, so now it is not so easy, that is why many times it seems that if power comes and goes, then it is fine, it is like whether you send potatoes or mangoes every day.  How to eat four, eat a little of that every day, what do you say, how to drink lassi, drink mango shake some day, okay it is something like that and this is the fact that if that person suffers for a long time for 10, 15, 20 years, I am not saying this I don't know for how many years Yogi Ji will stay in UP, it is the job of power to change at some point or the other. I am not wishing that I get changed soon, nor am I in anyone's team, but I want to say that  The person who supported Akhilesh Yadav for three-four years, his father and uncle  Ji did not let it happen, okay, he used to come to the assembly and meetings and call me Tipu Tipu, so in the last six years, in just one year and six months, he became a person on his own in one called shot, I became a judge.  Learn his lesson that brother, people like law and order a lot and this is not so much in appeasement, this time when I come, I will not let law and order get spoiled, this is my own independent thinking, but people also like this infrastructure, these highways, highways  He said these things, people also like this, now Yogi ji has to see that after this as well, he has improved the law and order, he has improved the beneficiaries, so do I have to just stop at this, is this all I feel?  This is my view that not just us but all of us will get fed up of this one day when the law and order was very good for many years, people also remember when it was bad, I am giving this example from the perspective of politics. Many people will forget now, like I was listening to Priyanka Gandhi in Amethi  There was a speech by Rajiv ji that Rajiv ji used to come here and like this, hey brother it has been many years since Rajiv ji passed away now, you should not have aroused so much emotion in the speech among the local population because the voter of today is 18 years old  So he was born in 2005, in the year 1991 and he must have last gone to India in 1991. Before that, when he was the Prime Minister, he was only till 89, so those stories were written 35 years ago, so the one who is 45 years old today, he too is 8 years old. He must have been 10 years old and he remembers a lot, so you can see that all the voters who are below 45 years of age, all the older ones have become so old that they are not able to understand anything, they are still not able to speak and recognize their audience.  It is necessary that you cannot eat the bread of just one thing, someone is eating the bread of your emotions, someone is eating the bread of law and order, someone is eating the bread of faith, some are beneficiary because what about the beneficiary, this is the law of diminishing returns, now Modi  Like ji said in a speech that if they give 5 kg ration then brother remember that this means that he should show by doing it that brother I am giving it and it will be a sin if you do not vote for him and I am not telling it by doing the exact worm atom youtube2  Yes, when you keep getting it for so many years, then you get an entitlement and then it does not seem that you are getting it, like many people in the country have got freedom, so it does not seem that you have got it because you do not know when you got it  It happened after 1947, till 1960-65, people were very proud that they had got independence, nothing great was happening, there was poverty in the country, but still it was like, at least we are not getting beaten up by the British, it's good because they remembered it  No, those things which were born only after independence, now they do not know, so the ones who do not know, they do not know, this is one thing that has changed, now in that the old people said that we have brought the boat out and come safely through the storm.  Keep singing those songs of mine, it doesn't have any effect, those songs at that time  They started teaching those songs to the next generation, now this generation which will be 18, 20, 25 years old in 20224, yes, they remember the song that I am talking about, it is the song from Kisli Laaye Hain Toofan Se Nikaal Kar, right? That is not remembered, if it is not there then it is not there, what is there to feel sad about, it is an ever dynamic thing, every time you feel nostalgic, that's why you say that they did so much, did anyone do it, Congress also did a lot, everyone has forgotten it because they again did some nonsense If you do these things then if nonsense things happen now then people will forget the old good things, life is like this, look inside the family, there is someone who is doing a lot of things right, if something does not go right then there will be anger, look at your office, you are in the office  You have been working so hard for two, four or five years, you have been working so hard for the whole year, the appraisal period has come in 15-20 days, you will have a lot of arguments with each other, or you said something or he/she misunderstood something, there must be some issue.  The incident has happened, your appraisal will not be good, now there will be stories in it  While telling, I remember, I don't remember that day, but look at that, how bad it is and someone took it away in 202 days, the same thing is happening in the story, that is why some BJP people and their devotees are getting very upset many times that hey  What is this happening in two-three months ? This kite is being blown from here to there because brother something has gone wrong. Have too much ego, what is Keralasusvideo? The realization comes quickly that there will be a mistake, even if you don't accept the mistake, but on the mistake  They definitely act. What about Congress? It is like an elephant. Congress is moving. It will take a lot of time to change its move. It will take a lot of time. People will run out of patience with Congress. But the thing is that you cannot ignore that elephant, no matter how much it moves.  Even if he is slow, he means he is such a fun-loving person, he represents a different India and sometimes the fast India is when he is half-hearted and is getting tired and even after running so much it seems as if he has not reached anywhere or has reached somewhere.  I am not able to taste anything then are you looking at that elephant or have you also reached here it is like which rabbit and  The totoys wali totoys have also reached here, this same concept which is the difference between Congress and BJP, I want to explain it with a very classic example, understand this only then you will understand what is good for the middle class and what is good for you in the middle class too  So there are people of different tendencies, the difference that exists between Congress and BJP is the same, you can say the difference exists between India and China, in terms of sense of urgency and discipline, China is very disciplined, sense of urgency, BJP is very disciplined, okay Whatever is the work of BJP, they did not even make a sound in it, and look here, Shruti Choudhary and her mother's ticket was cut, so there is all the crying and whining here, I am talking about Congress, they are fighting on the stage Rao  Dan Singh and that Rahul Gandhi sitting in the middle, the votes are looking like this, this democracy and India, Rahul Gandhi is sitting like this, he is doing this here and saying this and that here, stop friend, the public is watching  There is a fight going on inside the meeting  He is fighting in a rally full of people and what is funny is that it was Bhupendra Hooda's seat, Kiran Chaudhary ji, Bhupendra Hooda went to speak and the seat on the stage got vacant, Kiran Chaudhary ji sat there in the front, Garj Chaudhary came and sat there. Yes, it is fine by doing this and those poor guys are coming back, Hooda sahab, why are you looking for a seat in Congress, brother, this is comedy but many people may like it, there is a lot of discipline in BJP, they gave tickets to so many people  There is pain sitting inside but you don't have the courage to say it, if you identify the race, higher order thinking then it becomes grey, okay and then I will do this also someday, then I will tell you, I can make one such video every 5 minutes  I will first say that BJP is good, then you will accept it in the first order, then I will prove Congress to be good in the higher order, you will accept that too, then after that I will make BJP good, after that I will make BJP good, so  Then I will make BJP win, then I will make Congress win  I will make him win and then I will make BJP win, every time your higher order will keep going on, then in the fifth or seventh time the brain will lose its power, then at one stage you will say do not make him win because every time it is logical, logical, logical, that first I said that  First tell me about the first order, then teach me more economics, then Congress starts looking good, then tell me something about them, brother, they are very weak here, they are making a big mess here, this is it and here this will happen, that will happen, then you will say yes  Yes then BJP is fine, then tell some story in that BJP, they will do it like this, I want to give you freedom by telling you one more thing, I got a very lovely comment saying Guruji, your channel gave us a lot of fun with political toxicity  He is coming and saying that my wife and I watch your channel. Subscriber 's WhatsApp is dangerous for the country. It depends on who you are. You can fill in the blanks for anyone. You can do it in religion. You can do it in party. You can do it in person.  I can do it, I can do it in ideas, I can do anything in policies  Ho dash is dangerous for the country I want to tell everybody all my country men through this now watch these are big important things, I will tell you a little at the end so that this channel is not seen by many people, this is not something that everyone can understand, I want  To tell my country man India and Bharat is really a great country that nothing is dangerous for us Hey, why are you saying this, there is nothing, we are the most dangerous for everybody in the sense that we have so much strength that no one can destroy us Perhaps here the Sanatan Dharma which is the religion of the majority and which is the way of life and what is called earlier it was Indu, from Hindu it became Hindu but it was a way of life because understand carefully when religion emerges from way of life and from it  Something is told to the people living in a geographical area, that thing can never be destroyed, nothing can be dangerous for them till they do not control that way of life because Sanatan and Hinduism are the only religions in this world which they  From the Off Life  It has emerged in all other religions, the way of life has emerged from this religion that this is a religion, it says that one has to live like this, you are understanding it, I am not disrespecting any religion, I am just telling you a basic difference, I am telling you a basic difference, world Take any religion, it is a very good religion, they say good things, everything is respectable, everything is very basic difference that a religion was formed no matter how it happened, whichever religion it is, that religion brother, you have to live like this with that religion and there is another Sanatan which  We used to live like this when Shankaracharya went to Nath in the 10th century, by forgetting to check the exact date, he told that come on, those who are of this way of life, now come, now if we come under this umbrella religion which is called, then everything will be fine  It is possible, I am saying such a wonderful and wonderful thing here, so brothers and sisters, when your way of life is questioned and an attempt is made to fit you into this formula that this is religion and from now on you will live like this, then I, the astrologer, have to question you.  hmm bye  profession, do not question me here that how big are you talking because here Duggal sahab is not me, otherwise you can tell me what have you become today Duggal sahab, okay but I am very good at religion and all these things Keeping the knowledge in mind, I am telling this very wonderful and lovely thing with great responsibility and this thing is so liberating for you people, if you worship anyone, if you follow Sanatan, worship a tree, worship a stone, worship any kind of animal, it is okay in your  On the family who are listening to me, you can ask five different Gods, it's okay, it's not like this, you have to do this, no, you have to do this, no, keep a fast only on Monday, not on Monday, keep it on Tuesday, keep it for Hanumanji, no, no, keep it for Bholenath.  Keep it, no no many people keep it for Thursday some keep it for Saturday some keep it, don't keep it for the month keep it like this by the way here we only have actions consequences I hope you liked this touching the last thing that I will tell you and close it, what I told you about voting  It was like that brother this was so much  seats will come and in that I had said that these small parties will get one or two seats here, so people said that I also know the anti-defection law, brother, I am not saying that any party will get 70-80 seats  Two MPs out of them will leave, they cannot go, there is anti-defection law, but brother, if there are only two MPs and both of them left, then what anti- defection law is there beyond this, there were only two MPs in the party, both of them left, there is only one in the party  There was an MP and one left. There were four MPs in the party and three left. Are you understanding? I am telling you about the case where there are four, three, two and one. So, this one, two, three and four is going to happen in many parties. I am telling you this.  So many parties can merge, many party members can go, many can go like this and many will not go, they will resign their seats and contest the election again, we saw this also in Madhya Pradesh, brother five MPs resigned, so all five MPs  The seat has become vacant now, do whatever you want, that too is a possibility, so don't think like this that I will come and show you such videos.  Hmm, look, I might have made a mistake, I am not such a person, but this is very basic A B C D, right? How can you assume that I don't know about anti-defection law, I also know it, friend. Okay, a little bit of political challenge is going on, I am managing it. So, I mean, if you do this much information, then it is understandable for me, but don't do this much in the coming time, on brothers, sisters and climate change, after the elections, Agniveer, I did not raise the issue of Agniveer much in the elections.  I made only one video, got very good comments and there is a lot to tell but I did not tell them deliberately because what I know, what I want to tell, it could have affected the elections a little bit and I did not do it deliberately so that then my  Do not follow me and question my intention because my attention is not for political gain, my aim is actually to raise the issue of Agniveer and say how can the election be conducted like this, hey friend 99 lakh votes have been cast in Haryana, 24 lakh votes here-  If you influence there then it will be a big game my brothers Let the election results of Haryana come and see who is winning by how much margin. The margin will tell you how many votes were cast. There are 18 lakh votes till now. Last time there were 16 lakh votes. Out of 16 lakh, 13 lakh people had voted. Last time, the votes were 18 lakh, this time I am telling you only till then, more voting has been done, you are thinking that voting has decreased, votes have increased by 2 lakh, so don't say like this, what are you saying guruji, you are sitting with six subscribers  How much will the election be held? Election can happen brother, it is not like that, there is no need to cast a lot of votes, every person who sees it will also tell it to 100 people and if a video becomes a hit, then what is the problem if it gets 50,000 or one lakh views? Make it in shots and not repeatedly. If the video that I will make in the coming time is fine then you will get to know and my issue is still country because I want to tell my audience that nobody in this country has understood it.  Agniveer the way I have understood that the opposition party does not know anything, they are playing vote bank politics. Whatever I will tell you about Agniveer, there will be no vote bank politics beyond that, I will tell you this, I will explain this and it will talk about the country and I will tell you  I am telling you that in 15-20 days or a month you will start hearing about changes in Agniveer. This is my guarantee. Modi ji also has a lot of guarantees and I also have a guarantee. And nobody is against anyone. It is in the interest of the country.  And people will come and take credit for my words, I am also telling you this, first whatever I say, people will also take credit for it and this is what I want to tell about the country, that is why I am saying take this channel a little, okay, it will benefit us  It will be beneficial for everyone, this disclaimer has to be made again and again, gradually you also start realizing that when you start eating more, then you come to know with what feeling the food is being prepared, where is it coming from and what is it  Slowly you will realize that brother this might actually be some higher order thinking  Actually there may be independent people, actually this can happen just because you do n't see it much and everyone is working according to their own agenda and that is visible, clear cut agenda, clear cut agenda, I say it again and again if you are a devotee  Or if there is something opposite to a devotee and you are feeling very hurt then as a content creator I will have to take care of that as well, I can't say no, no because if I have an agenda, then I  It does not matter because my agenda is that if the devotee feels bad about the devotee or something opposite to the devotee happens, I should hold on to it on one side, this is bad, that is bad, many things of both the people, many good things of both the people  There is so much bitterness in the society, so much talk, so much what do you say, this kind of poison that is spreading, one cannot sit and talk about it, why can't consensus of the country be built, why is there so much hatred, okay then let's do an A to it  That will be my purpose and those are the issues. There is a need for a lot of clarity on these issues. Do you have any questions now?  As a subscriber, if you want to ask something, please write your question in the comment section. As soon as I get good questions, I will make such videos for them every 15-20 days or in a month and right now we will go live around youtube3.  We will sit and have fun that day, we will enjoy that day as they say if we want to enjoy, we will definitely eat sweets, it is anyone's wish, we will enjoy how we want, we will praise the one whose fours and sixes we like, we will enjoy a lot, result day is enough  The whole country felt like this, this time IPL went like this, more than IPL, I think, although I don't watch cricket, but I feel that this time we have to enjoy the elections for four days, 4th is the day to enjoy, it is a good day India.  It's a big day for us so we'll meet at 1 PM on Tuesday at 4 PM live so please there will be this many channels and this much data would be coming okay then we'll also have a small channel okay apart from that we'll also take our taste in different ways and  Those who want to taste, enjoy and find happiness in life, please come  The few that become that, brother, there are many channels, there are crores of channels, so the first person tells that friend, it's okay to come for fun, we will taste it all, whatever comes out will be there, I will keep the comment section open, it's okay for many people.

    "title": "05 Observations From India - Pak World Cup Match [4qjtBkyq_z8].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, five observations on the India-Pakistan cricket match that took place recently in the World Cup. These will be very good observations. You will get to know a lot by listening to it, no one analyzes these things, this channel is very relaxing and clarity giving.  The first thing is the signature that Babar Azam got from Virat Kohli. Many people will say that you do n't even watch cricket matches, yes I do, I don't watch matches. If while walking, I see something then its  I am telling my observation and I am telling about some things which are trending on social media. Babar Azam got this thing signed by a big player of Pakistan. Can you imagine India playing in Pakistan and the Indian captain got this thing signed by a big player of Pakistan. He also got his back lash signed.  It has happened that Wasim Akram said that if you had to do it, you had to do it secretly in the dressing room, why were you doing it in front of the world public? This is a very practical advice, although I think very practical but it's  A food for thought, you are praising him, this is what he is doing, despite the atmosphere being like this, what I would call an innocence is the thing about both the players, Virat Kohli can also be talked about here, why should you sign it? Under this, one more issue will come out. Apart from this, if you want a video, then I will definitely make it because he had also come to Boycott India Pakistan match. They do this with us there, it happens with the soldiers, you do not forget, you  don't do it like that  Yes, I have to give clarity beyond that also because this also becomes an issue. What is it that they fight there and then here they play, then they are jersey players and you are the captain and you have lost the match and you have lost badly.  In a way, quietly go out like a wet cat, I am that you are getting that signed in front of the public, in front of everyone, so it shows something and we should keep sports on this feeling, we should not take so much stress, this is another thing.  Who  We also have a great official, the secretary is fine, he was watching the match by going down in the crowd, it is a very good thing that he was not watching the shows sitting in the VIP box, when there was an old dispensation and he was a politician.  If you have seen him, he was sitting with big stars and he was watching, then it comes within the political signal and it should also be appreciated that he is watching and doing so unserious.  This is a good thing due to looks, I will not call it like this, they are acting like this, try sitting in the heat and see, then sit with the public and see right ahead and Chanakya ji of our politics is also sitting somewhere outside and doing his own thing.  I thought comfortably with my granddaughter, I was watching it comfortably, it was a good site to see, now as if so soon you will tell me that you are a devotee, if you are a devotee, then no one, what is it these days, every video says something to me, but now I have moved on now  In every video also, depending on the time, I will change, tell me something at this point, tell me something in the next, those who watch regularly, they know what I am, I am fine, so it was a very good thing to see, I felt fine, yes too.  They have also come to see the map match and along with that, the leaders who are connected with the general public along with them are called leaders and this goes in the back of mind that the people of the opposition should learn a little from these things, first of all it is not like this.  they used to do  Okay, it is not necessary to look like a king, you look good sitting inside a king and are doing your own thing. If you want, there can be another 15 minute topic on this because a lot of nepotism has been talked about on this too.  But I will also give clarity that if the administrator is a good father and the child is also there and jeans too and he is doing well then why not forcefully, from where will he get a new one if some buddy is doing a good job out of it.  Okay, the third thing I wanted to tell was an observation. After one five, I will also tell you the sixth. Now the sixth has also come to my mind, so it would be good to listen till the sixth, we will discuss about that also, then you will change mine, then my  You will take him from here to there camp, tell me till the end which party I belong to, okay, my claim is that I do not belong to any party, but you still tell me, okay, third thing, let's talk about the captaincy of Rohit Sharma.  The vibes of Rohit Sharma are not cool, disinterested, that means, one was the vibes of Mahendra Singh Dhoni that he was captain cool but like this and after seeing this and this change, he batted oh ho ho and when he got out, it was like this.  This is how he got out, these are the vibes that India can win the World Cup The Same Thing When Virat Kohli was the captain but not that Virat Kohli was very aggressive and I am very good with that  I will tell you the observation, you tell me, this is the observation of life too, it can be like this for you if you do extra polling or it can happen here too, the observation is this, did you see the aggression of Virat Kohli, when he used to be the captain, it is okay and you saw that Rohit Sharma  So it is absolutely true that if there are not so many emotions in ODI cricket then the chances of winning are more and under Virat Kohli we could not win big trophies in ODIs but did very well in Tests.  The thing is true for the test, aggression is needed in a test match because a man becomes cold in a test match, same is the life of life, a little aggression is needed in the long term, he becomes cool in the short term when any decision making has to be done.  So if you want coolness then Rohit Sharma's captain in one day can do well let's see it and he was also playing under him if you look at what he said in the presentation that this is the way it is looking.  Don't look like that, brother, let it go, it's okay, we are not very excited about winning or something that I saw with the BCCI President and the one with the top officials, that is, the number eight, you cannot remove them just like that. They keep hanging around somewhere and the friends with number four are also famous. Incidentally, I have launched a new astro channel in the comment section.  I also teach astrology, I am also an astrologer, so please, if you guys have not subscribed, then in the comment section, it is very good, very good Saral Jyoti Jyotish, its name is Sango, Saral Jyoti, okay, so you can join that also, Saurabh.  Ganguly ji's appearance was a surprise along with the BCCI President and that team because from Sourav Ganguly we get to learn that even with Didi, we keep it here. And yet you become powerful and then you are removed also and then still you are hanging around and yet you are not on wrong terms and bad terms with everybody  This is a very good observation and people should do this in the public space also. This should happen in the personal space also, we get to learn. Now there are four points. You have to tell two points, the fifth point is on crowd behavior, booing is not a good thing, Gautam Gambhir is the only one who came out and had this moral courage to come and say that what is this, I take it a little further.  I will go ok, two types of things went on this is a place where I have stayed for quite some time in my life I understand the feeling there I don't like this behavior I am not defending him, I am explaining, okay, so when you show like this, you show the other person how good he was, the people of Chennai gave him a standing ovation, first of all, that was 1999, by 2023 the situation has changed, second thing.  The same Chennai crowd booed the Sri Lankan players in 2013, so everyone is stuck with whom, this one is also a cry, although I am not like that. I am justifying the thing of 2013, I am doing this to Boeing because I want to tell that this behavior is such that I don't get along with my sister-in-law or uncle ji and inviting her to a wedding. Insulting him is a wrong thing, it is not your cup of tea, you are not at pan India level and I will clear that if you want that the army brothers have our place there and then we play with Pakistan and  That one, I will give 15 minutes of clarity in it very well. If you want, then as an audience, you can write it in the comment section because these are the topics of discussion and I am neither analyzing it in any way nor giving any answer, it is one sided. You guys watch it and enjoy it, then there is that topic, even if you don't have the answer, you want to enjoy it, if you want to do it, then if you have to call me, then don't insult me and if you want it, then you can do the match four feet. We will not play even two with you. There are nine matches in the league. One has been given to you. We will win only eight matches. And if the World Cup final is with you then we will not play even that. You take the World Cup, have this attitude brother, have this attitude.  And if you cannot do this for some reason, which we will discuss in that video, then you tell me these are the 11 players, they are playing in your country, applying for visa, for what ever region of your fans did not like good things, whatever  There will be reasons, it's okay, all blue is blue, it's okay, those players are playing 11 and you are like this, you are doing like this, having so much partition as a nature is correct, a cricket match is going on, someone is hitting good fours and fours off course, you are not praised.  You can do it because if your team is hitting the same level at one time then the crowd was silent, your players are batting, your players are bowling, hitting sixes and fours, you are getting out very tightly.  You are shouting, this is also very understandable, but if the captain of the opposition wants to say something after winning the toss, then you are shouting at him, this shows a very petty mind, it is okay, why do you do so much, who is saying that?  Make friends, hug, do this, do that, do this, do this, no, don't feel like doing it, for what ever reason, but doing this in reverse also shows amateur nature, I will just say this, okay now this  Will this thing be repeated in other places too? Here I feel that if Virat Kohli, who is an Afghanistan player, did this by doing Naveen, then when the Delhiites were doing it, then he just walked out and he just said that he was his.  That brother, don't do it, I think the players of the team have to tell the crowd that one gesture is enough to know what is happening, one gesture is enough, I think this should come up and all this will end.  Ahead This will be addressed because this is not in good taste because the whole world seizes you. It is okay, there used to be a Soviet Union, there used to be US and USA, they too had their revelry, this was there for so many years, but with a little management etiquettes, it becomes a civilized society.  This is the thing inside, I will make a video of 15 minutes in detail, the last thing, brothers and sisters, which is again observation, the name of the stadium is correct, earlier it used to be Motera here, your name will be fine.  So now that name has been changed, now is it a right thing to change that name? Is it a bad thing? Beyond this, again it is for 15 to 20 minutes that this is our big leader and hey, you have done so much in the name of that family. Isn't it possible here? Yes, everything can be discussed on this because the brand value also increases because now it becomes the same thing that when one's family is not ahead, will it have to be done at the same time because a very big leader will say leader. They will say that those who are from big states, have deployed their big elephants there and that belongs to the Election Commission, they have to cover it whenever elections are held, nowadays they do not cover the address, they do not cover it, that party has become irrelevant.  Has it gone or is it not needed? Were they covered in the last election? Were they not covered? Otherwise, earlier they used to cover, why they had planted so many elephants, then they used to tell them to plant their idols.  I have kept my statue, who installs it while he is still alive, but what brother is there anything further? No, we will install ours only and go after typing. Okay, so here too, something similar happens that you don't know what happens next because sometimes you don't know what happens.  Will they also ask about you next time or will they not ask, this can also happen, okay, so if you want a very good clarity on this, all these things like stadiums, airports, our institutions are named after them, many people say that  There are no public names Should I put the normal name or not? Do you want to discuss beyond this? Very good and earlier it was put in his name, in its name, in its name, now in its name, now change the name, do this, then on this.  I have very good clarity, so I will give clarity on this too. These were my five-six observations after watching the India Pakistan match. Which of these did you see, which one did you find disturbing, and which one did you like?  c you  If you have n't seen it then please comment in the comment section. Thank you very much."

    "title": "05 Rondumal Situations You Need To Avoid In Life [RQR2xplwlxk].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, five such stupid situations which can come back to haunt you later on, it is going to be a very interesting topic. I have to tell who all do these stupid situations and what could be the consequences of them. And I have had a lot of live experience and a lot of experience.  It's not like I just came to know about this thing, it was going on, so today I am thinking of making a video, first Randamal situation, girl here. I am addressing the mothers of women who, in this first Randmal situation, cry so badly about their marriage that the girl does not even get married and when she is crying, she does not know what the girl is going through, but when  She is 25 years old and now she is talking about marriage, which she completely refuses, now he will say, how can I explain this, we kept looking after the kitchen, kept raising children, my husband got like this, I too am like this. I too would have done that, every time the daughter never sees happiness, mother never sees happiness, she sees it in marriage, she sees that my mother is an economic slave of my father, so I want economic freedom, I want financial freedom somehow.  If I feel like it, then I will not be a slave to any man. Such a thought process occurs and sometimes in parenting, women used to show special attention to children and sometimes to girls in such a way that we  So if we kept raising you then it was not fun, that means we were not able to live our life. When such things are being said at that time, the result is not known. Then that girl would be 29, 30 or 31.  When they turn 31 then they will panic and when they turn 31 then they are panicking so you guard against this thing. The quality of your marriage is not the quality of life. Sorry, the quality of marriage is what children see whether it is worth it or not.  Look at that, fighting, quarreling with husband, being dissatisfied, crying a little, washing, this is normal, it is healthy, you can even say how much acting you will do, but check this, sometimes our nature becomes so much that we become filled with bitterness. Women are so full of bitterness now that they again say to the next generation, brother, not on this path, there is no happiness on this path, what other path will you get or not, we will see that it is won before us.  The second thing which is an example is the random situation of the parents, looking at the general reservation of the society, that if there is reservation, otherwise all our boys will become IS, all our girls will become IS. These parents give such exit routes and escape routes to their children by crying.  It is what it is. What is the point of crying in front of the children? Tell me brother, this is the law of the country, this is the fact. If you can't go here then do this, if you can't do this then do that. If you can't do that then do that.  Why is the youngster saying this because he is crying so much over the reservation because his father also agrees? If the father scolds him and says brother, be realistic, this is the way it is, if you don't get it, you won't get it, this merit will get spoiled. This will happen, that will happen, why discuss brother, why discuss, earn money or where you were born, you can change it by going back to where you were born, no reservation is there in your higher education but that.  If you have to enter higher education, people fail there too, then marks are not cleared, then you don't get reservation, you get rejected and then after that, you don't even get further jobs. If you leave, then do n't cry so much, then IIT is your fifth.  The government did this by opening up so many seats that it reduced 10,000 seats from 3,000 to 2,000. Sometimes the crying never ends. After 10,000, there are 500 government seats.  After making Rs 500, it becomes Rs 5 lakh and that reserved one also becomes Rs 2.5 lakh, which was once only Rs 2,000. If the reservation of two is reduced to Rs 10, earlier the reservation of one was Rs 1,000, one was open, now there are five reserves, now five are open, so one is in five.  There is no satisfaction, no, my rank is only 5001, okay, stop doing this approach, the third thing is corruption, there is corruption in the country, I want to make a video on this, you guys tell me. I have been thinking for many days on this also, I am going to give a lot of clarity on this. They cry so much about corruption, they cry so much about corruption and pollution also together, India is a corrupt country, corrupt country, every corrupt moment, every corrupt moment, after that, it is your child. Goes to Canada, there is no corruption, there is no pollution there, ok, there may be another 1.5 crore problems there, then you cry that in old age, I don't know how to ask, no, I did it myself.  You made your child hate you, is n't it Ro Dumal Syndrome? This is corruption, this is corruption. How much corruption is there. If I say more than this then a video will be made. Okay, this is corruption, it means every day we go out, someone loots our property, okay?  What does it mean? Check it out. A very nice video will be made on corruption. I am feeling great from within. You guys should ask some poets and poets to write some poems and shayari like that, then I will definitely make a video on corruption.  There is no no to corruption, I do not refuse it, it is okay and it is not a good thing either, but there is a limit to cry, in other countries also there are different types of it, okay and then there are different types of struggle also, okay.  So don't cry so much that everyone here is not the next generation, brother, we have so much corruption in this country, father speaks, mother speaks, it happens everywhere brother, thank you, okay, so this one, you keep one thing, the other thing comes for girls.  about i  I will tell you that the boys who speak are not boys, there is a new disease among the boys these days, it is okay, that girl trapped my friend in a false case, this is the syndrome of a liar, this is the crying of the boys, okay brother, let me tell you one thing.  If a girl implicates a friend in a case then there are only two possibilities - he was deserving, he is a scoundrel, he is right or brother, his luck is very bad, he is a very decent boy, his luck is bad, only two things can happen, there is no third thing.  There can be something in between, it's okay, you were a little mischievous, a little unlucky, you underestimated a little or overestimated, whatever you did, the situation will be somewhere in between these two things. Now you see that you are a scoundrel, so now you feel nervous.  It may just be on luck, do n't cry so much friend, you will remain single, girls are in demand, you will become girls, you will not do it because the sex ratio was 90, it was quite bad, it was very bad in North India.  So, if only 300 bachelor boys are left in it, then out of 1000, 100% girls will get married, so it is not making any difference and 300 will not remain bachelor anyway, that too, I will tell you what are the problems of being bachelor in future life.  It's okay, but it's not okay for girls to be bad mouthed all the time. It's okay, all are the same, not all are the same, neither are all boys the same, nor are all the girls are the same.  So pick any one, it is not the same, you only need one good one which works properly as per your requirement, do not take the contract of the entire female gender in the country whether it is good or bad, assume that the whole country will be well and so on.  If you have a bad encounter then where will you go. It is also possible that it was only you who had a bad encounter and everything else turned out to be fine. Okay, so a lot of time is being wasted in this and the last thing is the problem of jobs in many societies.  people are crying in  Even the parents keep crying, then you will send your children towards the disease of men, without experience, that means no one in your family has done entrepreneurship. Son, father is ready to sell the plot, that one from Ghaziabad, that one from Vaishali, that one from that one.  Sell ​​the plot, sell Hooda's, give Rohtak a bez, give the shop there bez, give Sagaj's bez to me, the entrepreneur, do something, study, job is also a thing to do, or a job?  Who has made it dirty in the society, all that is happening outside on the Internet and on social media, the weightage of all that is 10 to 20 in the minds of children, whatever is right or bad, the weightage of the parents is 80, the society should push a little.  It just takes confirmation in that direction. There are all kinds of narratives going on in the society, some say that the job is good, some say it is bad, all kinds of things are going on, but what kind of narrative is going on in your house? He will decide these five things, these are the five things, you will have to suffer because of them, be pragmatic, that son, the job is not challenging, it happens after four-five years, you get an idea, I will make a video on the job, by the way, I will give you all this clarity, this one is the age of one year.  At the age of 24, I don't like this so I won't do this, we have n't made much progress yet, we haven't reached 10 trillion dollars, but our capita GDP growth is still  It has not become 00 dollars, it is running at 200 dollars, the capita wala of fear on the country cannot throw tantrums that I will not do what I don't like you, I will have to do what you don't like for quite some time, some time you will  Have to do right and then depending on how you perform and how you invest and how much you do and how you live your life  And How What Kind of Mentors You Get What Kind of Exposure You Get What Kind of You Know Hard Work Which You Do and Smart Work Which You Do Depending on So Many Things Now May Be You Will Get an Opportunity to Do What You Like Other Wise  It's Not Easy Brother to Actually Do What You Like Mostly No There Are So Many Things Happening  What people don't like is mostly the same in the market so remove this thing from your mind that I will follow my passion and I will do and I want your passion may not be something which can be monetized and if it can not be monetized  So many people are roaming around with passion. If you run after passion then you will become a compassion net case. Compassion net case is after passion. These are five romantic situations, please get out of it, they are not going to help, they are going to cost you too much, it feels good when you are crying, I know it feels good, but if you know  How it will come back to hunt you, you will know next time, tell your country something is wrong, na, the country means the country, you can catch one thing of the country, everything is bad.  If everything is bad, then he will leave your country, your child, then don't cry that he doesn't ask, old age has become bad, he doesn't come, doesn't ask, doesn't see, doesn't see, he has gone abroad, you pushed him and sent him, remember, he is fine, thank you.  you very much"

    "title": "07 Mistakes Which Should Be Avoided After Retirement [hlFwHSy_k7A].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, this is going to be a very interesting video, I am a little worried that people may not feel bad because in India, people are very sensitive and in this matter, most of the videos are made with low cost, but brother, if the low rate is the area and the  The place from which I come and the community and I come from is not known for that so it is very difficult for me to make it okay and the second thing is that it never does any good by making round and round negotiations so maybe make a small role  I am telling you that before starting the topic, you may feel bad but it is very practical. Tell me how you felt. I am telling you about retirement. Your father is retiring or has recently retired or you yourself are about to retire. If you are that.  You are watching the video, please rotate it in your circle, all of them, this brother is talking, what kind of talk are he talking, is it okay, Guruji is telling you something, I am telling you seven mistakes. Seven things that a person does and should not do on retirement: As you are approaching retirement or retirement day happens that today is retirement, we are okay with it, call it the thought process, call it mistakes, call it wrong notions, call them the things which you should avoid.  Your life is a comparison of many people's lives. Retired people's life is a comparison of all identifications. We are retiring. Many want to glorify that.  It should be known that you have led a very average life, you are not brilliant from anywhere, you are about to complete 60 years or the superannuity, right on retirement, because the one who takes VRS does not celebrate retirement, she quietly left today, he left tomorrow.  The work has started, he is not celebrating, it is the 60 year olds who are celebrating, you have to see that you have not done any great work, if you were actually intelligent and great, then the Indian economy would have been so prosperous.  It was liberalized in 1991 and it has been doing very well for the last 15 years. You would have done something else somewhere. If you could not do it then you were very ordinary. You were grinding mills and there is no joy in that. Celebrate It Hey, what are you saying, it's like this, once we retire, once we get married, once we get married, nobody is impressed if you're retiring.  Na nobody is very keen about it you may feel it's a great day in your life it is an ordinary normal day nothing to be very excited and celebrate about it because party abhi movie abhi bahu baaki hai 3035 saal aur jeena hai past 30 saal toh 35 You worked for a year, after the job you got married, had children in marriage, then raised them and then went to your office. Did politics, then cried for promotion, fought hard, got promoted, then raised children, got married, took me to the valley, there was so much activity and then you are retiring, now the next 30 years are nothing, don't jump so much.  Don't get excited right now, you have to worry about the future, he is not that big today, okay, so the first thing is this, the second thing is that I am retired now, so I just have to enjoy, so it's too soon to pursue enjoyment.  Don't run away, you will get a lot of time when the only enjoyment will be there and then you will get tired of that enjoyment too, so stop now, do not run away as soon as you pick up the car, he could have taken a holiday two months ago and it is not that he has not traveled anywhere in his life.  As soon as I wake up and retire, it is not that I have to fill some void, especially I get a lot of money in retirement, government employees get a lot, is it okay or do others also get it?  Something like this should give him peace, stop now, okay, the third thing is the biggest mistake that we do after retirement, we have to do a job, now you are stuck, man, when has he been driving us crazy, the first two points have been seen by you, now you are talking, are n't you, busy?  Yes, you have to do a job, yes, you do n't even have to do a job, you have done your job, friend, then you have to stay in the job for 35-38 years, it is someone else's job, wearing a tie and a shirt, hello friends, doing it is different, that is sitting in your own home but for someone else.  go and order  Playing is a different thing, they will come on that, that video will also come, those things will also happen. Subscriber Info is a webinar group, you can find it in the comment section, join those people who are facing this life situation because I will tell you what exactly to do, do not do the job with your hair washed.  You will go under the black hair and they will say, Brother, water has come, I have applied your water, this is what all these people go to HR and Admin and some of them do not get great jobs, mostly no one.  IIT IM or any 30-35 year old boy or girl, if not your child, then brother, there will be a lot of trouble, friend, don't do it, I am telling you to keep your self-esteem high, I know that money is important, time is also important, you have to pass that.  I will address everyone but don't do the job, don't jump and leave so quickly. Okay, third and fourth thing, people forget that he is retired, his wife is not retired, they think that she is a housewife. Come on, hey brother.  You have retired, you are sitting comfortably at home, what achievement does she have? In your retirement, your better half is mostly a housewife. 99 But it is like this in India. Even young girls are housewives today, so I assume. 58 59 57  Year old woman will be a housewife but she should also see that now I am retired darling coffee will make your faizal  Whatever is the name of your husband, who will make the dialogue, okay, I will make it, okay, he too is making a mistake, beyond that, bullying does not go on that much, no, you will have to reduce it a little, now that you are retired, no one else will tell you, I will tell. Start planning a week before the day of your retirement so that you do not feel that you have to do it after retirement. Okay, the fifth thing is that as soon as you retire, you don't have enough time to think about.  are  I do n't know what I will do if I get it, but suddenly you have realized that you are the one who has retired, the lives of other people are still busy. Was there someone of yours or was there someone with whose support you were thinking of building a house?  He is alive or his child is gone or some good programs are going on in his life, he also does not have time, then you reach out to people, now they do not give you that much love because they do not have time, you have time and  The worst thing that retired people do  Go anywhere, I was this, I was this, retired, you can do anything, retire, there is no post above the Cabinet Secretary of India, if that too, retire, then now you are irrelevant, no one is telling you that you are an empty cannon.  You were a cannon, you were a loaded cannon, you know the difference between a loaded cannon and an empty cannon, you no longer have gunpowder, now that bulb no longer has a filament in it, so just calm down everyone, you were nobody interested.  Nobody is going broke or very polite This one I was there I was this one I was there This one was there It seems that this is not a chair Is it a chair The current chair has its price Keep it at home and order it yourself  Keep taking out what is okay to take out, keep taking out, no one will listen, don't tell, no need to tell anyone what you were, what you are now, realize that what you were has been removed, what are you now? Dum hai that is going to sustain you for next 30 people, do n't know yourself.  Will use my what I achieved then no one is interested in getting Bharat Ratna once I got it  That's it, that's the end of the matter. If I ask the names of how many Bharat Ratnas in India, you don't know who got the last one? You guys don't know who got the last and latest Bharat Ratan? What is their name? Will they attempt the latest one? Is anyone preparing for UPSC?  It will be right and he will do it, no, Oli, he has got it, he has not got it, I don't know, I am fine, so no, I am not interested, I was there, it is fine, now there is a politician named by Deve Gowda.  Yes, he was the Prime Minister of our country, very few people know, many people, less, most of the people do not know when he was, now I should ask him, when did Devi Gada become the Prime Minister, before Chandrashekhar, or after IK Gujral? Was it after or before Vajpayee or was it before Vajpayee or was it after Vajpayee, which year was it, I do n't know about the Prime Minister, I don't know and he is living, it is not the past, it is okay, it means it is the past, it means it is late but that people.  Do n't know who you are, you are the Prime Minister, do n't know when he became Prime Minister, when he became where he was, what he was now, what he is now, then no, okay, the sixth thing is that people make a lot of mistakes by spending money on their relatives or on their friends or in their circle.  By spending money on party, we buy time or attention, we will celebrate someone, we will have a party on retirement, why is it a party, brother, if I could come after retiring, then what happened to the world, people retire, the world does jobs, there is no party in it, it is all party.  They are asking meaning you have lost your job, you have nothing to do, you are sitting at home, now its not a party, no, friend, you are misbehaving, no, social, social, first of all, you have to realize, it's not something great, it's a Day in your life you have not changed and since if you make a big deal about it then there will be more vacuum we are telling all this ki bhaiya apna kharcha pani karke  Don't attract, it is not going to happen, today there will be a party, today there will be clapping, today the photo will be taken, today it will be put on the page, it will be put on so and so, professor sahib, doctor sahib, IS sahib or this officer, that officer, there are 1.5 crore departments of the government.  And even in private, when you retire, you become CEO, VP. Well, in private, it is not so much about retirement because they keep doing something outside, which is senior. Those who retire at the level are transition, delay is nothing called, much retirement is more illness of government, retirement is ok and more is great achievement, ok is not achievement at all, more is normal day and behave normal, if you behave normal people will behave.  There is a lot of fear inside your house too. Father is about to retire. Don't know what he will do. People are also worried.  The wife is also worried. The wife says that he will be sitting at home the whole day. Now he will know what time all the mates come and go. I have no work at home and he will chat again. She is also very afraid.  Okay that's also Nobody is comfortable Nobody is used to having you in the house now you're also like Terry and many people I have seen spend their mornings with no work done  He takes the brief case and goes out, I don't know whether I sit in the park or come somewhere, don't be so enjoy, enjoy the company of your wife, enjoy the company of your home, enjoy the home, decorate the home, don't spend money left right center here  -Right there, immediate and the seventh thing which is a mistake, people start feeling that it is a mistake that now people are not respecting me as much.  You are not paying attention to me, now I am no longer relevant to me, my wife is the same, hey wife used to talk rudely earlier also, man, it has been 3035 years of marriage, she is not waiting for your retirement to do rudeness and take revenge, women then settle down  She makes you feel like this is your psyche. Children can and should misbehave earlier also. Children can do it. Children can do it on their own.  If you don't misbehave with your parents, then what are you teaching? Yes, children should misbehave with their parents. If they are not being listened to, they can do that. Your children are misbehaving with you. What do you want other's children to do? Batmeeji is yours, when they do it after retirement, you feel that I am of no use, that is why they are doing it, this is a color thought process, and there is no change for you in the family. You are as dear to the man in the family as you were before. Earlier also such aarti was not being performed. Remember that 59 years of age of 56 55 52 when you and such aarti had to be performed. You thought that you are relevant. It is.  Your perception was ok earlier also and now too, their life is busy, yours is busy, now will I teach you how to stay relevant by not making these seven mistakes? If you want to do a job, then I will teach you what to do. Do you agree with this? Those who are retired or have done so, or should not do a job, I am not at all forbidding to earn money, I am absolutely forbidding doing anything.  I am not busy, and this happens to many people, friend, I have to stay busy, I have to do some work, that is very low, just to say, now my time should pass, if you go to pass the time, then the time will not pass, you should go.  for m  Should be, I don't know, I will be three times busier than I was in my job, I was not doing anything, now I have to do a lot in life, even at the age of 65, big people, I do n't know what made me a KFC guy, which was fine.  He is Colonel Saunders, I think it's okay, a lot can be done, okay, but if you do only this to pass the time, then your time will not pass. I am also telling you that you have to release there is nothing which.  Judge Changed Your Intelligence Judge Not Decrease Your IQ Experience Wisdom Nothing has evaporated suddenly just because you retired It is still intact Okay it is intact and you can do a lot with it What can you do Beyond that there will be discussion You would like in the webinar Other things can also happen in this connection, using the power of social media to increase your knowledge.  Reach out many times, no people, I am also in that category, I am very young brother, okay, my hair is white, age is very less, so many people like me, I want to come to meet you, I am right, I don't have time for you.  Pass time is your way of passing time, I can't become it. Yes, you have work, there is some intelligent proposal, there is some matter by all means, this too many things are kept silent for retired people, why don't they want to meet friends, everyone knows.  I am retired, this man will waste my time in the future, this happens to me a lot, people don't know, it seems like it is a misconception, what is that problem, I too have a little bit of gray hair, I am facing the consequences, it seems I am in their category.  Because they are also white, I am also white, hey brother, with knowledge, one can become white very quickly, one can become white very soon, so I am not in that category, many people like me are retired people, let us not meet.  I will teach you, stay in your home, do webinars and learn comfortably, make your own notes, and please give them to your parents who are retiring, and do not make these seven mistakes. Which of these were you doing? Tell me.  Thank you very much"

    "title": "07 Things Middle Class Needs To Look Out For In Budget [G7Us1cflT7Q].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, the budget is going to come tomorrow, seven points on which budget we should look at, the things which I will look forward to the common man, you also listen to these things by listening to them, you will get a lot of clarity and better understanding, I will tell you things in seven points so that  Because after the budget comes, you know that the opposition has to oppose it, but we already know them and we have to do it, we already know about many things, but I want to get my syllabus out in advance.  I am doing this so that when the budget comes, if things have happened as per this then we can judge it accordingly. I will tell you what is the focus beyond that and what is my wish and desire, if there is a desire then it is very good but focus.  Beyond that, the most important thing is what no one is saying, no one has said it anywhere and we have to pay attention to it. Edge Indians, the first thing is how much is spent on defence. It is very important that without a safe India, India cannot be developed. 1.6  1.7 is the focus of the budget only, so much focus is not given to it, it does not even come out of the mouth of the Finance Minister, it remains written somewhere in the speech and later research has to be done somewhere. You see, is it not so this time too? Listless work will not work as it has been done before, because if it continues like this, then it is 100% certain that you will be criticized again. This time, give the speech for half an hour more. Parliament goes on like this in Parliament. Tell me everything on defense.  What is the exact expenditure, it should come out from the mouth, it should come out in the speech and the percentage of budget should also be known. % is my wish list, minimum should be required which is the threat of Pakistan and China and it will be a signal to these countries that we should also spend here.  Because you keep increasing the salary and pension but do not increase the budget and then say that it increases as a percentage, so it will have to be like this, I should keep the budget at ₹1, the salary was ₹, that was  70 80 If it continues to grow, this first point will be mine, second will be what are you doing for jobs creation, this is not needed in the scheme for money, now we need this India, dash India, this value, India, that India, this thousand crores, not 2000 crores exactly. What are you doing for job creation, how many jobs will be created, where will that money go, it is related to that, the third point is what you do to push real estate.  There will definitely be a desire to know what changes are made in the definition of affordable housing. In big cities, affordable housing is a matter of 60 square meters and in small cities it is 90 meters square meters. Will we get tax intensive incentives in it, will there be one GST instead of five, will it be revised? And the limit of income tax rebate in section 24 which has been stuck at Rs 2 lakh for so many years, who is paying interest on Rs 2 lakh, today we are getting some crores.  If you are getting something for less than Rs. 10 crore then 85% of it is interest. Even on a loan of Rs. 1 crore, Rs. 85 lakh is spent. Even on a loan of Rs. 50 lakh, Rs. 45 lakh is spent on interest. Which house can be bought for Rs. 25 lakh?  Where is it coming from, tell me, now at least 2 lakhs should be increased in it, that real estate will be boosted by this, taxes come on the fourth thing, you have made so many slabs, they are 9 to 12.  Lakhs 12 to 15 lakhs and that much should be reduced by reducing the slabs and giving relief to the common man. Don't give relief of Rs. 9498 in that 000 tax is saved per year. Wow, no, it should be visible in good sizeable form for every person in the tax labs.  There should be exemption, corporate was taxed at Rs 25 and common man's tax is Rs 33 in higher slab, so please reduce that also because the tax of corporate is less. This is what was said when it was reduced that it is being reduced so that there will be job generation, it is not so, everyone burps, no one has been reduced, the fifth thing beyond which I will keep a very sharp eye is that Some separate money is being given for Andhra Pradesh and Bihar because in this I will ask you for your opinion and wish list that if you want to give it to Andhra Pradesh then give it because I think Chandra Babu Naidu ji is a good allocator of funds, if you give it to them then  welfare of the country  It will happen because I feel that he will do good for Andhra Pradesh but giving money to Bihar is like breaking a bridge. Giving money to Nitish Kumar ji. I am not against Biharis nor against Bihar, but the one who is running Bihar in Bihar.  He is facing such a fate that the opposition can't stop him because someday he may go to their side and how can the BJP people say anything to him because the government is running on his crutches, don't the BJP people like Nitish?  Neither the opposition would have liked Babu nor perhaps the people of Bihar would have liked him, but he is so rich in luck that everyone has to face him. And he is not a person to whom if you give money, he will benefit me from Bihar.  I don't think Bihar should get any special treatment. I am again saying that I am not against Bihari, I am not against Bihar, but brother, if you give money to that person there, then you see, no one has even bothered.  No mistake has been made anywhere, so many bridges have collapsed, so many bridges were built costing crores, they did not belong to the Central Government but to the Bihar Government, nothing, two or four JEs were suspended, they were suspended here and there, just this faulty designing, everything, corruption means no mouth too. Brother, the bridges are falling down, will no one open their mouth? And then give more to Bihar, give more brother, don't give and if you want to do some good then do it through the seams of the centre, do it generally for everyone. Bihar will have to see how much it will be. I will go into the sixth thing that a scheme for the poor will have to be brought. Some scheme for the poor will have to be brought but this time it should be women centric because no one has any intention of giving money to men.  If you give it to someone then people can smoke bad beedis with alcohol. This can happen. So, whenever you have to distribute things among the poor, whatever has to be done, you have to share it with the women. Still, something can happen in the family. Don't do it like this in general.  Then, according to me, a lot has already been done for the farmers. Bhaj brothers, you are not getting the votes of the farmers anyway, now the money is limited. I am not against anyone here, I know that the budget is standard and not a cut copy.  Do not run by pasting, this time you will have to do something different, this time you will have to spend somewhere else because the resources of the country are limited, it is not that there is unlimited money, so here every time Kisan Nidhi Sn Samman Scheme, this scheme becomes theirs.  Neither do they feel that respect nor does anything happen to them. Brother, give a chance to other people too. Focus on the people of the rest of the country also because if the middle class gets scattered from you BJP people, then there is no one to sing your praises like Bhopu.  Those who sing the song 'I am a political' are also telling that, I am not, I am not at all immediately wishing from within that BJP as an idol, BJP as a party because it is becoming very weak and there are some people who are trying to weaken it. Why is BJP so concerned about it?  weakened quickly  I am going through this because many people are saying now are you a devotee or not a devotee, I am BJP, it is a good party, a very good idol, it is living a good life, no other party will fall at such a speed, not even Congress should fall, Congress free India.  If it is not good, then BJP-free India is also not good. Parties should be at the same level, but if talent check is done on all these things, this time Nirmala ji will be clapped openly. If things are good, brother, if things are not good, then there will be condemnation.  Don't do it because there is democracy in the country. Even when Nirmala ji's husband can come and speak himself, other people should also have the right. It does n't happen that just because it is a personal thing, there is so much democracy in the country that Nirmala ji's husband.  Those who are themselves intellectuals, economists, very intelligent people, they also do this, so we too should have some rights, if things do not go well, then we can call out that this is just cut, copy paste.  The budget came like this and did it like this. Earlier the budget used to come in a brief case, then it started coming in red. Apart from these superficial things, the country needs something. Finally, my seventh point comes, listen carefully, at the end of the budget, this time the public.  Will you tell me how is the budget? Now what is its meaning? Open the coffers a little and everyone should get the feel good factor that everyone has just enjoyed something. This time one should not get into the trap of headline management. This is my request because How headline management is done, I will tell you Godi Media, four rupees will be in Delhi somewhere and such a rupee was given to a poor man, this thousand crores, this crore is 140 crores population, whatever it is, divide it whenever you want, when you get 1000 crores. Brothers and sisters, if you divide 140 crores by 140 crores then you will get ₹ 1 paise, remember this, do not jump on this, first of all, because Godi Media will do this, then Industrek is something.  No choice, apart from flattery, you have done corporate tax on you and that 25% of yours, no one asks you further, but what do you do about CSR, there is no accountability, so you will celebrate everything, India Inc. no this time.  We the people of India, we the sovereign will decide the budget is good and not because don't look at an average man, I tell you these are pink newspapers, they are very sexy, they are good, they are CEOs like this. Want this capital, do this, why what will happen due to your wanting, will the common man also want you, so you all have to come and give thumbs up, the headlines will be managed in these big pink newspapers, the headlines will be managed that yes brother, this.  It is like this, but this time we will not let it be managed because there will be budget of youtube0 time and I will come or it would be better brother, there is no prejudice of force, that is why I made the video first.  I have told all the things on these things but I will come and discuss again. Yes, what did you do, what did you do, how much difference will it make, okay, brother, the things which are good will be clapped completely and if non-descript and it will be gas released and such nonsense.  So it will also be told that he did that here, the headline was managed from here to there because the schemes that are there have not been effective, many things are done directly, like if you understand that if I collect government tax from you, then From the flats in the slab, it was Rs 20 and now he has reduced it to Rs 10, so this is money directly in your pocket. There is no need to stand in line for any scheme, cut the slip, show the identity card, that is Aadhaar tax, there is no need, you can speak directly.  Yes, if I get anything left then how many thousand crores should I give, give or not give, who knows in the line brother, he will waive the loan, he will waive the loan, he has so many scams to waive the loan, he does not make anyone forgive, it is written along with it.  If you have waived off the loan once, you will never get it again, then who will waive off their loan of Rs 50,000 if they never get it? The catch will never be told. The head management is doing it for the last 10 years. I am telling you that it has been successful for the last 10 years and many people.  I was also afraid that yes man, that industrialist has written this in these newspapers. If someone writes these are expensive newspapers, the pink ones come for Rs 12,131. I think this is less.  People read less English newspapers in India. On top of that, business people read even less. These newspapers will tell you some great shows. Good India Inc. celebrates. So people think that I don't have any knowledge. Seeing this, these educated people speak.  And then they will bring it on their news channels and it has been there the fiscal deficit has been contained well and we are progressing and this RBI has done this these fools  In India, they make one speak English otherwise it seems that one is intelligent and they make you a fool by making you a fool, that is, they make you stupid. For a long time, this opinion is mine, first I will speak, now I will speak, I am a knowledgeable man, Guruji, I know.  Hey, I was also impressed by this style of Jaishankar ji for three-four years, then when I did my original research and asked people what was the benefit of foreign policy, I came to know that it is English, just this and will do and that.  Will stand Tata Teena Tata Teena, in the beginning it seems like this, what an amazing man, go to the white stage and do Tata Teena and say from behind, Hey, this was just for show, now do it like this, saying something is different, doing something is different, but someone call me.  There is no one who will throw you out because English is not spoken in India and on top of that it should not be a problem and no one can come and tell you directly, come and talk directly like us because I am saying that I am very dead, I am saying dead otherwise.  I too have been fooled for three-four years, this minister is very good, this one's performance is very good, we also say that to Gadkari ji a lot, this has been done, you are poor, where is the infrastructure needed, where to invest the money, where to build where to build the road. Infrastructure has to be laid all over the place. If there is no manufacturing going on there, then how will the goods go from here. If roads are built then it is good, then defense is also very important.  China and Pakistan, what is happening in Kashmir, these trains have been involved in every five, six, seven accidents of yours. In the last one month, papers are not conducted with you. Look at what is happening inside the valley, it is a tangy force on things. Defense is not visible, it bursts later and it is the same railways, do n't give money for the maintenance of railways. Vande Bharat, come to show the green flag immediately. Vande Bharat, Vande Bharat Hari.  Jhandi Hey from you, the latest thing that has happened inside Gonda is that the track of that track has not been welded properly, so come to the basic thing, you cannot make dal, rice and roti in your house, you are going to make Sashi, this is an example.  I want to tell you this with full of emotions. Brother, do the basic things. No, should Sashi not be made? Shouldn't Jaani be fine? Should n't exotic dishes be offered? Is the country like this?  Brother, if the basic things are not good for you, brother, if you do not know the body mass then do not go to differential, because you do not know maths, first understand the body mass, first the question of bracket will be solved, then it will be off, then the question of division will be solved.  Then multiplication should be a basic. You don't know tables. You are struggling on 2 twos and four fours. You are struggling on 7 edges. You have started finding cube root and square root.  The first child is called like this, isn't it, friend, this one has done chapter one first, chapter two has been done, you have done the fifth class first, you will do the eighth class first, this has happened because the government can pick and choose because what is there in doing the basic things.  Must have done a basic thing, clapping and respecting it, even today I am telling you that the open defecation free drive, the drive of toilets was a very basic thing, but I have forgotten all that, I am not enjoying doing that now.  If we have to reach the moon quickly, I would like that in this budget there should not be too much planning to become a Vishwa Guru, there is no Vishwa Guru's work, our train is not at the Vishwa Guru's place, on the contrary, look here at the Vishwa Guru's place in Kashmir.  How are you, what is happening, things are not done like this, exams are not being conducted by Vish Guru, it is okay for our children, now what should I say, then if more people speak, then it speaks, it speaks more. If it was a song of life, then we will not speak.  Question Paper We the public will check Seven things have been told on headline management We have to see whether the government goes towards headline management Will take out opposition Will take out some opposition but we have to do this on things together because the opposition can come and say that the poor What did you do for this because brother, you can do anything for the poor, it will never be enough, even if you give lakhs of rupees to every person, poverty will not go away and how many poor people there are.  If 100 crores are poor then if you convert 100 crores into 1 lakh then where will you get 100 lakh crores from, still nothing will happen then the opposition will be different but what happens to us many times if after that we go into negativity to bring the budget.  So everyone gets into it, that's why I had to bring this video first so that I and my audience can have a more nuanced approach so that they do n't do it too, brother, if we see something happening on these things. So it is very good and if the headline will be management then we will tell about that also and you will see how it will run on the next day or that day or news channels India Inc India Inc I am already telling you I am India Inc this CO has given thumbs up name  I can also tell right now but I want you to also discover which chatu khor is that right in business because right what is needed is this is needed very good very good so all very stock market gives thumbs up this gives thumbs  Up and once again thumbs up point increased and decreased the next day and some more on the stock market too. If you want to see the genuine government then I will end by telling you one more thing and that is that the growth of my deposits and yours will be less than the growth of loans.  The growth of deposits is running at 10 per cent, meaning people are depositing more money at 10 per cent, they are depositing ₹ 1000000 and the amount for taking loan is 1314.  But it will pay, that is, if a loan of ₹ 1,000,000 is being taken, then it will fall short by four or five rupees and if it continues because why are they not making deposits because everyone is going to the mutual fund, why should you people become poor by putting money in the mutual fund? If you want this topic, then it will become a topic, but it will be made on Clarity for Youth, which is my separate channel, go and subscribe to that too, that topic will remain and write if you want.  No one has told us how we are becoming poor by investing in mutual funds, but I will tell you, and it is not that he is a click butt, there is absolutely no such click butt and Varku ji should also tell this because he is giving 90% money to everyone.  I will tell you how you will become poor by investing in mutual funds, which are stuck in SIPs for years, that is, are you thinking of becoming rich or will you become poor? And if all the people in the country go there, then the banking people will have to increase their interest rates. Deposits will attract money only then your interest rates will increase and then it will have a bad effect. You have seen the stocks of MCs running away and many asset management companies, so this will be a completely separate financial topic. This remains a bit political.  But I will explain it well in that but like it, share it and let's hope with crossed fingers that brothers will see, let's hope that I may be four and six, the government will feel good.  There should be a factor that it should seem that something has been given in actual, not just headlines, that if this scheme has been located so far, then nothing has come in my pocket, nothing has come in yours too, nothing should be visible to everyone for job creation.  In defense of real estate, in tax breaks to the common man, you put the rich man at Rs 25. The wealth is within his company and he gives dividend to himself. There also he pays tax at Rs 10.  The rich are paying less tax and the common man is paying more tax. What does this mean? Parents, my father, the government. If you do some justice then my father will judge the government's performance. We the people will judge and no one will be in a hurry to judge.  I will see the budget coming out easily, I will see the fine rate peacefully because people will jump very quickly to talent, it is either the greatest or very useless depending on which idol they are sitting on, if they support BJP.  If he is sitting against then he has to speak about the useless budget because how can he speak well and if he is with BJP then there is a compulsion to blindly follow the ideology or if you are blindly following it then you will have to sing its praises.  If I don't do it then I do n't have any pressure to praise it, that's why I have interest, that's why I came and defined this syllabus first because if I do it later, you will not speak because you  Is it somewhere on one side? Now, on which side have you sold? This side or that side, I have already told you all to watch here and what is the ultimate feeling that by the evening, if you enjoy something then you should see that feeling yourself.  Yes, I got some benefit because the time to pay the tax is just coming in July, those who are paying huge taxes, it takes a lot of life, it is okay to pay because nothing is happening outside in the country, if you look at it, there are no potholes.  the road is smooth Underpasses are not filled in the rains, there is cleanliness, waste management is also good, the poor are getting well in the country, they are paying so many taxes, the poor, the poor, they keep crying, then the man says, brother, please reduce your taxes.  The welfare of the poor is not happening, I do n't know how much I have taken, so how long will I continue to keep myself like this, there is no feel good factor, it is okay because if the feel good factor does not come here, then every time after the budget, there will be at least one in India.  At least one lakh people, if not more, decide to leave the country every year. I am telling you a figure, so at least the government should be doing such that those who have money are doing well. So many people don't want to leave the whole country, it's a different topic even beyond that, why do they go within themselves, what should they do, but you have to look out, brothers and sisters, as my subscribers, on headline management, you have to look out on the headline.  The management is not doing this forcefully, they will fool you by speaking English in the more intellectual sounding O-O style and by doing this O-O, whatever they speak in English, I also know English and that is why I know how to style.  It is done by beating, say it, wait a minute, tell it in simple Hindi, if you tell it, nothing will come out, under your able leadership we are going from strength to strength and these are so many 15  What did you say in the minute, you have chatted at home and the budget has been very good, the India Inc has done this celebration, what happened, what happened to me, what did I get, that soldier who is standing, Agniveer is standing, is he getting any pension, is he getting the equipment.  Is he getting thermal imaging? Is he getting armament carrier? Is the security of whoever is standing increasing increasing? He is not getting trapped in ambush. He has whatever he needs for his survival and fight.  Are they fully equipped to fight and protect the country or not? Do you also set up a security guard of your own in the society and look after him? Where will they get tea and when it rains where will they stand with a stick in their hands?  Well, he is fine, his health is fine, let's ask about his well-being once, the RW of the society, neither the RWA of the country, nor the government, and he has the right to ask about the well- being of all five. Tell me seven points out of seven, we will meet again as soon as the budget is completed and you guys please look out for that video too. How did you like this video, like it, share it and start reading the Economic Survey too, that is also a big thing.  Beyond that, if I get some details or something useful, I will tell you. Other wise, I have seen many places in the print media saying other wise or lipa poti is a lot. Jargon is used a lot everywhere. Jargon is used everywhere today. No one spoke on the day of Reverse Repo Rate Cash Rev Ratio, these four or five of them created these ratios, every time they speak in English, they do not tell a simple thing whether the interest rates will be low or high and they do anything to it, they are like this.  Is that the rent agreement? If you go to it then tenant and landlord will not be mentioned in it. Lease-lesser will be mentioned in it so that you will be able to understand who is the tenant and who is the landlord. Every business has its own business. Terms have been made by astrology, they have made their own, it is okay so that no one can learn astrology easily, Sango, astrology is simple, it is a different channel, it is teaching a different thing, I teach the same thing there, to understand things easily and anyone can come easily.  That's why I don't explain, otherwise everyone will understand. Everyone will understand, then how will those intellectuals be questioned? Through this channel, I want to bring everyone to the level of intellectuals that no one has come up with any special vitamin recipe like this.  someone read  It is not written, he has just learned the style and uses some four-five jargon and just by that you all get impressed. He has a lot of knowledge about the stock market because P-B ratio is book value and cash flow and so on. Discounted Cash Flow Dividend Value and Book Value Oh My God Yeh To Bahut Knowledge Leke Baitha Hai End Face Value ₹10 One IPO Sh IPO Red Herring Prospectus Yeh  There are 20 terms, there are no words, I have put the members on Clarity for Youth, if you want to take membership then learn it, I am breaking all the barriers that people have created, I have proved my knowledge to me many times.  They joke that you are Duggal Saheb, what can you become, why can I become, why can't you become, anything can be become, there are five channels running, anything can be done, I am just showing it by doing it.  I do n't mean to tell you that I am not doing it. People come to astrology class also, they teach everyone, everyone has work, everyone will teach economics also, because everyone should be able to learn anything, once they have learned it, how do they learn?  Learn how to learn anything quickly. Once you learn it, brother, you can learn anything. This is what I am trying to teach you. Today I have told you these points, so if you keep your eyes open and monitor like this tomorrow, then first of all you will on face  You will smile that wow question paper, you have written this one first, meaning this one which is not NEET, this paper which is published in the paper the day before yesterday is fine, will be praised and it will happen that if you have written that thing then check in it that all these things are  What was done for this, it is very important to do these seven things, please share, like, thank you very much."

    "title": "07 Things Which Children Should Teach Their Parents ｜ How Many Do Your Parents Know ？ [-DIg7v8ksmA].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, seven things which you should teach your parents, if they are above 60 years, even if they are 60 65 70 75, then you have to tell and teach this. In many of my videos, many times people say, hey, you do not allow us to respect the elders, you are like this.  Do you know what kind of comments come, I am fine because the elders feel that today I will tell you something about practical service to your parents and bringing happiness in their life. With practicality which will bring peace in your life. If you are also in my age group of 20, 30, 40, if you are listening to me, you have to do seven tasks, these seven tasks are not difficult, you will do all seven of the seven, tell me which one you are doing, tell me already and  Don't say this is difficult, it is very easy to do, you will have to teach it. Okay, and if you are elderly and are listening to me, then learn all the seven tasks yourself, then it is better to get your children to do it or else.  Pay attention, this is a very interesting video, first topic, first task, okay, this is digital banking for our parents and this paytmbank.com is a middle class audience only, so now the rest of the people are lagging behind, no audience, so don't mention that ours is not educated.  Even if your parents are not very educated, they still use mobile, that thing can be taught to you, it is okay, there is no need of a college degree in this, if they can understand the numbers, it is okay, then firstly you must do this thing, secondly.  The thing is you insure that your father, especially his mother, is not driving. I think your father should not be driving much well in his 60s and 70s, especially on the highway. This is one of the most dangerous things in your life if you have an elderly person in your life.  No, everything seems fine to me, so what are you waiting for, when the visibility will reduce, when some scandal will happen because its spillover effect is going to fall on you, it will be as much as this.  I am teaching you to understand in this matter, this works for NRIs who are working somewhere else, their parents live in Bangalore, some in Jind, some in Kaithal, some in a small town, you are working somewhere different, to insure you.  This is the thing that they get used to hiring taxis. If you are a big city then you should know the system of Uber Rolla. Other wise drivers are also available on hourly basis. Nowadays, there is no need to keep you on salary for the whole day. There are many drivers' numbers. You tell me in advance, book it for 4-5 hours, 00 6600 system is running, it is very dangerous to drive yourself, especially in the highways, and what is the cut off time, one some elderly person should stop driving, that is, as you ball, you should stop driving properly.  It is seen that then you want to quit cricket, when it starts hurting your face, then you should quit, you see this, you can't wait because your life is at risk, you will do something wrong to someone else's life too.  At some point of time in risk you have to realize that it is our nervous system, reflexes, brain and reaction time, whether it is a string or if we have to go on the highway, then please ensure, this is a very big thing, you are serving them, the third thing which is  You have to insure the parents by studying behind both the parents because they do not do it, someone else's parents do it, then the parents are happy and those whose parents are happy, their children are happy.  But 99 people's parents are very unhappy, that's why people are unhappy. The job of the channel is to increase happiness and peace, that's why I am telling you through practical consultation, you have to encourage your parents for movies and outings. Now you will speak for movies.  If you want to do it, why don't you go yourself? You don't get along with your wife, your mother, you know, for years now that abuse and fighting are not happening.  If Tutu Ma'am is not happening then it does not mean that there is a lot of friendship, she will not go and you are telling your parents about the boys, there is still a slightly different program for the girls, they can also encourage it, but it is okay.  The fact is that you cannot take yourself because your family will go, they will go, your family wants a two and a half hour outing, they can go for half an hour because the elders have their own limitations and their own interests, so they will have to go independently, especially if their hands and legs are fine.  are being  And if you can go by taxi then you can do it and if you are a little elderly then you will have to take me in an assist type vehicle in the sense that you have all the facilities in a big city and you feel like going out to eat, go somewhere and have dosa sometime.  Eat golgappas, they never come out in the house, that dal khichdi, khichdi dal, moong dal, cumin tadka, this tadka, that tadka, dry roti, then that gourd, gourd tinda and then petha and it is cooked.  Friend, what has happened to the old people, it means that sometimes I don't feel like chatting, I wo n't do it even once or twice a month. In such big cities, I see a lot of times. In Gurgaon, I see ladies coming, all the elderly people are above 80.  Okay and they have their own club formed so they are happy. If you want to get them to join then you join your club. In many cases it happens that only one parent is left, if there are two parents then one parent.  Are you sitting far away or do you have the limitations that I explained earlier, then you have to join any group, be it kitty party, women's or men's, where it can do some outing and all this, can give movies of today's times. Who is this Rocky Rani and whatever else is she watching on the big screen? At least they should know what is happening with the children of today, what is the world of today, what is happening at times, the parents have become so old that they do not know about their  They have so many complaints about children  I do n't know what has happened in the new generation, where have they reached and what is happening these days, all the pictures that are being made, all the authors like me, these movie makers, script writers etc.  Everyone here is stealing content from my channel and making it. Before this, she was made with Ranveer Kapoor, Shraddha Kapoor and who was that, which movie was Main Jhoothi ​​Tu Jhootha by doing this and now this Rocky Rani, all my themes, this is from this channel.  There is core expertise which is being copied, which is good because such things are extracted from such a level that a person would not be so famous that even if we come and say such things like me, even if we make claims, people will laugh a lot, hey are you so much?  So subscriber, what is this and such a big picture, yes, it is like this, ideas are stolen like this, big poets also steal from small poets, if it is okay then it is okay, that is okay, all that.  Themes Because I have been doing this for two years, three years, okay, after that the fourth thing that you have to teach the parents is to know the checkup procedure of the hospital, which hospital is nearby, where is it, how to reach their emergency phone.  Numbers of reception, numbers of ambulance, numbers of doctors, when is their OPD, on which days, on which days one can book and go, from which site, how can it be done by phone, all that is a method and nowadays in hospitals.  It is very helpful, you go out and straight away, he holds you and gets everything right, okay, all these things are available, otherwise you get overwhelmed, go once and teach everything and come back, this one is here, these lift buttons are pressed like this.  Let's go here Doctor Saheb, it is not that those parents have turned 88, 88, 90, you have to hold the finger of the one, brother, you do not have to hold the finger of the 64, he still has the strength, isn't it, when there are fights, then the house  I come out with all my strength. I let my 68, 70, 72 year old parents shout so much. I say, if you are sitting with so much of your life, then why do you make noise about this disease? You have a lot of life, people come to my consultation, people themselves are their own.  In order to understand the treatment, they would have told that you scream and shout, yes, you scream, then you are also sick, yes, you are sick, that's why you scream, or you scream, that's why you are sick, or if you are not sick then this.  Have to release that they can go for the procedure because they have to teach you Dear Pa Papa Dear Mummy you are just 64 you are just 65 ok and you will live till 98 If we have served you from now till 65 then our ass will be broken for 72 73 years  Then who will do it for you from 73 to 95? Papa ji, mom ji, do it as long as your essays are going on, there is no great work in your life. Please learn to do this, please papa please mommy my dear and tell them everything in the hospital, they have set up such a hospital of their own, you will get coffee here, you have to give 0 here, you have to give 50 here, please learn to use the card, if you do n't have a debit card or  Start taking notes, for this your child should take leave from his job, his 8000 day leave is 10000 day, his leave is very limited, he has to take it for his illness also, he has to take it for his child's illness.  You also have to take it for your illness, then it roams around, so it cannot go for 10 days, why don't you need it, when there will be an emergency, then everyone will come, in an emergency, the neighbor will also come, the rickshaw puller from the neighborhood will also come.  The watchman next door will also come, in case of emergency, whatever has to happen will happen, whatever routine is required, routine check up, because old age is a routine in itself, how many years does old age last, as long as you remain alive, because once you become old. You have turned 65-70, has he known any disease that comes in your 60s, has he gone with you, then how many more aartis should I perform for him, many times I speak with love, many times I feel scared, people.  What I want to drive home is the point that how did you like these four practical things so far? Please enjoy. Those who have just enjoyed this, write five, six, seven, it is very fun, it is very good, it is practical. Fifth, please tell your parents.  Be it a small town or a big city, in a big city, you get this urban clap and all these things. Teach them how to use another wise brother, three electricians, three plumbers, three carpenters. Give them the numbers of all such services.  You will not get the second one, you will get the second one, you will not get the third one, these are the ones who you have verified because you are elderly, you cannot send anyone like this, these are the people in the house, these are the people you call when you live.  You behave and you tell them that brother will ask you to do this work, do it quietly and they have a habit of giving 200 for the work of 00, so you quietly take 200 and give me the Paytm number, I will give you for 300 otherwise this is half my life.  If she goes here like this and if she goes out, then she will be unwell, then only my family will have to come here, to save the parents, it will cost them lakhs of rupees for their children, they are not concerned, this is the bitter truth of life. Why is he talking like this or why is he talking like this or is it true that he understands his money then you also know whether you are serving here or saving your 3 lakhs, see that, this practicality is telling.  I am you because that money has to be spent by you because it remains in it, the next point is related to this, the sixth point, teach your parents request, beg them, teach them, request beg bag.  Of course, the maids who come to the house, sweep, mop, or cook food in someone else's house, do the utensils, tell them not to get entangled with them, they are serving you directly, do not get entangled with them in money, routine and work. Call private maids and tell them that you know how mom is and how dad is. It is not in your power to improve them, which means stop saying anything and say that it is old age.  If you feel pain in your body, it comes out on the person next to you. Say, we stay away but it is our duty to come out on you, not on you. I will give you the brunt of it. You have to increase your courage next time.  If you want to do something then tell me and if my mother deducts your leave money for two days, four days or five days and you feel like running away, then please call me, I will help you.  I have got paytm2, I also deduct the money, I scold you, I am also scared, she is enjoying a lot and secretly you have told her what will happen to the maid otherwise, the maid will leave every fourth day and leave on the fifth day. These maids should also have an association.  These days, everyone knows each other, come that koti, that koti, that flat, that koti, there is something like this in him, he is such a mad person, he will do something like this, don't know, do n't know, then what will happen if there is any meed in your parents' living in the family?  don't come As for you, your mother is now worried and sad. Your father calls me. Brother, daughter-in-law, come, you come and ask us. The house is not cleaned, the food is not clean, no one wants to live with you, brother, they will not tell this, neither do we want to live nor do you.  You don't let anyone stay there anyway, so subsidize your expenses, make it seem as if you have got a maid, say Papa, I have got a maid, this one is very good and this one, papa, doesn't charge Rs 4000. Mom takes 00, I don't know, she doesn't know the rate, you are the one paying it, 1800, you are the one paying, and tell me, if mom takes leave, tell her that the money will be deducted and brother, you come on time, still mom, there is something in the end. Will she not clean from under the bed, take it from behind when she was maid, she would not have released her saree by doing it like this, okay I will go where did you go, he is still there, so for this thing.  Tell the maid, I will be your compensator, the whole game is about money, friend, get the money where you deserve it, 11 no one cries, this is the same crying in all the jobs, the boss sucks, there is no one to suck, it is a pain, a pain. That he is paying the salary of one person and is doing the work of two people, then the cry is that if he gets the salary of one person and gets the money of Rs. 1.1.  Everyone remains happy, okay, there is no such thing in the job, but what kind of idea do you think of this? Can it be like this in your daily life? The six points which I told you, the seventh one is also very sweet and important point. These six points are better for you.  There will be a relief and a happiness in the life of the parents and their bitterness will be reduced. The frustration will be reduced. In the house where the elders are present, in the family where the elders are unhappy, that family can never be happy. This is what I am telling Guruji, everyone.  They also do it, but the fact is that what is there now, no matter what they do, they have to cry, then they will be happy because they are not taking out their pain anywhere in a practical way. They say, \"You don't come, hey, what will happen if that boy comes?\"  He will sit down and then the boy will talk for five minutes and for 10 minutes he will say what happened to the shop and the plot at the corner, he has to talk like this, what else will he talk about after 5-10 minutes and then you will say, yes for my money, yes for money  If you are interested then what should we talk about, tell me what should I talk about child, you have to tell him that you have eaten well, you have slept well, you have slept well, girl, you are fine, you are thin, you are fat, everything is like that, hey, what do you mean, so fit?  You have been living as you have been, your children will be like this, now those children do not look good. Parents also have the problem of being out of form. They have been sitting there for a long time. No problem sir, there is a video in Kajam about respecting and serving the parents, it is okay.  I don't do this. The seventh point is very important. It is very important and the elderly people are not doing it at all. Even the men in their 60s are not doing it. The 60s are not doing it. Any man in his 60s and any woman in her 70s. Hey, you have become old, so what has happened to the money? You have so much hair, your hands and legs are crooked, they are crooked due to some disease, then beyond that, give some massage massage to your face, get your parents massaged here.  Get membership of salon which is available in good cities and nowadays in all good cities in India, there is a discount up to Rs 40, if you take membership once, I am talking about a city like Gurgaon, that means it is such a thing that you have 15  If you have paid 20 Haj and taken membership, then whoever is going to get a haircut, if he is at 40, then the parents should think that at 40 they are done with it, if nothing has gone out of your pocket, then they have to.  Whatever you want, get a manicure, mummy, get a pedicure here, get a neck massage here, get a back tea here, insure every five-seven days, sometimes go for a haircut, sometimes get a face massage, sometimes get a hand massage, sometimes get a manicure, sometimes get a pedicure, and all the things that 50 aunts have opened.  Maha neck massage, get this treatment, that treatment, get it done, how much will it cost in a year, 10000 15000  It will take 200 Hajj, let it happen, their bitterness is reducing and sometimes even call it a gift, just say half of it is a gift from me, I have not done anything on your happy birthday, I have not done anything on your happy anniversary, let me give you this.  Gift the gift. Massage to your mother and father. Nowadays, it has happened in big cities. You can do Jugaad in small towns also. There is a lady who knows how to do massage in every city of India. You will find massage people in India, some will come by pap, some will come by call, some will come through jugaad, either in the village or in the city. Earlier, in the villages of India, all the ladies who were pregnant, some who were old, all were massage givers. So catch them and get them done by your parents and tell them to apply oil on the body, the oil will be applied on your body, it will not cause dryness, there will be no irritation of the skin, there will be a feeling of freshness in the body. You take those nuggets or you take roti and put chopra on it, it becomes like a churma, then you make it like a normal patha, like a plain one, without salt and by adding sugar and ghee in it, and the people of Haryana understand such a wonderful churma.  I will get pimples, it will get pimples and the body will also get pimples like this. Apply cream, ghee, olive oil, oil on the head, oil here, now you, now you parents, look, now I will do the video, okay, parents, go somewhere.  Half of the time, people who are fathers have no place to go in their old age, someone will play cards next to them, someone will sit with old people next to them, but the lady who has to go, what should the poor girl do? Let her relatives go. He has to go shopping, he has to go to the market, something, he can't go, he says, old man, you know how to drive a car but you do n't drive the car, this woman does n't have the brains to ask for a driver or should I go somewhere.  I wonder if I can become independent, they keep fighting among themselves, they fight among themselves so much, it means that the parents have become such a situation that the children have become counselors of the children, if there is no problem in the married life, which is the case nowadays. I go on because of what ever reasons, then their parents, your mother said this, your mother said this is happening to you, you get a call, seeing your mother, your father. Why are you frustrated, friend, go out on a date, take the money, spend it on your body, that is, on your chest, by the time you give it to your children, I don't know how much their value will be. The FD that you have made, their assets are not going to become anything, but still they will be worth something.  All will be given, take your money and spend it, your frustration will be less, you have to live for many years, this is the body and these are the hands, apply them cream, apply cream, apply forest essential, apply this, I will tell you the name.  If you say that there is no affiliate marketing then I am just telling you the name, apply anything, apply expensive desi ghee, apply good one, but when your body will work well from outside and like this, your money will go away, then the driver will come to you.  You will go to the hospital, you will know where to collect medicines, you will go to watch a movie, you will go to a restaurant sometime, you will go to a familiar bar with the woman who has been your wife for the last 50 years, from 40 years to 45, sometimes you will feel something good.  It is not necessary to go with someone else, violate their privacy and yours. Go, sit, speak sweet words with love, do not eat too much, eat a little, drink juice. Hey, your days are so short in big cities that you are so cold.  Organic good food, all that is available outside, that is a different thing, it costs Rs. 2,000,000, you get a good environment, look at what is happening, look at how India has progressed.  What is happening, go out and see the electrician, plumber, carpenter, keep their numbers, they are Shani Dev of so many hands, they do so much work, do not deduct their money, you will deduct Shani 's money here, he will give pain in your bones. Are you listening brothers and sisters, not uncles and aunts?  I am much older than me, I have just washed my hair, I am younger, it is okay, so he is having pain in the body, and whatever work Shani does, who is Shani Sangola in the session, this is the kind of video.  Do you understand who is Astrology Shani? Those people of the lower class who are doing hard work, the poor people are working hard with their hands and feet, the government will be very happy by saving the rupees and fifty-eight rupees of those people, Thakur will be very happy, who will be happy?  No one will be happy, Gabbar will not be happy, whoever it is, whoever you want to understand, whoever is running the world, okay, no one will be happy, he will give you pain, then he says, take more mijbil and mijbil and bite someone else's.  Mirable again people stop coming, a stage comes like this, no electrician comes, says that the house is on fire, I do n't know electricity, she doesn't give money, and the tap is broken, plumber is not ready to come, last time again money  They had cut it off, why would anyone go? These people have a lot of work, brother, these days, where only the elderly are left, neither are the maids happy to work, nor are these people happy to go, this is also a fact, they do not get any money.  pitch pitch  It's too much, change your nature, everyone has to grow old and teach those who are old, teach them to the parents and please give your number to these service providers and say brother, whenever my mother calls, father calls, yes yes madam, do it like this.  Reach immediately, madam madam, your son has asked, that's why we come doing this feeling, son, you don't come at my behest, you come at the behest of your sons, so you take money from us, people will also like this comedy but all this is practical.  I am telling you things, please do that and there is a definite need to get membership of the salon. You people need it very, very much because when the body is well oiled from outside, massage and groom is there, the body is fragrant and soft, there is softness in the hands.  The hands are very soft and soft, press like this, the hands are very soft and there is no irritability, the pain in the bones is reducing or if you do any massage, the blood will flow.  Half of the blood doesn't flow even after touching 70. Now where can I get it from? Walk, walk or keep doing it, then it will go a little above the normal level. Take medicine here, get massage done and it will go. When it goes, it will go to the brain and also to the stomach.  There will also be digestion and it will go everywhere in the liver, then in a few days the eyes will open like this. Brother, you were right. I have done good to many people and to thousands of people. No brother, as soon as I felt like it, something opened up.  brother and all  I am suffering from diseases because things are not working, everything is stuck everywhere and there is irritability, garbage, garbage, garbage, so please today I have done everyone a favor.

    "title": "07 Things Which Indians Need To  Free Themselves From ｜  Independence Day Special Video [jm4n_nTE4b0].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, wish you all a very happy independence day. Today on the day of independence, talking about independence, I have brought seven things for you due to which you now have to work for freedom. The country has got independence. The country is free but there are seven things which can stop us.  I will tell you about those topics to live a happy life. All my content will be around this. In the coming time, the first thing is freedom from job. For this, all employed people have to work. Many people are saying.  If you have not yet got a job, then you are free from the job. Yes, the person who is employed has to work because if you have not done the work, brothers and sisters, there will be seven things, I will tell you in a very good way, which one did you like best, tell me, prepare only for the seven.  You have to do it according to me, but you tell me your favorite one and tell me in the order, which one do you like the first two-three, if you have already got the job, if he or she will not work for freedom from the job, then he or she will be punished for 45 years.  I will be freed just like that, after that there will be no utility, I will be thrown out like sucked sugarcane, I have to get freedom, if you go towards freedom yourself then you will have better control, working and earning money is for 7580 years, no one can stop him  If you are not doing it then this was the first thing, the second thing is the freedom you have to work, brothers and sisters, everyone has to work, that is freedom from toxic people around you, this friends.  It may be in your relatives, it may be in your relatives, tear the page from the book, it is not possible, it is not possible to do this. Many years ago, it seemed that when the country was a slave of the British, freedom did not seem possible. 1885 1890  1905 1910 But you have to work hard to be free, you have to work hard to get freedom from toxic friends, from toxic people  Take freedom, take freedom from emotional dependence on people, this is what happens in life by learning something new, so today on the day of independence, I have a discount, you will find it in the comment section, there is a discount of freedom on 25 of all the workshop webinars I have done till date.  The code is Azadi 25 please go to download and watch them and buy it. Relationship workshops are there. Pre marital consultation is a complete 12 of astrology.  The class has a happiness course, one happiness is a lot, that is how to become a writer, a lot of things, whatever you understand, whatever you like, take it, the pricing is low, but today there is a discount of Rs. 25 for you all, so after that, the third thing. You have to work for freedom. You have freedom from the fear of your future. The fear of the future is troubling many people. It is a fear of what will happen. You will have to work hard to get freedom from it, but this  There is a third thing that I would like, the fourth thing is freedom from people's influence or narrative. Now there are influences like us, we are also influences, but whatever narrative is being made in life, you have to apply your mind, you have to awaken your intelligence, discretion, consciousness yourself, do not go to anyone.  Because whoever awakens will have a narrative, always have your own agenda and narrative, otherwise you will fall prey to someone else's agenda and narrative.  I am a person who fights for the freedom of the individual and for the power of the individual, if not for any political party or power center, then the fifth freedom that we have to take is from the party leaders and their idol, this is the idol of BJP, the idol of Hindutva Congress.  I will become a socialist idol, I will be a lieutenant, sometimes I will be seen on the left, sometimes I will be seen in the center, I will make myself our own. We all have to make our own idol, we will not fall.  Do it for someone whom we feel is right, okay today I am not analyzing the speech of the top leader, today is a happy day, so you will understand from him what the analysis is going to be, it will happen tomorrow, okay, that speech will be analyzed tomorrow.  There are no such great shakes to be done today. If anyone is thinking, okay, I had talked about negativity also, a very lovely video of mine on the top leader will probably come today itself. This is not the one to explain negativity on the Independence Day.  So no people, anything wrong is happening in life and people will say that, don't talk about it, it is a negative thing, do positive thing, it is very stupid, that video will come, this is the video of India's number one clarity giver, this is my video, you will get clarity after watching it. Maybe I will release it today itself, if you want, in the comment section, okay, like the channel and subscribe. Sixth thing, this disease is very strong, this disease is very strong, we have to take freedom from it.  Have a habit of being bored, try to get freedom from bad habits, take a pledge, today the biggest thing is being bored, I am seeing children getting bored, I mean, how can children get bored, if old people are getting bored then it makes sense.  There is nothing to do, even children are getting bored, youth are getting bored, so much to learn, so much to do, don't know what to do, how can you be bored, if you are bored then people who are in excess will go towards addiction, towards masturbation.  Will go towards pawn addiction, will do anything  You will not work well if you should not be bored. There should be an agenda for your time. Which channel should I watch? Who should I learn from? What should I learn today? There should be a register. A pen should always be handy. There should be paper and my notes, like I do while walking, should always be with me.  I never understand my writing, even I do it with great difficulty, but they keep making something like this, something, something, something, something, something, they must be unable to understand the writing, somewhere, some thought process, they have learned something.  make someone else  Even if it is typing, type it according to the date, keep it in the phone, keep it anywhere, whatever you learn, always keep learning, keep learning, do not get bored, never ever, if you consume good content.  If you do then you will not get bored, if you stop watching short reels, these short reels are ruining us, they make us go through five emotions within two minutes, sometimes a dog, a cat, sometimes a girl, a beautiful girl, sometimes hatred towards religion, sometimes some food item for the mind.  have curd Five emotions of the brain go away, we cannot deal with such emotions like hate now, fear now, lust now, food now, sound now entertainment, meaning don't expose so much because that random thing will come, our brain is getting fried.  Do not consume reels at all is an addiction I am a content creator I have made 2000 00 videos but I don't even have 20 shots I tried it many people said and  Many of my shots have been taken by other people to whom I have given the podcast or many people have cut them and made them, so they are mine. Otherwise, I am not a fan of reels. Nothing of any use is explained in 30, 40, 50 seconds. It can give you just dopamine and serotonin and it can be made to play. Do n't do this in the brain with hormonal chemicals. You can avoid the habit of being bored and get freedom and seventh most  Important thing: Work like financial independence. Financial independence does not mean that you do not have to earn money. Enough is enough. Financial independence means that in your life, brothers and sisters, with whom do I have to work, what do I have to do, if I can decide the work.  You have to always earn money, this will happen through SIP, this will happen, you cannot become financially independent on this formula, you will become financial dependent fresh cash.  Flows can be achieved only by doing fresh work, by doing gig economy, by creating side income and by creating multiple sources of income. No SIP can liberate you, if you invest this much in 30 years, this much will be there in 50 years, everyone will die in that many years, so if you have something  If you want to learn a new thing then again go to the comment section and in the beginning you will see it in the comment section and then while leaving you will say Bharat Mata Ki Jai loudly. When you are excited then both hands are raised. That is, today we saw only one hand raised, when there is real enthusiasm and determination, then both of these have to be done like this in life, always close all your fists like this and now we will resolve in life that we have done seven things for the sake of freedom, I told you.  Do you have a favorite John-like way, do that or do all seven of the seven? This is your fist, this is your hand, make it a fist like this and close it like this, see how much energy you feel, let me show you by doing one thing, do everything like this. Listen with me, wherever you are, keep the phone a little away, make fists like this, enjoy and do like this, take a pledge in your mind that we will get freedom from all these things, these narratives are fear, fear of job, slavery of job, toxic boss.  These are toxic people, this is the party, these are the leaders, these are different idols, those who spread hatred in the name of religion, today we will take freedom from hatred, nothing has ever happened by hating, earn money in life, grow as much as you can.  You can hate, nothing can ever be achieved. Brothers and sisters, the enemy would have been there because the enemy is hated. If the enemy would have been destroyed by hatred, then why have we made such an expensive defense budget of lakhs. Why are we maintaining the army only because of hatred?  We will do it, we are 145 crores, we are the popular country of this world, no one can hate us more than us, there are so many of us, so everyone is being judged like this, let the enemy blow you away with hatred, brother, he does not fly away with hatred, you have to make some efforts for him.  is that  Luck will be a physical thing, money is needed to acquire it, countrymen have to work to earn money, they have to work, they do not have to hate, they are seen standing together, it has been 10 years, there must be some tiredness of hatred and hatred, now even outsiders can see it.  Outsiders are also watching from all sides, otherwise this is such a tight situation, then now is not the time to hate each other in our house. I am not saying at all that you should open a shop of love, it may or may not be opened, it is not possible.  But hatred can be reduced, hatred can be reduced, focus on your life, earn your money, enrich yourself, make yourself happy, then while leaving, say Bharat Mata Ki Jai Jai Shri Ram and like this we will spread our enthusiasm with both hands.  We will do it from the same and it will remain like this and the countrymen now have to work everywhere. There is no need to look for Captain Saheb now. Focus on hitting your fours and sixes. Captain, many have come, many will come in future also and will keep coming. We need to play our game and play our game.  focus on  Thank you very much, subscribe the channel, like and wish you a very very happy independence day and every time you need energy in life, you have to close both the fists, do it like this, energy comes, try this, it is absolutely fine.  I hope I put some energy into you guys, had some fun. Enjoy and wish you a very very happy independence day. Thank you very much."

    "title": "07 Things Which Middle Class Needs To Teach Their Children [h44ftyXywvg].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, I have brought seven amazing things, if you are between 18 to 23 years, you must do 18 to 25, but above 23, it will be a little big. This is a period of five years, if you listen as a parent also.  If you are, then please try to get your children to do it, show it to them, you cannot force it with today's children, so show the video to the children, tell me how much do you agree with them? What are its benefits, I will tell you that it will be a lot of fun. I have told seven practical things to many people, many have implemented them, many people are very happy. Whatever I am telling here, I am telling it to the children of the middle class and the rich.  It can happen for children also, it is okay if you live in a particular society like upper middle class, middle class, you are okay and your child has gone to college, he is 18 years old or is in the third year. In the fourth year, if he is in college or is looking for a job, is doing something, then asking him to do these five-six things or asking him to do seven things will be very beneficial for him and if the children are listening to me, then definitely do this. What is the end of it?  Parents' respect for you will increase a lot, love will also increase a lot and there is a lot of irritability in the parents because they are people, they behave in a very entitled type C manner and when the parents are very sad then they should tell their children seven things.  If you get all seven of the seven done then you will become Jhinga Lala. If you don't get seven then get five done. If there are no five then get three done. If three are not available then just choose two, it will be done easily, then seven things will be done. Let's start with the first thing.  Be it a boy or a girl, it is applicable for both, you have to give tuition to your child, teach anyone, earn money, teach English, teach Maths, John Saw is his subject, there is no child who cannot teach even if he wants to.  I am not saying that at all 11th and 12th coordinate geometry and if he is of that level then by all means he must know the subject, he must know a good amount of English, sixth class, seventh class, whatever, you will get it in the society itself.  You have to choose the subject, there is nothing about money, I am not saying that 10000 or 200 Haj, because when you start doing this, whenever you do this, you will get money because any money can be earned.  I am not teaching you to earn, everyone wants to earn but this is not a practical thing, it is very easy, four students, five students, 10 students, two students, six students, one hour not every day, not every alternate, his rates may be different for you, this work has to be done, it is okay, second thing.  Get your child to do a small certification course in those digital marketing skills. It is great if he works for someone else and he will earn if he understands it, otherwise he will need it for himself in the future.  There should be social media handles for all its types, so do this second thing to it. Social media is actually being watched not just by sitting like a consumer. Hey brother, some people should also go into its other side and understand how the algorithm works. facebooksignup  .in Skills, if this comes then the child's life is set. Many parents are worried about my child. I don't know what will become of my child. Worry is right. Worry is right about what will become. Make yourself instead of listening to what will become of the person.  The child is a good person, first of all he has started earning money through tuition, he is learning digital marketing and cooking, he will also help his mother in the house, mother will love him so much, be it a boy or a girl, he is directly supporting you.  There is a cook available and if the mother can help and both the children are grown up, both of them are cooking something and the father is also helping a little, then the hygiene conditions of food in the house are also better and the food also tastes good.  And If someone cooks food with his own hands, whether it is a child or a human being, he cannot go into depression, he cannot be sad, he gets a sense of fulfillment, when the dough becomes wet enough to make roti, then a transformation is seen in it, then you can become like this.  You take and make roti, then it swells like this, then on the other side you apply ghee and give it to someone, you eat it yourself, this is a journey to see that flour from here to here, that vegetable is lying like this, that after cutting, its shape changes, that turmeric. Valdi Mach Masala Lag, this is a very good thing, this is the fourth thing that you have to teach, in a controlled environment, I am not telling you to make your child a taxi driver, you have to make someone a car driver where he can charge money and help people in their society.  If you can help, you are available for one or two days, this will improve his driving skills, he will drive in a controlled environment, the child has learned to drive, he has got the license, but he is driving, yes, he is driving with his face raised, so you are speaking.  He is wasting petrol, now he has to go from here to there and he will come in the next fifth or sixth place, how else can you do this thing, your own child can be a shopping assistant for whom, for anyone in the society. Only in the circle of friends around you will they charge you money. This is the shame that Indians have to break. When you break this shame and start earning money, your child will reach places. A normal child goes anywhere, a fool goes to play with friends. Such a hassle, hey, he is shopping for jeans somewhere in the proper way, where he knows where he can get a gift, he will also go to the shopping mall to get food, he will also feed him, the next person is taking him in the car, so who will take his money too?  There are many of them, your daughter is 21-22 years old, there are many aunties who can be taken comfortably, those whose husbands do not take them because they are 60-70 years old, they must have a husband, they do n't know how to drive a car now or not to drive.  Whether one wants to go or not one wants to go, now the one who felt shy in this and ho ho ho did not like it, then you are middle class, you will remain poor, now you are becoming poor, middle class is fine, have you seen the child of a poor or a poor person?  He does not hesitate in anything and this is what our youngsters are doing by going to foreign countries and doing all the work. If your own children could not do it here, then this is not to make all the work permanent, it is to remove his hesitation and to save his time.  to utilize  This is for his child to earn money and to give him a confidence that he can earn money even without getting a degree because nothing magical is going to happen after the degree. You have to do shopping for yourself too if you want to help your child.  You say four kilos, this, 2 kilos, that one kilo of mangoes, do this and bring it like this, then what is that, if they go, they also do not want to order, they don't know and will not bring good quality, they will not bring good quality today, they will never bring good quality.  he will come just like this Declare, he is coming with the luggage. Bring the luggage, he will bring it. Tell him to do this. Sixth thing: It is very important to take the child to the hospital. The child himself has to go to his family. He has to go somewhere. Nothing comes for free even for outsiders.  The child is available, his time is available, time is precious, it has a price, he will go to the hospital, he will learn everything because it is possible that you too will need it tomorrow, so he knows all the systems in your society, there is a need to advertise it a lot now.  Not there.  Then you can fix his days. It is not that he has to do any work every day, it is not that he is doing all this work by leaving his studies. A schedule can be made for your child on a daily basis from four to six.  He wastes hours. In 30 days, at least 125 to 150 hours are being wasted. If he does all that work on mobile, then he will know which scale up can also be done. The seventh point is very simple and  It will seem a bit strange that he has to iron his clothes. Yes, press his clothes. Don't give it to the washerman. The washerman takes five, six, seven and 10. He takes more than the bedsheet and anything else. So in your family, whatever clothes he has, he will do the same as the washerman.  If he is ready to do it then you give him five, seven or ten rupees and he will do it well. He goes to wash, pours dirty water, lives in a dirty environment outside and does the same in the clothes of 10 people. Brother, your clothes are tied in a bundle, it is your own child, it is not yours, he will not do it, he will do it for Rs. 100, he will give money like this for free, no one does it, encourage him when he feels like doing one press, I will get ₹ 10.  You are getting 10 clothes at home. How many clothes does a family have? One for four people will be the same. Don't give it for yourself, but you can give it for your money. You, you are the father, I have pressed your shirt. give him ₹10  No, he is telling me to make him a man of Rs. Yes, I am telling him to make me a man of Rs. 10. Today he will become a man of Rs. Then he will become a man of Rs.  This is how counting starts. This is how counting starts. It starts from one. If you make a thousand rupees straight away, it may take you 6 years to make that thousand rupees. I am making you a rupee today itself and then it will happen.  could After a day it becomes 00 and after one month it becomes 1000 and after three months it becomes 10000 because it has started, no youtube1 every buddy starts from zero, any new channel will be created, it will start from zero, it is dependent on.  So many things will go, so I am starting you now, so what will happen with this, what will happen to the parents by doing all this, will the irritability in life go away that my child would do something?  Not only this, now you are seeing that your child is waking up on time, he is driving the car, he is ironing the clothes, he is also cooking, he is also doing some digital marketing etc., he is also giving tuition to the children. Now the child who is earning Rs 00,0000 is earning Rs 40,000. Now you open his demat account, get him a PAN card, open SIP of his mutual fund to manage his money properly.  Tell me more, son, this is your money but spend only Rs. 10000 on it and save Rs. 0000. Those children, brothers and sisters, come to me bud wise to do so much SIP like this, do it like that, they start from 24, now I am from 18.  I am saying, from 18 onwards, now apply Tigam 30000 SIP till 24 and 40 and 60, now apply the entire amount.  If you want to play, whoever is okay with it, he will do it in the beginning. The one who has learned to earn money, his attention is focused on earning money, now if he is focused on earning money, then do love night, will you get L or something, then that is okay.  His attention will be focused on it, then his friends will also become like this, then maybe he will get the idea of ​​making an app, then the idea of ​​a startup will come, then he will open a shop where the press is being done, where the car is being sold, then  Startup is done, I am that I am not asking him to do this work because he has to make him this kind of person. Brother, he can make a very good app in which all such people can come together, all become drivers, all become the normal people of all the houses.  They are helping in their own vehicles. Somehow, all of them are verified. They are earning money and cut it. Sky is the limit. Start doing it once. All seven things out of seven are double. If seven out of seven are not there then  Do five, do four, whatever you choose, do the following, do this today, do this on Monday, do this on Tuesday, do this on Wednesday, do this on Thursday, do it as you want, but this is a practical thing, if someone likes this  Feeling inferior. What's wrong with doing household chores? What's wrong with cooking? What's wrong with giving tuition? What do many people do? Parents think that if I have given tuition to my child, then these are my stories.  He will tell that I did my education through tuition, which means that the respect of parents will reduce because parents tell such stories. Okay, this is also a big problem. The whole outlook of parents is not to make their children do this because of their thinking.  The method is a bit defective, they feel that tomorrow no one should say that we did not allow him to study, we did it well, hey brother, he is wasting a lot of time, but not a lot of time, but if he is preparing for IAS.  So all this yes, if he is preparing for IAS then don't do all this because he has to prepare for IS. In 141 years, even Ram ji had come from exile, but preparation for IS is not completed in 14 years, people are fine.  So brother, if you are getting yourself prepared for UPSC then don't get it done, it is fine because he does n't know what he wants to become, it is fine, but if that preparation is not going on for you and you are a practical person, you want to be happy in life, you want to give very good care to your children. Want to be happy with the presence, you know, the child is a parent, all the parents listening to me is it a joy, the child is doing his own work, he is earning money, this is secondary, he has the ability to do this, the skills which I have told are very simple skills. Teaching food because while cooking, one's hands are used, one part of the brain is used in tuition, one part of the brain is used in tuition, one's skills are used in driving.  It is used to take people to the hospital, to help someone, to go shopping like this, to know about the world, to know what is happening at home, to do your ironing, this is theraput. I want to say to all of you, no matter how sad you are.  And those who are depressed and live like this, start doing your press, these days the steam press comes when she leaves, by doing this it is as if her steam is coming out, right, you will release your steam is also coming out, I am telling you such a Guruji thing. people their own  That's what your pants are, you press them, my relatives write like this, many people and acquaintances, you press yours, they ask very personal, everything is a done thing, yes, everything is known, it's just like this, Hello friends, everything cannot be done by deep thinking.  The video is not made just like that, you do any other work of your own or not, you will iron your clothes, your pants or your shirt or your suit and in your life, the husband who removed the child from his wife and ironed his wife's suit.  I also pressed it without burning it and  There is a lot of benefit in that too from good to good, there is a lot of benefit, big planets get activated, hot clothes, Mars gets activated in the sense of doing Venus to the wife, Saturn gets activated in the sense of doing you, a lot of things get activated, an astrologer can't help himself.  I am telling all the other things in depth friend, otherwise I have to tell many times, where did you read, why did you read, what is the use, who said it, I will not tell much, I will leave this much, so please do all these things, it will be very beneficial and how many will comment.  In the section, write ' We will attempt athlete' or 'We are doing these three', 'We will do this' or 'We will do all seven'. I enjoyed it.

    "title": "07 Things Which They Will Divert Your Focus Towards In The Next 100 Days [iEmdzcgg2g0].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, seven things where you will have a lot of attention and focus in the next 10 days, I will tell you right now and here I will tell you which things you should focus on without focusing that much, so please spread this thing because it is already a trend.  It is going on, the next 100 days have started, the biggest focus is till the World Cup finals, the focus is on the World Cup, so you have to watch India's matches, watch a few in between, watch some batting.  Some?  You have to watch it, but don't get sucked up into it. Analysis of the match in the first analysis. Even in the break, the match was won. Virat Kohli did not get a century. He hit a six in the end. What happened? Who was the enemy of the match? Who was the winner of the match?  No, it should have been like this, don't get into the analysis, don't get into the analysis, you won't get any benefit. Another thing beyond which there will be too much focus. Brother, this is a war. Palinam, now the material has been sent. You don't know on which side your own government is.  You yourself should be emotional whatsapp-web, this means how much it means to have someone from your village, even if it is from your village, the man should understand that he does not know who is fighting, you have to analyze it, you want to know everything, I tell you this.  I will also tell you why we go astray here and there, I will also tell you, but first yes, don't go astray, I will tell you all those seven things and if you concentrate on where to go for the next 100 days, then how far you will go in life.  If you tell me how you will go ahead of the competition, then tell me the first two things. The third thing is that there is a recession in the US, there is a recession, there is a recession, the Fed is going to come there, it will do this, it will do that, this will happen here in the market, this commentary will also come a lot.  There is no need to discuss this beyond a limit and there is no need to understand that FII has told me that when I should focus on what, I will tell you why these incidents are also happening. Okay, so you should discuss this also.  of  There is no need after that, it has to happen on elections, it has to happen on elections, come listen, subscribe to my channel, I also cover elections as entertainment, but whenever I cover anything, any of my videos is a claim.  This is mine, I want to tell you whether this is claim right or color then please write in the comment section. If claim is right then write CR. If claim is right and claim is color then write CW.  The claim in the comment section is that whatever I come and cover, things good, bad, negative or positive, what is happening in the society, does not suck your energy, does not make you bitter from inside, does not make you hopeless from inside.  No, juice will not come out after watching my video. If there is some juice inside, it will not get sucked out. It will feel as if something or the other has been put inside. This is a big thing, content, so you will have to see all this, you will also have to understand a little bit.  I am telling you first, after that let's move on to Reservation Caste Census. There is a big discussion on this. My video on reservation is pending, beyond that I will give you better clarity. This has to be done, who is getting it, you know who is not getting it.  As for what is happening, I will cover all that further, but on top of this, there is going to be a lot of energy in the society, you can be in any stage, you can be in this side also, in this side there is also a side which  it is happening in your hands  I don't have it, you can do more by shouting at him because there is Supreme Court in it. What is all this now? There is a saying in Haryana that marriage songs are not made with all the songs during the wedding do not turn out to be true.  In real life, elections are the next topic that you will be focused on elections too, it is about politicians, they will give this, they will give, this is how my audience and all of us will give.  This is a channel for those who are middle class or above and have risen above the level of livelihood. Please, with folded hands, I will tell you that if you are actually poor, then there are 1.5 crore more channels for the poor and you can go there many times.  It seems that you sound very elite. Yes, sometimes we have to make separate channels. I have many mass channels too, so I want to make this small channel so that you can talk about such things in a relaxed manner.  sit so that we  Also, crowd sourcing of information and all these values ​​and all this, in this way we can carry forward one thing and which is going to be discussed a lot, that movies after movies will also be lined up like this, so the juice of patriotism has been taken out, all the movies are on end.  This will de-sensitize people in the name of patriotism because ultimately patriotism is also an emotion, like all other emotions, it is a good emotion, I am not saying it but brother. Don't whip up your emotions so much that all your patriotism gets released on the spot that when you saw the Kashmir file, the emotions got released right there, that 400 crore rupees were earned, it did not benefit any Kashmiri Pandit, then please tell us, we came to know that this happened.  You came to know then what happened then what did you uproot, you know we hate, we will nurture, yes we nurtured, then that button was made to press first, it will press more tightly, that's all it will take, one how hard to press, only one vote.  I have to know, I show all this through acting so that it is necessary to bring out the emotions that come from within many people. People do stand up and I sit down. There is no benefit in sitting comfortably, she got it.  He got the award, they got it, they also got it, many people get awards, okay, so the movies will take you inside like this, she will come in a movie, I will tell you now, she will come in the end, Naksha wali is coming, they will watch her trailer, she will also watch it.  I will analyze And then ahead of it the fighter one will come, then maybe this one, what is its name, Randeep Budha, this one will also come, this Savarkar one is fine, then there will be discussions on all that also, it will attract a lot of attention, what do we have to do, we have to know all these things and identify them. But don't suck your energy, do n't get attached emotionally. Keep all these emotions which are real, your wife, children, family, brothers, sisters, parents, mother-in-law and father-in-law. Okay, so all these things will suck your energy and Then Ram ji's temple is going to be built in Ayodhya in January, that will be a big event. You will have a lot of event management in 100 days in the coming four-three months. Today, it will continue to be seen here on TV. You don't want to see Ram temple.  When the Ram Lalla temple will be built, it will be held in January, it is on 22nd January, it is a big event anyway, it was told that no one else will come there because this is the region and we know what a region is, a show stopper.  so one  Only I come, but my faith is full, I will go myself, okay, off course, maybe I should not go on 22nd, after that, we all should go, we all will go, but we will not consume that thing endlessly, buy a ticket for the whole plane, get down to Lucknow, Lucknow, go from there, bye.  Look at the road, stay for two-four days, take photos, have faith, we will definitely do it, but how much time will it take, 48 hours, 72 hours, darshan has been achieved, peace has also been achieved, work has also been done, some money has also been spent, okay but many people do not do this.  We will waste much more time than this and there was no actual feeling of devotion in it, no energy exchange took place, no darshan took place, no place was seen, you see where I am explaining what needs to be done, now listen to this, in the next 100 days, it is all yours.  It will go away with time but where do you have to focus? First of all you have to focus on four-five things. Real estate is running on real estate. Tuk Tuk Tuk Tu Tu Tu. Whoever has to buy or sell his is a very good time for both the things. And in English there is a word called Restructuring of Assets. This is a very big field. Restructuring of Assets is something that is lying with the parents, they are not doing anything, they are sleeping with money, they are not able to understand everything, some are running ahead, no one is selling or doing anything. I am doing all these things, I explain them very well through this video. You will find four-five groups in the comment section, so those who want to understand real estate, I do webinars, some for free, sometimes for Rs. 90, Rs. 95, sometimes paid.  You can join them, there are groups of info webinars, there are groups of my real estate channel, subscribe to it because all this discussion which I have told you along with it will suck your 100 days and what will happen here which will directly affect you.  You will keep discussing about the price of tomato and its price, it is the price of petrol, petrol has become ₹ 1, it was ₹ 1 in 1991, if you look at it according to inflation, there is no growth at ₹ 4 and  They are crying so much, the thing that was on 000 square feet of yours will be on 00 square feet in some city, it has grown to 70 in 3 years, it does not have that inflation because hey, you middle class, these are the things of the poor.  Why are you discussing or are you poor, you are not middle class, the property is on fire here, the flats which used to be available for Rs 1.25 crore are not available for Rs 2.25 crore, the rates of plots have increased. Concentrate here or say that I am poor, then be very clear that I am poor, for me it is about tomato and onion and what is its rate, brother, at least make a difference in this, the actual poor over there is not discussing it.  He is feeling that he has to press the button which has to be pressed, he is doing his work, he is also increasing his rates, he is also increasing the labor rates, he is increasing the rates of everything, so this is middle. Lower class class keeps discussing the topic, middle class has to discuss the topic of middle class or rich class, if you want to go ahead then this is real estate. If you want to join, I can also tell you the solution. Why did the previous one say to me, Guruji, you discuss.  If you do some solutions then you will get the solutions, brother, you will know the real estate rates of all the projects in the top seven cities, what is coming next, what is the inventory, what is the inventory over hang, what is the demand, what is it?  What is the supply, what is the demographic, what is the opportunity? You will get all the clarity, you will get it very well, you should join that channel also, subscribe to it. Second thing, in the stock market, I had earlier told that the US recession is going on and these FIIs will create ruckus in India. You know that foreign institutional investors and domestic investors now come and make noise and tell stories that people get sold in their name that the sky has fallen.  The sky has fallen and then they come and pick up as many blue chips as they can. Look at the number of blue chip shares in India, the top 10 15 20 shares of India, take Nifty, take BSC. Okay, now tell me that name.  I do n't want to do that in that, who has that much knowledge to know what is Bombay Stock Exchange, there are 30 stocks in Nifty, take 10 20 30 stocks which are from the government.  There is no control, government control means remove the government banks, these minerals of the government, whatever kind of companies they are, Coal India, remove all those others, the private ones, look at them, see what happened in them.  In the last 10 12 14 months, your ADAC bank was 00, in 2019 it is still 00 and other things, look at what happened to their profits and other things, coke because  Actually, things are at very good rates in many places and that is the matter of blue chip, every person is looking for multi baggers from inferior to micro cap, small cap and is losing his money and there are many good things left, okay the third thing which is  You should learn more. What does learn anything mean? Learn anything new. I am starting Happiness 2.0 course which is different from my Happiness One course. You can also buy Happiness One course.  You can take Happiness to Course, if you want, it will start after Diwali, on a most like date, 24th November, there will be five classes of 2 hours each and it will change your life, there will be every kind of relationship based on emotions, which is very  It is important, that will be the next important thing in life, then there is job, then there are investments and then there is food for the soul, so I told the heading five, there is a lot of juice inside it, so this winter.  You want to learn well by sitting under the quilt, adding turmeric to hot milk and having some gulab jamun sweet halwa because it will be in winter only, winter will start on 24th November and there will be classes like in five weeks or two weeks.  It will be of 2-2 hours and there will be follow ups too. I will make you a consultant. Yes, I will not come there and say anything like don't think bad, don't see bad, think positive law of attraction like this allam ballam.  I don't work, I am a down to earth leader, real happiness in life, real happiness, wealth from happiness, you can also learn the thing which you want to take because it is an iconic course, it is bound to be a full house, so if you take it now then it is good and  Maybe I can increase the course rate which is very nominal to ₹ 2500000 in total ₹ 2500000 per hour is fine, after that the thing you should focus on is your family.  My relationship, my children, I want to tell you that your focus on these seven things, brothers and sisters, is going on more because of the things that I told you about earlier, that you are talking about elections and what is happening in the ballot, discussion of pictures and discussion of all these things, reservation politics, because  All of our lives have become so dependent on ourselves that we are kept immune by outside discussions. We are parents in our 60s, our father is retired, all of us are busy discussing these drinks. What is happening in my family? Someone should help the children, boys and girls, take them a little higher in their life, discuss about them, they are not there, the mother is running away from it, the husband and wife are running away.  Everyone is running away, there is an escape because if you see it in your life, you will see this, you keep discussing, everyone should get more votes, he should get more seats, he should score more runs, Virat Kohli scores a century, it is a good thing. 48 became 49  Happy will break Sachin's bond, okay why am I saying this, burn for someone, brother, someone is becoming yours, something is happening to you, where are you going, the boy has already reached, he will come from 48 to 49, he will also turn 50.  What happened to you, when will you win the World Cup, money will be deposited in your two accounts from BCI, BCCI is sorry, don't put a single rupee in your account. If India wins, I am not saying that do not wish for India to win or do not celebrate it.  Or don't follow him, but I am saying that while doing all this, look at yourself too, where have all these people come from, where are they all going, Virat Kohli was such a dirty little boy of 1819 years and he  Meaning, look at the journey from there to there, what has he achieved in so many years, do not take that inspiration from him, do not take inspiration from him to be happy to earn money and study something in his life, he just becomes happy in that, that brother, you are just something should happen to us  Pai, you do it Munna Munna, you do it, you win the World Cup, you become a century, okay second, you are a very big leader, brother, you become the Prime Minister, you become even bigger, you will cross 300, cross 400, cross 500, your good brother.  The picture is coming, your picture will make 1000 crores brother, we are fine, yours should be 1000 crores, this time it is ok, a good fighter picture is coming, this time it is the fighter.  The picture will be released on 25th January, there will be nationalism in it, there will be a fighter in it too, this time we will break the record of Top Gun, brother, how many billion dollars did Top Gun earn, then how much will it cost India in Purchasing Power Parity, its formula is 2300 crores, brother 2300 crores.  This time we Indians are thinking that we will fail Tom Cruise, so I will also watch the picture and I will also analyze and review, but I will carry these emotions.  I don't do it from my side, whether I earn Rs 2300, Rs 3500, Rs 4000 crore or Rs 1200 crore, my focus will be on what I am doing, I want to explain that I am not refusing to do all this work, so what did I tell you when Ram Mandir  It will be done and we all have to go there, I am asking to go there, we have to go for darshan, whatever charity we have to do, after doing all the work, we will not waste 10 days in commenting on it. You are being watched on TV, go there and see, there will be debates, counter views, there will be fights and this is what these people have to do within February. Do you know how the election bugle will sound in January? In February, you know what kind of accounts will be there. Here Red said this, this said this, I will bring all these topics for you in a simple manner and will tell you easily and you will consume and I am saying again and again.  Don't bring out emotions here, just like I may do some things in acting, but inside I am so relaxed, just watch what is happening and how it is happening, focus on your health, new year is coming 2024 eight.  Number will remain, Gisu year has to remain, who will make everyone work hard. Yes, I remembered him by doing simple astrology, there is a channel of mine on youtube2 baby, it has not even started walking yet, you guys please subscribe to it, I will give its link in the comment section.  I will give it in the description, if you can find it somewhere, simple astrology, if you are not a subscriber yet, then you are missing, I am very happy, now the eight number year will come, 20224, okay, so the eight number year is not the end here, world over elections are taking place a lot.  There will be changes in the regime, there will be a lot of uncertainties, so there is no need to follow the uncertainties for six months, I will just wait for when the results of the elections will come, there will be no direct immediate impact in your life.  There is no change, I have to follow it, but follow it as an entertainment, follow it as something, yes, I want to see it, don't be so emotional, you are sitting with your vote, be very clear about who has to do it, you will see it anywhere in my channel.  I will never influence your vote through videos because I actually don't have an agenda and how can I influence, I have n't decided yet who to vote for. I haven't even decided who to vote for. I'm just watching the show. So when I haven't decided then why will I make you decide? I don't even have a decision myself so I want you to remain like this and even if it's not like this  Even if there is such a feeling that even though we have not decided, only then we will get nothing, otherwise we will not get anything at all. The Middle Class The Great Middle Class Joe Chillam Chilli twittersignin.com Tell me by looking at me, you get to know me completely.  Who am I going to vote for, I can definitely say that I can change everything in a small election, a big election or a very big election and you should also do the same and do not act as if you are its worker while walking around.  Are you a worker or a politician? There is nothing left that you are running behind. Don't know when will you get the ticket for those you are running after or will you not get it. Don't know what good they will do to you. Don't know that all the politics has now become high command type centralized. There is only some benefit.  not happening  So why do they want a different video beyond that, then please write on the comment section. How did you like this video? Please tell me. Please utilize this video for you while walking comfortably, peacefully while waiting for the metro, going in the bus, going to office regularly. This will help you to watch it.  You will save a lot of time and you will get clarity on all the topics. What I want to say is that I am influencing people's way of thinking and what I am telling you is that such a partition is being created and not loyalty being bought.  They are forcefully showing you things and you because there is so much frustration in your personal life that you have to vent it out on these issues somewhere. You cannot vent out your energy on any outsider's actual issues, you feel scared of yourself, don't you get frustrated because that  If you have to blame yourself then it is very easy. Whatever issue is going on outside, get involved in it, it is okay, get involved in the work of others, this is this and this is the irony of the situation. Look, this knowledge is being shared with you by the person who is in that community.  It's okay to screw around So I belong to a state I belong to a community It takes a dozen of you anyway I have seen it in my full observation of life that brother, not many people reach here, not many people reach anywhere. We have to reach somewhere, we have to see all these things, so we cannot run away, matches will also be seen, elections will also be seen, some news will also be seen, the fear of stock market will also be seen, stocks will also be monitored, but brother, learn something new. All this and I tell you my point of view of seeing all this, like it is said that someone who can see a little less has glasses, like these ones of mine, I don't have power glasses but they still protect me a little from screen time.  There is a little coolness in the eyes  It's fine, I just use it for that, it's fine, but if someone has power glasses or has sunglasses outside, then when you wear them, you get some kind of protection, from dust, dirt, sunlight.  So when you meet something, it is your perspective, so what is this, this is mine, I am telling you that this is also my perspective, look at all these things from the perspective of how beautiful the world is, okay with this.  to be attached tightly  Better be detached and enjoy this hug. Oh brother, it is a drama. We will not jump. We will not jump. Let us do this. Hey come brother, you are not coming. You went after asking me. You want to fight after asking me.  I had to suffer this, that does not happen, there is a fight between two people, I will call him, I will call you, brother, you come, today your brother is in danger, oh brother, you are in danger every day, go and get into trouble every day, I will not come next time, I am yours. Daily  If it is your job, then many people will attract you in this way. Come, come, come under the tent, come and put up tents everywhere, you will bring them under him without asking, you will spend the time of your whole life and ask him how many times I have gone to him, it has become his century.  The picture will be worth Rs. 300 crores, it has crossed Rs. 300, it has crossed Rs. 400, all this work will be done, then what will you do while sitting in June, so I took the paper of 100 days in advance and gave it to you.  If this has to happen, you will go through it, you cannot escape, but now you will not be so attached to all these things, you will be a little detached and enjoy. Please share, subscribe to the video channel, thank you very much."

    "title": "100th Episode ｜ Ideology Reveal Special Video ｜ Must Watch [QOYOe4tQLhY].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today that time has come, finally 100 special episodes, so I will reveal my idol ji in details, otherwise till now, have you been in this many episodes, it is like this, this is your advantage, today it is important to tell you as a disclaimer also.  It happens and I may be a little longer than this video of mine, you will also get a chance to create your own ideology in life and will also get it in the form of a template because whenever we talk about Idol ji, I am with you.  I will tell this thing through points, ideology, so the first thing I would like to tell is the first ideology, I am not polarized, there are two factions like Congress and BJP, there are poles, I am not polarized, I believe that like the earth has a north pole and a south pole, but there But life is not human, human beings live somewhere in the middle. You know that both are extremes, one has to live in between, so that is the right way in my opinion. You came and said this, didn't you do this?  If you speak against then you are not in his team, so first of all the ideal is that I am not polarized on any side, then what am I? Second point, for whom am I, I am for the individual and the family, as if sales are building blocks.  In the same way, life is the building block of the country, from individual to family and from family to society and country, if there is any problem in life then it is said in Ayurveda that if problem and disease comes from the stomach then it is the disease. If it has to be resolved then it has to be resolved at that level as to what the problem is. Whatever level the problem is in the country, it comes from the level of individual and family in the society and politics in the family. This is a political channel. We run away from politics. No, we cannot run away from our family politics and family politics itself is a big mirror of what we get in the country and I will tell further how it is right now. Okay, this is the third part of the channel.  The ideology that is mine is that whoever is the politician here and who is in power, only he will be asked more questions to take us to the real issues, we will take him from here to there so that it does not happen like that, 204 7 here and there, he did this and that. No no no no hello hello NEET exam 24 lakh children will become 1 crore family members if 24 lakh children are affected then multiply by four then that many people  Already affected so it is very important that we do the real issues okay and understand the issues like fourth I tell the point like people will say reservation is an issue no reservation is not an issue hey what are you talking real issue  There is unemployment and employment and the bigger issue than that is Livelihood. If in India everyone gets the job they deserve and it is easily available, if God comes from above and it happens, then tell me. Reservation will remain an issue, there will be a need for reservation, why is there a need for reservation because there is no level playing field for everyone, there are no jobs and they want, so when you make wrong diagnosis of the problem, you will find the solution wrong because what solution are they looking for like the opposition? Hey Rahul Gandhi ji, will I do it at 85, you do it at 500, above 100 nothing happens, you do it, what is the percentage because diagnosis is the color of jobs.  How many jobs will they create in Haryana now? Hey, there are 3.5 lakh government jobs in Haryana. So many jobs are there in Haryana. If you open another 10,20,30,000 shellac, will it change Haryana or the votes? These are some useless things but this.  No one wants to address the issue like this or want to explain it because I will explain the positioning I am doing here in detail. Let's move a little further and what is my real M? That is the one in the end.  Will come out in the line, I will tell you the next point, I want to be a champion of middle class type because I believe that the rich class is already figured out, they know everything, they are running the world, the lower class is the one.  The thing is noisy, not confused, all this media, social media, all this middle class consumes more, look at all this and the middle class, where were they going by doing exit polls etc. and where did the lower class press the button?  You all know the results that have come out because there is a disconnect. We feel that if we did this, if we did this, if we did this, then this is what will make us win. People's requirements are something else, they are not confused. They know who has to do what. We can sit here and say, sitting in a city, we can say that people of Bengal are idiots, why do you do this and that, this should be done because these are such letters, oh brother, in them my  We have wisdom. Now we should have so much wisdom that we should also talk about our issues. This is most important. A middle class is very confused. Let's move ahead. There is a middle class which is status conscious. It is quite polarized. It works on formula. It is stressed and anxious.  Relationship issue is traveling and the biggest thing is two things, write it down somewhere because mostly you are my audience and you are a politically irrelevant class.  It is a politically irrelevant class and there is a lot of confusion. My job here is to make the middle class politically relevant to the middle class because as soon as we talk, the middle class talks about something, as a class, it would not have stood up if I had said something in Haryana.  I raise the issue, Government, you are a Jat, so everyone of Congress is in such a hurry, I am Guruji, brother, I am saying that I am above the caste, I am positioning myself, there must be some caste, Sadhu's caste, right?  Ask, take knowledge, bow down, leave the sheath of the sword, Kabir ji has said that if any man is born, he will be born somewhere, his father's address is known, his grandfather's address is known, his family's address is known, so somewhere.  There will be no individual in the caste, now we are not divine but biological, so as many of us are biological, we will be born from somewhere, now we will be born from somewhere, so put a stamp on the forehead, if I am raising issues, then I am like very  Now you will say that you are the champion of the society, which class am I, maybe I am not that class, the class I am batting for, it is also possible that they don't like me much individually, so I have made this video. What do I want about ideology? What is the main thing? I want you, who are my audience, the people whom I can influence and this is my campaign to make you all disillusioned with politicians, that is, all politicians. I want to make them not become like this, they should remain like this in front of them, I want to make the public like Pushpa, by doing this, how does one stand like this, she is coming, right now her songs are coming, Pushpa Pushpa Pushpa Pushpa Pushpa, so you all the audience.  You and the respected and sir, all of them are fine, whoever wants to be made Pushpa, why can't we be Pushpa in front of the political party, I have come to the vote lane, I have made my body, my brother, ask for votes again, why can't we be [praise] Nothing is achieved by raising the Rathasaptami gut and protesting like this. No one is listening to your protest. Whose concern is there by protesting? Nobody is getting embarrassed. I will tell you how to embarrass the politician. Why are you people ashamed? I am telling you among yourselves.  I am being family centric, I am saying that people, especially elders, are not forgiving for their sons and daughters-in-law, but for politicians.  There is forgiveness, so many things get done as per one's wish, so many things go wrong, life is not going ahead because what is there, it comes down from the elders that they look at the father, what is the father, he cannot solve the issues of his house, there is not much going on in his house.  Then now he will talk about politics, what is happening in the country, what is happening in Ukraine, what is Hamsa doing, what is he doing on Israel, this channel will bring real issues, I am different from other channels of mine.  I am telling you from: If you must have seen people like Sangola Sutra, this is my main channel which is a big channel, I am telling about houses on Sangola Sutra, I am also telling on Clarity for Youth, I also talk on real estate, I also talk on astrology. I do this and this is my politics, here I am asking you to channel that energy towards the politician, do not give so much respect to the politician, there is no need for such extreme support, the most powerful man of the country has come to support him too, hey support.  If you want to do it then do it no matter what week it is, they need our support so that these politicians, they are already very rich and very powerful and very influential, do not harass them any more, they will go to their heads, I am telling all the politicians. I am here because I had already told that I am not polarized. Those who are in power should know how to tighten their grip. The public should come to ask more questions. Godi media will not ask right now.  I will also make another video in which these are the real issues of life, inflation is increasing, electricity and water problems are happening somewhere, so these are the issues that have to be raised by the politicians, we will talk about the meaning of 207, you tell this to the child. This unit test is not passing, Papa is saying final exam, final is the final exam, Papa, asking about the board exam, Papa asking about competition, means will you let someone go so soon? Do you forgive the children or do you keep them tight? Then why ca n't the public hold the politicians tight? Why can't there be Pushpa Raj where the public is Pushpa and that is its punch line. -The people are bowing down everywhere in the political rally. Everyone is bowing down to each other. You are bowing down to this one. It is happening like a trio. There is no time for photographs to be taken. What should these leaders do?  Why can't we people come and say this many times, we will become cynical, then something good must be happening in the country, whatever good is happening, it is happening, now we have come out of that jhunjhuna stage, there is a stage. When a country is progressing, there are issues of self-esteem of a country, something like this happens that friend, don't think too bad of yourself otherwise the confidence will be broken, now a new found.  Due to whom did you have confidence? Did you come because of all these politicians? But now your heart demands more. Now you will not be fooled so quickly. Now we want everything and we want it quickly and we will not be satisfied. What did you do in 2 15, what good did you do in 14 in 2011.  What did you do in 1990, who did what, it doesn't matter, that's the past, what are you doing today and what are your future plans, the question is why are you crazy?  What is happening, love your wife, I am telling the men, I am telling the women, you are crazy about the politicians, somewhere there are women also, got an LPG cylinder, somewhere got some ration, five kg brother, father 5 Got 1 kg ration. You are very happy. You are happy to take alms. Tell me, give me jobs. You will not have to beg for ration. Tell me how much does 5 kg ration cost. To cook it, it takes a thousand rat cylinders.  It comes as if you are giving ration, it is better to give free cylinders to everyone, we will buy ration ourselves. Why don't you say these logical things and why don't you say that we are not satisfied with this? This is not something. Law and Order has done very well in UP.  Then what is the great thing, if you have done law and order then it should have happened 50 years ago, it should have been okay 30 years ago, if you have done it now then it is a big deal, then the big thing is over, now law and order is good, you are in this country.  In  No one is looting on the road, it's okay, you are not being beaten, your life is a little safe, so it is a very good country, that means basically India is not Syria or India means any other country, where fights keep happening, it is not like Ukraine.  Or the situation is not like that of Hamas, either your work is very great brother, you are able to make this video and what else is required or how do you say this dictatorship, if you were a dictatorship then what video could you have made, hey brother.  2024 is going on, even if I feel hesitant in talking openly, then for me the definition of dictatorship is the same. Why are you taking the definition of dictatorship to the time of Hitler, 100 years ago? Why is the definition of dictatorship 500 years old? Because brother.  Democracy has come to such an extent that not getting even a little freedom in anything is a dictatorship and this is the waste of an individual. So, if he is not progressing, then his values ​​are bad. I am telling the same thing about the meaning of values, not from the bondages of the family and the work is to break the wrong belief system and here the questioning of the politician through the political channel is someone's place.  I will not perform the Aarti. Half of the work has been done by some politician, sometimes there will be a little clapping from the mouth, but it is anyone's choice whether it is a politician or a person in power, he will be told and questioned.  And small things will be done, everything will be said that brother, question whether meditation could not be done in 7 Lok Kalyan Marg, is this meditation by going inside the camera and showing the world what I am doing by showing 16 cameras, why not?  You can't ask questions, no, if meditation is being done for the country, then show it to everyone live, what is it like in a cricket match, how long will this gimmick continue, how long will this gimmick, why why ca n't a call out be made or it will be too much? Nautanki bhai, why questions were not asked, then you did not respect me, how did you speak against Bauz, oh love is going on, Amitabh Bachchan is here and no one will come and speak like this, why will he not speak, why will questions not be asked, people feel this way from inside.  It is believed that by making someone a class monitor, we will control everyone, this does not happen in a vibrant democracy. When people come, questions will definitely be asked. Today I hope.  I have been successful in clearing a lot of ideology, the agenda will not be fulfilled, the agenda will always be told, not always, you want views, you only want views, what else do you want and only 0 views come from youtube, if you cook food, then you want only this, whether someone eats it or just food. I have to make it, I have to make bread, no, we know you, everyone makes it for views, I am making it as a professional creator, the rest of the people are taking their selfies, someone is giving a lake from Italy.  Someone is giving from here, they are also doing it for views, the problem is that these politicians are also doing it for views, like us, we are just saying that brother, when did we say that we want your vote, when did we say that we want your vote?  They say that we will go and clean, do waste management and do other good works. We have never done any work but these people have entered into the program with the help of views and have brought these votes for some other purpose, so it is the work of people like us.  To inform and check their work and we want to become the voice of the public. You write in the comment section what should be done ultimately, I will also make a separate video as to what all of you should do. If you want that then write in the comment section and ask questions.  Will go and will be asked logically and do not think in your mind that I like pav bhaji very much, then someone said that no, there is a lot of flour in the pav bhaji and its preparation is not proper and like this.  C Hey, why did you spoil my mood? Do n't think like this. B. Curious, maybe he is saying the right thing, so if the pav is made of flour, it is better if it is made of refined flour. No, no, the friend is saying that take it like this, there is no fat in it.  When someone says something, listen to it just because the taste in your mouth will not get spoiled every time. You have to be alive to the possibilities, other possibilities and be curious which  It was 2014, it was not 19, 19 is not 24 and in 24, there will be more change in 29. Be alive to the change that yes, there can be change and that change will definitely happen, whether you like it or not, it is the undercurrent of your lower class.  The way my audience is the middle class is not that impressionable and that stupid. This is the one thing I will say to you that you will go down in history whenever there is any kind of trouble on the country.  There has been an actual crisis, neither have the less educated people, nor the villagers, nor the rural people, but those whom we consider as such have contributed more and not in any society in our country, it is the educated society which is the educated people and who are like this.  They are middle class, they are turning away while ruling, they have not understood which direction to take, you see the freedom movement, Rai Bahadur, who used to pretend to be brave, what did the people in the middle do and who actually Used to be so angry, these farmers, soldiers and those who are lower class, just because you have become middle class, don't think that we will decide. Firstly, the middle class is already getting disillusioned that we are not very Robinhood or Livelihood. They are the ones who give, the poor do not need anything, from the middle class to today, the middle class cannot survive without these people, they can easily survive among themselves.  I will give a lot of service, today there is a female goat, it is Eid, so the maid has not come, what about many people, what is the condition at home, please tell me when this video is being made, today the goat is here and happy goat.  To fellow Indians, if it is okay then it is the truth of life that if the maid does not come or the husband falls ill for two days then it is fine but if the maid falls ill for two days then it is a problem then understand where the society is going, the husband will remain ill for two-three days.  He will be fine anyway, he doesn't do anything in the morning, we are asking for tea, he is a little sick, so the maid should not be sick, if the feeling for the maid is more awake, then all these things are what I bring in the form of a little sit down comedy. I am bringing real issues, real issues are facts, facts are facts, things should not be talked about so much, things should be done down to earth which affects us, only then the channel is being liked, many people are liking it, it is practical. things are happening  There are other channels also, you can subscribe, so a lot of content is coming on Real At and is coming. Real estate is reaching a different point, now detailed videos will be made on that too. How did you like it? Tell me, like, share. Subscribe to the channel now. Do it if you are watching it for the first time and this video is now my iconic 100th video because now whenever I have any further video, I will say go and watch my ideology video. If you have seen then that is my video. Any politician can do anything wrong here, hey, he had done wrong, he had imposed emergency in 1977, then what to do, if emergency had come, what had happened to him in 75, what to do now, what about Indira Gandhi ji?  I will not punish his son's son's son. Okay, I will punish him alone. Don't vote for him. If you still want to remain in the 70s then don't vote for him. I am I am I campaigning here because this time-  Times  I will have to clarify, what campaign am I doing for Congress? If I ever say something good for Modi ji, then you are an agent of BJP. Brother, can there be any person who is neither an agent of BJP nor of Congress?  He is an agent of Aam Aadmi Party but I also tell him my story. I don't like Aam Aadmi Party much. Still, I give relevance to Congress and BJP. Yes, these are two thought processes, but Aam Aadmi Party's Bhai program is for me personally.  Idea ji revealed today  I have told you what to do but the fact is that just because I don't like it, I should give you such a rod, it is not necessary that you like it, every friend is important, which Arvind Kejriwal ji has said that he will remove Yogi ji as soon as he comes out of jail. If slogan was raised then 10, 12, 14 seats would have been eaten, if the incident of Kejriwal ji and Maliwal ji had not happened then Bhaiya Khani could have gone ahead also, so every friend is necessary for anyone, as they say, vegetable is made.  Food is prepared, everyone agrees, all spices are necessary, all yes, some salt in it becomes very important and sugar also becomes necessary if some other dish is being prepared, but still many things are important, so we all have to understand things in every way.  I have to do 360 degrees, I call him a multi-discipline approach, whom I can say that I have never met but from whom I have learned things, Charlie Mangar ji, bring multi-discipline approach in life, then you will never be in one place.  Don't worry that I will not be a one trick pony, one thing, you cannot accuse me of any other agenda of mine and on top of that I am not a one trick pony, that I know only one thing and know only one thing and that's it.  According to one thing, I can give you light from different places, I gave it from here also, I gave it from here also, so please subscribe the channel, thank you very much."

    "title": "14 Anchors Banned By Opposition [gCl1blapA5A].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today we will discuss what has been done to the anchors of some media by the opposition's block, so is it a good thing or a bad thing, a lot of discussion is already taking place on this, so I will give my take.  I have come up with this, you can tell it as per your own, see, call it good, big, think, think, this date, the ruling party also does very smart things and in politics, whatever things are being done by these players, we can see them in front of the audience.  Have to appreciate like two people are playing or two people are playing badminton or tennis, that good shot, good shot, here people have become personalized, defending on which kiss they have dripped, if this opposition then it is very good, it is like this that they enjoy it.  Now if these are the people then they will say like this, these people had also made a decision on their time that they will do this, they will not do this, if GST is taken then they will practice, these are the anchors of the news, these are the actors from the story from the news.  This has nothing to do with news, there is no news on INLD, DBT is happening and they have become so lethargic because they are getting more TRP in this, which means they will take the debate to this level, all the news coverage is only in Delhi.  What is happening to you, no one knows what is happening in Orissa, okay what is happening in the North East, no one knows what is happening inside Madhya Pradesh, people do not know, that is, in Madhya Pradesh these ₹ 1000 sarees  Ladies have started getting it, it is very good brother, we had to wait till the elections, they could have given it earlier also, it is given even better in other states, it is given in Haryana, so that it is known, still the color is in sub status everywhere.  And this brother in law, you are not criticizing me selectively, these are the people who were speaking to me, so this party is not in this party, I am not from any party, I am a commentator, the fairies are pampering and clapping, someone has the power to us.  Do n't know what is happening in Madhya Pradesh, there are elections going on, there is no news there right now, these people have a studio in Noida, they go around wearing such nice suits as ghosts and do anything like this.  That's why they take people's money. People are losing trust in the news channel. Just because these people are not giving interviews to anyone, now that and the trend there will go, there is no one to speak to KP, now these people too.  it's okay to say something to someone  There is no one from his team, one half was there, it was suggested, he got acquired just like that, you know, so he had nothing, otherwise he said, brother, we are not coming at all, okay, this is a very smart move with the bill note.  It's like this move, in the ruling party, direct connect was made 10 years ago, I think YouTube channel from them is the only option, no you come, I open fear on YouTube channel which is also open.  By the way, these people have also opened up, but people are continuing to communicate and that is what I did a few days ago, you know, you all must have seen that I had made a video, a variant, in which I had said that the government, whether it is state or centre, means should.  Note B Spending money on advertisement, which one you all cross check and Google, six together six 6:30 thousand crores, in the last eight years, the Central Government has given this answer in the Parliament, this is money on advertisement.  This is just a figure of what is spent by us, what is done directly, what is given to PSU through that and through that through that and indirectly and that is given, the figure of that is not even known yet, it is very big, friend, it has to be done so many thousands of crores of times. So many thousand crores, I do n't know how much it means, 15-20 thousand crores will be spent on these things in the last 7-8 years, what we did for you, we did it for you with your money and I am telling you with your money only. So what have we done for you, that is, comedy is very big, now what have these people done, now this is their state government too, now they are saying that son, we will not give you money, in a way this method is on the stomach. Now they will be kicked, okay, at least this noise will subside, which had become so much, because they say that earlier they used to say that by selling sex, they are most seen in Hatred is selling and More by Godrej selling in.  More because the program of most of the people got spoiled, so most of the people will be more or less because of the hate-weight because the bike is out because it is the state government, if you count them all then it is a lot, this one is from that time. If you count their state government, then there are a lot of them. Now if they don't do anything then they will not get the money. Now if the money will not reach them, then now they have also got it. Now why should we be insulted and give you money too? This is like advertising.  So  Many infact many debates will not work, so I used to feel that even if you give money, people don't allow you to speak without taking so much humiliation because they used to take the meaning like this and I feel that even after taking the money, the man would be so humiliated. How to tolerate, next we are doing Chilli Chilli Chillam Chilli, it does not let us speak and there will be many people in our audience who enjoy Rahat Masala, it is better and better, yes now it has come, yes now it is good and debate everyone.  Keep selecting your channel, there is no story or story in it, it is he who is doing the narcissistic tendencies, everyone has caught their own that yes this is the one, ours will be like this in this one, the truth will be like this in this one, there is no news of the people.  Everywhere because it takes a lot of life to give news, you will have to go to a small town, you will have to send a journalist there, you will have to spend your money to bring news there, you will have to work hard to get news there, you will have to employ yourself or open a news studio, that means you can do this. Tell me, what is the difference between them and mine? Hello friends, we talk more sensibly, what do some YouTubers talk about? Apart from Chillam Chilli, there is one behind me too, let's say something from the screen and see, very big news is coming.  Every 5 minutes a big news is coming, 24 hours this news is being spread like this and now look at this and now Modi ji has joined hands with Vidhan, oh only hands will meet, what else will we meet each other and what will we do, meaning leaders will meet.  if there are hands  To meet means that the media has become like a cricket country, that is, they have been hit with a six and that friend, this means that this country is happening, that is, this is the level of news, it means that some news of ours has made a house for a big bus.  The news is that INLD is fine, they catch the big bus every 24 hours, they are visible to whoever belongs to them, now they have come, they have taken them out of the car, it is raining flowers, what is the song behind, what is the feeling, what is being sung, all the feelings.  hey talk about less  Come on, friend, you are a news channel, you also have shareholders, they are watching, no, what is the problem with you in doing this, you are not his or hers, I am not of anyone, I am the one who is talking about the issue, it is about the flag, their words are also there.  At least someone should talk about the flag, whoever can talk about it, will change the education policy, will discuss about changing the education, what is happening or will it be only on these things that someone has come, that means he is not, ladies.  As Housewives do it, they cook it at their home, today it is like Mata's Chowki, tomorrow we have such a fast, the day after tomorrow we have to have our photographs taken there, as if they do not happen in a wedding, what is the function of a wedding, so all that becomes a function only.  It's not just a fox on marriage, whether the boy will kill the girl or not, it is a function that yes, now ladies sangeet is happening, before that they are taking saree photos, it is becoming like this normal public life is.  Becoming like this, now they are going here, now they are going there, reached there, here the father is being cut, there is being cut, this is what is happening, this is this note news, this can be done in a small way that here was this function like this That but what was coming out of it How much of it is like plastic I mean like gum you make it like a rubber band How much you make it big How important is something which needs you to be covered Economics is one of them very Important issues are the intelligentsia of the country and if it is not there then there is no need to forcefully fill 24 hours. Do less content, do less that, do everything, debate starts at 5:00, watch the story on news channel at 12:00.  It is going on till now and as soon as I open the news channel, I come to know that the name of that channel is also 'Bol Ke Scheme', meaning the channel itself, I know whose it is and now this is the space of YouTube of Chakkar. I am occupied by the people and on speaking negativity, the ruling party is also wrong that the ruling party means that there is no expenditure there, so the news channel which I mostly watched on my YouTube, when I was making this channel my own, where is the content. No one is giving an independent opinion, remove this handcuff of two fingers, there is no news channel or YouTube which is giving an independent opinion that yes brother, this thing.  So it is right that anyone has done the right thing and brother, this thing is bad, okay no one is telling this thing, so what they are doing, we will not call it good, it has been done well, it is a smart move, a smart move, these people have also done a lot.  Earlier, all these sixes and fours were being hit from here, okay, now no one was thinking about this batsman, this is like Sri Lanka, keep it like 54 0, okay, if you see the numbers, then now there is a little bit of it in the match.  like this  It is said that it will be fun, we have to enjoy further, the audience, we do not have to be too sentimental, this is someone, this country is decreasing, I hope you will understand this thing, share and thank you."

    "title": "70 Hours Work Week ｜ How Not To Lose The Mental Battle ？ [CEyAKRk92eg].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, it will be a very deep topic, now I have decided to have really deep a videos, they will definitely be a little long, otherwise it will be longer, so they will not come every day, but it will be a matter of deep thought, so today's topic is 70 hours week, this is in English. How not to lose the mental battle of Narayan Murthy ji, that 70 hours is enough, yes yes, everyone should not know, no, I belong to Illuminati. Narayan  Murti Jaala became very popular, got very good views, got very good comments, of course, this channel is small, so normally I would have put it on that channel, but here I have already made a disclaimer because of the effect of third order thinking.  The fact of the effect and why this is happening, that is why I do not want more views to come because many people do not have the patience to understand what is happening, then please stay connected, it will definitely be beneficial, you will get a lot of clarity in life and peace.  What is going on, 70 hours, everyone doesn't know, but Narayan Murthy ji has dropped the anchor, 70 hours means 50, 55 hours, forgive the blood with the one who makes you work, as if it is 70 hours.  Suddenly 50 55 starts talking, it starts to seem less, doesn't the anchor want to drop like me? Through this video, the talk should have been for 30 hours, 30 hours for the country, in which there are no jobs, people are crying hi.  So much of this class is sitting without work and it is dying, so brother, something else could have been done. Wherever people have made it a matter of productivity in foreign countries, I am number one in clarity.  Giver, today I will give you clarity that it is not right to even ask about productivity, no no, numbers of ears are not important, what you do in these two ears, listen, today even this does not happen and I will tell you what is required and in this we are facing slavery of the British.  The thing that is in our DNA is playing the workout. Listen carefully to see if there is a problem. The problem is that those at the top are in the management or at the manager level, there is an employee below.  There is one from above, those above want to do micro management, they want a person full time and they want to get the work done by standing on their head and want to treat you at the laborer level, if you are a late laborer and I am your contractor supervisor.  I am and you are going after taking 10 seats, understand it carefully, it is a deep video, even if it is long, what will happen, you will get complete clarity, you will get it under the examples and you will know why this is an Indian phenomenon only, in other countries too.  It is less and why is it there in ours here because these who are slaves are the ones with this kind of mentality and laxity. I will tell you all the things. So here, if you assume that I am your contractor and you are carrying bricks and your name is Rohit, Rohit is.  A fancy name for a laborer but lets say the same thing comes out of my mouth. Okay, so is our captain. Okay, but as an example, you are carrying a brick and I will tell you, Rohit, if you put this brick down and pick up the sack of cement. Rohit will keep it like this and will pick up the sack of cement. There is no loss of a second in continuity. There is no great loss in productivity. The great contractor knows where to go and what to go. So he picked up the brick and put it down and from there he picked up the cement.  Same thing is happening in that sexy work place. Wearing a tight tie, wearing fragrance. Are you doing any work? Is it your routine work or has a presentation been given before? Have you collected any data?  It has been given to do, it has been given for analysis, it has been asked to make some TT, you are dead for communication, you are working, suddenly someone will say, do this, this is urgent, this is happening in government too, in private, in corporate, in everyone.  What is happening now is that the guy cannot switch on and off like this, he was doing this just now, now he is doing that and suddenly whatever is useful, it is not that easy as pick up that cement. Sack It requires some creativity It requires something Thought Process It requires something And it has a deadline Did something and when its work was done What work happened to it What work happened to it In India at 9:00 AM 10:00 AM Whatever working  There are hours, coming beyond that is considered as a discipline, brother, you have to come, it takes time to warm up because Half the offices are set to Europe's time or Middle East's time or even America's time because when will their warm up happen, who are you catering to them, who are you catering to in the front, who are you catering to in the back, this is also a big problem.  You may be relaxed between 9 to 12 o'clock, work is coming to you at 1 o'clock, you are not coming before that and you cannot say anything because the office is starting and then your dedication is checked.  Between 6 to 9 o'clock in the evening and at 9:00 in the morning, you have to be disciplined also. People say, I want an employee who is disciplined and dedicated. D&amp;D is disciplined and dedicated. However, they do not say that there is another D also.  Work like a donkey, that is also a requirement, discipline means 910 pm, what do they say? Punch in, log in, biometric. Threatening so and so and then brother you start showing dedication at 6:00. This is the biggest problem. What is the second problem? Seeing the employees like shellac. By using someone's word, I am not making anyone classist here, but it is like a peon, isn't shellac?  If it happens, it has an owner. The owner is the employer. What is his job? He has to give water to the boss when he feels thirsty.  Sir, if he rings the bell, he has to be given water, so he has to be available. Secondly, Sir, can he drink tea also? Is he drinking water, tea, sir, every second or not six times an hour? No, he can drink it anytime when he needs it, when there is a guest, sir.  If he comes, will he bring coffee, is it okay or sometimes sir needs to get photo status done, needs to get some work done or has to give something, files, needs to be given some kind of work, then he has the availability to do the work as long as sir will work now.  All the jobs are bosseno and India is this because it is lethargy and lot of dream and entitlement. The same thing dozen happens in other countries. There is respect there brother, accept from me that work is not getting done, I am having fun on the phone, I am the manager, I am the boss.  I am useless or I don't know if I have to pass the time or I have a bad relationship with my wife and that manager doesn't want to go home otherwise he would have to bring vegetables P. Now in his mind he has thought that I am  If he has to work till 8:00, then he is doing it at his own pace and he wants to decide his pace with the people below him, this is what is happening in reality, this is how I am making the video, without anyone taking it.  Coming, I have seen that Chetan Bhagat ji is a big columnist, whatever he is saying is right, it should not be and should be, he is an educated intellectual, there are many people who have left him a little or not, no, no, he is not productive, he is not increasing in our country.  Productivity, Laat Saheb, is not ours to make. The people from above have kept us slaves like they used to do. When Laat Saheb was sleeping inside, he was fanning it outside. When we were slaves, by doing this, if his right hand got broken, he would use the left.  And if he stopped, he would be whipped and then when his shift ended, something was needed for the next shift person, he needed full time work, we needed availability, that meeting would happen for that lot sir.  At 4:00, now he felt like eating at 4:00, when he ate at 4:00, your life is going on accordingly, he remembered his work, he will create it, brother, every time panic is created, if at 5 o'clock  If the work has to be completed then take 1015 days in a year or go till 6 o'clock if it is an emergency, there is too much work or something like this has happened or there is no system of giving compensatory off in it, this is a discipline.  This is dedication and we need discipline and dedicated employees. Discipline doesn't work for us and dedication doesn't work either because dedication means work, then you say, work will be done today or in the afternoon, come at 12:00 and rest.  Wake up, eat breakfast, then work till 10:00 in the morning. It's a good office situation, the one at the top needs discipline, the one at the bottom needs discipline.  Dedication is needed, there are buses below and everyone has spread raita. Government too are crying and private too are crying. India is such a country that you will laugh also on the dialogue but you have to tell whether the dialogue is right or not, those who did not get jobs should cry. And those who are in love are also crying. Hey, one party, stop crying. If life is spent in work and work itself is so dirty, then these people should be happy, we don't have any work.  Is it an athlete that we don't have to die, let's do something or see those who have got it, so many crores of people have not got jobs in India, at least I have got a job, what is the problem, you can do that too.  I will tell people in a very good way. So far, I have enjoyed the video. Those who have learned it, please write MG so that I can know in my studies that brother was listening to so much for so many minutes. I am going to make this code word.  Age A  My creator gets feedback, otherwise there is no other way, otherwise there is no other way, how much audience is there who is enjoying, I am trying to liberate you people, now listen carefully, you who are my audience.  There is nothing bad about them but I will blame you that actually you are being exploited because you feel comfortable in your job and that is what Illuminati and them know.  Especially the middle class, they need comfort and security. In the name of this comfort and security, I will exploit you in a job. In another way, brothers and sisters, another solution can be that you start working on hourly basis and get paid on hourly basis.  Well, now accountability will come to the people who provide work in their life, how much they are doing, then 70 hours of work is not sold, it is 40 hours of work. You people want to suck 70 hours by giving a salary, this is a problem for you people, if you are like that then instead of crying, come to your gig economy and start working, start doing project based work, start doing early based but you cannot do it because then  Now what is the tied tanka? 50000 60000 1 lakh 5 lakh 2 lakh comes into the account at the end of the month or on the first date.  SMS comes that so and so is credited, so and so, for doing one's own work, you will have to ask for money, the next person will bargain, then you will have to pay on hourly basis, you will not get money for tea and water, you will not get money for waiting for the presentation, there is no presentation.  And you are sitting and watching like this, you will not get money in it, you will not get many things and you also know why you are interested in people because look, the people who know that they are not worth anything have got the job with difficulty. We have to pass the time by sycophancy, they don't even cry, they are saying that anyway my time was not valued much, in my family someone in my family was pushed out and I used to work longer hours.  When I go home, my mother gives me food, my father does not complain, I am a youngster, my clothes are washed, I get food, I am getting less salary, it does n't matter, you are also sucking me, so there is something in my life anyway. not be  One was, this is not very sad and these are also increasing in large quantity. One is the person who considers himself a great person, why are you wasting my time, my time and why have I been kept, I have done my work.  You have done well, I am very good, this chatu khor is having fun, she is frustrated, when staying in the office for an extra hour starts giving you pain, then instead of crying for her, you should release her in your life, this is what has to happen here. This only  It's an ecosystem, you can't do anything, just think how can I get freedom now because if you buy a car in it, buy a car, visit a foreign country, then you ca n't be free from slavery and you will have to make sacrifices there and everything is happening to you there.  The man thinks that he will live his life by doing these four things and he is getting trapped in life and he is very good even in sycophancy.  It can become a subject because many people are troubled by Chatu Khor, if you want that then type C for sycophancy which is called sycophant which is very Hindi Sanskritization because no one understood psycho feint and then if you did not understand even Chatu then it would be said.  Putting butter on it is very good, my videos are not here to increase hopelessness, my videos are realistic, I am a realist making realistic practical videos and trite Libre my audience and people, I am able to influence that brother, here the program is like this, if we talk about 70 hours, then 50 hours are normalized, 48 hours is labor law, no hours should be counted, what are the hours, simple rules of work.  It's like the time between when you put on your clothes to go to the work place and when you take off your clothes after coming back from the work place, it is called work. This is definite. Now count yourself.  How much work are you doing and then do another count of how much salary you get, divide the amount of salary you get by this work, then that is your P/R rate and please write in the comment section, I also have an idea.  You will know what is the PRR rate and then you understand and compare whether you are below a plumber or above a carpenter or below this or below and what else can you do, first calculate your PRR rate, do n't be shy now.  You people will say, how can this happen if I went wearing clothes and on Friday there was an office party after work and then we went there and we thought, hey, that's work too brother, that's work at home, clothes for work place.  Putting on and taking off is the job because it is a job done for the sake of work. Now you have been sent somewhere in it, you are late, how did you get stuck in the jam, the time of your life is being taken away from that job, when you will release it.  Only then will you know the work How much are you doing? May be they have told you 40 hours of work, 60 hours 65 so you are already sitting on it and here talking about 70 has scared you like 70 70 so now 50 will feel good, this is this.  See, he did it, achieved brother, by talking about 70, he did not get the normalization done for 50. Ilm Nath, tell me this, it should have been talked about with some emphasis on 30.  I feel like it because I feel a little anxious that the person who sees me so clearly, sees how and secondly, by building up this narrative, they are putting it on the youth and people and on them only, that Munna could not be done by you. You are not able to do it, you are the only one lacking, you have to do the work to make the nation, you have to do it for Maha Bharti. Whenever high moral ground comes in life, whoever makes it, remember that your Yo is making you, work for the nation, work for.  this  Work for that, whenever these things are spoken and many people will come, then what work should not be done? Whenever these big things happen for the country, then they are sucking you in. It is okay to remember all these and these, now these  People in that shake tank, Aman Gupta and these two or four ladies and Vineeta and one Addi and someone else, they took photos like this, still working 70 hours plus every a week, took photos like this, nice clothes, nice coffee, nice  AC, good makeup, sexy environment, beauty, fragrance, food and drink, if this is work, then we all Indians will work 100 hours if you are working in that environment, see the weather of India, see the dust, see the heat, brother, here it is divided like that.  By the way, life gets lost in the same way. Compare everything with the foreign country. Even the foreign country is doing only 30 hours as much as you.  Denmark, Finland, these are all the countries where the happiness index is so high that we do not even talk about happiness. Why is happiness not made an election issue in our country? How many months, how many hours should you work, where you get paid, this is an election issue.  Why should n't it be made? Elections are coming now, why aren't you making it, why won't you forward this video that friend, Narayan Murthy has divided everything based on what he said, he has made the benchmark 70, so you will say brother.  Sir, it's okay, don't do it, don't do 50, so it's okay, hey, I am saying, go to 30 and after 30, do the remaining 30 of your personal work. Sir, why can't government jobs be in two shifts of Group C and Group D, with half salary? What kind of talent do you need to feed water to a shell? Brother, your salary is Rs 30,35,000,400,000. So he said, do it like this and come from Monday to Wednesday.  I am saying that the government should change Monday to Saturday and increase the week day by one day and from Monday to Wednesday by one day and from Thursday to Saturday tell a group officer, brother, it is okay, we will not divide you by two, you are a big officer but only on 3.  They say to the rest of the group, if you divide it by two, then the jobs will be double. What great work can you do? No, no, no, you will have to come every day because I explained something to him on Monday.  Nonsense, half the time, no, there will be conflict of interest, if it does some more work, then now we are not doing conflict of interest, these programs are happening everywhere, whoever has to do whatever, tell him, brother, it is like this, the government will give salary as much as it is worth, six times a week.  Divide by two, if there was work for five days then there will be six days of work. You increased the productivity of the country by six days. You increased the productivity of the country by 16. Because the work increased by one day but the individual has to work only for three days. He is free for four days to work wherever he wants, brother, from Monday to Wednesday, you come and from Thursday to Sunday, where are we, we have nothing to do, what does he do, we have nothing to do, brother, you work from Sunday to Wednesday, no one cares for us.  Do n't take it, it is not possible, you have to think out of the box, there are 144 crore people in this country who are working, their lives are being lost and those who are not working are losing their lives because of that. Both of them are losing their lives, so no solution can be made. You tell me, the one who buys tickets, sitting at the railway station and doing like this, what continuity and productivity is there in him? Say brother, you will spend three days from Monday to Wednesday, this is yours.  Whatever is left to be done, don't do it. I don't want to do it from Monday to Friday. Why do I have to do it like this? Those who like it, do n't do it ahead, implement it from 1st July 2024.  Election results will come in May, new government will be formed, now do all the recruitments, the old ones, don't jump, they are not taking yours, brother, you will retire, one day you will definitely retire, we have collected so much till date, government.  The road which the government runs smoothly will move at a slightly faster speed because the enthusiasm will be there, if you have to work only for three days, then the enthusiastic man will do the work and will say.  Come on friend, I got half a tanka's truth, this is the truth below, what is happening today, I am telling you, I am a down to earth leader, there is no fanfare at all, today there are many state governments and many states which are in Group D.  The employees are Group C, they are being hired on contractual basis, there is no monitoring of their quality, nor are they called government servants. When this proposal of mine is going to be from Monday to Sunday, it is in it.  And that person will have the stamp of a government employee and he has accountability and the government does not even have money, he will have to pay less than what the government is giving now and he will also be trained. Nowadays, there is some agency where he is caught for typing.  He doesn't know, he is learning on the job, neither his qualification nor the test. Hey brother, there will still be all the tests. These are the two jobs that I am asking you to do. All these exams are going on as they are now. The quality will be monitored now. In the contractual situation, if anyone comes and takes it, then someone's idea was also right that why should we pay so much salary for C and D, the idea was right for us to take it from outside but there is no guarantee for it and C and D.  Where D's posting is, where they work, there are no postings for them, they will remain the same, this is a divide by two tank, adopt it and it will do a good job, I am telling you the ID, one, they say, earlier one used to come, Ad or Abhishek Bachchan.  What an idea sir ji, at that time 5G, 4G etc. had not come. The ideas he gave at that time were all implemented later. I did not understand whether he should have got the award or he was so visionary.  I am telling you what an idea Sir ji, this idea can also be there, there will be so many jobs, Marathas have also got up due to reservation, their Jats used to get up here, now they too may get up there. Marathas got up, Patels got up, you keep playing all the reservation cards, hey, you double your job, there will be peace somewhere, there is peace somewhere, there is relaxation in jobs, anyway, by doing this agitation, I do n't feel like making any money.  I will get it after doing agitation, it's okay, anyway, if you don't feel like it, then this job is the same one and this one is more at 97, but there are C and D ones and BB CD B also at 7 8.  The remaining 85 jobs are of C and D, increase them by leaps and bounds, what is the problem from July 1, 2024, give half more work, I said, instead of Monday to Friday, the productivity of three jobs will also increase.  Something has increased, what is the problem and whoever takes issue with it will cry, he basically wants to harass the public and wants to earn money in other ways when you  If you increase people like this, then who will be the setting? The setting is done with the Tuesday person, the Friday person has to do the work, then how will it happen and change that too, sometimes change it from Thursday to Saturday, sometimes from Monday, that too according to the month.  It may change that this month, if you do random selection of this and that, no one else will know, there will be no wrong in that and that because you have increased the players, as soon as you add more players, then what happens in corruption. Like, when the number of players is removed, then the pumpkin gets cut in the utan, you also know that you must have seen the Mala Wall Weekly, the one about the lottery ticket and Ompuri and that story is very good that first two people know about it and then three people come to know about it.  If there is, then it will be divided among three, then among four, then if the entire village comes to know, then tell the entire village that if you commit corruption, then these are original ideas, they should not be rejected so quickly.  We should discuss and this work which I told that we should not lose this battle is not to be done. If you want to become a Vishwa Guru then you cannot do it by making yourself like this. You are at 126 in the happiness index and need 70 more hours of work.  Do it then again, that means those who are up to 136, we are making Pakistan above us, this is this index itself, this is a lie, this is a lie, whatever does n't suit you, make a lie, if the same agency has a say in anything.  If there is improvement, then do the clapping which suits you. What does this mean? If the child's report card is obtained from somewhere, then if the number is good, then this one, Papa, this one is fine, and this one, Papa, teacher, teacher does not like me. I mean, this could you in childhood.  Get away by this logic brother, those are the parameters, do some improvement, the parameters of happiness are seen on many things, Rudu Mal and Tad Desh, we are there, let's accept, if we accept then only. Go towards happiness, come happily, I am doing Happiness Two course. Please join within the end of November. Happiness Two is a very iconic course. Last year, Happiness One was there, it comes at the end of the year in winter. It is a course of ₹ 500. You can do h2a.  h2 There will be five iconic classes, you will also get a two-hour recording, you will be happy in your personal life, I am very against the personal name of the individual, in the name of the government.  Crying in the name of inflation Crying in the name of the world Crying in the name of the world Mine has been looted Mine has been looted Why is this middle class being looted brother Why are you being looted Why are you being looted Must be there something lacking in you brother If there is a man  If someone loots somewhere, he does something as his own, after that he has the program that I will not loot, every man is going away robbing you, every man is going away fooling you, then if every man is going away fooling you, then it is  it  Is it possible that you are an idiot? First of all, you have to introspect, why do you assume that no, I am intelligent and not an idiot, he has fooled me, he has become a politician, he has fooled me, business people have fooled me.  Gone are the influences, these media people have become fools, they have become people, they have become money people, they have become mutual fund people, they have become real estate people, all this has become mine.  If you are ready to rob, yes then you are ready to rob, then why do you have to remain like honey, why can't you become an ant or a fly, then that is the way of thinking, not just what is happening, either cry that this is me.  Will you do this to me and your whole life will be lost or if you learn only a few things, I will teach you things in a very practical way in the happiness course, I will not make you do any such meditation, okay, I will not take you much towards spirituality, I will see you in practical. Perspective is like glasses, I will change yours and things will start appearing more clearly, so please h2 me."

    "title": "A Common Problem With Indian Political Parties [fdkGcRHF8G8].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, now we will discuss the problem in Indian political party which needs to be addressed. You guys tell me whether this is a problem or not. Democracy is running very well in India. It is called Mother of Democracy. It is a democratic country. There is some topic of discussion on this. No, but the topic of discussion is what democracy is there within the political parties themselves. You are thinking that you can choose any political party or choose any other.  He is a server of the party, he is just one or two people, why is there only one in every party, there is no democracy in political parties, their elections are not conducted properly, do you know how one man or two men are made party presidents?  The maxim goes on and it is becoming a presidential style thing for us now that I look at the man, if he likes it then it is okay, this and his election is some team choice, the rest of the faces are nothing, if you are complete, if  If you look at the democracy in the world, there are 12 democracies that came before us and the democracies there, if you take the example of both of them, how much fight they have to do in their party, how many people in the party they have to compete with, whether they have their own party and the Democrat Party on their face.  The primaries of those who become presidential candidates and they continue for a year or so and the debate and their thought process and how much competition there is and you can see in the UK also. Before Sonakshi became Prime Minister, he had fought in the competition, but he did not win, then he became the Prime Minister, then he stepped down and came, he again got selected in a way, so this democracy has to be strengthened and people's choice has to be read.  In this possible date party, people are now being divided into party leaders and leader parties. Those who have status, they run like their own private limited, not public limited, it is public limited, this is big.  The party which is an old party is a big party, it is public limited, the rest which is of status is a private limited, family of D family, D family, that one is running the system, so no one is facing any problem on this, the biggest problem is this. No one is raising this voice. The middle class should raise its voice. It is the conscious one. The middle class of the society takes issue with everything else. So why do n't you do it? Why are you proper in political discourses? Shashi Tharoor ji has shown some passion in the elections and in the party, and you know whatever happened to him, the other party is not showing even that much, nothing is being shown, only those who make amendments.  There is one of his, which is from Delhi, there is only one amendment in it that it was like this for so many days, it will become like this now, it will become like this now brother, why is there so much and note only this, if you see, let's not do elections, it is okay but this much.  Brother, I don't know how to say anything against the leadership, leave alone speaking against my party's leadership, is there anything going wrong or should it be checked, should it be balanced, should it be given a counter view or something? It is just a matter of becoming, we are all one, everything has happened within the circle of one, so whatever we call consumer, we will call it customer, if all these political parties are a business in a way, then we have something.  I don't have a choice, either you all are one, there is the same ideology, there should be some shades in one ideology, there is power, just like there is color, if you pick up blue color, then blue color also has shades, isn't it? Light blue, navy blue, dark blue.  This Blue Dart Blue gives you Asia paint, when you see how many shades there are, then you think that you can't get it completely out, so you know, some are orange, some are red, some are green, some are different, they do n't have any meaning from now on, but that Shades can be seen inside  If I have the power to choose, I have to choose only blue, so why should I choose dark blue? If I have to choose any lighter shade of crops, then why can't I get that choice? Shakti, almost through ideology, I am thick and thin.  The message is going through these to the rest of the people, now what is happening with this, the second generation, after that, suddenly someone special will be born, whatever has been created by someone in the future, the mouth should open and it should be shown, that clarity is not coming and  There is a cricket team like one man, now you cannot run a team on the basis of one star batsman, every time there was a video like Sachin Tendulkar, till these other people came, in the beginning, if you see the period of 90s, there is only one batsman, that's it.  If he gets out if he scores the same century, then thank the team. It should not be like this. You should have mini people. I am equally capable and slightly capable but still very capable enough. You are top.  Most of the people have this feeling of insecurity, I think it is visible in all the leaders across the party and in their chain and if you see now, the elections are going on, in the coming time, it will be for the Legislative Assembly.  If you want details, if you are interested then I will tell you openly what is happening in Rajasthan, what is happening in Madhya Pradesh and the meaning is visible in it. What is visible, if you want to ask.  I will also tell him in details that brother, there is something-something-something about leadership, unless the political party, which was the grand old party, was so insecure about their leadership that they were not allowed to make any setups. The cost of the party will be exactly 50 seats. Thank you, everything is done, even then it is not mine, it is not given to anyone else, now they have started doing course collection but the same.  The thing is that then I remembered your story, Sansa was also a daughter-in-law, she used to do this, she used to do this, she will be here, now the same thing is being seen in other places, now this grand role party is doing this by improving itself.  When I saw the elections in Karnataka, I saw the arrogance of the local leadership there and said, Come on brother, you only see, you only connect because people are connected with the local leadership everywhere and in the coming time, you  look at me a lot  The clear cut seems to be 2024. If you want that, then I will definitely make the prediction, that is, then you will get the information about whose SIM, how much will come, who will win, who will lose, what will be clear about the Indian political system and that will be in 6 to 8 months. I will be right there with you.  I will tell you that brother this is going to happen now and according to me the public will definitely take what is happening off course and it will be such an interesting thing for the first time which has never happened in India till date. What if that thing?  If they want to know, then I will make you in the next video, but right now there is nothing inside the political party, so if anyone wants to come and open his mouth more, do it like this, brother, are you taking anything else too or just this one person, all the rest are fingers. And I don't even know, I will ask you the names of the ministers, brother, who is this minister, give me respect, the minister does not know anything about anyone, who is doing what, is he doing like this, how will he function so quietly, what is the use?  What to do  Tell me, I am not talking about what kind of marketing is happening that we will not do marketing at all, we will not do marketing at all, what talent does anyone have as an individual? The public should know about the latter too. The names of other players should also be known.  Need team's notes, just Sachin Tendulkar, Virat Kohli, only Rohit Sharma, you need you know, what are the other people, brother, which one is this? This wicketkeeper is sitting behind, a wicketkeeper is sitting behind, my name is just S.  Dhoni but what about Adarsh is fine, who is coming, who is going is fine and what is the calculation that there is talent like this, no one is showing anything, nothing is being told, I am feeling dependency, I am feeling that the moral of the politicians is as high as that of the politicians. Politics is so low, the moral of the politicians has not been seen, the irresponsibility of the party has been seen too much, disappointment is visible on the face, those who have learned a little to see the face, know how to understand, disappointment is visible.  There is a look on the face as if we are being waited for something, someone is being waited for this, will that thing happen, how will it happen, what will happen next, we will know if we understand the signals, then it is not a matter of keeping the secret.  I will tell you clearly if you want. Okay, we should never remain in the dilemma of right and wrong because this channel will have a little intellectual thing. If water becomes hot, it goes to sleep at 199 degrees Celsius. After 100, the Father is divided now.  A good thing is not a bad thing, it is just happening, it is a phenomenon, in this way my channel is to discuss this phenomenon, some things for your understanding and for your peace, in order for you to understand that yes friend, this is what happens.  It has been the case that no one talks, now it does not mean that we will go to talk too much, but we should know that so much is happening, so there is this star artist in it, like movies are also divided, I know there is a star.  is his  It is divided around, but the supporting actors also have a role, do n't you go and watch the movie, it is the same in every scene, it is the same in Harsing, so many times you think, please show something else, see how wonderful it is. Supporting actors have supporting roles which are very unappreciated, so if I apply for something, then brother, I don't know anything about anyone, so in doing something that is not called your risk, you take a basket from match in D and then that.  meaning seconds ahead  The third row, the fourth row is not yours, you cannot believe such a special R only, that brother, it belongs to the commander, he is the only one going on the horse, the rest is also important, everything is important and there is no story in the party.  If there is a story in their party that someone has to say something, then they remove it, then when there is no democracy within the party, then why should we setup democracy? Learn from other things. Many times, do we also put some story on ourselves?  So People get angry in our country, how did the problem get resolved, UK likes it, it's okay if you go to UK, then brother, learn from them, they don't have any insecurity, they made him the Prime Minister of UK, see which language and how.  Or whoever does it, learn it, we can learn something from them also, even a little, how much conversation takes place within your party, that is, the MP of the party has value, there is a party there, they have some opinion, there is nothing here, either SIM  We  If you decide whether you will fight or not, whether you will get the ticket or not, it has been done like this and while leaving, I will say that democracy is not there even in people's homes, so in a very democratic country, father rules the house too. Is there a domineering father or In some John families, you are the grandfather, some are the mothers, this is the problem even inside the house of our country that one should listen to the child also, the child has grown up, it is theirs too, they should not take the story.  This is not the story of democracy, it is not even inside the house, all that is true but the individual I am selecting is the one who is not bringing democracy. You are understanding something of this day before yesterday but this day after tomorrow has gone no power in this party only so now  What should I do? I have to go to watch a movie. He is your favorite actor and you like it. His role is smaller than a guest appearance. Then what should I do? So why is this the choice of choice? Nahi kari ja shakti de last party witch me, this Delhi girl herself will be 10 years old, so it is not that she will go to a party every day, small parties will be established, there are many organized within the status, so it is not that what a party.  It will not come very soon. Ideology will come too much. But with this party, debate dialogue is not taking place. Brother, you have not shown India what is happening to the world, but do it privately so that you can have some idea about yours. Some camp was being held, Chinhwari, these camps and camps, nothing is happening, nothing and if you see their committee of fairies in which they are sitting, keep all this, everyone, who was Gadyavar or is there any significance of any party. Whatever top committee they have, take out and see, it is so much like this, the Young Leadership Party is not visible, they are like that outside, they are the girl's brothers, a wedding is taking place outside, the story is that animal there, the story is their story.  no photo  Hey, what do they have to say, what has to be done, which is the future, no grooming, nothing, no hand holding, no accounting, no calculations, okay brother, what is it, just that meaning, in such a country, we should have choice and grooming should be there, according to me, yours. Tell me what is the account and after pressing Madhya Pradesh Elections and Rajasthan Elections in Madhya Pradesh, thousands of rupees are in the account of Ladies, if you people are listening from Madhya Pradesh, tell me if anyone else got the mobile from Rajasthan.  It is okay that the mobile is being distributed, I think the figure of Rs 6200 is what I heard. You tell me what scheme is running for the one who is from Rajasthan. The scheme which is running in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, tell me it is okay, it is heavy.  There are votes and we will get so many, type, the government is giving money, okay, you think, elections are coming now, people promise later that we will come, then brothers and sisters, we will do this, leave those promises, they say.  View sisters, do it now, take the program, okay, so the public is enjoying, say yes, we will take this too, now what are you going to do in the next one, then whom should I take and the one who is middle class and has a little tax foot, he is a little worried.  If it remains, he will definitely feel that it is becoming my envelope, as if it has been shown to someone, is n't it the relief in Haryana? It is visible to the daughter-in-law, it is the pulse caste of the public, those who come to the house after marriage and take a breath.  caste is what we call someone after that  If all my envelopes are gone then the situation of middle class always remains like this. So this channel is not stressful, don't put negative comments on it. It's ok, enjoy it, don't ask anything else, many people can post it, it's ok in these new ones.  I have to investigate the cycle a bit, I have to find out what is happening, the way he takes the envelopes from the daughter-in-law, I speak in a little Haryanvi, just like everyone else's joint brother-in-law, before everyone else's South Indian, there is something there in this. Lot of gas, some type of mouth visible system and D. New girl comes after getting married, okay, new earthquake, if there is one, after veiling her mouth, then some shagun is called in it, okay, shagun, shagun is okay, faith of ₹100, ₹511  If it happens then everyone goes with it in such and such envelopes, so according to middle class, according to me, the one with the date should call her, take the envelope, give what to whom, post, okay, now you have taken it, now where have you taken it, so now Give these to all of you, you give this one to Ba ji, you understand but you should not do this much and how is the operation, how to proceed further, but I will keep making videos in the future, you enjoy, I hope you are enjoying the channel because of me absolutely.  Don't want to know your name, everything should be known and when everything is known about what is happening, then what is there in it, neither read in love for anyone nor hate anyone, nor be a sycophant of anyone, nor be a fan of anyone and no. Show someone too low and say brother, we have a good time, it is okay, we are not giving a very good laptop, this time we were getting a laptop last time, is the country getting so rich now, inflation is going on, so you are managing with mobile, what is this? You should be a laptop, this is India which was earlier and in the big countries and democracies, there is a lot of satar in it, it runs in the form of a poet, I am not that talented as a poet, but understand the satar from this, the government.  Understand that he does it everywhere, he does it even in the house, he also gets it done on his daughter-in-law, and they say, no, this is the big dialogue, this kind of dialogue has to be killed, this is what the middle class has to believe now.  To the politicians because now they will understand this language. What has happened is that the middle class has become a fan by force. There are some politics, they have taken your vote for granted and you and your voice too. So you have to show your displeasure by crying.  You are under compulsion because I am from Agra, I have selected you in the barbaron, I am taking you with this song, I am happy, we have to vote, this is the attitude to have, the middle class has become a fan like this, and this has been done, let me become a hero, that.  Exactly that example which is neither a daughter-in-law nor a daughter-in-law, when they showed that they took away your envelopes, all the states and cities, there is no daughter-in-law, okay, I hope you like my examples.  I also feel a little tired of this, without giving any stress, the thing is to understand, this channel is different, there is no chillam chilli, there is no elegance, there is no devotion for anyone, there is no hatred for anyone, there is no more love for anyone, love is its happiness.  And I love my happiness and peace with my mother's clarity and peace and I am giving this message to you all, think more about yourself and in the further video you will see this thing, thank you."

    "title": "A Never Discussed Reason For Poor Infrastructure Revealed [PeYnKWNFhSk].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, we will talk about infrastructure which has never been discussed because it is also very important. We have seen water dripping in the Parliament. The roof is fine. Water is dripping in the Parliament. A new Parliament has been formed. Brothers and sisters, what is the corruption? Tell me, I would like to tell you one thing.  Due to which you have always seen my videos, they are different, they are a little different, the train, can you see what is happening on the train, then there would be no point in making videos, otherwise this train is here every day.  A derailment happened today, there happened there, today this happened, it means this is a shameful thing and the minister is moving brazenly, that reel minister is moving and no one is asking anything because now he is tired, it means there is no limit, so many issues are happening everyday.  The opposition is not able to understand that the public should raise the issues of citizen journalists like us. What incidents are happening every day in Delhi, we have seen such unfortunate incidents. Three children are from the coaching center, so there is no need to talk about this. But the issue I have brought today is that first of all, the people of the country, the universities and the politicians of BJP say a lot of things to Nehru ji. We all say it is right brother, not all of them say it but many speak like this, Nehru ji said this. Today, through this video, we are clapping for Nehru ji with our hands like Bhakra Nangal Bhai Saheb, otherwise those who are today are like these, they cannot become Bagra Nangal, Bhakra Nangal is standing today and I am speaking sarcastically. I am speaking sarcastically. Clap for the British also. Have we ever seen the scene of buckets being installed in the old Parliament? I am speaking sarcastically. Beyond this, don't tell me that you don't love the country, I love the country.  That's why I am telling you since when has the British Parliament been standing, these people who had left it, had seen the scenes there, what they have shown you, then is this corruption? No, yes, it is not just corruption.  There may or may not be corruption. Listen carefully, brother, there is no talent in India. Civil engineers are not being made and those who are being made, I do n't know, are doing something else. All the good civil engineers are there. Maybe Bhai Saheb takes Adani Reliance and cannot make anything from Adani Reliance because those people will come and say, you see what is the misfortune of the country, now don't judge me now that you are BJP.  Is it Adani of Reliance or Congress, listen carefully, understand the chronology, understand the misfortune of the country, what is jealousy of the rich, crony capital accumulation, all the talent going to good places, where talent goes, talent will come at a cost if it will.  Come at a cost, he is not going to be a bidder, he will get the contract for anything, he will get the contract for the bridge, these are the bridges that have fallen in Bihar, brothers and sisters. They did not fall because of corruption. They did not fall so much because of corruption. No one wants to become so corrupt that the bridge collapses. Talk to any corrupt person. This is a brainless person. The design itself is bad. Corruption has always been there in India. Corruption is a problem and it happens in other countries too, but due to incompetent corruption, things still get saved. Stupid corruption is a disaster because if you make a wrong design, there will be some will in it. It is something like that you do not know how to make halwa and how much desi ghee you put in it, but if you do not know how to make halwa, then halwa will not be edible, then you cannot say that if halwa looks dirty then there is corruption and tax is not necessary.  There is corruption, many people make it edible even without desi ghee by adding some extra dalda falda. I am trying to make you understand that no one is discussing this. Come and tell them, hey brother, whatever you want.  They were either left the country or they are not being born or they are selling something else because civil engineer is not sexy sexy as a computer science, mechanical people are also learning coding because the money is the same.  We meet because there is no respect for Civil Engineers, they live in the sun and their face becomes so black. Brother, as much as you like, even if you are from IIT, you will have to do the work on the spot, you cannot work while sitting in AC, Civil Engineer. Engineers, this is the biggest problem in the government. Check their degrees in the engineering department to see what level and how much knowledge they have because supervision is their job. If any government department is doing supervision then  He is doing the work within which it is being made, even if you have given the contract form to someone, the form is good, she is sitting with good talent, she will not come in ELV because paying money to someone who is poor.  Talent has to be given by taking useless talent, it will make it cheaply and you have written the rule that it will go to the cheap one. Why brother, the country is being fooled with such a big infrastructure. Listen carefully, roads are made, infrastructure is called roads.  I have great respect for Gadkari ji, I tell people one thing in that also, we will build roads, we will build roads, for this you are being taxed to improve the infrastructure of the country, hello, wait a minute, wait, wait, when  If you give a contract for a road to someone, then under PPP they ask him to collect toll tax for 20 years and they say that you collect it, then where does this money go? If you have given Rs 1000 crore to someone to build a road, then they  Who will collect the tax, you have given it, he has made it but you are not giving but you are taking money, so you are saying that you are building infrastructure and before building infrastructure, you are imposing toll tax. Nitin Gadkari ji has made a big statement.  Well said Sitharaman ji, you are giving this insurance and why tax is being levied on it, you are also collecting troll tax for the death of a person, no one comes and tells us because many people think that Nirmala tai is like this, we are Gadkari ji that.  Everyone is good, yes because we like Golu Molu people, everyone also likes them, okay, I am not saying that they are not good, not bad, I am saying that toll tax is collected at many places in India where the time has passed.  It is a private toll being collected, its time has passed, look at Khed Ki Daula, we have been talking for a long time, let me talk about Gurgaon, the name of the channel is also Khedki Tola, tax is not being removed from them for how many years now?  So Dwarka Express has also been built, now it has been connected there, Sona Save Delhi Mumbai Industry Corridor has also passed through Jaipur, it is still getting collected, it is not being removed, it is not being removed, it is not being removed.  They take from places, they have made such a mess of infrastructure and are increasing taxes and work cannot be done otherwise it is the misfortune of the country that there is no talent in the country, neither are there talented leaders nor talented workers because whoever has talent is  He says, there is no need to put us in these backward places, we will do some work of our own, I will build a good house of my own. You have seen this, brothers and sisters, many of you must have built a house, your parents.  He must have built a house, is it a normal contractor, is it dripping? What kind of contractor are you, whether you are an IIT contractor or an architect or are you very great? A normal friend, extend your hand, don't you do it like this and send a letter with such force, it never drips from there. Parliament was dripping in Ayodhya, so understand what it is, it is not corruption, it is only negligence and lack of talent. Now it is being said in Ayodhya that there  Workers are not available to do the work. That's what Nipendra Mishra ji says. Google it and check that it will get delayed because there are no workers. Where have the workers gone? There are no workers in India. Oh, this country of 104.4 crores has gone to America. The workers have gone to Dubai. All the workers, what happened to the workers, what happened, no one is asking any questions from Ram Mandir ji, so what can be important, all the elections and all that, Jai Shri Ram and all that, there was so much respect and  Everything is there, workers are not available to do the work, so see that there is a huge shortage of talent in our country, don't cry just like that, there are no good colleges of civil engineering with good degrees and they are not given respect and money. Till the time we get it, it will be like this because these big projects require a lot of technical expertise. If you give contracts here to normal house builders, then check which firm it is and make noise about it, I will have nothing to do with it.  No, it will be a listed firm, which one will it be, but you tell me what is the news in the world, India's Parliament is dripping in the rain, more contracts will go out, we are Vishwa Guru, Vishwa Guru's Parliament is dripping, look at the view, he will make opposition.  He is doing the right thing. He is doing the right thing. Before this, the Parliament was not dripping, even if it was dripping, you would have done something that was not visible, you would have done it quickly, how did you allow the world to do this when you did so much? If we had control then we would have done Monsoon Session Actual Monsoon Budget Session Monsoon Session Monsoon has become the real monsoon, tell me what is the condition of the common man, if this is the condition of MP, then we will cry loudly for the infrastructure, everyone will cry together and will empress, where will this tax go?  Raha Hai Dil Maange More, earlier people used to say, is it like this? I will make one more video, its name will be very good video, it will be 'Tamacha Politics', you will enjoy it, I will stop it here. Yes, but we have to raise our voice on this thing. You can tweet wherever you are. YouTube 4 seats, this is what was done with them, 44 seats, then 52 seats, now 99, all three together do not form their government. If you add 44 and 52, then how much is 96, 96 more.  If you add 99 then it becomes 195. If you cannot form the government with the number of seats won in 19 elections, then the same fate can happen to you too.  The public wants you to get so many seats in the next three elections that the total number of your three elections would be 2009. By doing this again and again, you fall further into the pit. I am very surprised that this is what you say in defense that it was like this.  There was such theft in their time, this was that, how can it be done in their time, yes, look at their condition, what they have done, no, look at their condition, what they have done, you want the same condition to happen to you as well, Indians.  Janata Party is a very good party but I do n't know if there is a lack of talent in the party too. There is a shortage of people who speak, there is a shortage of people who argue. Modi ji himself does not sit in the Parliament. The budget session is on.  He is in Delhi only but does not sit. Rahul Gandhi ji has said that he will never be seen in my speech after today. I have done this to your leader and made him underconfident. What is happening in the country? We are shocked. Who is in the Parliament now? What statement will the Minister of Parliamentary Affairs, Kiran Riju Ju ji, give? It is very easy to stand there and say, this is the law, it is like that, say it like this, this is not right, that is not right, why is the Parliament dripping, please stop it.  Repair the Parliament again. What are you showing to the whole world? Brother, the Parliament is not functioning, it is raining or not functioning, then declare a rainy day. Why in the country?  It's a disgrace, is n't it, in a way, it is dripping from every roof and it means that the Parliament is of the country, why was a new Parliament created just to show off, the old one was better than this, then it is for the tax payers.  Money has been wasted. Will the Parliament of the new country run in the Parliament of the British? Make something good and use it. Friend, in everything there is respect and dishonor. If a good thing was made then its very structure was destroyed.  It was okay that a good thing was built, so why break it forcefully. If someone has built it, then why don't we make a good thing considering it as a heritage, otherwise we will build our own separate place and waste time. If the Taj Mahal is built, then it is good, money.  I am coming to tell him again that we will have to build our own, Ram temple is also very good, rest if new thing is needed then build the old one which is running well, then who leaves the old one, then why do n't you ask questions or ask questions at that time. So you are India's India  If it is so, then why is this Parliament dripping? Answer, you have to answer. Let's ask comfortably. Asks only with love. The citizen of the country is asking, what are you doing? On one side there is no water, no water on the other side, no water in the country. No lol, now so much water is coming, there is no way to control it, ca n't we collect it somewhere, this is the biggest misfortune, I want to tell you, it is a very big misfortune and I have only one solution, although I  not from any party  What Aam Aadmi Party and BJP have spread in Delhi is that after fighting in Delhi, Congress should come and form the government on its own. Say that we will run a bullying government, we will not be afraid of the Center and we will provide these resources and once the public  Do only these, I have never told anyone like this till date because speaking like this would be a waste of time that you are a Congressman, it may seem okay, but this is the job of teaching a lesson, brother, the common man's party says.  Our bureaucrats don't listen, you don't listen, then sit at home, then when you can't hear the voice of the public, you can't cry, how long can you cry? Yes, I am surprised, yes, I am surprised, yes, this is from Modi ji, I speak sarcastically.  A few people have a copy, now on many channels the music comes from behind it. It is a low budget channel of mine so I have to act. Many times people asked me how do you speak, so I had to explain it to you and one person.  yes sir  Okay, so throw them out, friend, the Aam Aadmi Party people have had enough of their existence, we are poor common people for 10 years and they think that they are our common man, they are doing nothing, it is better to appoint a Congressman, that one, that one is yours.  Rahul Gandhi ji will reveal the meaning inside the Parliament, I feel this from within, I want to tell the BJP people that Rahul Gandhi ji has enjoyed becoming the opposition leader, he has no fun in coming to power because those who come  It is fun to insult and go there, they know that sitting there is also an insult, I feel like this, I feel like this, many times they say, this is fine, friend, give me 99 seats next time, keep taking classes like this.  This is also a taste and I am saying that this is also fine, meaning whenever you enjoy doing this because they seem to be running away, if Congress wins next time then the government will be formed.  It is fine in 150 because it could not make it in 190. Congress will make it in 140. Okay, so let's see, right now I feel that the condition of Congress is what happened in the second term of 2011-12, when the government came in nine.  There was a lot of noise going on and the Nirbhaya case had given rise to that and then the Ramdev ji episode, Anna Hazare and the atmosphere that was being created.  It has started to get created, this honeymoon period is not even there, people like us used to say, friend, do your own business of politics, now brother, you have to enter because it is affecting your life, every decision is affecting the government, sometimes this tax is  Sometimes those taxes are like this, sometimes like that, because they have to be made like this, that is why they have to be political, every person will have to have a choice, there is no choice, I am the first person, so oh brother, if the world is dynamic then it will take two years.  If I said earlier then this is the biggest thing, will it continue the same, will things change every six months? I am still ready to give a lot of advice to the BJP people and to the NITI Aayog that the situation can still be changed in your favor if  If you want such a video, then I am ready for that because I am actually here for the public and I also know that I have no interest in the fact that the food I have cooked for 5 years, from which I have to eat, gets burnt every day. Have fun and enjoy, I am not the opposition, the ghee of the opposition dissolves, the Parliament is dripping, so are the tears of the common man, my tears are equivalent to the dripping of the Parliament, what is this happening to my tax payer's money and the ghee of the opposition?  It is melting, you understand that this is the difference between a common man and the opposition, the ghee of the opposition is melting that now another issue can be found.  They humiliate them and use titter but the heart of the common man cries, you understand this difference, this is the difference, there is no resolution here in this channel, there are many opposition channels and which are completely against Modi ji BJP.  If you want to blow them like that, then the grease melts inside me, I feel like crying, I don't want it, friend, legacy could have been good, yes, 10 years seemed like they had passed well, now it means is it time to pick up the bag or what?  The results of three elections are being awaited. RSS meeting is going on in Kerala. Now many people have started holding independent meetings. What to do with them. Discussions are slowly taking place. The atmosphere is slowly getting heated. I still want it.  Yes, I still want the reason to be clearly visible, to promote the speech of Anurag Thakur ji in which the content has been expanded and to promote the expanded line.  It does n't suit you. It doesn't suit you to praise like this. People are watching those things which are very below the belt. I do n't know whether there is anyone to give guidance or not. People are so scared, how to guide them, Rahul ji.  He is not afraid, that is why Rahul ji is getting the best guidance. He is getting fours and sixes on every ball and Modi ji is getting beaten on every ball. Who is telling him that he has taken the wrong vehicle, he is feeling that he is off stump.  guard  And it is from the middle stump, it is like that reference point itself is wrong and someone is having fun by telling that friend, do it like this, there is no fun, there is so much fear, who can go and tell, let it go, it is a big deal like us, still  They are telling and many people see, they write on a big level, channels and videos will come, only positive ones will come if someone wants to take it because we, the public, should not care who is running the country, how is it going, it should matter to them.  We need to see what they are getting in the country, what is their feeling, let them run as per their wish, what do we have to do with us, how is the environment being created, we have to see first the issues of Agniveer, after NEET, then the border issues, then this issue of trains. After one after the other things, you are calling for a bronze medal, why brother, why to get clapping, this way Xi Jing Ping will remain a colp, so many medals are going to come from China and Vidan ji.  Meaning, these small things should remain on that phone, the bronze medal is not a big thing, yes, hey, it is a country worth 140 crores and you are pampering us, once all these Olympians come back, they will be given tea after winning medals.  Throw a party at your place, every time a medal comes, call him and put it on speaker, now he is our Sarabjot ji, he has seen how he talked, you have seen that tone tenor, he is his Mannu Bhagar.  She was talking like this, sir, thank you, I liked it very much, she was in love, you have seen what happened, so now I should see, I will tell you subtle things, you people like this kind of content, tell me, now there is so much.  Now, we will have to bring two videos in a day. Do you want that two videos should also come because whenever you get time, take out 1.5 and watch it together, this one is fine, not all the videos, but if the athlete wants to watch it.  so give it  Will come because some more content will come in many days so please like and share thank you very much"

    "title": "A Secret Nexus Which Taxpayers Need To Expose & Break [Nn6Q_ErHHOA].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, very good comments have been coming on the video, very good spirit, my spirit is awakening, today I am going to tell you a secret which will tell you an original thing, you think about this and this thing, you just have to pick up this video, pick up means.  This is a moral application because till date no one has explained this to you properly. This is from our middle class which is my audience because in the lower class there is no asking and the rich class makes a mistake in this, they give money and they will not speak.  Poor, okay, I am using the word poor because they spend a lot of money and are going to spit. Right now in the elections, the middle class has to make this demand and I am going to tell you in this demand that a lot of money can be saved because in India and Anything happens in India, anything happens in our country, there is a lot of talk about money that brother, this money will go back a lot, only this much will go back, that's why people come here jumping, today I am on tax foot, middle class, middle class, these are those who  pays taxes  And the class does not pay tax. Basic definition is fine. Tax money is being spent on advertisement. Advertisement is done by the state government or central government. Advertisement should be zero. Whoever has a party in the state, the expenditure should be from the party fund only. The region is telling about it.  All these politicians, from the one at the top to the one at the bottom, brothers and sisters, they keep doing their own advertisements 24 hours a day.  Tore this, opened this, did this, then why do you put that secret in the newspaper? I am going to tell this secret. Why do they look inside the newspaper after seeing the newspaper ad? No one gets votes for them. Not many people even read the newspaper. He is going to tell the truth tomorrow.  I am and they run ads on INLD news. Now you will see ads on INLD news running in newspapers. They are from different political parties, but they are from the state government and the funds are from the central government. I have been those six.  If it becomes zero, you have to give aid from the government fund. This is a small party, there is a government like his, where in Gurugram, next to him, see how much he does and he reduces it. People calculate the figures of the rest, the biggest government is the biggest.  Big government and biggest leader, you will go crazy that they took so much money from us and what did they do with us through tax foot. Actually the reason is, I am getting a little passionate.  I am telling you with full dedication that I am putting so much of my life into it that even the videos have to be sold. These are the media and news and the money to buy them because what kind of money should be given in a sack, the government is taxed, so take out the money in the sack and then give it to someone, then power. How will they give it? From the middle of this ad, whoever opens his mouth against them in the newspaper and across party lines, whose government is doing everything, will not give money to him and as soon as he gets the money, he will sing their praises to the maximum.  They will say shamelessly and this is their method, the second method is the hoardings which are there whenever you look at the hoardings and check this, send RTI to the people and you further tell them that if you spend money on such ads of the government, then you will not get votes. How many feats have you done? They put money in the hoardings, they do their work, they eat the money, the one who works on the hoarding contract, took the money from the hoardings.  The material is there, it does their work across the party lens, I am telling you that the money goes from the government, how will the money go from the government to the workers, if you can't give it then this is the biggest scan, you tell me, when you go in a helicopter, you go into trouble, there is a rally.  It is like this, you are doing only advertisements, you hold press conferences, all your leaders and ministers, who are in the cabinet, are doing advertisements. Lens Across and Government did this for 24 hours, gave a gift on Twitter, so this is an ad only, now what is the need to print it separately, you gave it to me, you took a mother, you will not lie, brother, I am a people, I am in hi officers, when they  If you want to open your mouth on record, then it is accepted that it is true, why do you print the truth again in the newspaper and give advertising money to this app and then you see, even two party fonts from your party fat, which one is theirs?  It's your father 's money, it's his money, that money also belongs to the public and that public, tell me one thing, why would anyone give money in the party, no one gives ₹ 50 for free, even when they donate, 90% of them also look like this. This is how they do it by taking photos, if I get some mileage then you know where that money is coming from, for what purpose it is coming, the political party is sitting on the fence, don't you do your own kind of advertisement which you do?  If he is not in the government, he will cry only then because of coming to the government, he will also give that money to the government. Please check Google, file RTI and check everywhere and make it an election issue. Brothers and sisters, how much money will you save?  Do you know how many thousands of crores of money will be saved? Do you guys have any idea about this? Is this idea original? Is this a good idea? Is this an ID? Someone should stand up and say something to any party.  We will not only talk among ourselves about the program and even at the national level, be it the biggest party or the smallest party, everyone is in two, three or five statuses. Your drama is happening, so never stop each other, this is for each other. Politicians who criticize everything, you are a thief, you are a thief, you are a thief, you did not do it, you did it, you are useless, you are useless, I am good, sometimes you have to say that for how much do you put an ad and I put it because the media.  how to  Control, now we have come to the YouTube stage, YouTube has stopped getting money, YouTube Row is being called, it is being facilitated every time, if you have seen me taking a photo with any leader, then remember it is simple, if someone  This is the kind of channel or we have to tell such things and we have to tell independent opinion, nothing is ever neutral, opinion is always there but we have to make it important, that independence opinion honey. If I have to say tomorrow that brother, someone has done this thing well, then that is an opinion concrete. Now it does not mean that I accept everything about it, but if I am going in the same direction, then people are wise, so wise.  If everyone understands then this is the biggest rigged game. Sari Meet, you cannot trust any media, the media houses are owned by politicians, sorry, they are businessmen and all over the world are politicians. What will they themselves do? They have front and join debts and those who carry an agenda and you know it suits you, you like it, sometimes you also feel ashamed that the friend is doing too much, saying too much.  If so, then start boycotting these things, you say simply, brother media, we will not watch the news because that news is only advertisement, how many advertisements will we watch? I am a common man like you, he has started a channel for me.  If you ever see such activities on the channel, then do let me know because if it happens one too many times, I will use my hard-earned platform to ask questions to any politician and I do not ask questions to politicians. You have seen my previous video.  Have also seen that what question should one ask to a politician? Are you a mango or a cat's account? Once I got a chance to interview a senior politician, I have to go to ask this question. I would like to ask someone the answer.  No, no, and all the interviews are done on recording, so suddenly no one can talk to me anyway. Government, this should be zero. Do n't tell the government. Tell me about your schemes. Tell me who has accepted it. You are sitting with the government.  There are officers in your government, there are groups below the officers, there are groups below Group B, there are C, there are peons from DI. Tell them, whatever advertisements are done by the government like uncle teacher, tell them about the government's gas scheme.  Your sarpanch is all your workers, each of these fairies is sitting with 12-12 crore workers to comment that 12 crore workers are yours, publish you in the newspaper too and I am taking every party together, do n't say here that you belong to it. I don't belong to anyone and we don't belong to anyone. If you want to belong to someone then you have to belong to your wife, to belong to your children and to be your own and to be your mother. Who are you and have you known a lot about belonging to someone else? Then adopt your brother's children, sister.  Take it and have your father-in-law with you, after that, please share this idea that I have given you, please check it, if it spends money then it seems like a pickle and it is an election campaign, why should you include it in the campaign?  You keep pushing me, what do you tell me, you tell me what you have done, you have given this thing, torn it, put it on us, we have done all this, and if you have done so much and put so many ads, then why are you getting so many letters?  all kernels  You won't know while roaming around, you should be very confident, you did very good, you advertise it very well, so if there is a student who has studied very well, has very good knowledge, he is confident about the exam, he will not appear in the exam, which paper will I try?  It happens that the one who has made a fuss, who was showing to mom and dad, is roaming around very quickly about the condition of everyone, so now we have to make the public aware about anti  No, Banna Bhai Saheb, how much budget do you make in the government? No, the government has done it, they have to tell them that if you do what has happened from now on, no problem, you did not have the knowledge and we also did not have the knowledge, we would not have woken up, Guru ji.  From Gurugram awakened us, now we will ask questions in 2023, we will ask in 24 that the government will spend thousands of crores of rupees for its Y-Bhai and Rs. Stories have been heard everywhere to save money. Stories to save money will be spent here, band this, band that, a politician bands his pension and by giving money to his workers, the government gives money to the workers. What does it mean, friend?  All these tent house people, see which party, in every state government, all the workers become tent house people, all the tent house people because that way is the function of the government, it is the function of the government, it is the function of the government.  It is the function of the government. It is the function of this government. Is it necessary for any government to know what is the need of knowledge when all these things are reduced by electronic means, I am not going to make you aware through YouTube, they know that if the story is not known then they will not get it. 15  People are not going to listen to me, my YouTube channel is a small channel, it may not have 10000 subscribers but still 10-15000 people like one video.  Let's see what I am saying about a politician, if you don't organize or do something like this, then 10,000 of his men will stand up, if he goes quietly and stands up, whether he wants to give any message on the story, his message is nothing, sir, make less beedis.  Tell me the money, take it on the tractor, brother, isn't it there? Take this, take this note, we will fly away, it will be yours, so and so's daughter-in-law's job was brought, yours was transferred, yours was his, this was his.  This is this, let the Gadar people gather together, this is from my district, then this is from my tehsil, from the block, from the campus, Panchayat, everyone is on duty, 20 people, 30 people, 40 people, one behind the other, then they do it like this.  Even then if you don't pay him ₹ 50000 then more than that he is his friend Elevation Hello on YouTube and he can say whatever he wants, he gave him 3 lakh rupees, you are his gram in Devi Lal Santi  If someone from three lakhs stands up to a politician then tell his name Politician When I came Other politicians I mean other politicians Actually three lakhs like this He said, brother, reach there, my gram people, two Devi Lal Parks reached on this date Three lakhs someone  If any politician has the guts then tell me and here I am saying that other politicians are fine. Any min, even those of Amitabh Bachchan level can extract money from superstars and we have to stop the public from doing the same. Corruption is here, it is big, it is not there in other places. It is here that the money given by this government is being given through whom and it is going to whom selectively, that is why there is so much incentive to work and if I become a political activist then it is not a common man.  At home, father says, Son, your father is coming, go to the railway station, some uncle of 25 years, 30 years is not ready to get up, he will go, take the auto, father, I am sleeping.  Why do they roam around because brother, we get this, we have to catch this political activist also, every time next time, anybody wants you to come in influence, you know left right, what are you getting, no, I am not getting anything, I am for the country.  I am laughing, it's okay, the agenda is there, many people are involved in multi-level marketing, politicians and politics don't speak MM, brother, there is a scheme below this, every man becomes three. Then she will make three of them. The one at the top earns the most money and the one at the bottom earns the most money. Do you know that I am teaching you multilevel marketing? What comes in it is that brother, is it a scheme or a product?  There is nothing to do with it, it can be anything, from toothpaste to some soap to oil to clothes, anything to some scheme, whatever it may be, the power is the model, this is the one with the pyramid, it is okay, the politics is also the same, you should not become the stupidest person at the bottom. This is just a message, I hope you will correct this thing that I have told you, it is a very unique thing, advertisement is given money forcefully, they are given money to keep the narrative going for 24 hours, no one does anything less than the ideal for free.  This is as bad as in Noida too, these too are kept in a big policy, the rent is spent, it seems expensive, it is less expensive, so this ad is not running like this, these are not run by any ADO whose soap and oil we are selling.  These people are running on ads. Your eyes should be opened. For the next 7-8 months, I am telling the general public to see the ads in the newspapers and they will see what will happen in the news media of the political party or the one who is not in power. One ad will come, the other one will have 10. Ok, Kuber's treasure has been found. Kuber's treasure is the public's treasure, the one who is going from it, you just have to check through RTI, brother, just tell me the last 5.  How much money did you spend in a year? The government has to keep track of every kind of documentary, but that government does some advertisement but it does not tell how much money was spent on advertisement because if uncle does not even ask then he will have to tell when he tells.  If you have to, then this uncle who took the money will not be published in the newspaper, that news will not be published on the news channel because if you know that it is being received on my channel, I am getting money on my YouTube channel.  So will I tell him that I am getting money from this, I will also tell him, no one told you, you understand, Nobody Bill, expose this, because this is less fun, but if you ask then it is right, ask more and tell him the thing, public, now you You will say, why don't you check and tell me, I have given less ideas to the Guru, if I start reducing all these then how will I do them because people will give me money, brother, you do it, no, Chandragupta.  If you want then Sher will do it and if you have understood the point till now then it is good and this is not the place for hats of any kind here because here we are talking about the welfare of the public and about creating awareness and no one is spreading negative politicians dreams.  They are doing religion, the least is to stay in power. The biggest religion of the one who is in power is to stay in power, first of all, after that, he will do something. No person can do good for anyone else unless he does good for himself first. See this is a fact.  So this is what you are doing  They are making big, do not comment, have to tell you directly that friends, this is what I don't like it and I don't like other vices. How will it be cured, I understand all that on a different channel, there is no less of it here, this was the message here, I hope you guys understand all these messages, please share it, I made this video with a lot of effort. Make it very fashionable, put your tweet on Twitter, put it on WhatsApp group, put it on the public, just like they see in the pictures, just like you would see a picture, recently the public has seen the example again and again and the public is getting this realization.  It must be some external thing that he will be something, but it is me who is doing it, in real life it will be like this, now I am not sexy and he looks like Shahrukh with a singer in his mouth and driving a motorcycle like this.  I am doing like this, I am a normal person, I am looking just like you, so I am not as sexy as you are, but brother, I have power later, the original thing is power, I tell people, share it and if you have not subscribed to the channel, then do number in democracy.  You have got the platform and write in the comment area of ​​Dhaba because the quality of the comment area has shown what is the quality of the channel and subscribe."

    "title": "Aam Admi Needs To Know , Discuss & Raise This Issue With Politicians [4D3yXuOWlMg].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today there is a sensitive, sensitive, okay, sensitive in English, I want to discuss this topic, think with an open mind, there are many of you who are interested in this topic, I will be talking about an issue of identification of armed forces, beyond this, I also have  I am coming because I am Guruji, I also give consultation, I give clarity on every issue, so I want to tell you on this also and please share it if your tweet and WhatsApp are relevant.  This is fine, share it, because many issues are not being discussed. Will only caste and religion be discussed? You can do some other work also, now things are being talked about openly. Now the match has reached political slog overs. Whatever match is happening, okay, today we will discuss two or three things related to the armed forces, one thing that is coming is that by doing disability pension, it is given to those people who somehow got disabled while doing their duty, there is a lot beyond that. they are the law  There is pension, things are being tweaked in it and those who are disciplined in the armed forces, now they do not open their mouths, they cannot open them, they should not even open them, it is okay, I am being very pragmatic, I am not the one who is so emotional and so loud. I am going to talk about very practical things, talk to anyone in India, talk to any politician, talk to any politician of any party, talk to any person on the road, talk to the educated, talk to the illiterate.  You can do it with any group of people, it comes out of the same mouth, we love our armed forces, we respect you a lot, so there is no complaint in that, but brother, do it on this thing too, only respect will do, are you very fond of it?  We respect you, we love you, everyone says this to me, so I have to ask, who are these people who are doing this work, who are they, are they some bureaucrats, are they civilians, who are sitting somewhere in the ministry, is this the great thing?  Do the politicians know that our hearts beat every time and should beat every time? Do they know that the only thing that I am going to discuss is to come and say that this thing that is being discussed has only two or three options, this is absolutely wrong.  There is no such thing, this can be a choice, the second choice is that this is a thing, I did not know it, my God, this is wrong, we will fix it, of course, now you have told me, thank you very much.  You get a reward, you told this thing, this second thing we will do and the third thing we know we are doing, ask us, tell us, we are teasing the issue, we are teasing it comfortably, as if there are only three options to do anything in democracy. That this thing is being told, this very thing can be wrong, it is wrong and it is right, then you tell me that among all the things which are there in disability pension, there is a factor of 20 in which if you have more than that, then you will get pension and all those things.  is being tweaked and by changing the word of disability, a new thing is coming in many cases by changing the word relief. Why do they keep doing this new thing? You have to save money, neither do you have to save money, nor do you have to save money.  Are Armed Forces a profit and loss company? Is it a PSU? Why do n't they save money in PSU? They are in Air India. You don't know how many thousands of years it took them to take that decision by investing thousands of crores. Since when are the Armed Forces for profit?  And there will be a loss for Agniveer, this is a loss, what if something happens to Agniveer, you have conditioned the terms of Agniveer, let's save the pensioners, that was to equip the armed forces, this was the story, did you agree that it is fine, do something.  You did it for four years, but in its terms and conditions, earlier, suppose a young man used to come for a job for 15 years, he was appointed and he got something done in one year or two years, okay, so he had some system, did n't he?  You have done something for the country, if anything happens to you, the country will take care of you, so that four year old Agniveer has come, okay, you are not giving him anything further, but whether you want to discuss it or not, first tell me as much as I can.  Listen to the audience, whether you want to discuss it further in detail or not, listen to this issue, don't listen, don't look, don't speak, don't speak, this is to be made, this is to be made, then tell me other wise, those who are affected by this one now or this one.  Now many cases are going to come to the court differently because of this and this is not right for the country, the country cannot have a situation where the country is going to be protected, the court is going to take justice, the court will take the decision but this is the situation first.  It should be told and discussed and it should be said whether it is being discussed on any TV channel, on news channel or on social media or on T-Forward. Why is it not being discussed? Is it true or is there a fear of something when nationalism?  This is such a big issue, now a fighter movie will be released on 25th January in 2024, and beyond that, elections will be played, I am telling you that we should play, we should play, politics should be run in its own way, there should be nationalism, but what is this, is this real, to whom these are the real ones.  These are the TV people, not those from the movies, these are the real ones who are unhappy. If you look at the armed forces, they are serving only 12 to 15 lakhs. Count the 50-60 lakh retired families.  So these four crore vote banks are also found, but brothers and sisters, these four crore are not in one place because there are national people from Jammu and Kashmir to Kanyakumari and which city should I say in the West? I know the city of Budj for you people. Or you settle till Ahmedabad only, it is fine in Gujarat or there is some other place to the left of that, small or big, it is fine till the border, from there till you reach East Eastern Most, Sukhiya, Dib Garh, there is much beyond that.  from such a big country All our military brothers come, okay, so now they are spread out, so they have some vote bank somewhere, some vote bank somewhere, some vote bank somewhere, so now if this is just one, that ridiculous, ill- mannered MP of some state, who has votes in five to six areas.  How much did he tolerate and how many protests did he bring? Had he been a normal person, he would have told him, \"Dude, you are being so ill-mannered\" but could not remove him because he can effect five-six seats, will he do it or not, I do n't know what his status is.  So brothers and sisters, can't these people do this, am I appealing to the politicians also because brother, the politician only listens to the vote bank and should also be listened to, it is his religion, not against the politician, I am making him sense, but there is this thing in him.  There is no awareness among the people about what is happening, everything is being done in the name of money, you are cutting it like this and where is it going, then which one, someone should be happy, how much is being saved, first of all this.  How much will be saved? First of all tell me because the name of the disability pension has been changed. There is no tax on the person with disability. What will you do by deducting the tax on disability pension? How much will you save? How many people are getting it? Some section of the society is getting it from within. I believe in this.  I think that our politicians are very good, I believe that our leaders are very good, I do not think that they know this very well because if they know, brothers and sisters, then it is they who win and lose the elections. Someone in the department below him is doing mischief and there could be 10, 20, 30, 40 people who are doing mischief, not more than that and they say the same thing, there are those elements in the government, many a times he has benefited from it. It has become departmental among ourselves, it remains a department in Raita, I want to tell the politician, you want to lose the election, you vote by throwing money. Now in Rajasthan, votes are being given by giving phone calls. In MP, votes are being given by giving Laadli scheme, so brother, this is also Rs 5 crores. No one gave you consultation, Prashant Kishore ji, did your consultant remain in Bihar only?  He has disappeared, he doesn't know anything like math, excel or fax. I am telling you this issue to the politicians, no one is discussing it, no one is talking about it. Read it, it will affect you in the elections.  Please go and stop this relief pension system. Stop making these name-callings. Someone is telling you that this is a lifestyle problem. Your heart has become like this. If this has become a problem then it is a lifestyle problem. Oh that life.  The style was also given by you. Who is living in the mountains, forests and mountains without family for two-two-three years? Is he not stressed? What food is he eating, where is he living under gunshots, is he dying?  He was not stressed, if something happens to his body due to his stress, then you will not say, no, this is your lifestyle disease, Lalaji's lifestyle D, the one who sits and eats this kachori, the one who is your army brother, is he eating kachori, tea, pakoda, kachori, is he full?  You have your training regimen, you have your medicals, every year when you select someone in the army, there is a proper procedure. You select a fit person. Now don't you say, it was your genes that were bad, so why don't you check, what were your genes that were bad, now this will be a problem for you, don't do this, it makes a difference on morale, I would like to talk about leadership also here, the amazing leadership of the army.  There is no doubt that it is fine at the junior level but on other things I want to tell you one thing, you guys tell me and I will try to wrap it up for the bureaucrats too and what if a person becomes a general?  He should join a political party. After one year, do we have to put any clause? After 5 years, let me tell you a very good thing. There is bureaucracy across departments, all across railways, on big positions in the government. It has a lot to do with the private corporate sector. Contracts are left, work has to be done and it has to be done, the country runs like this but the clause in it is that the company with which you have signed some contract or anyone you have any connection with.  If you get it done then you cannot learn employment in it because that conflict of interest comes, it is a very good thing, it has very good check and balance, it is very good check and balance, it is very good check and balance that also I was giving you the contract, I was in the position.  I was retiring in a year and you hired me, so could you, I am considered a pro, so there is a provision, but the same thing does not apply to political parties, brother, no, brother.  You and I drive your agenda, that too is employment, isn't it a kind of political service, only you will become a minister, you will become an MP and they will become MP, no one is telling you these harsh things, we have to discuss it properly.  I also get emotional while speaking, but I am not emotional but I have satirized it. How Mama Tune Changes Mama Tune Changes Naa Woh Kolavari De Kola De Song  Inside comes someone wearing a big coat. He is talking about our country, not about any other country. The big judge of our big court, the biggest judge, the biggest judge, the one who talks like this, a case of sexual harassment has been filed, Mama Tune Chance to know.  You should see, this is how the rule works, this is how it used to be, I am not judging it, this is how it should be done, but the public should know what is happening, why should they become so crazy because this channel is for the intellectuals. Don't go here and create a ruckus, but we should know what is happening, the discussion should be complete, we should know that we know this is happening, you do it, you do everything, we are all watching like this, the public knows everything, I am the public on this, everything is happening.  Even if you know it, a video of mine will be made very cute. If you know, I do that, don't the public accept this dialogue? Politicians, the public is very intelligent, the public knows very well that it is like this, there will be another video on this, don't subscribe to the channel.  here you  You will get independent opinion. Neutral opinion is the word I never use. Opinion is never neutral. It is always at some site. It keeps changing from different sites, but people have made everything black and white that if you are speaking like this then you are against it.  I have uploaded 3233 videos so far. You can't tell my political affiliation. You see a change in every video. Do you ever see a change in every video? I keep doing flip flops like A for apple, sometimes B for ball and sometimes C for cat. One half of me will only say L for loser. I will not say the line. L is for loser, which is also called left. Okay, put it in that too.  Gives half a bar in the category, half in the video, rest I keep roaming in ABC, okay, it is an independent opinion, not so-and-so, bitter, and not creating a ruckus, please tell me, friend, this should also be known. If anyone has ever misused the Disability Pension, then to get it under the procedure, the systematic balance has to be maintained. You should not brush everyone off. Disability Pension does not mean that you will have to take only pills to become disabled while you are on duty.  You are going from one place to another. You are on duty. In the army, you are on duty 24*. Ruling on courts etc. has also come. Even if you are on leave, you are always a soldier. On Duty: If he is going somewhere even on leave and something wrong happens then he has the right to take action by the law because he is on duty he is always on duty and if something happens to him while doing Sambalpuri and it is Very but what is that? Will I have to go to the court every time? I mean, what are you doing then, why are you doing it? How much money will you save, how much will India's GDP grow? Tell me, this government is busy in advertising itself. All the governments spend Rs. 10,000 crores, I am not telling any party, we did this, we did this, now you, these are the rallies that will be held in six months of elections, in this too, they have torn it apart, blown it up, done it like this.  I did it and then again posting photos of you, you are roaming around everywhere and half a man, and these photos are everywhere on social media and outside, here and there, here too, I mean, I am so interested, it becomes too much.  If it happens then it falls, don't do such things, some things are like this, don't tease them in this country and that is the last man standing when everyone raises their hands, no one gets flooded in any situation, okay internal  The situation is done, the rights are done, this is done, if something happens from outside, then he is your last man standing, he is yours, you don't go there and do the work, and to do this work only the one who is not allowed to do it will do the work.  He does n't know S of security, he doesn't know N of nationalism, he does n't know P of patriotism and he does n't know L of loyalty, he doesn't know Kakh, he doesn't know what is that emotion when that soldier is standing somewhere to do anything. So he is standing on this faith which is the faith of the country that brother, if something happens to you, they will take care of you, don't be afraid because the bullet comes from nowhere, it is neither seen nor heard, it seems straight and how much more  It hurts, doesn't it? Those who have got it, only those who have got it know, those whose near and dear ones have got it, only they know. Please don't save money by going here and if you have to save money, then first tell me how much you want to save, the whole country will come together and  They will put in your treasury fund, those 50 huge treasury funds of yours are lying open, of which there is no accounting, where did it go, what did it go to, no one knows anything, neither can ask the name nor can put it in RTI, nor can it be put by who gave it, nor can you put anything in yours. Electrol Bund  Those who do not know who goes to whom, except those who are in the ruling party, no one knows about the rest, if someone else puts it in, then it is yours to do so, you tell them that the government says, tears will come out of your eyes, you are a normal man.  What are you saying, we are not John Forces people who are at 99.9. Tears will come out of your eyes as I am going to tell you that a soldier pays his own insurance money because he is ready to insure his outsiders.  No, a soldier cannot get his normal health insurance because his risk factor is not high. If you read the health insurance, you will also find it written that I am not in armed forces and that the soldiers pay their own money for their own risks.  For getting life insurance, ask if there is anything in your department, check their system, they have different names, get it by doing AGIS, you are different, I do not have all the knowledge.  Here the meaning of the person who distributes is that he himself is giving insurance for death and is going towards death, holding competitions, doing selection, doing training and saying, I will go and eat and I will give insurance and then you come with them.  You are playing this game, you are giving disability relief pension, be ashamed, be ashamed, do politics in many things, save money, I will tell you, I will give you a free consultation.  Where can money be saved? One and a half crore places can save money. You have to save it here. You have to save it here. A lot of money will be saved. You will become a tycoon. If you tell me, it is total. This is badassery. Politician needs to tell this. You have got three options. Only again I  Will surprise the video address to the politician your votes will go brother everyone likes to win the election I believe maybe you don't even know because  Even the politicians don't know when no one is speaking, not explaining, down down down down, the buttons will be pressed somewhere else, why not as much as the elections, still work has to be done, make false promises like you always do everywhere, liar, what is the problem, just say it.  We will see, it cannot happen like this, there cannot be justice for our army brothers, say it or say that this is happening as per our wish, we know everything, we have given our blessings or you can punish those who are doing mischief.  you this this Can't make a round bargain, we have a lot of respect, we have a lot of respect for the army brothers, a lot, when you tell us, we have a lot of respect, who does n't have respect, tell me the name of any person in the whole of India, who doesn't have respect in 144 crores and who is this  Ready to say on camera that I have no respect for the army but everyone has respect, then when everyone has respect then why is it discussed every day that we are very  I have respect. No, I have a lot of respect. No, I have a lot of respect. I come from Haryana. We have many boys here in the army. Okay, that's why this issue is very near and dear to me. Okay, many people are in touch. Okay, many people brother.  There are martyrs from everywhere, there are many from here too and the percentage in our state, Haryana, within the national population is not even 2, but within the army, that percentage is very high.  There are a lot of officers at the level and even at the lower level, go to a village, go to a family, there is one person in every family or wants to go, out of these three you will get and in many of them you will get five.  - If people are going from five generations, then this issue is dear to me. Those who are dear to me, then don't listen like this, just comment here, spread this message so that it reaches the ears of some politician. Son, your exam is coming, this is your number five question, it is going to be cut, the voting percentage is 2 to 3, the election is going to be very close, in this way, this match will go in 50 overs, there will be a very tight finish in many contests and there. Votes are also received through ballot paper. The one from Rohtak had lost. Our ballot paper is fine. Remember which one is which. That is fine. If the ballot paper had lost, then let's change the ballot paper. An example of a constitution was also given when the vote gets stuck in less than 10,000 votes. These people of MP decide. You must have heard that the counting of votes comes first on the ballot paper. The ballot paper is the first to be opened. Who gives the ballot paper today?  Everyone presses the button on the day. Brothers and sisters, where do the ballot papers come from? They are the ones with ballot papers. Take care of the ballot paper people too, that is the message and top.  There is also a request to the military leadership, just look at it a little, brothers, it is okay, you have eaten salt, there should be a little salt towards those people whom you have commanded, if there is an issue, then do it logically, legitimately and according to logic.  If there is something wrong then add the check balances. Add the check balances. Now isn't it the case that this ration is distributed to everyone in India, all the BPL people are sitting with this card. Do you deserve, then you shut down everyone, you say that I will put more checks and balances, if you bought a car then you are not poor, if you bought a house, then you are not poor then if you put check balances then brother, there are checks in this.  Put your balances already. According to me, based on my knowledge of hearing and talking to people, there are already a lot of check balances, but if you want to increase then increase it more, no one is forbidding but genuine.  In this case, you are under the garb of what ever and I am still mine, I do not believe that the politician knows, I will not abuse the politician so soon, because of this, it is easy for the politician to become cheap, I think so.  Because why would any politician do this, it means these are five crore people, these are 50 lakh ex- servicemen, every ex-serviceman and those 15, how many families have four, five, 10 people, everyone has a father.  Mom, brother sister, by doing this and that, brother vote is four five crore votes, there will be 94 crore 95 crore voters, put 100 crore voters, let's vote, 60 65 crore will vote, 65 crore will vote, then out of 65 crore, four five crore voters will be angry.  When elections are looming, at least this free consultation means thank you to me, then say I want all political parties to take up this issue and first thank you.  Me for making it an issue and for you I have brought this low hanging fruit and fix it and make them happy, this is your direct vote bank of 5 crores, tell me one more thing, one more thing, this is a retired army man, he is not 510, one  A retired soldier has the power to influence 100 people. I am also telling this because leadership is such that it is left with the army, it remains with many others also.  So we are trying to influence millions too. Okay, please share. Thank you very much."

    "title": "Agniveer Scheme Discussed Like Never Before On YouTube ｜ Must Watch [xFsXE22qUZY].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today we will discuss about Agniveer Scheme. Nowadays politics is a political issue and according to me its understanding is not very clear and it is not clear because the ruling party has implemented it and the opposition is speaking about it very superficially.  It is not good, it is not good and is not able to convey because an intellectual who needs the bandwidth to understand something, perhaps he does not have it, so today I will discuss.  I will try to do this. You are a common man, I will try to give you complete clarity on this issue. You guys tell me, whatever issue has been made in the Agniveer scheme, it has been made for the child who is a human being and no one calls him that.  This is good, some are saying that it is not good for this, this is the topic of discussion, the opposition is saying that this person should be given a job and that is not good, who will come for a year, the opposition and the ruling party are saying no, this will reduce our pension bill.  It will happen like this, it will be beneficial and we and him  We will adjust and the benefit will be like this. This has been discussed for the last many years since the scheme has come. I will discuss this rather than what is good for it. I will discuss what is good for the country, for the organization and for the armed forces. No one has discussed this, let's discuss it because we will look at the individual, he is very important. Let's discuss the individual only to understand the organization. Army, Air Force, Navy, all three.  The organization of our armed forces operates in a different way. It should not have been there at all in the Air Force and Navy. It should not have been there. It should not have been there. It will be discussed. Why it should not have been there. It was not needed. And for the Army, it is on record that which arm  The senior officers of the forces, General Saheb and all this, have said that a book was also going to be published, which has not been published yet because the elections and all that have come, because it will be published on this issue, maybe someday.  Let's see when it will be published after the elections, but I want to give clarity on this now. If you first focus on the Army in the Indian Armed Forces, then within the Army, it is called one of the arms. There are different verticals and then there is one Infantry. We have many regiments in Infantry, Punjab Regiment, Sikh Regiment, Dogra Regiment, Jat Regiment, Rajput Regiment, Mahar Regiment, Maratha Regiment. Your Gurkhas are from Jammu and Kashmir, Kumaon Regiment is not going to increase GK here in Ghadwal, but I am going to tell you that we have different types from all over India, they are grouped and eat together, get up and sit together, fight together and that All of them come from a particular end, the officers who command them, who are their officers, they are officer level people, they can be anyone, they can come from anywhere, their training is done from different places.  They can belong to any place, can be of any religion because the religion and culture of the officer is the same as that of his jawan. This is an unwritten policy in the armed forces. The officer will have to follow and that is the same.  Our armed forces have a rich tradition and the common people do not have that much knowledge. Now that we have adopted the Agniveer system, we cannot recruit people in that ratio because there are regimental centers for each regiment.  There are regimental centers at different places, there was a system of their recruitment that if they want to be recruited then they will have to come to Haryana, this belt means such people will come from Churu Sikar, Rajasthan and such people will come from Punjab.  They would come from Uttarakhand like this and then they would collect them and put them through the selection process and then they would be trained and then they would go to those regiments. Now that system is being questioned because now you  Can't supply like this because in 4 years, not that many people are ready to go, so now mix and match will start coming in those regiments. This mix and match exists in Air Force and Navy. There are very technical forces, there are very technical forces, there are technical forces.  There is no issue because in the Indian Air Force, his equivalent of Jawan Airman is doing very technical work, he is not directly facing bullets on the border like the Army.  It fights, it is not fighting like that and it is a different force, it is different from the Navy, I do not want to complicate it too much by explaining it, I want to focus more on the Army itself, what is wrong with it is that the armed forces, our army, fight.  She fights for the name, salt and mark, first of all is the name, first of all is your name, your grandfather's name, your father's name, the name of your regiment, whatever name or your identity people will say, fight for the country, for the country, for the country.  country's country's country  There is a country, there is motherland, Mother India, Mother India, there is all this before that, because there is a healthy competition in the armed forces too, that if your unit gets the first chance to capture this hill, then it is very big for you.  It is a matter of pride that you have been chosen and each of your regiments has a lot of history which goes back even before independence, where every regiment shows its pride and tells that this regiment has won so many Paramveer Chakras. Mahavir Chakra has been won, whatever awards we give, whatever bravery awards we give, there is a history of a regiment, there is a history of a platoon and that is when you put a four year old soldier in him, out of which only one out of four will be trusted. So they are not able to come to the bonding at young stage age, they don't even know that they will be there, there is brotherhood in the troops that they talk to each other and keep it all cohesive because look you go to America on that. This is not the case in America, the kind of system we have, there is so much difference in the food, can you tell me that the Jats of the Jat Regiment will eat the same kind of food as those of the Madras Arrangement, okay, how many people will the food be prepared for?  It will be prepared accordingly because food is a very important thing, the army moves on it's stomach and on top of that, then culture, then your gods, the way of worshiping God, everyone says God, everyone has the same thing and that.  There is goodwill and all that is very amazing in our armed forces, but still the culture. Now if you mix all the festivals and celebrate them then the work also makes a difference. These are the things which the people of Gujarat decide.  Don't know the thing, there should be fights in Gujarat, never historic, never ever, now they have decided, now people like us from Haryana are crying, they understood because whenever you talk, people are made about money. Freedom has come at a great cost. Freedom has been achieved with great difficulty. Even after many years, there is a cost to protect it. Well, the people of Gurgaon must know that you pay maintenance charges on this society. What attacks are coming on your society?  You have given so much money for 12 122 Hajj, I am asking, those who live in condos have to save a lot of money, when you buy these electoral bonds and give them to political parties.  Take the Electoral Bund, take this also, the Arm Forces Bund, you have to grind it, tell me, our India is not the country, it is not a grind, we cannot give it for 15 years, we can give it for 20 years, it could have been seen positively in a very different way, pension.  To become a graduate, one has to be engaged in the Indian Air Force for 20 years, one has to stay for 20 years in the Army, one has to make 15 out of 15, if now  Also your Mahendra Singh Dhoni is hitting sixes in the last over, he is turning 43 years old, so brother, why are you retiring this young man, how old has he become in 33 years, even top level athletes and sports persons are working.  So no no, it requires fitness. Yes, I know, but it requires more fitness than a top level athlete and if you ca n't maintain it, if you can't, then take him out and keep the test because Mahendra Singh Dhone's fitness is his.  It comes from within that I have to stay fit, I have to play, but in the Armed Forces, fitness is insured for you. To stay fit in this organization, you have to get up every day and do physical training and you have to do parades and whatever training you have to do.  Why do they enter in this way to save money, so much money has to be saved everywhere and then what will happen after saving money, we will become America and money cannot come from anywhere, it is a very wrong thing, wrong for the country, its consequences 10  You will know in 15 years when the next fight will take place against your adversary on the West Side. On such a record of our country, people say that we will kill them, we will eat onions, we will eat onions, we will also make bombs, this is what they said, their leader has said, those people  They say there is nothing in the name of money, but the next person says that we will drink the water and you are identifying us by Y P, one on the left, this on the right, see China, that, what is the meaning of his one party?  forest thinking and what else  That is that and on top of that, you will raise this four year old Agniveer here, hey, will the value of training for brother be done for three to four years? Is Rafale a plane worth Rs 1500 crore? Beyond that, if I employ a child to service it.  For this, its training is one and a half to two years, so inside that Rafale there is radar, engine, air frame, armament, do you know how much training has to be given to the ship to do that and for continuity.  For this, Maruti's Alt is being serviced in two-three years and the Jamura came, I thought, let's go, you are fine, you are bad, you are broken, you are breaking down so openly, see what happens to the armed forces.  The thing is, either those who are serving at their top will speak, they cannot speak because they are working, those who are retired, they are joining political parties and doing everything, they want to become ministers and they are not willing to accept the greed of becoming ministers. If you open your mouth, who will open your mouth? How do you know? How are you telling me? How is this all this nonsense? When will you know whether the preparations for the match were good or not? What I am saying is right, no, there will be a war in 2035.  Then you will know, till then you will have to wait, you are not able to understand this thing and I am telling this to the opposition, I am not able to understand what I am understanding, there is no one to tell you that no filter is found, this is what we have asked.  this is good for them  If it is not then please explain why it is not right. Tell me. It is not right to come and say it directly. If we were to oppose, then the public sitting there would never understand it. She would say that this is an opposition. She has to speak everywhere, isn't she a heavy hearted person?  I have to do dash, this is what I have to do in khati mein ok so they wo n't take you seriously because you can't come a convention teach them because what is in our country  It is difficult to explain, it is easy to amuse, it is easy to fool. All Agniveer are doing the same. Let's discuss the defense of the country. Let's not discuss whether it is right for the boy. No, it is right for him. He will do something, that too is necessary.  But there will be unemployment. First of all, Arm Forces is not a source of employment. Arm Forces is not employment, it is a calling as the top leader said.  Was it not when you said about Ganga, Mother Ganga has called me, I have not come, such dialogues sound good, so brother, what are the armed forces, they are called, they do not come, this is a calling, this is a service to human life. Can't measure that they will pay so much money, this is not the job of security guard and unfortunately what is told to them after this that we will employ them in paramilitary, they employ them here and there, they think Indian Arm Forces Indian Army Aims for.  Killing you shoot shooting the enemy that is the training you want to put them in other services where they shoot at the feet throw tear gas brother you have put killer instinct in the soul of that guy either say it is ours we are not putting that in So security guards are creating baton bearers, either say this or claim this, no, our training is good, Agniveer is also an equal fighter, so brother he is.  He is a fighter, he is a train to kill the enemy, he is peacekeeping, this is policing inside his home and this is not for this kind of thing, he is not for throwing tear gas shells, he throws grenades, then he is not in tear gas shells.  It will be adjusted and what belongs to them and what they say is their turf, we who are their rights and the rest where the claim is made will also be adjusted. They do not want these people to come, they also do not want everyone's own in India.  Turf is there, we are the best, we are the best, whatever organization everyone says like this and and there should be some competition in the country and it does happen and it is okay too, I am not against it, everyone says their own thing, I am good in the armed forces also.  It would have been ours that we would have blown this one up, we would have done it like this, we would have killed like this, everyone has competition, it is a healthy competition, it is a good thing, it is okay and the Air Force did not need an 18 year old.  The child is coming in 38 years, he has to repair the plane, then when he grows old, he is fired, then we keep him for another 57 years, in the Air Force, he is retiring in 55, 57, 54 years, you have to increase his engagement by 20 to 30 years.  Do tax, don't give pension, the cry is coming out on the pension, is n't the public's cry coming out on the pension, it could have been sorted out in a different way but no one had that much brain.  Did you put it in four years, make it four years, make it two in four years, that means that joke is going on, Nabhi, the joke is going on in Haryana, Pahara family has retired, which family is this in half a year, the joke is going on that someone seems to be a little below the belt type.  There are many times that one should not talk about families like this, but do not make fun of them like this, you tell me this, some man is saying that here you get a chance for the third time in 73 years, before that give three more chances somewhere else and here you can retire in four years.  Two  Why don't they give them a chance? Now people will treat my caste color creed and not mine like that, but the fact is that brother, listen, our people are bullet eaters, I talk about the history of historic Haryana, but our population is not in the armed forces of Haryana. Representation was more than 10 and will continue, I don't know. Okay, go to the officer level and see and after martyrdom, I am not demeaning my brother from any other country anywhere here, but tell me.  If I am a topper student, then go and check. Check the names of all the members of this sacrifice group of yours who are Para SF in the last five years and in the last 10 years. We have made it easier for them to come to our village when we are there.  He comes as a martyr, does n't it come to the Haryana villages and check or what does it come from, the subject of pain is too much and then you will not understand, then you will say that you are sitting on the road, there is pain everywhere, then  By protesting, reservation is not like that, you cannot join the army like that, farming is not like that, there is no job, but Anam has brought in migration, my state has been kept in Haryana and Agniveer has also been closed here, you will not raise the issue in the elections.  So even if you wake up, you will have to answer, what's the problem, friend, he is a common citizen of S country, I want my best man to fight the enemy, I don't care which province he belongs to. Which caste does he belong to, which religion does he belong to, I want the best there, I do n't want compromise, I don't want the man who comes here with the spirit of a job, the one who comes here with the spirit of service and who can kill the enemy, who has the spirit, who has  There is chaos in which there is aggression in which there is arrogance. I want the best man and this machine. The machine and these machines are doing this. The machine does not win battles. Brothers and sisters, the people of Gujarat do not know this because it is the industrialist who works with the machine. It is the  Man Behind the Machine and Will Win the War for You If the work had been done with machines then this Russia would have finished it, we are also sitting with the machines of Russia, etc. Tell us, look at the condition of Ukraine, Ukraine is defending the motherland, JSP Russia.  Couldn't do it, see, these times are coming like this, we have to save some institutions from failing, we have to save them from becoming political, by meddling one after the other, things are like this.  The institutions that stood up after independence, all of them, all of them have entered into the fray, and they too have been defeated. According to me, the law should be passed. The people of the armed forces, who are the top leadership, should retire within 15 days.  You cannot join a political party for a year, now you will say that you are retired at 60 or 62, so don't come for senior pension till 77 years, if you want to live till 90 years, then 13 years.  Do service and serve. Kife has said that service is to all those who retire, I request them with folded hands, with great respect, you must have licked the feet of the political party of service, you should serve yourself, not your soldiers.  Do service, make an NGO, make an institution for them, you have to do vote bank politics for them, become their leader, where you retire, you go and join this political party, you get some help.  A governor makes you a governor, sometimes he makes you a left and right ambassador, at some places you get an MP from an MP, then they use you and throw you away like a piece of gold, and the rest of the people, whom you had commanded, came here doing just that.  They had come wide open, they look like this, friend, this one also went, this one also went, this is good, that's why he was not speaking for us at that time, because he had to go to this party after two years, how much of a despite and how dirty he was. Politicization of armed forces is going on, this is not right for our country, brothers and sisters. It is not at all right for politics to enter everything, to enter everywhere. This is where the armed forces were kept. The cantonment is a little far away because you are doing this.  Understand, whenever something fails in the country, when the country means everything, then it is said that call the armed forces, they are the last man standing, sometimes the police fails somewhere, the entire law and order fails.  The traveler goes and then he says, I am the military, why is everyone afraid of the military because it is faceless, I know it is above caste and religion and if the bullet is fired, it will be the real one and will kill, that is why everyone is afraid because everyone else becomes straight, tell me the same thing.  Troubles are also taking place at the same place, some rights are being taken at some places, some are happening because they are not being controlled, if the military comes from someone, then it is in their power that everything happens like this, we have to stop that thing.  We have to save something, we have to save that thing in the country, if that thing is not saved, then what if we are going into reverse care, whatever things were right for us, which were going well, what was good, we are ruining that also.  In the short term, brothers and sisters, in the matter of votes and politics, no one is going to speak openly because everyone has some greed or some fear, two things are fear and greed, greed and fear, the world is created by greed and fear.  There is control, this is also a fact, but can we common citizens say to our politicians that dear, leave them, leave them, this is your special child, not in others, it means in good sense, it is okay that all this. They are different people, we are the last man standing above all these things, when the whole country even sings their songs, when the country calls, you see them, look carefully, understand that when they will come, when their  If there is a requirement, everything else has been tried and failed, so we are treating them like this. You will have to spend water, brother, if you have bought a car, you will have to pay for its maintenance, you will have to put petrol in it, if you will have to give insurance, then if there are armed forces, then brother, the country has armed forces.  Let them say that you will have to follow them because if they are there and they are standing then everything is going on, they will not give you money in their wallet. Like others, in our country all the work should be done well, we are standing for it and if we are standing then there should be a proper system, this four year system is very very bad because it hurts the pride, the armed forces, the soldiers and all.  They are fighting for the honor of the platoon and I am telling you another secret, this was done so that if a soldier of that regiment is standing there and he shows cowardice, then for some reason he is fighting on his feet.  If something goes wrong and he turns his back, then his brother, who has come from the same village, caste, religion and region as him, will go to the house and tell so and so that his son was saved because of that fear. That my name should not be tarnished, you came here and basically thought that this is British or this thing was understood by British, you don't understand that this is the pressure of this thing, it is very easy to say that it is for India for India but when they  The bullet is being fired on the forehead, isn't it?  And this is going Shik Shik Shik Then only Apna Kise Kiye To Uke Bera Ho Gujarati Ne To Na Bera Ki Why A Person Fights And Gives Up His Life Very Easy To Tell Yes Bharat Mata To Hai I am not refusing Late is too  Much other emotions at play and we are meddling with those emotions and this channel is for people with some IQ Ye trolls mat aa jana kam IQ wale sare jinne kuch bera  Not only this, what am I trying to tell you, you will fight for the name of your forefather, the country changes its boundaries 5 thousand times in 15,000 years, those who fight for the name of their ancestors, I hope I have been able to explain, if not a little, then I will explain more openly because now the batting is happening openly, time is going on like this, everyone should speak openly, it is okay, if no one is left then they will also tell why this is bad.  Why is it bad? It is playing with emotions and forces are an emotion. You don't medal with the emotions in the name of money. It is okay and if you are not taking money then the government said, I want to drink water, save taxes and increase the price of petrol.  The era of illusion is going on, it will take a little more, it will take a little more. You will be pained to know this, brothers and sisters, that our brothers and sisters of the armed forces are losing their insurance.  They pay the money themselves, do the work of dying and the money they get from that death, they themselves give insurance because in our country there is no one to insure the armed forces, there is no one to do health insurance, it is written that you are not working.  And doing true job, you people know this thing, you people know this thing, you people know this thing, you say no, no, they have a military hospital, brother, they are in trouble like this, oh brother, one of our soldiers should go somewhere.  If he meets with an accident, will he get it in that military hospital within 5 kms? Will he get it in three kilometers? He will have to get his treatment out of his own pocket. He does not have insurance. He does not have health insurance. How will he get it? If he has to get treatment, is there any provision for him?  Will the provision and how to get that also go and check why can't a military person take health insurance if it is very very very very much and something else, there is a lot of pain behind it, it is very easy to say, hey so  You can get cheap liquor in the canteen, along with it you are also suffering from Arthritis, there is some problem in your waist and then some day when you have to listen to the whole thing, if the country is ready to listen then we will tell you because poor people are there.  They ca n't speak, we are like us, we have Guruji, we all know that consultation is happening everywhere, I am a social observer, I see everything of every section, who has what pain, who is the funder.  Who is a hypocrite, who is the earth, who is having fun, who is really lagging behind, who is opening his/her mouth for whom and who is not, and what is happening to whom, commission on Eth is not coming, if it is to come sometime then please tell me sometime.  If he wants to come then he will not come, it is forbidden in the heart, he will not come and brothers and sisters, those who have done Agniveer too, then it is not right, so are you in front of them, I will eat them, so you have made this policy against them.  Stop this against me, stop this and one more thing today I am telling you today through this video I have a claim that my Agniveer scheme will be closed, if not today, if not tomorrow, if not the day after tomorrow, then the day after tomorrow, I will do it, because understanding will come from somewhere. Because Vajpayee ji used to say that there will be elections, parties will come and go, the country should remain, so when it comes to the country, wisdom will also come but someone should be there to explain, it is better than love, sometimes ego becomes too much.  If you had taken a decision then you would have said that if I have to take it, then I am weak. Yes, the country is bigger than your ego. Okay, if I have to take it, I have to take it and no one has to make me naked. Logically please come and understand and my request is arm.  I also know how to give my presentation to some extent. This slide shows the things I have said in the slide. Ishna asked whether you can give it or not. This is the money you have to save. You have to save all the money, how much?  You will save a lot, that's a lot, that's a lot, they do n't stop the pension of MP and MLA, they do elections again and again, one day MLA wins his life long pension and you select MLA for one day, just now this is the election of one MP.  Someone is fighting in Haryana, then their MLA's vacancy will become vacant, he makes it, he gives it, do you know how many MPs and MLAs they have and how much is their fee? Don't know whose pension is open, then close yours. No Agniveer Bandh  Do yours, 73 years, 78 years, 85 years, give us a chance, give us a chance to serve, and 2e sane, retire me, wa bahu kitne la hua hain x Agniveer, we can't take it lightly, this is a very serious thing which I want to  Tell Through My Audience and You Have to Spread This Video It's Your Responsibility Because These Youngsters These Boys  When they come out at four years they are very trade skilled people with this facility we cannot afford to lose them to left right things also that is also a danger because if you don't provide them something than they are father and they are right by the Best Okay So That's Also Possible I'm Not Say Every Buddy Goes This Thing But As a country we have to be very very careful, I trained a boy for four years, after that he doesn't know anything now, so can he get brainwashed, can someone else get him brainwashed, so that is a topic of discussion for definitely  That where do we utilize their skills and how do we utilize and there are as many corporate houses and the rest are parties with an electoral base of Rs 135 crore 1 crore.  She gives 200 crores 300 crores to these parties. Brother, you take care of them, take care that they will be the best employee because if this scheme is not changed then it is the job of the people of the society like us to settle them well by doing publicity for them.  Do it and I will also try from my side that if you are Agniveer and you are retiring and you are not able to understand, then if in my capacity I can do 500 Hajj.  2000 or how many because I also have a circle, I have subscribers, I have people, so I will do as much as I can, whenever your time comes, I will do the best for the people and this is our society which needs it very much, we cannot treat them like security guards. Are the best? Don't pick them up, give them a job of security guard for 15 years. Don't make the mistake of thinking like this because if you do it then that security will also be like a security guard.  You will find people who sit at the border and a madam shouts in the society, yes madam, go and see the viral video of Noida society. Madam comes after drinking alcohol and is shouting at one o'clock in the night. If it is okay to shake the security card, then understand it.  This difference is fine even by mistake, you people do not understand that thing and the educated class is the intellectual class of the society, please discuss, group, discuss everywhere, we have To have a big discussion because this is not the point of discussion. You debate on TV. The person sitting for does not know where he is. The person sitting against does not know. Pick up any figure and remove any figure. If this thing is implemented then the country will benefit.  10 Lakh, 12 Lakh, 15 Lakh Crore, these 10 Lakh, 12 Lakh, 15 Lakh Crore, they just say in any matter, ' Brother, it will cost so much.' Divide it by 150 crores, does anyone have the figure, you are going to become the third world economy, why are you saying, I am also the same, okay, we three will become the third world economy, then the third world economy will be so bad.  The situation is that our arm forces are not visible properly, the ratio of the budget is going like this, increase the budget again, increase the budget again, who told you not to make it a little bigger, then education and health, what flags have you shown in education?  They have buried it, tell me at which place they have buried it, they have buried it inside the infrastructure, they have buried it for the infrastructure, I will tell you the truth about that too someday, then it happens, then if you start telling too much, then you talk too much or do negative things.  All those bunds have been created by taking loans. Which one you have created by earning from your own pocket? Right, Freedom will come at a cost. The country has to be ready to pay the price as you are in your society. There is a lot of emphasis on maintenance charges, but it has to be paid, is n't it? Similarly, here also you will have to pay, if you want then it is fine and you will have to pay and it will have to be discussed and I have ideas and many more.  I know people and intellectuals who have such ideas that even without increasing the pension budget, we can make Agniveer in a better form than the present one, so please listen to people like us, please listen to us.  Well, we have people who will explain all these things that if your pension bill is coming at ₹ 1, then how can we reduce all this while instead of paying ₹ 100, 110, 120 and so on.  This should be removed from Air Force and Navy with immediate effect. Agni Var Ski It is very lean and mean. There are not so many people in Air Force and Navy. You can count.  Try it, if he is 110th from the Army, then he is not that much, he should not be there at all, because he is losing more money than profit because you are not able to give him training on that ship worth Rs. 1500 thousand crores, then why not give him a year.  You ask what are you getting done, what are you doing, then you are giving him the salary, train him from the first day, as soon as his initial training is done, say brother, you will see this radar, you will see this plane, you will see these missiles. You will see, this is a ship, this is a worship ship, all of them are marines, you will go here and by the time itself, after four years of service, he has become a very good warrior, technical warrior or whatever warrior you want to name him. Call it the war fighting potential of the fleet or whatever organization it is, be it Air Force or Navy, it has become a huge backbone of it, if not for years, then just like that.  He is roaming around and then he comes and says, okay, you got selected, come, you are one out of four, go today, now your what is this, so there are experts sitting on this thing, I don't know, they are not getting the platform, if they don't want the platform, then come.  Will give the platform to discuss because of new channel? If not, then if you are an expert in all these things then you can write in the comment section, I will reach out to you and bring the same specifics again.  You will say, yes, we are like this, I have this expertise and I have this and we will do it with that, why not, these videos of mine are watched at a big level, I know the channel is small, so what has happened, it is visible only after two to three months.  If it comes then please share it. Thank you."

    "title": "Air Quality Index And Pollution Pe Charcha [wmeF97Iwv5w].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today we will discuss and try to get clarity on Air Quality Index City Life because you have an idea about Air Quality Index, Delhi NCR is very bad and there is a lot of noise about it, so we will discuss beyond this because the noise is bad. This is a phenomenon of every year, let's discuss something else, okay, we recently saw a video in Punjab in which a government employee is being held and is being set on fire. If you have seen it, please type.  yes there  This is an inner fear factor for the cities, for the city life, for the rich people. The way Hindi movies were made and our country was so intoxicated that you can't even breathe. Delhi is being targeted more in this. While breathing is not being taken even where it is burning, breathing is not being taken even in Rohtak, not being taken even in Fatehabad, not being taken even in Jind and those of your Punjab from Barnala to Sangrur. Take the names of all the districts and Greater Noida of all the places is most affected, then it has come to Delhi like people from outside Rajasthan MP or any other South Indian, it is in Delhi only, yes, it is affected in Delhi, that is why.  It creates a lot of noise because the Prime Minister, President, Supreme Court lawyers, all the MPs, powerful people, rich people, business people, media houses, all are here and then that Chutku Party is here, the Chutku Party used to say that we will do it right.  Now we will give, their party has come there, Chutku party has come in Punjab, you people have done it right, so it is okay to do it right, it is not like that two or three things are additional in this month and it becomes the La-Palooza effect.  Wind does not move, pressure gradient happens differently, everything gets stuck and stubble gets burnt, plus then crackers come, now this debate will come on Diwali also, now they will say, a section will say, oh when our Diwali comes, then crackers should not be burst.  give our  In the name of so much fire, so many firecrackers, how much will you do? Well, it is a thing in India that if something gets ruined or kept dirty, then it is like that, if we spit paan and make it dirty, then it is so bad that it is already kept on some wall.  If this is the situation then I will tell you and spit and how dirty it will be, it is already dirty, we don't do clean things there, this is our problem, now we can't do anything about the pressure grade, yes that cloud is stuck, yes that but brother.  Your construction activities which are grab for norms, we will have to do that activity every time, we have built highways etc. all around, tried to control the traffic, made Kundli Mane Sir Palan, made Eastern Expressway, traffic does not stop and now even odd-even.  We will do it, the vehicles used to run always before, now those plants which provide 11000 mega watt electricity are coal based around 200 in Delhi.  300 kilometers is also a lot for them, there is pollution from them in summer too, it is our moment, we have to consider this thing as a disaster as if flood has come, what can we do now, flood has come, it has come because this is the raita we are spreading. Yes, he is already contributing to it, but the stubble tax that is being denied to the farmers should be stopped. Now who has told the farmers that who decides the time between crops? Till date no one has told this thing, who has explained it?  It is said that the crop will be harvested at this time, sow it at this time and not harvest before that, or why don't they give 20 days leave in this, why are they panicking about harvesting early, this too is done by the government, the government has decided, or the government never came.  Will tell you, there will be many of you who don't know this. Now come and tell me, try everything and I am the All Powerful Mighty My Father who does not have much knowledge by coming against the government. Spreader and this is not just one, it is the rule of all the governments, check it by melting, these purifiers show helplessness, many people have these purifiers installed in their homes, rich people, powerful people, position people, it is difficult to go out but go home.  Inside, their air quality index is only 40, PM 2.5 is only 30, so maybe they check theirs every year, rest of the people might be running away to Goa, some might be going somewhere else.  It happens but this is negative but what I am trying to give is the clarity perspective. I am trying to give that the requirement of the people who live in the city is always that yes friend, I should go alone, stay for a few days, go to a quiet place, decision.  Making a small place but that place is liked only as a tourist brother, whenever you go there for a few days because any good thing is there, today I am going to give so much clarity to the people because in real estate  You also know that I am very passionate about doing research about real estate and spreading my knowledge about it to the people. If there is a good place in India, everyone will like it and then everyone will go and if it is not good then there is no good place in it.  There is nothing good anywhere in India, no, it is good, then tell me the address, two years ' time, then ask, tell me which is the good place. 25 years ago, Gurgaon, which was outside for the people of Delhi, was a very quiet and good place.  agreed  I used to go to Palam Vihar, it was a colony, people used to come, the rates were big, now see what is Palam friend or any other place, everywhere is packed, packed, packed, packed, packed, your Mussoorie, Nainital, Shimla, tell me what is the condition, tell me any other place where once  Once you reach there, build a road which is a good place and till now humans have not reached here because perhaps this road has not been built yet, once you build it, you will reach here also. The people of small towns are people of small places, they are unappreciated.  They give to the cities and are very happy coming to the cities despite the pollution because they get employment opportunity, they get electricity, what is electricity and what is its continuity, when they come to big cities, people come to know about the water supply. Variety Clothing Entertainment Gadgets Accessibility to Education Health Care Now people living in big cities have taken these things for granted. Before crying, brother.  Everything is not available even in New York and in the cities of Australia, there are fires there too, there is pollution, at some places there are tornadoes, at some places there are cyclones, there is problem of date in every month of the year, take any name of the world which  Images come to us of Canadian cities and US cities, the vehicles have to go at a distance of 5 minutes, 10 minutes, you cannot take the vehicle out, if someone has a heart attack, it will take one and a half hour to remove the snow.  I am telling you a practical thing, four is good, somewhere the breath is good, somewhere else is it good, in India you have taken out the car, you have not removed the snow, it has gone in reverse, and there the car is slipping on the road, so here I am telling someone about it.  He is not giving it, I am speaking here on the exit route, my work remains the same, there is only one level of crying, to stop it, this thing is probably not in our control, so tell me one thing, where the Chief lives, things are fine.  This should happen where the President resides, where everything is in the hands of the Supreme Court. Anyone can file a PIL, do something, stop it, and the Supreme Court immediately comes, now they think that the government should take care of it.  If there is no cure, then brother, you got the school holidays done, you did a very good job, do the school from home, do the office from home as well. Brother, tell me, the country is not in our control. When we can't breathe here, then there is only one person who can go out.  nickel bread  If you want to earn a living, he will do it, but rest of you think about it, this Covid type work is done, you stay in your house, just not as strictly as it was at that time, assuming the same and doing everything but you can stay at home because we have failed.  In doing what ever duties have become its failure of government, if the state is the government, then the center can make its own rules, but what is the point of politics, the center is there, it is good, I am not able to breathe. Yes, it was not coming even before Sheila Dikshit's government, when the buses used to run, then they did CNG, earlier this one QI was nothing, earlier one QI was like this, if the face is black then one QI is bad, that.  Was the one QI, there was a time like this, at that time it would have been only 900, which nowadays we get torn between 400, 500, it would have crossed it at that time because you used to go on a motorcycle. So the mouth used to be visible when the motorcyclists used to go, the helmet glass was also completely black, the mouth was also black below that. You people must have seen the old times in Delhi and so many factories and this was a lot. It turned out to be a period of 25 years.  There has been a lot of improvement, but after that improvement, this is the situation that happened and there is still a lot of scope for improvement, let alone the vehicles. Now what is the point that this situation is because of the vehicles.  No, the circumstances are also very natural but now we can reduce what is in our hands. Is it a lot of fun to burst crackers on Diwali? I know, there should be freedom and it should be repeated again and again in any festival or religion.  And linking with it is also not a very good thing, according to me there should be a lot of firecrackers, there should be green firecrackers, burn a lot, make the light white and be happy, although it has nothing to do with Diwali and the festival of Diwali and religion. Actually, it has nothing to do with sentiment and that thing because when Ram ji came, there were few firecrackers. When Ram ji actually came to Ayodhya, only lamps were lit and there were no lights, but still I am not against firecrackers.  I mean, if there is happiness, then people play it in happiness, it is okay, it should be played, even if India wins the match, it should be played, but friend, which one should be played?  Now see, can there be anything there, can there be a limit beyond that or can there be something like that, run one or two in the name of Shraddha, run five in the name of Shagan, can there be any self control because  What happens to many people, what happens to many people when a man says no, ban something, then it becomes more fun, for some people this is also a big problem, according to the rules, this should not happen, I am not able to breathe from inside the full shower. They are coming out, those black ones  The ones with lead and which oxide, nitrogen, sulfur dioxide and I don't know in English, Barium, Varium, all the chemicals, I will not take a chemistry class, but things are bad, either those you call green crackers are expensive or their whispering sound is fun.  I don't know about them, it's okay, the colors don't come out, either you apply them or you reduce them, it's okay, but if you try to ban it too much, then people will play around with it by saying that you have done it to us, we don't do it like this.  We don't do it like this, oh brother, what to do now, this is the time when the air quality has to be like this, the wind has to be like this and all the things have to be like this, so there is a lot of it in this.  Telling someone that this is everyone's failure can be one approach, the government should say, the other can be that do whatever is in your power, brother, don't call me to the office, let me work from home, give children school holidays, be your own.  And yes, one month at a time  Look, this stubble lasts for 15 days, 20 days, isn't it, when it is 1015 days, it is a big terror, this thing is fine, even after that, it does not mean that it will be completely cured, but it will not be so bad, so this problem is of 15 to 30 days, but  We have to see whether it is such a problem that so many memes are created here because the rest of the activities are happening here, you cannot go and duplicate them anywhere else, but what is the point of this?  It is possible that you can go down in the happiness index by causing trouble to your own life, this is bad, that is bad, everything is bad because everyone has the choice, brother, if not you are enjoying here then you go and then this population. Brother, why is the population of Delhi increasing? Why is the population of Gurgaon increasing? Why is the population of Noida increasing? This is a useless place, you ca n't breathe, everything else is fine, you can't breathe, only here you can breathe.  If it doesn't come, then why are people coming, why don't they stay in the chamber, where they were born, this is also a matter of thinking and where it is being burnt, then what can we say about Switzerland, has it become the farmer you tell me about?  The fire of stubble did such a thing here and it burnt it there, nothing is happening in the environment there, nothing is happening at all, yes, nothing is happening, he thought, oh brother, there is no air there either. Such  Same thing is happening there too and all the farmers do not sit for a day, sometimes someone is harvesting the crop, sometimes someone is harvesting it, sometimes someone else is harvesting it. If you go and see in the village, 20 of them used to go, what do they say, in Haryana, they are defeated and move on.  These are going on, they are going on incidentally in the streets and everywhere else, I believe these coal vendors who make tandoori rotis must have stopped by now, otherwise people are also burning garbage and this waste burning.  The government itself is saying that these big destroyers should do something else, the contribution of pollution from everything is at 3 4 5 6 7 8, 100% pollution happens, it is okay, then later it may be more due to environmental factors.  The stubble is contributing late but the stubble will only do it for 15 days brother, what will happen after that then all the things which are called your roads. That if you vacuum clean four times, then the pollution will be reduced by doing something like this, but why don't you do it? There are no vehicles, why don't they do it? If the state government creates an uproar once, then why don't you speak to them before voting for them? Why don't some corporation or some place come and ask why don't you people fix your micro environment? Suppose the government is sleeping, then will we do anything of our own? Not the government, sir, this is not what the government is doing brother, it is not the intention of the government. Every person can do this by pouring water over the trees and sprinkling water around his house and if every person does a little bit, it will make a big difference. If you sprinkle some water on the trees in front of your house, then that  All the dust and soil comes down under them and they breathe, first once the trees breathe, then they will breathe to you because the situation becomes such that if you look at the trees and leaves, they become in bad condition and then your road will be in a bad condition. put water on it a little beyond that vacuum  If you do the cleaning, then all these things are in your hands, this one is also not doing that, because what is the point, blame Diwali, blame the firecrackers, blame the stubble, 20 days pass, what is the need to work because the rest  If you control the contributing factors of work, it will make a difference, but it involves hard work and money, so just vent out all your anger there. Farmer says, brother, I also have to earn my money, I too have to buy my mobile phone.  Come, will these people of the city buy me too to do all the work? Well, it is okay where it is, and it is okay to catch a government employee and do it like this. From inside also comes that friend, what is this, we will take discipline, we will do it.  They will mean it from inside and you see inside the video, you came to extinguish the fire with your hand, just think mindset, how much irritation is there from inside, otherwise you recorded it too, just imagine, brother, you do the scandal quietly.  That poor guy, just like me, I was feeling so much for that government apple. Had I been anyone else, the poor guy would have cried. It was that bad scene to see and still I do n't know what the government will do and we all should.  Follow that because, if this is the status of the government people, then what is there to do by going, I have already beaten the government employees by making them sit, come and you will set fire to them. It must have fallen too much, it's fine like this and it's very sad, it's fine, but what politics is involved in it because it is a one party government, you tell him, he will say something, he will say this and then people also know.  The person who is doing this and is so arrogant also knows that he will uproot me, okay, we are the vote bank, it is our government, the day the morale of the government employees becomes low, then do it like this. Lena ane ye that scene it itself is a scene of why we are in this state and mes understand ts we started the video with that and I am ending the video with this that this is the reason that state that of that thing which is the state which This is the main area in which we have entered the situation and in this, oh do it like this, do it that way, when others were sitting there, even the law was back, they had made it so easy.  If it is a little, then until the public does not speak, the public will not control the public and everything will be left to the politicians and the government, this will be the situation and the day the public will take it upon themselves, I will say who was talking nonsense, who was doing what nonsense.  This is happening and there is an uproar over it, then those people will know what should be done and what should not be done. That is the message so you should all spread this and try to raise the issue and do  What ever is in your hand Little bit that little bit that sprinkling two buckets of water every day around your micro environment will make a lot of difference sprinkling two to three buckets of water every day around your micro environment will make a lot of difference Planting trees around you will make a difference Try not to go out Try not to burst too many crackers I am very against  Stopping firecrackers is something I am against too, my friend, don't ban it, but tell yourself not to do it, because what happens when you ban it, many people become like this from within, if you have banned it, I will definitely use it.  There should be control among ourselves or after a little shagana, if you find a green cracker then put it on yours, it's okay, it's a festival, I also know that there are sentiments, although it has nothing to do with it. Because I am an astrologer also but disappointed, I am saying that I am happy that you want to do it. It has been historic ever since the country got independence. We remember from our childhood that firecrackers were not burst 500 years ago on Diwali, nor were they burst 400 years ago.  But let's ring it now, no problem, if you want to celebrate then do it in the name of Sagan, reduce it, do it with a joint, do it with a green cracker and if you can't breathe at all  Well, I do n't feel like eating because this is the air, I don't even feel like eating, and for people like me, we have to eat during the festival. It's okay that the festival is coming, so we will eat 10 types of sweets and 15 types of dishes.  If you eat, then I am saying that friend, find happiness even in getting a little food, then it is okay, but if you eat too much, it is Diwali of 12th on 10th and 11th, then breathing is getting disturbed on 10th and 11th.  If you agree, brother, be a little careful, this is my request to all the athletes to listen to me, how did you guys like the video, please share, thank you very much."

    "title": "Airlines and Airport Chaos In January [jTsEoCH72jY].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today we will discuss Airlines and the Crisis in the month of January, which is what you saw recently, we will discuss this topic, I discuss from Higher Order Thinking, you are my subscribers who listen, what can you do in it and what can you learn. You have seen that recently a report came that a passenger of an airline was jumping and killing him, so that news has been made, you all know about it, so here I am neither defending the airline nor him.  I am neither defending nor accusing anyone, I am trying to give some information about how things are happening through this video, it is being played out according to aviation and now let's see that.  What can you do, I will suggest from my side what you can do, then you tell me whether it is a right thing or a wrong thing. At the time of Covid, we all were helpless, all the shops were closed, which means everyone of life came to their homes.  And life still went on, good and bad.  It went on as it went on, now suddenly many times have passed, we again take the things of nature for granted, without realizing that what is this fog, it means that the car is not moving, a little distance is needed even to move on the highway, there is a plane here. Talking about delay is something called RVR, the distance I should see on the runway is approximately 75 meters for landing and 125 meters for take off. The center line is  etc. but there is CAT in it, this is I will not get too technical but I would like to tell that this is happening because this is airlines, airport, management, in a way the truth is not being told, ideally speaking, know, there is fog.  So flights should be canceled and rescheduled or reduced. Ideally speaking, you also want to take the 5 o'clock flight only because the tickets are less. So you want to go at 11 o'clock or 12 o'clock, why don't you take the flight, it is expensive, it is a convenient time or why don't you go in the evening because you will have to stay in a hotel there, then understand that people also save money somewhere.  If the airlines want to do that then they are keeping all the things inside the airport, called terminals, where people sit, then there will be a lot of crowd, that is one second thing is that when the passengers security.  After checking, they sit inside and the plane closes the doors, he says no, the captain says close all the doors, then he can ask permission from ATC and come to the queue, now as soon as the visibility improves, a little sunlight comes out, then knock knock knock.  Now many times what happens is that 50, 60, 100 people get stuck in the plane line, as if the vehicles do not stop in front of the toll tax, then if you people are not allowed to sit in it and you  If you are sitting at the terminal, then the flight is bound to get delayed and longer because the door which will be closed which is first come first serve, the start up permission and the taxi permission are sought in the same order in which all those cubes are asked. Suppose all of us are together and are not moving anywhere right now because there is too much fog so we cannot go anywhere, everyone is standing like this, it is okay in beige, we are standing like this, then people entered inside it and did that and closed it, then this Now the rules will be there first.  That some changes will come and should come because according to me, the biggest problem is that if the going is being delayed then doesn't the passenger sitting inside have the right to take me out, I can't breathe, I'm getting irritated. I am having a headache and I am having some anger issues. Please throw me out. I am not going to go. Keep my ticket money too and throw me out. There should be some cut offs for athletes like this because  Because what is happening, how to sit in the plane for four, four, five, six hours, what food and entertainment and everything is going on there, all those things of such a tight economy class, some child is crying in the middle and the noise and noise inside is disgusting. As soon as the battery of the mobile starts getting drained, the human being also starts getting like that because one hour, two hours, three hours, now in the winter time, you are sitting like this, somehow then what will happen next, it is okay, but then the weather is bad.  does not happen in winter  It is bad, this is also a problem, okay then there should be a cut off because they say that they are not telling the reason, oh the reason is as simple as the ship, no airline earns money by keeping the plane on the ground, if the plane is flying then  There is money. The more the ship stays in the air, the more money it will earn. Just like an auto rickshaw, if it keeps moving on the road, it will earn money. It is standing in the garage and not moving anywhere. He is sleeping under a tree. He is not earning money alone like this. So what is here, the entire juice of the plane is taken out, the crew keeps changing, well, one thing that is not mentioned in this is the new airlines or the airlines which are very spread out and have taken over, so many  The ratings of the captains may be such that according to the weather minima, they cannot fly the plane because now their experience is not that much, their qualification is not that much and some airlines which were old legacy airlines are there.  The commander is sitting there and he says yes, yes, it's okay, we will make you land at 75 meters also, we will make you land at 100th century also, many do not have that one, so now all these details are technical details, there is no way of knowing that yes also, who is my pilot?  I am coming, for how much will it cost, will it cost, these inner things happen, okay, when you select the ticket for that day, at that time you do n't have anyone to check who is blowing the air, how is the weather.  If this happens then all these things can definitely be improved but everywhere in every country this is called pile up or pile up happens and the schedule gets completely spoiled and what is the matter with that, the weather is good in Mumbai but from here  If you don't even take off, you will have to come back from Mumbai. Passengers from Mumbai are also stuck who have to come to Delhi, so when they get delayed for so many hours and even inside the trains, you are getting to know about it, but this is what is happening in the train.  we will walk slowly one by one  They will be lagging behind, there is an hour's delay, so they are sleeping in it. In the train, that work is different, but what is inside the ship, first of all, the people of the ship become a little rich people and where the rich people have problems, the rich people have problems.  It starts happening, there is a lot of traffic there, you know, you do it like this, you go to the terminal, you can only see something, you can see something, people can't see anything, and then go, go, go.  Can't see even 100 meters  If you see 100 then brother will definitely take out 100 and a quarter. Whatever he is seeing, the pilot is having a lot of fun. Sitting in the cockpit, he is also looking at the mobile like you. Hey, we give him coffee. Yes, this is the difference, he has coffee.  Poor guy gets it fine but as soon as his duties are completed today, another pilot is needed. The management here seems to be bad. Many airlines are anticipating this and it's been hours. Now those hours are over. Now this is a plane. Can't fly, now the weather is clearing but his duties are over, now when will the new one come? If the new one had to go beyond that, then call him, wake him up, if he was not on duty, then he is already in these times. Whatever is the duty roster, I am sure it can be done easily, but he is not going, that is why it is so tight, he should stand there exactly the same, first he should come 15 minutes earlier, instead of replacement, now you know that.  It cannot fly, the one who is supposed to fly has not come and the passengers are saying that and the airlines are telling the passengers with raised hands like this, at the time of ticket, brother, from 1st to 31st, we do not know, it is okay, it will fly, it will not fly, it will fly late, it will cancel.  Hoga tell do a bola nahi jaata we will we will update you we will update you respect and updating they are asking ATC why nonsense ATC asked me again and again the address is fog  If it is clear then they will send it. Now those ATC people say like this. The pilot tells the air hostess that the poor air hostess is waiting, the crew is waiting and the girls are like our women, daughters are standing and all the frustrations of the passenger's life are there for them.  I have to take time when my meeting is getting late, why are you not coming to your meeting? You were not going to become a tycoon anyway, if you were such a tycoon, you would have gone on a private charter.  Had you been there and that private charter also doesn't take off, okay no, I will take the best pilot, hey, even in the best one, Rs 100.15 is required, it is required in all, okay, if you were so rich, you would have been going in your charter. You are traveling in economy class, you are not that great, the one who slapped you was going on honeymoon, that boy is 28 years old, it is fine, Goa honey, honeymoon turned out great, it is his, it is to me, to the wife.  He comes saying that I mean, I don't mean, I am married, such an aggressive husband, hey brother, wait, are you in such a hurry, honey is moaning okay or no, I have to go, he is not going to get slapped, so is there any defense for him? No, it is fine, but sometimes what happens is that in slap incidents, all the irregularities of the airline are hidden, which runway you have to operate, which one is not activated, then it is like there is a problem with the government.  If it comes to this, nowadays you can't say it, do you know this thing, don't say it like that and that's the issue, P rate passengers, E rate passengers are also a flight safety is a problem, why should such a situation be created then what is mental. Screening of passengers along with luggage will also have to be done, ' Brother, what is the Thrush Hold Level? You define what is the Thrush Hold Level, you say that if someone is in the flight.  If the passengers are sitting for one hour or two, that's it, that's it, then she will go tomorrow or later, let's see what would have happened if she sat for half an hour and 20 minutes and then it's just 15 minutes, now one more hour, so passengers, I mean.  What do you mean, what is this joke, now on what basis are you speaking for 15-20 minutes, do you know when the focus is going to be cleared, now after that, what is your internal, what is the level of the crew, and this is  That is not being managed because you, the pilot, this is another big thing, I am telling you that the pilots are being treated like they are the drivers of Ube Rolla. Okay, now the driver of Ube Rolla also has to sleep. Okay, so those are the limits here.  It's all sugarcane juice. The pilots do n't increase their salaries that much. The pilots don't take that much from their pockets. What is an airline? An airline is also a car, it's like a taxi. There is a driver's salary in it.  You can call him a pilot, the other part of yours is oil, water and maintenance, the rest is the profit from the ticket, the less you rub it, the more you will pay less, because the ticket is directly in his pocket and the oil is being used, which is required to be used, it is okay.  If the pilot is kept more then the pilot will be relaxed, now he has a thrash hod level, the government should reduce it further. I think it is okay not to rub so much.  80 ars, 100 or 60 ars, you have already paid for the flying time but the rest is also a hassle, reporting time, first come medical, then go back, then get stuck in the traffic jam, then what is the point of that taxi, what is the point of body tax toll in that, if the citizens are kept in safety.  We have to stay but what is there here, it is all a game of tickets and money that now the ticket price has to be kept less than these things so that if the ticket price increases because all these pilots will come, increase the ticket by Rs. 000.  Very good and pilots will come and take the trade ones, take the best ones, brother, what is life? The more dollop of sugar you add, the sweeter will be the kheer, okay, it is as simple as that, but tell these things transparently to the people, instead of operational operation, what operation?  What are your operations? What can't you tell? Is this a secret operation of the army or ca n't be explained? Is it an airline? Is it a civil airline? Are you going from one place to another? What are you doing because yours, tell me.  The airline should tell the display, we have so many pilots, we have so many planes, our pilot to a cockpit or pilot to aircraft ratio is like every builder should tell or people, we find out that even within 10 acres you are bringing 600 flats.  So the density is 60 acres per flat. Now, if this many people are from BH, then this many people will live in it, then the density will come out to be this much. You should know everything - product, service, smile in everything.  Smile and say what's happening, we are clueless, we don't know anything, just like you don't know, I too don't know anything. Speak clearly, wearing a mask of professionalism in such a way that I am in.  Control but I don't know how to say the same thing in English to irritate the guy by being so evasive. Friend, I do n't know how, now I too have got hit badly here, where did you come from?  I have to go, I also have to go home, my shift is also ending, my child is also crying, I have stomach ache in my house too, my maid is also asking when will I come and the food has not been prepared, my husband is struggling.  Talk normally like this, friend, talk normally because that much you will smile in the service industry, if you do this then people will do the same, the bad condition of Indians is clearly there, the athletic employees are the ones who give them  Tell those who are managing, brother, the passengers in this plane have to bear the brunt of it, you are sitting there in your corporate office, you are planning to extract all the juice, plan in such a way that a plane just lands and is clean, have you seen an airline?  Isn't it already? Those passengers have not yet deboarded the plane, the next ones are already standing, the cleaning will be done, they will be standing here for 15-20 minutes and the bus leaves them and goes away, like this in such cold. This is what is happening: Passengers want so much efficiency, they need so much timing, so correct, why are you doing such and such, for a little half an hour and a quarter, I am telling you this much in India, I am telling you again and again, in our country no one is doing this much work. We are not so great in productivity, what do we say, no one can wait for half an hour, he pretends to be a passenger, he is outside, where is he, after sitting inside, he becomes a tiger and says that you have ruined my life.  Here the efficiency is reduced for half an hour in the cold. Winds come and there are many winds. The one standing on the tarmac at the airport does not come in normal houses, it remains all around in the buildings, there it is completely open, you are also sitting in the jacket jucker.  Yes, you are sitting with everything but he cannot actually sit with so many clothes and then when you are standing outside and then you are sitting inside for three hours, then tell me, you had to sit inside only for three hours, so you were comfortable here.  If I had brought it, I would have sat inside only for one and a half hour, it is too much of a cut throat for the margins and for the sake of this whole business that if our ship leaves and there is weather, then why would we sit in this, neither do I want to wait for one of ours.  The name of the airline is the same but the ownership has changed. Well, where the Maharaja's photo used to be, it was there. Those were different times, they had different stops. Flying that airline is what ever was the best thing in life.  What are you waiting for? Why are you in such a hurry? The plane will fly, sit on time, drink coffee, because whatever you see, you will have to wait at the terminal, even if you have to wait for four, five, six hours. This is an easy situation. You have a washroom, the proper one is on the plane. No, it means that it is okay to keep hitting the corner and after using it so much, then that issue will arise from it, this is your normal terminal, go comfortably, there is tea, coffee, magazine, newspaper, you can take a walk like this.  You are fine, you can do like this, you can do something, I made you sit in the plane like this, I want to tell you a simple solution to this, everyone who is my subscriber, listen brother, from the first time in life, 20th January, 20th January, don't go anywhere, don't plan.  Do this, you cannot do this problem, like whatever Hindi movie is released in the last 15 years, other than Uri, The Surgical Strike, all are flops, no one goes to see it or in such cold. No one leaves after 10 15 20 January etc. In the beginning, these were some South Indian movies, okay, a little bit went on, but generally Hindi movies are not available and Merry Christmas came, no one saw that too, it was fine but if no one watches it then many  Make things your own rules brother, don't know, we are having that meeting brother, you can do it on Zoom, just think about it, Covid has come, neither did we go through Covid for 15 days nor did we go for one or two years, nor did the world behave like this, do it like this, not at the same time.  If you have to go roaming around, then brother, then you will have to bear the hardships. The film star who has to shoot has to go, the one who cannot avoid such things has to go, you are a private individual, so go within your capacity.  Avoid wandering around at that time because what experience is left. Go on fighting and quarreling. Now tell me no, no, you had to go for honeymoon, so you cannot wait for marriage. Yes, honeymoon can be done a little further and later too.  It is possible that you may postpone the date of marriage or delay the honeymoon for a while and then go away, or the honeymoon may remain the same for a little while, definitely find a resort here, whatever work you have to do on the honeymoon, those things can be done anywhere, the rest is for sightseeing.  Time comes differently, go for a walk after one or two years, I sometimes teach you these things on Marital Sut Sangola Sutra, okay, there is no need for so much aggression, this is the name of the trip, 10 12 These are 15 days, these people have given some details like this, you cannot do anything about the weather, and then why should I treat each other like this, if I am in the supposed control of things, then I say brother, listen, this weather says it is fog.  The conditions can be predicted for 3-4 days. Tell your brother straight away that the flight is not being canceled because of the weather. You should come 90 minutes or 120 minutes earlier, then you will have to come because you will have to worry about it.  Once you are put inside, then you are put in the tar mac again and then the screening has to be done. CISF people will be involved in it again. The ground crew will also have to struggle again. The ground crew says put it off because everyone will drink their tea. They want to do the checking with CISF like this. Brother, you will come out again and again, then you will go again and then all your checking will be done. The entire ship is checked completely, there are protocols, so that too takes a lot of effort and time. Many people try to avoid it. But what I want to tell all the passengers is that brother is not your captain, he is your life, your life is in his hands, he is taking a lot of responsibility, that is, I am saying that the DT driver should show his respect to the Haryana Roadways driver.  If there is any problem, he is a little polite, so you will help him. I am telling you that in Haryana Roadways, there is a conductor and a driver, if you get into trouble then take it and see.  The bus and the passengers have to go on one side, 60 is fine, he is driving that car of yours or why are you spoiling his mind, the car means DT, I am talking at the bus level, here is a plane and 15 million things can go wrong in it. You will have to give him respect and it is not given to you and you will treat him like that. What I am saying is that you have to give respect to your taxi driver and if you have to give it to him then the pilot is a man who has spent Rs. 1.5 crores.  I agree, you have to pass the exam, it takes a lot of brain and it is not an easy thing, it is a very technical thing, ask you Bernoulli's theorem, you do n't know it, it's okay and you just gave money and sat anywhere that if I gave you the money then  It is my right, it is not like this, don't travel, if you are such a bigot, then take a charter and if you eat the charter, he will also go in it. The only thing that matters about the charter is that he is a bigot, that he is sitting.  And he is taking clearance, when the weather is clear, then he will call Saheb, Saheb will leave from then till then he sits comfortably, he does not sit tightly in the charter, he spends one or two hours moving up and down, that's the difference.  Other wise it is a level playing field brother, if the weather is bad then even the Prime Minister's plane cannot fly. It has to be understood that if the weather is bad then he will not go. Even if some VIP's plane gets priority and so on.  If the weather is bad then the weather is bad for everyone and if you people don't understand such a basic thing and make noise like this then it shows what is the level of the country because now everyone will start traveling or my Nah, I myself feel that when I say some things that they can be mistaken as classist but it is the same thing that railway stations will be converted into airports, now I do n't know how many of them have been built but airports have definitely started looking like railway stations.  OK we  I am not blaming anyone for this, the economy is doing very well, hence the number of people has increased. I will do a calculation and tell you. Okay, the collection of made is made made, you listen. Now I am telling you that there are no classes in this. Why is it so tight and this is a very good sector, if you look at it in a different way, a maid has to go to Kolkata. From Kolkata, she has to go somewhere further in Bengal, Malda etc. I am giving the example of Gurgaon.  Actual example so from me now I am into aviation in various capacities ok so tell me sir how much will you get this ticket from Delhi and looking now look classes classes to koi hota nahi but you are also taken by surprise na when the made ask  That if I want to go in the ship then you are like good and then you understand the logic and reasoning and then you are like my India is changing and progressing  And these are economic indicators and you feel very happy also because I told him completely, I explained it completely well, I said, look, if you buy the ticket first, it will cost you this much, it becomes very expensive on the last day, so how much will it cost, if the ticket is on time.  If it is done then it can be quite low, okay, when this was asked to me, it was a little less, then if you book tickets up to Rs. 1.5 two months in advance, then it would be possible, okay, so he did some calculations and  Said that it will be beneficial then how come her husband is an auto rickshaw driver They said that if their days are saved because they come by train, the journey is tiring, they cannot work the next day, they are coming a day earlier  After doing some calculations, he told me that if his travel expenses amount to Rs. 9000 and if two people do the same, it will come to Rs. 0000, then he will save almost that much because of him.  He won't have to take that much leave, his auto rickshaw income is also around Rs 000, like that would be enough for him in a day, plus that thrill of sitting in an aircraft for the first time and then seeing the airport and all that and his economic sense, it's made for.  It was a rough calculation, I can't remember the exact figure so I was like wow they are also thinking that way and now brother then that if  If you are coming here, then there will be no crowd, there will be a lot of crowd because now you tell me how much lower you have to make than this, now below that, the maids who are cooks etc. are earning decent money and they too are getting deducted money on holidays. To save his two days, two days to three days are saved. If you count the time of commuting, then three days are saved. So, he calculated that the combined earning of my husband and me will be Almost be like this plus, my body is not broken in the train. If I do this and that in the train reservation, then everyone has a mobile phone. It is okay and this is the poetry of the people. These people are not like that you have to ask your daughter-in-law, leave is canceled at the last moment. Most of the middle class will plan their travel so much in advance because they are not sure because they are not sure if something happens to the 100 king's subjects.  The country is changing and of course they are not the ones who misbehave, they will be the last ones, no one is saying here that I am never suggesting through this video that the level has become low for those who misbehave. No, their level is not low, their level is somewhere in the middle, I am not saying this, it is here too, those below are doing it for the first time, so poor people, Jahan said as if they sat down, sat down quietly. They don't have any problem, the only problem is those who are roaming around with a sense of entitlement. They want everything to be open, they don't know what is happening, so why do n't you tell me if such passengers sit. In the plane and the plane is flying in the air and Allah is making noise, then it means it is like a very problematic thing. Okay, so it should definitely be screened and there should be some kind of procedures and according to me, brother.  You will not go anywhere for 15 days in winter, you will not get hit, it is not necessary to go anywhere, it is okay to go from here to there, then go from there to there and not from there, it cannot be avoided like this, hey everyone, Covid has told me what nonsense you say.  If you can stay for 2 years then what happened in 15 days, do meetings on zoom, travel back and forth, move your time, why do you have to go at the same time, then if they themselves, people will think that friend, if you know some place where there is terrible traffic.  There is going to be a jam of 10 122 hours, so it is necessary to get trapped. I am sure that no one will get trapped. Anyone who has had this experience of 1015 days, ask them right now whether they will travel at this time next year or not, then I will say this.  It is not necessary to fall into the pit to gain knowledge, it can be done by others also and no matter how much you cut it, that is not the issue brother, even for the cat.  1.25 meter is needed, 75 meters is needed there too, something is needed there also, not just like that, it doesn't work even at absolute zero, it's okay, as much as you want, and that's yours, those vehicles that run, the bus that comes to pick you up at the airport, that's it.  Ca n't see at all. Suppose he is sitting in the bus. It has happened with many people that 75 minutes less visibility of landing runway is required, less visibility of take off is required. Why should I want it? I won't go but if I want.  You  Someone has landed, now they are not able to enter inside, they are not able to park because earlier there are so many planes standing there, it is like they do not go to the bus stand, the buses are standing so much, the bus from outside came, it cannot enter inside now.  This is not a bus stand or the outside one, like in Sector 12 in Gurgaon, even the key cannot open inside, so the outsider got down, he did not catch the auto and went, this is the airport area which is completely sanitized, so if your plane has arrived and that taxi  back up  If you can't seem to accept then poor guy is standing there, look at his condition, he can't fight and come out, so it's tight, it's tight, and it can be managed well by just cutting the flights, brother, no, it's not necessary to fly, tell me.  And the way they say that if they give a disclaimer, be it from the government, from the airlines or from anyone like the airport authority, it will be like this in time, if you have to bear the brunt of it, then it is okay to have parathas from your home.  Come on, we just saw a photo where people are sitting and eating food at the airport and the airlines were fined Rs 1 crore and the airport authority was fined, hey, you are eating food there, you throw it there, you will become AOD, friend foreign.  Object Dum, it will take the plane, it means that it has to be like this, it is literally a bus stand, I am telling you, this is what they are saying, whether an airport should be a railway station or a bus stand, whether an airport should be made or not, they say that Bihar is in Bihar.  belonged to Lalu  No, what do they say, should I make Japan Bihar or should I make Bihar Japan? There was some kind of joke like this, I do n't remember but it was that kind of joke that brother, now if you go to the airport, the feeling is coming there.  All of them are sitting like this, doing a relaxing programme. Okay, then someone from outside the country will come and say, come and visit our country. I mean, they will say, 'Friend, what are you doing, okay, the population has increased, the hobby of traveling has increased.'  or ship  Is it too much or less or what is the matter, is it okay then this much cost is not right in my opinion, then please share, like the video and subscribe to the channel, I have also started the membership of this channel, if you appreciate the video.  If I am telling through this medium, we will do some discussion webinars on these current topics, how the country is changing, what can we benefit from it, what are the current events, what is the meaning of elections, by discussing over good tea.  The name of its membership is Chai Pe Charcha, any day it will be at tea time, it may be in the evening time, it may be Friday, Saturday, sometimes it may be at tea time, like the word Saturday is decent time, if it is a holiday, then the meaning in it is that you will like it, I will also like it.  Talking, discussing, if it is a discussion over tea, then there is discussion. There will be discussion from both the sides. You will not enjoy it as much as you watch debates and all this on TV, because my videos and my content are practical and I  No one takes sides according to the agenda whether it is good or bad, all people are doing their work, everyone sees their own benefit and this is how life is, it is okay and you cannot change it too much, it is okay instead you decide on your own. And avoid taking calls for 15-20 days. I think it is a better thing. Thank you very much."

    "content": "Hello friends, I have given ports, I have given airports, this becomes an election issue, it creates ruckus in between, I consider myself middle class audience which is my core audience, I will redefine it a little towards upper middle class and discuss with them on this topic.  I would like to do so, please share it openly in the comment section. Here I am not a spokesperson for anyone, nor am I batting on behalf of anyone. If you have any such type of conflict in your mind, then share it with me.  I am trying to relax. Recently we have heard a lot that if we give him the airport, then the management of the airport is given to him. Let's take the example of Adani ji, he was not the first one to give it. Who manages the Delhi airport? Tell me who manages the other airports. Manages, tell us how many total airports are there in India. Those who know should write in the comment section, because speaking like this does not level you up. Please tell me. You should have awareness in the comment section. You write how many total airports are there in India today, how many were there 10 years ago, how has it increased in last 10 years, then the contracts awarded to them are given to the lowest bidder in a transparent manner. If you know in a transmitted manner that these airports are Just given it, come and take me, tell me which airport it is not by saying that it is not a transparent marina, I am saying that all the bidders given in a transparent manner were the ones.  They bid and that is one second thing for them, I would like to ask the general public, your son and daughter were not bidding, it was not that if they had not got it, your son would have got it, only some other rich businessman would have got it, was he that rich? Being a businessman, he does not have a lawyer. If he feels that something is wrong, can he not go to the court? Can't he complain, because if it were so, then he needs to do it because he will be the one who will directly get kicked in the stomach. No  Not everyone does this, everyone is afraid, well, everyone is afraid. What I want to tell people is that there is so much opportunity in India, there is so much opportunity for work that people have come here up to their noses to do that work. There is not only money, but there are many places right now.  Ports need to be built, Airports need to be built, Roads are needed, but there should be money also to bid there. Suppose, I am a friend and you are a king. Okay, and you king gives everything to your friend.  If it is, then you need time to chew it, don't you? I am telling you by taking an extreme example, it cannot be known just like that, what I am saying is that no matter how many people you give it to, everyone still has a chance, but no contract is missed, brothers and sisters.  It is written in the qualification requirement that the turnover is Rs. 1 crore, how much experience has been made before, how much balance sheet is there, whether one has the capacity to take loan or not.  They say that no, these loans have been provided, loans have been given, so you should also have the ability to repay the loan, you can go and take a loan of one crore rupees, if your salary is Rs 40,000, just see, we will not get it from anywhere.  They don't get it but they got it, they have so much business in it, why are you focusing your mind on those worth thousands of crores, if you want to compete then do it with your brother-in-law, with your sister-in-law's husband, with your brother, with your sister.  Do it with your husband, do it with your brother-in-law, do it with your relatives because you will get happiness only by defeating them. You are not going to get happiness by defeating Adhani ji and Ambani because you are not in competition and cannot defeat them. The reason for your sadness is that your  Wife says, my brother-in-law is intelligent or my uncle, uncle is intelligent and that frustration of yours is coming out on Adani ji, I know it, I come and apply chilli.  People have a lot of fun in my videos, those who enjoy them enjoy it and those who don't enjoy it, they feel pain, so this is a good thing, I feel that emotions are aroused within the content, something like Ted Stock.  He did not come like this and said in a roundabout way that the journey of my life has come and I have become that, brother, what is the use of this, I am giving you that feeling from your mind, there is pain in the nerves, the air pressure has increased, the air pressure has increased. Because ever since I gave it to you, air fares have increased. I say this because I have some connection with aviation. If I understand it, I give you knowledge beyond that. First, let's discuss what is causation and correlation. [ __ ] in the morning.  At 5:1 o'clock he said 'cuckoo' and the sun has risen. Many people think that if a [ __ ] crows then the sun rises or at least a [ __ ] can also misunderstand that I wake up in the morning.  If I don't do Kukuku, the sun will not rise, then the sound comes out and the sun comes out, but this is not the reason, so let me explain it to you, brothers and sisters, this is an air ticket, the fee of which is Rs 5000, which is the meaning of the price of the ticket. 5000 7000 10000 Whatever the price is, it is fine, it has main cost, main cost is fuel, if the price of fuel increases, then the cost of ticket will increase.  The number one thing that will increase is this, secondly there is the aspect of the pilots, the crew and all the people who do the work that they do. If you buy any ticket, if it is worth Rs 10,000, then there will be a part of profit in it, which very can do right. One part will be the fuel, the second part will be the cost of travel and the third part will be your people's money. Third, if the ship has been taken on rent or if you have bought the dipper on the ship, then you have to repay the loan for that too.  There will be a part of that too, after that there is airport fee also, I am not denying that 150,200,300,400, whatever it is, there is a fee, if you go to the mall, you have to pay car parking fee also, discuss that fee so much. 10  Meaning, if the fee is Rs 100 or Rs 00, let's say it is fine for anything, although it is even lower than this, if I assume it is Rs 200, then how much theft is there in the fee of Rs 200?  Maybe it should be ₹ 2000000, then when it comes to 50, if someone changes it to 250, then it means it is only about 50 or ₹ 1. The focus is on 50 10000, not on the thing that which is from Boeing and which is from its Airbus.  At what rate are ships booked? What is the exchange rate that America gives us? How much is the vegetable money of the dollar? What is the game of crude oil going on? There is no focus beyond those who are pilots, their training.  Their fees increase more and their salaries increase because there is a very specialized specialized skilled workforce. You cannot create pilots overnight, that is, it takes time to make a truck driver, whereas it takes time for a plane pilot to reach that stage after qualifying. If there is a strike by the pilots or if the health of the pilot deteriorates or if he is unable to become a pilot or if the pilot does not clear the exams, then the resources are scarce. You have seen yourself in the airline business that it incurs huge losses.  They bleed even after charging so much fee. It is not that everyone remains in profit. But what I am trying to say through this video is that friend, leave many things aside. Adani of Whole Same Cement bought stake in ACC and Juja Cement.  If you take it then you have committed a sin, no, it was a multinational firm, it used to sell cement in India, so one bag of cement was sold for whatever rupees it was worth, so it earned profit from it, so yes.  What is there, there were only these manufacturing plants here, even now the manufacturing plants are here, so people were getting employment here earlier, they are still getting it here, so who got the benefit, the benefit is that those who earn profit go to their Switzerland or wherever.  That company also used to take the money there, it used to take the profit from there to there, now the profit, brothers and sisters, will remain in the country, now that money will remain in our country. Any big businessman of the country, Mukesh Ambani ji, Tata ji, it is okay if you acquire something outside, even if you acquire something outside, the money comes to India only because we have become multinational for outside, because as I told you, the money of multinational is in the original country.  If he will go and earn money in his country, he will stay here, so don't be a little humbled in front of your capitalist husbands, the poor people are so humiliated, so much that you look beyond them. Oh brother, this too was a generation ago.  Like Adani or Mukesh Ambani ji, one or two generations ago or three generations ago, they too were as normal as us, hard work and luck, this one gets the benefit of this, oh king, if it is benefiting someone, then it will give honor to the student only by raising your 12th failure.  Take it and make that too, those who failed in their 12th, were engaged in their business for so many years, reached some level, then someone lifts someone else, now the opportunity in the picture should be given to only those who  Meaning, those who do not have talent were picked up from every house and offered to those who do not have talent. There is no need to be so sad about what I am trying to do. Every businessman in India is getting some work or the other in every state, everywhere and those who  There are small business traders, they become big traders and it takes time. If you were doing some turnover of Rs 100 crore, then gradually when it will be Rs 200, you will be able to fill contracts of Rs 200, somewhere Rs 500. Now these people with Nyaya Patra, who have this mark on their hands, it is okay, they are saying that we will not cast in these businesses also, we will do the reservation, you do it, but from where will you get a cast, if this  If there is no one to do the work, then this work will not be done or what will you do, then what will happen ultimately, in India there are all the treatments, so this will become of one cast, the same person will be behind it, its stake on 1 is 99.  But  It's better to have some steak, all this nonsense means those things are meant to make you feel good. Hey brother, any work, you tell me. If you are a caterer for a kitty party of 102 people, then you will not get the contract for the wedding of a thousand people.  Will any man say or do you have to organize a wedding of a thousand parties? It is a wedding, thousands of people will come and eat food, you, Abhijeet, become one of them at the right time. Many a times, when a very important matter is being discussed, there is confusion in between.  If you have to tell me the way, then I just want to tell you basically that stop taking your tension, stop being jealous, stop business houses from business houses. If the Government of India, the politicians of India will not help the businessmen of India, brothers and sisters, then will Jeff Bezos?  Will it help Elon Musk? What do you want, what do you need? What should you be transparent for whom? Are you recruiting someone? Is there any competition there?  If you get favoured, it is a matter of great trouble because brother, you are affected, which is not out of your syllabus, it is corruption, someone will build that airport, someone will run it, it is a transparent process, you have to question it, do it, is it not right or you can do it yourself?  The process will also be like this. Earlier too, bids were made for everything in the airport. I am saying that the railway stations should also be distributed like this and should be kept clean and neat. What is ours? Get some more models done, get them, if there is a fee of Rs. 00 at the airport, then we will discuss the price of the ticket at Rs. 100, then we will argue at Rs. 100-200 that the contract has been given to it. It became fun during Covid when these business houses suffered huge losses.  So who filled it brother, tell me who had taken the contract for the airport and had paid him the fee, is the government not charging the fee, have you taken it for free from them or tell me, has the government sold it?  If it is given then what should the government do if it does not sell it and give it to the common man for free? Then where will that money come from? Then the tax payer's money will be taken from the poor man who is going to the airport. Either you tell me.  A poor man goes to the airport, the government is already distributing food to 80 crore people, so what do they do now that the one who is going with slippers and he is a very rich man, who is going with a ticket of Rs. Brother, he does n't value time as much as he doesn't value comfort. He doesn't have money. Stop being emotional about everything. Some businesses are running. The simple principle of the businesses is that if you invest Rs. 00, you will earn Rs. 105, then it will work only if you don't earn.  Will be closed then what do you want from that What do you want You want businesses to fail You want Indian government not to support and have level playing field for Indians  Businesses you want Indian airports to be given to Chinese entrepreneurs to be given to MNCs from outside or you want now we are a country we are going from defense production within our country and want to make weapons in our country so that other countries  But if you don't have to depend on it, then now the normal things that are related to defense are a big thing, these are the issues that divert the attention of the middle class and create anxiety from within.  Those who say that if they had not got the airport then your wonderful life would have become very good. You are being looted, they have looted, they have looted many things. Wherever privatization has happened, the common man has got peace in life for 3540 years.  Go back, what was the condition of the phone, do you know how was the connection, where were the recommendations, how much nonsense and corruption did the lines man use, and today everyone is roaming around with mobile phones in their hands."

    "title": "An Idea Which Can Make Both Ladka And Ladki Walas Happy ｜ Must Watch [4DKmU8KQKVU].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today I have come up with a very good idea. Let us circulate it in the society. What is this video and this idea? It will be sown in the middle, it will take 2-4-6-7 years to grow a tree, but it will benefit many people.  It will be done, so if your children are not married or your own are not married and marriage is important, listen carefully, recently there is another good private bill in the Parliament, okay, do it, in which one has told that in marriage.  Bring only 100 members, this is very good, but I want to take this thing further and want to tell you something that you should start a scheme, Janam Janmantar Joda Scheme, by doing JJJS, the scheme is fine, under which if people get married, then one of them  There will be terms and conditions, the biggest thing today is the fear of 498. Do you know that in section marriages, half of the boys are scared like this, at least there will be something inside him that there will be something in this marriage.  It is not given, there is no compulsion on anyone, if a marriage is taking place under this scheme and the government can subsidize that couple if they come under the taxable category, then some exemption in tax can be given if they are not in that category.  If there is then some more incentive can be given like there was some Ujla Ujjwala scheme or this scheme so that people can get married in this marriage because what is there in India if this law comes and a private bill comes.  It is not that everyone will do it, everyone would like to accept it. Democracy: Some people say that they want to invite 500 people to the wedding, but there is a system in place that limits the expenses, due to this, there will be no wasted expenditure on weddings in the society.  There will be a little bit of pressure on each other that why do n't you get married under this, do you want something from the girl's family and the fear of the boy's family is this, isn't it brother, we have taken something, not this one has imposed it on us.  She will allege that I had brought so much money, give me my money, give me my wife, give me this money, I do n't know what you asked from me, false allegations have been made on the boys, this fear is there for them, isn't it simple that if under this If there will be a marriage, it means that nothing has been taken and if you have been given, then do not marry under that and this intention will become clear first, if there are some boys who expect a lot and want to get married within this, then that means  their mind is flawed  Neither should such boys give their girls anyway and the girl's parents are the girl's parents, they are not demanding anything from them but still they do not want to marry under this, that means they also have some program in their mind for the future.  Is it no brother, we will not give anything and then we will not do this in this one because we should have the option, if you somehow and Domestic Violence Act 2006, all those provisions will be there, no one is doing it but this one will be at a charge.  will get freedom You don't know what you asked for or wanted to ask for and it will be clear from this that nothing will be given under this marriage and this marriage will be named like this and a budget can also be fixed for it like that bill.  In what is happening, he said that there should be 10 dishes, just 10 dishes is enough to eat, however, if you want to eat food in actual, then you can have 10 dishes and even for 100 people, 50 girls, 50 boys.  Meanwhile, everyone's close relatives get settled and nowadays there is a lot of pressure in weddings as people come and go, since there were hardly even 10 people, boy or girl, Pandit ji and two, four, five or 10 others, that too, it was very good.  It is not that less people came to the wedding, it is my experience as a marital counselor. One of the things that I do is that the weddings at which  Expenses on functions and weddings are consciously reduced by both the parties. Irritability is not there, otherwise what is the expectation that if the boys did something, the girls did not do it. If the girls did, then the boys were respected.  The conflict between the boy's parents never ends; the wedding function in India is now a four-hour long function.  It starts at 7008 hrs and by 1112 hrs the chairs are being closed, there is no time more than that, today is a fine day and by the time the rounds are over, only 15 people are left in the family. The discussion of that function is in normal marriages and this is my research.  Yes and many, I have cases. Three to four years is the minimum. In many places, marriage remains for life. Life remains long. There is discussion about it. Your suit came, your suit lost its color.  That your chunni was not right, this was not right, you did not take it, you did not give it, you did not tie it, you did not tie it, and by the time his die down is over, he comes to our place about to give birth to a child, Jaundice was about to come, now this was about to come, this  There are a lot of problems in the society. Gradually I will highlight them through my videos. It is not that you have not heard it, it is just that some people are doing some of those things, you know which ones they are doing these days.  We  All the things are maximum and now elections are coming, only those things will be talked about. Why is this not an issue in the elections? Many people call it a resolution letter. Why is the resolution not taken? Why is this not made in the resolution letter?  It is not taken that we take a pledge that now there will be no expenditure on marriages in India, it will be very less and what is its name, Prevention of Waste Full Expenditure Act, do it like this and melt it. Prevention of Waste Full Expenditure in functions. If it is okay then it is a very good thing because when there will be no pressure because many parents and many middle class people do not consider such events as part of their life like Filmfare Award.  For life achievement now goes to, now the function is done, now our life can end, after this she thinks like this in her mind, it is not so, there is a lot of life after that, 70 lakhs are spent on marriage. 70 days are not working, then when they come crying in consultation, then looking at the parents, it seems that they are more pained by drowning 70 lakhs or their relationship is broken because they are not able to understand things, but it is visible on their faces.  If you don't invest 70 lakhs then do n't be a disrupter and when you invest that much money then what will the new couple fight about? Give them money and give them good behavior bonus. Another idea like one year of marriage.  If you have also fallen and both of them have not complained a lot about each other and their parents, have not whined about each other and have not been unnecessarily harsh on them, then tell them that it is an incentive, you get a bonus, like in a company you get Rs 4 lakh.  They will meet you by taking it out of the so-called wedding budget and then say that if you give birth to a child in the next two-three years and you will have to take a break from the girl's job, then also the incentive is from which money.  Marriage Save the money that you have saved in FD and gradually invest it like NT plan, like these life insurance people and all these people keep giving it for a year, after that say brother, now Fevi.  There must have been a strong joint of the goal, if it has not happened even in a year, then we cannot take the contract of age, but in the beginning you put the car on their track, this society. Discuss this video. Discuss in your family groups. Those who are those who are forward.  Don't do them. What benefit is there going to be in it? So tell me what an idea Sir ji, write below it and put it on twittersignin.com, what is the benefit going to be there, but out of 100, even if it gets 5, 10, 20, and this money.  If we are saved and marriage does not happen, then the business of marital consultants like us will be less. I am telling you to kick your stomach. I am telling you to kick your stomach that marriages will go well.  Consultation will not come because it comes only after crying and crying, so please forward it. Pre- marital consultation is also very important. I carry out that also, one thing can be done before marriage without any fight. If anyone wants consultation.  So you can connect and type PMC to the a contact number which you can find out ok so please share this video very important  Do n't spend too much money on weddings. Spending too much sets up for disruptors from the marriage from the other partner from the spouse from the girl's parents. Don't know what to do with the girl. What should the boy do with what? What if we had given so much money? Don't just do it, don't do it by saying that call the couple that brother, the wedding budget is so much and this is also money or this plan, which package do you want? Tell me, should we give you money in your honeymoon or here, the couple is fine. They will say in a minute, Papa ji, we do n't have any friends, you call your uncle, Uncle Poopa, do 20-50 marriage, we will give it to us, every buddy Janji is very smart and his excitement level is also there and say, not all will give behaviour.  Good behavior will also be rewarded by both the parties, by both the sets of parents, I have hope in life, I thought this was a good idea, please share it, thank you.  Very Much"

    "title": "An Idea Which Can Provide Housing To Middle Class In Big Cities At Affordable Price [1VcqaYNQuXM].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, elections are coming, manifesto of parties is being prepared, there is an idea which we can circulate so that the real estate which is becoming so expensive should become a little less expensive. The idea is that the government will be the central government plus the state government.  There are a lot of owned land parcels plus they are located in the middle of big cities where they have official residences or people who have relatives of theirs live in them.  If you accept then the solution is that residential buildings can be built in those areas for government employees at the cost by the top builder and a space can be given to the builder to sell normal things in the market and that land can be used. There is cost and the government can cap the price of the builder because if they do not charge too much for the land, then the builder who is investing his construction money there will keep the same margin and his own.  Will earn money. If you understand then the land will still always belong to the government. The land is not sold to the builder because everyone will say this. What will they say? Capital is frozen, crony capital is frozen, not sold, government will not sell, government sold.  This may also give rise to the idea of ​​rental housing and the things that will now be built in the middle of the city would be like lease hold.  It's 99 years, 199, 999, you can do whatever you want. The builder will not turn it on, but what will happen with that? A lot of land parcels will be released, the prices will be very good in big cities. Now the question will come that if this is a subsidized thing.  This is a subsidized thing, so who should get it, then it should be given to those who do not have a house, first of all, there is a basic thing, so before putting the rich in the trap of poor, first of all, there is a house for the poor.  If it is not available then the off-course will come out of the draw plot because there will be demand from a lot of people because if a normal flat is somewhere around two crores then under this scheme it will easily cost one crore because the cost of the land is not that much and the cost of the land is not that much.  The government will not take much money, its mechanism can be made from city to city as it wants to do, if it wants to do rental housing then the government can also do rental.  The government used to own the land, it got it built by a builder, it is okay and the government is eating the rent, that proposal can also be there, the employees will also like it, they can be earmarked separately to some extent, if you see, then which one is this?  There is our Kidwai Nagar which has been demonstrated by NBCC in Delhi and is earning a lot of money there, Office Pace has sold all this and has demonstrated a lot, so it is not that we do not have the model.  But the thing is that now when development has to be done and ideas are being sought and are being sought at the Prime Minister level and are being sought on his behalf, then brother, we will have to give ideas, yes the allegations should not seem as if this was an electoral campaign.  This one is that you sold it because the opposition will do the same, so you have to openly say that this is my land, if you have a plot lying somewhere, your father is not letting you build four floors on it and you will get rent.  If it happens then what is the problem, you still haven't sold father's land and have given it to father, you take it father, do it like this, give the rent of two floors to me, I have built the house, so a lot can be done and it will be good for the public and when  It is good for the public, doesn't it? The public does not do anything and everyone knows what is happening because the railways have huge land parcels, there is also a lot of defense land, there are many different types of things where everything can be done.  man hold But you should audit it and see on which lands, yes, they are sitting in the middle of the cities, what is the meaning of government people sitting in government offices right in the market of the city, is there any commercial thing happening in your mind?  You can also live far away. You can go and see where the government people live inside the UK or in big cities of other countries. It is your heart to live there. If you want to live in a residential place, then you can make it residential. Build a tower for them so that they can also live there. children should also study  Those who live nearby are in good schools, their wives also work, so I am not an anti-government person here, I am just benefiting them, now you are living in shabby houses, CPG is also coming, maintenance is not being done, which public department etc. are these?  All the money is like that, do you know what it is, what is the color of it, what is the condition of it and what is the maintenance money? Everyone knows that a builder will build it, he will maintain it in a good way, that will be the HRA of the government employees.  The government will not have to pay. Government employees also go around saving money as per their social status. Whatever their social status is, we call it type four, type three, type two, type one. Such quarters are given to them as entitlements. As to which officer and what he will get in which pay band, then remove it by making life a lung. My one construction is for 150 years and will not go anywhere. Your quarters have become permanent. You have to get a house, otherwise it is yours.  The office is here, I do n't know from where you come here, some come from Dwarka, some come from there, some are coming from Najafgarh, I am taking the example of Delhi, some are coming from far away, so you will get a place with respect.  The land given in the middle of the city will also be released. Rest of yours, only very rich people are coming and living there. There are so many poor people living there. There are properties worth crores of rupees which will be a little less than the market price and more than that. This will be curbed, otherwise brother, the middle class cannot buy a house. Look at your Gurgaon. However, I am an edge real estate guy, I am giving an ax to the real estate business by suggesting all this, but sometimes I also do something to do good. Making a small channel is just an idea, the state government can implement it, it is not necessary that permission from the center is required, any state government can also do it, the center can also do it, it is the idea of ​​the political parties, theirs is political. Even if the party says, we will come to power, we will do this, those who are under the Centre, we will do that, where our states are under the state, we will do so much, we will leave so many ruined places everywhere, I am not saying that go to Lutyens Lane here. Change the appearance of that place, incite more crowd there and don't do me in Ecology and its chak tanto where it can be done, where FR can be increased, where infrastructure is in place, where Left Right has also been increased.  And  Where all the roads are good, everything is there because you will see in big cities, there is metro at many places, everything is good, only a little land parcel has to be released, I am not saying here that sell everything, 100% of the government. Because this is also work in progress. If this idea has been put forward today then it will take next 20 years, 25 years to execute it gradually. Yes yes, today the land parcel has been released here, today this has happened, the government office itself has expanded.  The government itself is getting bigger, so brother, you should make the office properly for yourself, now the government is also at each other's head, whatever happened in the government area and area office in Delhi.  It was a welcome step, isn't it a good thing, then why can't that thing be done all over India and why are you doing it only in Delhi and leaving it aside, rest of the country is such a big country, what is there and why can't it be done there if the space is released there?  Let it be like this, build a school, build a hospital, okay  If you make something which can release it, if there is utility of that pace, then this is a very good idea. But how do you like this idea, you have to share it. All the trollers are IT sales people, right?  They also look at useful things, it is not that they have come only to abuse because I am not making a video against anyone, I am just giving an idea, so you are someone's IT cell person, you are listening to politics. As for the party, please post it somewhere in the think tank that your committee has written that yes, it is good to say the idea, just put it as a phrase, who knows, implement it a bit, then put it, it is a great idea.  It is good otherwise the government will say either the government will make it for the poor or the EWS people who are worth Rs 150-200 carpets cannot live as a child of a human being. I am saying that even middle class people can't live there.  She has become poor in terms of buying a house, here the government has to earn money, I am saying to monetize it, the government owns the land, it can be put on rent as per its choice, the seller can keep it, the freehold person can keep it.  Keep it rental, keep it mix of it, keep it all, it can be managed very well, according to me, you guys tell me what kind of idea it is, please spread this idea, I feel like this This type of ideas can be put in the bar manifesto, I will keep bringing more ideas, if you have not subscribed the channel then subscribe and there is one more request, watch all these videos, 10 15 20 thousand people will watch them. If you have not subscribed the channel then subscribe.  And those who have done it, then they feel good after hearing such things from their families or spread some positivity and everyone listens to intelligent things.  Do this in the country so that our country thinks intelligent instead of being upset, I have a request, brothers and sisters, who is listening wholeheartedly, increase one more subscriber so that I am sitting at the figure of 26000, so that I can directly touch the figure of 50000. Mohim, it will take a little bit of effort, I know how to get someone in the family to subscribe like this, now it's time to vote, so this is how you have to press the button to vote, right?  So practice it now and press the subscribe button here because the more you press, the more my voice will reach higher. By shouting here, my voice will not reach higher, my voice will reach higher. When there are numbers in democracy, numbers are needed now, that is why I am every  In the video, I will ask you this thing at the end of every video, so please do n't worry, I will tell it at the end only, but please press the subscribe button, ideas will come only then and the poet's poetry will come out from within. Only when you get such clapping do you feel like writing more. Brothers and sisters, this thing can be done in an off-course. You will have to sit and think about it, but there is nothing that cannot be done. There is no piracy going on in this. The government is doing good to everyone.  It will be good for the builders, it will be good for the economy and it will also be good for the common man because the government does not need the land to utilize it at the market rate, nor is it for the public.  You can also pay the land cost, now the cost of construction is 00, you earn your profit and the government is also giving something, still we can launch the thing at 56000 feet, so what is the problem?  It is happening and by making a policy in full swing, showing it to the public, taking it around and getting everyone clapping, they can say that it is done with transparency and there has been no theft from the public.  It is good that the builder also adopted it and everyone did their own thing. This can be done very well. Spectrum was also a resource of the government which was sold by the government. It is okay that coal also belongs to the government and it is their resource which is under government control.  It is only those who sell airwaves, this is also the land, it is yours, the land can also be released to the people of India in big cities where there is fire.  Where will the common man buy the property at 15000 20000 20000 25000 rate 0000 feet rate? Will he live there in the slums at all? How will he live there? Make it clean and look good. The entire landscape will be the responsibility of the builder. Where will the swimming pool, landscape gymnasiums be given to the employees?  If you get the facility, the government employees will clap, they have made a separate one for them out of 5.5 acres, one acre and a half.  Acre of tower is yours, brother, your club, swimming pool, all this has been done, from here the money has been adjusted, then the accommodation received by the government can come out of the profit. If I am buying something for 00 feet and I have a heart of heart in a better location.  In A city, if I am getting a salary of Rs. 14,000,000 or even Rs. 12,000, then it is very good for me, I mean not exactly a common man, that is fine.  So there is benefit for that, it is okay and here your assets become the assets of the government and all the government employees, if they stay in a government place then they will not even have to pay HR, which the government used to give to everyone every month.  In this way, if that money is also saved, then the government will get the income from it, the whole meaning is if someone writes a paper on this, someone goes to Niti Aayog, someone makes a presentation about it, have fun.  And the idea in which there is no loss to anyone and benefit to everyone, if that idea also cannot be implemented then Politino is making his mind bigger by doing this now. Hello brothers, you will vote for me on this idea but yes, I will have to join such a platform.  These people have that problem, now from where should I form the government, so I am just giving an idea, brother, the one from someone else should do this free electricity and water, the one from the mohalla clinic, you can install it, it is okay that the other one is doing this.  You are a topper student, you assume that it is okay, brother, who has come to give justice, you give some justice, write all of them down in your manifesto, then whoever wins, wherever he wins, whether in the state or the centre, he will not get opposition there.  Because everyone had made a promise with the public, so can you public brothers and sisters force your politicians to say that this Guruji from Gurugram has given such a great idea, please put it in some form.  So that the existing restructuring that has to be done in public utilities and audit has to be done to see that wherever the unnecessary space is being wasted and the garbage is lying half of the offices, why can't they put up a manifesto, that is the message, so please spread this. Thank you Yuri."

    "title": "An Idea Which If Implemented In This Budget  Can Make BJP  Bounce Back [y9O9Muf2Zps].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, I will dedicate this video to the think tank of BJP because right now I feel that whatever race is going on in politics, they are lagging behind in it. My job is to come here and balance things many times and also give them an advice. I will give it because the budget is also coming, it will be good for the country and it will also be good for BJP and I want to tell that and I will also tell the reasons for it and you people who are my core audience, you tell me how did you like the idea, like I never did in my life.  I always give it in my disclaimers that being an independent thinker is not easy in today's world because people will still label me. Either you tell me whether I am giving right advice or not. BJP is going to have a budget, before that we have spent Rs.  Talked about house and PM Awas Yojana and all this, I want to tell through this video and want to give advice that whatever this housing scheme is, it should be done for the poor but not for urban people. BJP has to realize for the poor that they do not have a vote bank in the village and no matter how much they give to them, they will not be happy and those who want to live in the village, build a house there, give grains there, give 5-6 Hajj to the farmer. Given and do not seem to be making any progress in GDP, then there is no need to go out. Why is there so much pampering? It's about seeing that the country has so much money, the government can spend so much. It is not that there is so much money, even if there is so much money then everyone  There is no problem in burying these houses and giving them away, there is no problem but there is a limit on money. Now that money should benefit more people and the country should benefit from that money, there should be growth of GDP, there should be a trickle down effect. Politics should shine and vote bank should also be found. BJP was originally a city party and now it is coming back to the city. It is getting rejected from the villages. Now double the number of my farmers who have entered the villages. Do this.  Couldn't do it, couldn't do it, the farmer is angry and brother will remain angry, according to me, because who will go and tell him, who will explain to the farmer that brother, so many people have entered agriculture in disguise, people will have to go out and work but they  That too is a lot, living in a village, good air, good water, milk, cow's food, some of our own and then some, mobile and all that, I started getting it there too, I am not an anti-villager, but I like those who belong to the city. he is poor  My heart beats for this. The poor of the city is the person who is taking the risk. All the risk is his, otherwise he too would have studied anywhere else in the village because the cost of living is low in the village. Whatever you say, study in government schools there and there.  But take your food as per your wish and the government provides it. Even if you do not have your own farm, you are getting food grains and some 500 state governments have launched schemes like old pension, this pension, that pension, poor pension, Haryana.  So even if you had not married above 45, you could have survived there, but that man came to the city taking a risk in his life for his children and his own progress. Now the first thing that bites him in his city is  I want rental housing. The rent should be made by the government. It does not mean that you donate it so that you can keep it, but create rental housing where a very nominal rent is taken from them. It is okay so that it can be monitored.  It is possible that you cannot rent out anyone else and stay there yourself, what is the point in this? BJP will ensure a lot of vote bank and whatever help it will provide, it will be irrespective of caste, color, creed religion, it will help the urban poor. By identifying rental housing, I am again using the word rental housing and incentivizing builders to create rental housing. I will not call it EWS housing because What happens in EWS is build build, the government gives something, they sell it and then go to urban slums somewhere and then the next government comes, it builds, the city becomes clean, it is a big city, you look at Mumbai, Delhi. Look at Kolkata, look at any of them, all the big cities, that is, all the top cities, tier two cities and even tier three cities, the state governments should also encourage it, the center should give money for this.  For this, the state government should also invest Rs. 50 crore in rental and the central government should invest Rs. 50 in rental housing. Rental housing should be created for the urban poor. BJP will benefit a lot. Now, wherever they have state governments, they can immediately implement this scheme.  And in this budget, we can announce that 3 crore houses will be built out of thin air and PM residence will be located inside the villages where people will leave in 5 years.  They will leave and whatever migration will happen, urbanization is bound to happen, the benefit in urbanization will go to BJP only because the villagers are not afraid anyway and if you do n't know about the politics of fear, then those urban people are more affected by it.  So BJP can take direct benefit of Urbanization of India if it invests in these things now because Congress is bringing the bottom of the pyramid from the bottom, it is bringing it up from the bottom and BJP is now out of the pyramid. BJP will feel the place, what smart thing did it do first 10 years ago that this was the spectrum, this was our left from the left, left means whole and this was the rightist BJP and this was the center and Congress was in the center, BJP was called right wing from the center.  Here BJP came here and kept on pushing and pushing and Congress kept on doing like this. If it kept on doing like this then Congress lieutenants have disappeared and no one even asks about them. So Congress has come to this corner of the poor and this is what they call.  Don't talk about other big things, the people who say that they are JNU fans and all these things are fine, they are farmers of the poor, after doing all that, now BJP has come here and gone till here, what is there to do till here, what is there to do till here?  It happened that without doing anything, just by showing it, I started getting so much taste and votes started coming, then in the last several years, in the last four-five years, the work below was not done, the photo ops were very good, so now this one for the first time, do and means do and.  Dying situation right now  It has started because if you do all this now, then three houses will not be built out of thin air, the rental housing you thought today will be built tomorrow, elections will be held in four years, then in 5 years, state government elections are coming in Maharashtra. You are coming to Haryana and Jharkhand. Make immediate announcement. Your government is there in Maharashtra everywhere, meaning in Maharashtra and Haryana, your government is there. Announce it in the cities. Nothing will be achieved by distributing plots of 100-100 yards, because then you are distributing them in urban areas of Haryana, so who is the identification beneficiary? Many a times it has been given to some people from outside, he is not even their vote bank. Hey brother.  If you are distributing somewhere in a city, then do this much homework. How much should I tell you openly? How much should I do that? In Haryana, 100 yard plots have been distributed, so see their original antisense agents.  That the person to whom you have given it is a yes person, is your voter originally a heavy voter or not or just looked away from the base and beyond that you have given it, who is it, is acting very casual, below and above the BJP, this is a very practical video, this is a request. Now this is coming, the budget is coming and there is no anti or his thing in it because what is there here right youtube0 You will see Anjum and all of them, they know what the government has to do, Dhruv Rathi ji knows what to do.  And those who are like Godi YouTubers, they have just praised the government. Like me, I am in a lonely space. I am scolded here too, I am scolded there too, why do you call him like this, why him, why his, oh brother, I am also there.  I belong to the country, I am a nationalist and say, in any way you can get benefit, in any way you can get benefit, take such benefit that if you provide rental housing to a person within the city, then by default he will get permanent residence in it. But it is on rent and tell him whether you will pay rent for 15 years or 20 years, after that it will be yours and after that you will also pay tax on it. If selling in the middle is not allowed, if you do it under power of attorney, then it is illegal.  One who has paid rent for 15-20 years, a very nominal rent, I am not asking to ask too much in the EMI form, but what will a nominal rent do to him, he will remain in that house whenever he wants.  A person gets a house, then he installs a cooler in it, a TV, a bed, then the economy kick starts. When a person lives in a slum or a place like this, which is not permanent, which is not his sure thing.  Which is exactly the same kind of rent that the owner here is the government, so the government will not evict it, it will give an allotment letter in such a way that the rental has to be paid and after 20 years, if you want anything.  If it is done then your children will be living here or your family is like this and whoever will be living here will have to stay here for 20 years and the ownership is for 20 years. So what kind of idea did you think, first tell me and can this BJP and all this be implemented?  You can do this very easily by saying Rs 3 lakh 3 lakh crores, there is no benefit to anyone by building it inside the village. Practically even the villagers are not benefited. There is a garbage disposal place, you will build a house there, there is no sewerage.  There is no water, there are 50 other things which are not there, make clean places in the city and this will be a very good program for slum redevelopment. Wherever there are slums or such places or there are urban villages or unauthorized places.  By doing this in unauthorized colonies, somewhere the plot is like this, wherever there is government land easily, land can be easily acquired somewhere.  There is a parcel of 10 acres and there is also a line parcel, so there also you can easily take out 4000 flats, you can give them in the form of small and rental housing, things suitable for the living of a clean, decent human being, the equivalent of 350 400 carpets in the city.  If it is a big city then it will become a little smaller in size. If it is a small city then it will become a bigger size. If we do this then BJP will benefit a lot. I feel that  BJP has run out of ideas, it has become so over dependent on Modi ji that he will do only what he wants in the elections and has taken till 240, meaning only Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma will do it, there is no work for anyone else or will anyone give any idea that yes this is  Let's do this, which means that the only work left for people like us is to come and give ideas to your party, which means that now we have to give because we do n't feel like we have a chance to give, since it is from the budget, put a provision in it, we have already put it in.  The scheme that I said is to be tweeted, only the money is there, I had already told you that promises have to be made, there were promises, so brother, don't do it in many villages, too much money is being given in the village, there is no income from the village.  The GDP of the country is not growing, there is no productivity of the people, there is useless politics and vote bank politics. If the seats are counted according to the votes and now when the delimitation will be excised, then there are a lot of rural areas from here.  Seats are also going to be reduced, you people who are going to get this done must be aware of this. Well, what is going to happen is that in cities where physical man lives, there should be more weightage instead of just villages, villages are villages, farmers are farmers.  The government has tried to do a lot of good, everyone has done it, but the actual good of the farmer is not possible because no one openly tells him that farming will not work, only so many people can work on so many acres. Now not the whole family can live on this, you will have to go out and start doing other things also, so who should go there, it is up to the farmer to decide in the farmer's family. If a farmer has three children, then why won't all three farmers do that land holding? 1. There will be a third father, his father was not able to survive, he has two children from land holding, how will he survive, then the farmer also has to think, which government will come and do anything?  Just do the government, this is my father, the government does not let us die of hunger, but is not dying of hunger an achievement after 77 years of independence? Okay, after so many years, is this the achievement that we are not dying of hunger? Yes, let's consider it an achievement.  It could have happened a few years ago that so many people used to die of hunger, they did not die of hunger, but now we have to look forward, so the first thing is the house, if the government will provide the house and rental.  If there is housing, it will also encourage urbanization and the place will come in a good manner. Otherwise, if there is migration, people will live in unauthorized, unhygienic places, which will lead to diseases, there will be no productivity, there will be hygiene issues, infrastructure will collapse, cities will build anything anywhere in the cities.  If you take it then make clean housing from it. Many countries have done it. No one is telling such an original idea that I am telling by doing it from my own pocket. Many countries have done it.  The developed countries, when they were becoming developed, have done this work, they can keep the same cent amount which can be linked to inflation, that is, I am asking to take rent like ₹ 5000000, I am not saying that 10000 20000 is a very low minimum rent.  So that his cash flow remains stable, he will count only then he will know how many people are living there and the rent is coming.  There is a mechanism for it, so you keep adding that mechanism, there will be no difficulty, it will be a very good system, according to me, encourage this thing and in that, if anyone wants to buy or want to do something like this, after some stage, they should also add an option.  It is possible that the poor man has money after 7 years and he wants to buy and does not want to pay rent because after buying he can sell through lettings. If there is some such system then ask him to buy, otherwise wait for 20 years.  Meaning  IAS officers are very intelligent people, the rest of the people have to sit and tweak it so that you don't have to pay anything for 20 years, if it is too much then you can neither sell nor buy for 7 years so that it seems speculative.  If it is given then my idea will be very fruitful. It is very easy. It is a basic template. I told that its specifics can be discussed. If there is no rich in the city, then there is no need of poor in the city. Why do all the work have to be done in homes and cities?  You also need a driver, you need a Flipkart delivery boy, you need a maid, you need labor, a painter, a carpenter, everything, he also manages the ecosystem but it is also increasing and what kind of conditions do they live there, but they are among the people.  If the passion is high then they are taxed only by the middle class in the country who pays the tax, the lower class pays the tax, otherwise the middle class and the rich class pay, then brother, this is the use of your tax money.  If it is put to good use, you will see direct benefits. You will see the city becoming cleaner. The workers who will come to your homes to work will come in more hygienic conditions. Their children will live in a better environment. There will be no diseases within the city. If the city remains clean, please spread this message.  It is an easy thing to do to everybody, meaning now this idea comes from the opposition or not, then it is BJP, it is done only if we get the original idea, otherwise we do it.  If the opposition will take the credit, then if the Congress people are listening, then brother, you do not need to speak in the Parliament, but if you accept that these people do not do so even after giving the idea, then you people should say that yes, we had given this idea because I have full knowledge of it.  I am sure that many think tanks find the content of my channel useful because I see those words being used. I have used those words for the first time like National Security, which had never happened before in Agniveer's case. Earlier it was only about employment, on top of that, as soon as national security was used, big leaders started using it, so it is necessary for me and I have no misunderstanding, I have deep confidence that I have seen things.  It goes and is good, the effect should be the same, it should be good, a video has been made for positivity and negativity, I do n't know, I will post it before this video, I will post it later, I have made a very cute video, that too is fine, I hope so.  You will also see, like the channel, subscribe and share thank you a"

    "title": "Anant Ambani Pre Wedding Festivities And Middle Class Reaction [uVlGRHZimdk].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, in this video, which is Anant Ambani ji's pre-wedding festivities, there will be a discussion on one aspect of it and you will get to understand a little bit about the society, there is speculation about who is coming, who is behaving how and so on.  You see the pressure, if you see Ananth ji when it was starting, what did he do in Van Tara before that, what food is the elephant eating there, all this has to be shown so much that it is not visible to the eyes, this is Indian middle.  Don't be blinded by the class because I will not talk about the lower class. The lower class is not bad. They keep looking after their own thing, they have their own thing going on, they work hard, earn money and those of the lower class are very hardworking and at the same level.  Like it is said below, I am talking about the economic class here, so they are very much interested, this is the live wedding happening all over the country, who came, why did Rihanna not dance well, so much money, so much money, what kind of dance is this?  What has happened, it is a private function, one party has invited another, something has happened, what is your problem, it means that people are not able to digest this jealousy factor which belongs to the middle class, how proudly the Indian middle class is coming out. What is the name of Amitabh Bachchan's granddaughter, Aaradhya ji, is Aaradhya 's photo etc. the last day and beyond that, comments are being made by the people, why are they doing this, why are they doing this, where is the jealousy from within?  It is coming from, someone is enjoying, some rich people have organized some function where they are going, the function is going on, so the main work thing is not being done by anyone, I will talk about that in the end. Maybe if he asks a question then it may be a little true that yes he is saying that but to personally check who is spending how much, who is eating and how things are going on, in my opinion, he of middle class typical middle class comes out from within.  here comes this one Jealousy is the factor, you have got the same to compete, you are middle class, your competition should be with your brother-in-law, it should be with your brother, I am being sarcastic, so you should not compete with him either, but you compete with them, not yours, your wife's sister.  If your husband overtakes you, your younger brother overtakes your elder brother or there is competition among children, if any of your relative's children overtake you, then you are in direct competition with Mukesh Ambani, which means you are facing problems from him.  If so, do n't consider this circle as yours. No, brother, you are absolutely right. Guru ji, we keep doing this on a daily basis, but we also need a break every day. What is the point of jealizing with our own people, so dirty.  It is not our culture to do Satyam with our own people every day. Explain this also. I hope my subscriber also understands that no, we are not us, we are not jealous of them, we have to be jealous of them too, we have to raise our standards like this, be jealous of the people of our own standards.  If you are not jealous of your elders, then it is up to you to see. No one asked me this question, because when it came to pre-wedding festivities, I thought it was okay to have a wedding on 6-7-8 March, then I came to know that the wedding is on 12-12 July. So no one is asking that friend, this wedding festival four months ago in April, May or June is not just to divert attention, something was going on somewhere, so now the whole country is talking about it, now here we are, a complete gossip.  Well, on that point, yes, you did not talk about this, when you have done so much, then you should look at why these festivals are happening four months ago, brother, festive activities are not ours, they talk about normal marriage, marriage of that day. Yes lady, there will be sangeet, then there will be turmeric, then it will be like this for three-four days, it happens in a common man's wedding as well as in a middle class wedding, but what about four months ago, did he either feel like he wanted to?  Was it to ingratiate or was it marketing or was it something else or was it elections or was it some other protest? What is it, you write in the comment section and the middle class should not be jealous, you have to use your brain to know what is happening, who is defining this syllabus? Don't be so anxious to explain that a wedding is taking place, a birthday is taking place at someone's house, a wedding is taking place, a function is taking place, then you will become so evolved, who is coming, who is going, what?  What are you eating, what is the calculation being done, or the media has made its own, many things to engage you, give less TRP, because the deliberation is coming like that, if you have genital irritation, there is a little too much of something.  It is also said that this is my life and my brother, instead of wasting time by looking at this, improve your life, improve your life, make your life better, isn't that the message? Do you like the message?  It is a practical message that constantly check his guest list to see that he has also come, now he has got down from the stage, now he is coming, now he is dancing, today the family is dancing, today this actor is dancing, today he Today it is his turn to dance, then people are showing him off by saying look like this, by doing this again body shaming things are happening, which is not required, which is not required.  Someone is doing yours, it's good, all the best, it's a good thing, what is the problem, then concentrate on your own life and try to improve. Consume only that content which forces you to think about your life like it is this content or about my other channels.  There is content but that content will not be enjoyable all the time because it will show you emptiness, it will force you to do something, what is there in this content?  Why is this happening, type something like this, do something like this, it's good, they have a lot of fun, everyone has fun, this Ri also came there, Ri was also there, Ri also came, there is a photo of Rihanna Ri, she is taking out something.  All that is happening in it, you will say, Guruji, you watch all of us, I convince you not to watch, come and analyze, I am a content analyst, I watch mine many times, they do it to us, hey, I watch.  I will come and explain  I analyze and make videos, so I earn money from it, so where am I wasting? You are doing the waste, not you did it, neither did you learn anything nor did you settle your emotions, because emotions did not come, nor did you get jealous.  'Chidke' and such or what kind of time pass are you getting the happiness that oh I am very happy I am very happy, if you are coming then write in the comment section and if you are not coming then write be alive.  To your emotions this is very important in our life that what we are consuming in life will define that the marriage of an industrialist's son cannot be consuming this country's time but yet it is so shows that where this country is going and  What is Happening Why We Can't Discuss Things Which Directly Affect Us Because Whatever is happening in our life, we always discuss it.  Part it is like when a child sits to study, a small child of 7th, 8th, 6th and 8th class sits, he has to go to sleep, then mummy is hungry, which means his Dadda is not able to stand here, which is called Na Dadda i.e. a Haryana word, he is not able to stand. Whatever you read, tick it, you tick it, you must have seen children like this, then they will feel like watching TV, then they will feel like watching mobile, they will not want to study, then this is the thing that can be exploited.  It is special when you go to a stage but turn 22 30 25, when no one of your mobile phone is snatched then next time be very very clear what you consume and please make your diary and notes what ever is the learning thank you Very Much"

    "title": "Any Eye Opening Perspective On Reservation [yN11hNpI_ng].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, this is going to be a very important topic, you have to share it with everyone and make notes, I do not want to troll, I am a Guruji kind of person, I have Guru Tatva and am a person who has risen above all castes and that is why I have great courage on reservation.  I want to tell you clearly by doing this and you tell whether this thing opened your eyes or not. I am going to tell you a different aspect because if you get it on reservation then it is good and if you don't get it then it is bad. It has been 75 years. Nothing ever happened to them. I am going to tell a third finding and I am going to tell it by taking the example of the NEET exam which is in discussion now and you tell it carefully and think about it. I am talking about the NEET exam. After the NEET exam, there are many more  Many a time on social media it was felt like, 'You make these people behave like this, these people have done reservation on the basis of caste, these people will treat them as quota people, a lot of systems are run by doing this, so today I am going to tell the reality.  I am going to tell you the Indians, the fellow countrymen, the truth of reservation, those who humiliate you so much, those who get reservation, OBC brothers, Dalit brothers or the rest of the categories, SC, ST, whatever categories and today your eyes will be opened.  If you feel like crying, cry, if your heart aches, then share it. It is the duty of every person to share this video so that you get complete clarity. On reservation, more will keep coming on my videos.  Today, I am going to give clarity on a part under a different example that if this dialogue is hit or not, then get them treated carefully, I am going to set only that, so let's start brothers and sisters, 24 lakh children give NEET.  There are 125000 seats in the exam, out of which 6000 seats are in different government colleges, which will also include AIIMS and all the government colleges in every way.  Everyone will come in the state government, there are 65000 government seats and 60000 private college seats. If you listen carefully, if there are 1.25 lakh seats, then what do you think, if 24 lakh children are sitting, then around 62500 people with reservation are sitting.  There will be 62500 non reservation general idea, if you think it is ok then all types of children will give the exam in general category.  SC, ST, OBC, the whole world gives it, okay, then a merit list will be made in it, for all the 24 lakh children who will give the M exam, there will be one for them and one for 24 lakh. Okay, so according to the rules, what do you think will be the rank of the person?  He takes his seat in any medical college, you pause and try to write, now brother is top 1.25 lakh, so it is possible that the one in general category got 1.25 lakh rank but he missed it because his  So, there were only 62500 seats, so it is of general category, so if you have got 70000 rank, then it is okay, then you will not be able to take the seat in 62500, no, that is the same thing, you will not be able to take the seat, yes, you are absolutely right, because there are so many seats, so that is it. It was 62500, 70000 was for general category and OBC SC ST reservation people, they also have 62500 seats only. Even they don't have 6 lakh seats. Yes, yes, maybe they will be settled till 2 lakh 2.5 lakh rank. Such people will believe that 3 lakh should be put till how many marks. Hey, 650 660 number is out of 720. You can get medical college in 650 660. If the cut off for general category people is given by the government on that day then it is a problem with the grace marks but I am telling this from the example of the previous ones in general and SC ST.  And in the OBC category, this thing which is 650-660 is dependent on OBC, so if you reach the limit of 620, 630, 610, 600, 590, the government colleges settle all of them, no one goes below that because no matter which category you belong to, that much is your cut off.  If the person who got the number below that number does not go, then according to the law, all the people in the rank of 2 lakh to 3 lakh should be eliminated, but brothers and sisters.  The one who gets a rank of 11 lakh or 12 lakh is also getting admission. The one who gets 110, 120, 130, 140 marks out of 720 is also becoming a doctor. To get 120 marks out of 720, you will have to work very hard. Do you know if you brothers and sisters?  Even if you try your best and there is some negative marking, you can still get 170-180 marks. I am telling you mathematically, you have worked hard to crack 120 and selection is taking place in that too. How is this happening and who is getting selected in this? No SC is going in this, no ST is going and mostly OBC. People from rich families are not going here. I want to tell you that the fees of private colleges ranges from Rs 70,800 lakh for a 5 year course to Rs 1.25 crore.  If there is a separate quota for NRIs, then these people are not sitting with the money, they are not the ones with reservation, they know the number, it will be less, they go to the government, the one which is 60000 in private, the entire reservation is at 9080 and especially which is more expensive.  That is of upper caste people and rich people, all the rich people of upper castes are running the world and this is whether you are poor people or middle class or lower middle class, this is fighting on caste and reservation. And here is a world of clear cut rich, rich will get richer, father, radiologist, mother, gynecologist, son, Pedit Bhau, the same pathologist from some other department, the whole family, the same affluent family, the whole game is being played with money, doctor sir, to sit in the hospital. Must be that degree is being bought to run and these people are more dangerous than many people because brother, my child from ST with 610 is much better than 150 every day. Now the dark truth has come to light about the rich child of Rs 140-130. Now you have started crying that they take you for Rs 50, hey brother, what is the second thing like this here, now after leaking the papers, so many papers are getting leaked here.  These paper leaks must be due to money, so whoever has 20 30 40 50 lakhs, someone is saying that if the paper is being leaked for 60 70 lakhs, then again it is the people with money, this again means the people with money are on top.  The whole game is of money and it will be shown to you that they will give you this job through this video with a lot of love, affection and sincerity to my audience and to the general public of our country.  I want to say, brothers and sisters, if a 10th pass leader's son in Bihar gives you a job and you make him a king, it is not right, you make a politician a king and he will give you a job by begging and will play reservation reservation and you  You will go to their seats, go towards the king, he is sounding like Awadh Hoja, yes, it is right, Awadh Hoja also speaks right, you have to become a king, you are not meant to do a job, you are not meant to persuade, you say this, think this, this life.  Now it's not about me passing the exam brother, this is a country of the rich, this is the world of the rich and only the rich are running it. In this, the poor will fight among themselves on different things which you can now take reservation of Rs. 10 per gold also.  The back has come to the one who does not have money, so the reservation is actually at 60. If you look at it that way, because that quota has also come within him, then this is your dark truth that the person who has less money is disappointed, you keep your quota. Pass and these things will play out in many things, which university in Sonipat is the expensive one, the one with money is going there, second thing is the big institute, IIT is where scheduled reservation and all this happens, that paper.  You don't pass because again you have given help in marks in the entrance test but after that you will not get help, after that you will have to take exam, so that is why I am saying this, many people go away, I am trying to tell a society here.  I believe that when the child is not worthy and you send him there and he is not complete, then there is never any benefit from that tag, that is why there is no benefit of reservation, even though you have gone, I am not able to study with you.  To you  If I give all the lectures of Stanford colleges for Rs. 1 per hour, let's say you get Rs. 15000 from somewhere, then everyone can mostly afford it. If I give it for Rs. 5 or even for free, will you become as intelligent? One learning is peer learning.  There is only one thing which can be digested, like it is said that not everyone can digest desi ghee, even purity cannot be digested, so it looks like reservation.  It has been said that I have returned from there after studying, but how are you an engineer, brother? This is causing choler. Again, the message that I want to give to the society in a larger message is that the messages come to me, Guruji, the children are completely interested in studies.  I don't think they are getting NEET done because there is support for reservation, so maybe I can pass the exam, maybe I can pass in 570, but those are my consultations, conversations which I do through webinars, workshops or by going somewhere.  Whatever I teach in colleges or to children or parents, I am saying that if the child does not want to study, you will put him in a medical college, he has to study there for 5 years and then prepare for entrance for PG and then study there. Doctor Saheb has to study for seven years and he doesn't feel like studying and when he doesn't feel like studying then why are you chasing him? Brother, no, he will definitely become something. Oh no, I don't feel like studying now, it's forced.  also take advantage of reservation Even after getting whatever you are getting, you are not able to reach anywhere in life. This is also a truth and a very bitter truth. I don't feel like it. In the same way, if there is a general category boy, he will not be able to crack the exam. Why are you lagging behind? It is him, not the exam, you.  You tell me to your children, should NEET be given to 24 lakh children, should IIS be given to 12 lakh 13 lakh children, should it be given to 121 lakh IIT students, are there so many children of such calibre? Actual competition is in lakhs, if we talk about IAS then they clear 15000 mains and the last list is made of 1000, there is no competition among the remaining 100 people, so 12-14 lakhs fill the applications, it's like giving the exam.  Let's go and the same thing is that there is no competition among all in NEET, this is also a fact and in IET also there is no competition among all.  There is no competition, they are busy preparing but preparing. This is a matter of great pain. Tell me how do you guys feel. Tell this secret of yours. Don't make such a blanket statement everywhere and every time that this one is from reservation and this one is below this level.  There are many of them and they are running more efficient hospitals and more people are going there, I am also talking about this, next time when you have to read a lot of back and forth about the doctor, then just read this that son, where did you get that from?  I have done it and then we will know.  Colleges will come out where these private colleges cost Rs. 1.25 crore and 1.5 crore and ask him, son, how many marks did you get in NEET exam, sir, I got 150, so is the one with 150 marks going to become a grade doctor or the one with 590 or 610, 610?  This is still a very good number. Yes, 650 is much better but the difference of 40 is still equal by working hard and training in college.  It can be done by working hard and catching up, which is the cut off difference of 30-40, but brother, here it has gone up to 150, 130, 120, 110 and whatever figures I am saying, neither will you be able to say anti-reservation, it is my work.  To give clarity, we have to see things as we are, as we want, it cannot happen because one simple factor is talking about reservation, the one who is getting it is saying that.  It is good, the one who is not getting it is saying, this is wrong, this would be very first order thinking, wouldn't it? Apart from this, there would be an opportunity for discussion as to how it leads to does it really help. If it does help then what happens? And what happens next and for how long will these continue and apart from these, how do we have to run the work and how many total jobs are there which are reserved and if all these reservations are stopped or all are reserved.  If this is done, will the problem of unemployment be solved then we will discuss these things. Like Share Thank You Very Much"

    "content": "Hello friends, today's topic is your small world, it will be a little deeper topic, try to understand, understand pragmatically, do not jump immediately, do not do initial first order thinking, none of my videos are beyond first order thinking, that I can promise, okay then you  Look at this, yes we are the only ones we see in a small world in which we can get lost, where there is happiness and peace, where can we create such a world, you tell me, every person wants to create his own world, two or three aspects.  I will tell you by giving examples, when you go to office, it is not your world because in your world you should be the boss, you will have control, then it is not yours, your small world is created when a house becomes yours. You have seen that those who are elderly women.  Those who are in their 70s and 60s do not want to leave their homes, the elderly do not want to go, they enjoy their own world, they have a house, they have planted a pot somewhere in it, some water the basil, a routine has been maintained by a maid.  is and big Many a times even youngsters feel relaxed that it is relaxing, meaning they call mom and dad, come, friend, come, they don't feel like coming because they are feeling happy there, it is good if they are getting like this, most of the people are getting it.  But I have to say that if a new couple lives on the same floor in dad and mom's house, will the new couple's new daughter-in-law and son be able to live comfortably? Will they be able to say that this is our world because in our world there is food. Cleaning will be done according to us. Decoration will be done according to us. Some people have to put paintings, some have to put modern art, some have to put God's photo, some have to put curtains, lights, some have to put chocolates, some have to put golden ones.  There is happiness and peace in one's own world, this is a very big message. One more thing that is happening today, I tell you from the point of view of the mothers-in-law, that now the latest, the latest taste, the latest from the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law's market is very good.  You people will think that the old mother-in-law used to tolerate the daughters-in-law. You will say, Oh no, no, the mother-in-law used to tolerate the daughters-in-law. I am speaking from the mother-in-law's point of view because the mother-in-law who is the mother-in-law today is the one who was also the daughter-in-law at one time. By typing this, Today's mother-in-law, when she was a daughter-in-law, when she used to live with her mother-in-law, her mother-in-law used to tolerate it because the daughter-in-law, queen, make this, show them that they have come, serve this food, make breakfast, okay, do it like this, do it like that, mouth.  things used to happen  If there was a mother in law, we would live together somehow. I mean, I am talking from Sansa's point of view. The mother-in-law had the advantage of keeping her daughter-in-law in the house. Nowadays, the mother-in-law is the latest test. I am telling you that something new is being created.  There is no use in keeping the daughter-in-law, she will not do any work in the house, it cannot be said that there is a generation gap, by the way, let me tell you one thing, it depends on which state of society you belong to, which is still below, isn't there these things which  I am not telling you  Sorted out has taken place but these people who were here 20-30 years ago and have reached here, have been shorted out here. The day they too will be disillusioned and will move up a little, they will also understand, so why? My problem is that I have given the definition of middle class and definition of money to my audience, but what is the problem, if I tell you too openly then they will say that you are becoming classist, you are becoming rich and poor, your subscribers are becoming poor.  I am not saying this because we should reduce the bass and run away, but you should try to understand what I am saying because whatever I say goes to the third order and this video is definitely going, okay it is not going.  I am going to tell you what I want to say, I don't even want to hold my breath, if my sister is irritable, then the biggest things are for peace because this channel is about giving peace, to remove stress and peace, you will have to do something else wise.  There is no one's own little world, as soon as you step out of the house, the traffic does not move as per your wish. Water on the roads, potholes, traffic jams, bad lights. Have you ever got stuck here? Stuck there, not as per your wish. How will the boss treat you? Not as per your wish, no peace, child.  Are you going to school, what are you doing, what is being studied in school, how many marks are you getting, how many jobs will there be in the market, what will be the competition, you do n't know anything, those are the two, four and five walls of the house, those are the rooms, there you can find peace. If  There you have it, you won't tell me all these stocks vs equity vs real estate, this portfolio worth 30 lakhs lying in the D-mat, Russia attacked Ukraine, what sin did you commit and it became worth 20 lakhs, it gives stress, not comfort.  Where will you find it? I do not say at all that do not invest in equity and mutual funds, but the fact is that you should definitely invest, but before that, build a world of your own, build a world of peace and then play all the games because where  You cannot walk around wearing clothes as per your own, you cannot wake up as per your own, you cannot eat as per your own. Someone or the other is looking at you with a judgmental eye and saying, 'Brother, you should wake up early in the morning, why should you wake up in the morning?'  It is not good in a hurry, no, who said it is good, no, we have heard this, oh brother, it is your body, it is working till night, it is tired, in forceful tanto, I am watching what happens to the youngsters these days, you are watching the movie Age.  stars and these  Some TV stars and all that is how the news comes, why are they doing it? You don't have peace because the day you get a house of your own, that day it will be your own world. Earlier, a serial used to come, I don't know, you guys saw Wagle Ki.  I too used to visit the world many years ago. Well, I have not seen much. I am remembering only the name, I am remembering a few episodes. You should have a pattern, routine, there should be peace, there should be a corner in your house where you feel relaxed, there you have that.  whether a rocking chair is placed  You sit there and drink tea, look, I am talking about something that gives deep relief, that cannot come in a place where there is a lot of lack, that place is judged by being shared by other people, too many other people unnecessarily people, okay parents, yes parents too because  That is the world of parents. It will not take two minutes for parents to say this. It does not take two seconds to say. You say this is our roof, you live with us, it will happen according to us, the day you said it, then where?  If you go and you have taken a joint loan and that property is worth one crore but you have taken 20 lakhs, then from where will you get the 20 lakhs, which room will you take with you, then be very clear in life, you will settle your world on your own.  How can you take these two rooms, Modi ji, that our Prime Minister should have this house, how is the psychology, because it is linked to Gujarat, okay, psychology, let me tell you what is behind it, okay, I too have lived there for many years.  The psychology is that when a person has his own world, even if he is a laborer level person, he gets a room, then he feels like he has got a good cot of his own, he has got a carpet of his own, he has got a small TV, he has got a cooler, then Economy grows unless you have your own world, what will you install? Tell me, your wife wants the curtains which are of light color and your mother has installed them. She will not let you change them because what happens sometimes is that son, understand that this is your own house.  They say that if you have to work for work, then son, consider it your home, rest of the rules will follow ours, you understand that a man can consider his home as his own only when he can do anything as per his own in that house, not him.  This can be done. Where will the cooker be kept inside the kitchen? Will it be of 2 liters? Will it be of 5 liters? It is the mistress of the house who does the decision making. Eggs will not be cooked;  A person gets some peace by doing all these things, when you have kept two couples, you have not established your own world, then let's imagine, all of you eat non-veg and your wife does not eat, your parents eat, you also eat.  Maybe your wife is getting distracted or vice versa. If you live alone in a world apart from her, then a husband can easily adjust to his wife and say, ' Okay, I am out with my friends.'  I will do something, you don't like it, it won't be made in the kitchen, you shouldn't feel but I love you, that adjustment is easy, adjustment between husband and wife is easy because it is happening at a very simple level, it is not happening at a bigger level. Similarly, if husband and wife propose.  Some people eat and drink differently, there is a different system, they can't do it in front of their in- laws, their parents, and then where does the world settle down? I want to tell those elderly couples, brother, you too are not happy, don't think that by forcefully keeping your son and sister together will be a great achievement, your space is also being taken away, you cannot fight openly for yourself.  The mother-in-law is not able to fight with her husband. What happens to the mother-in-law? What is the biggest problem of the mother-in-law? The mother-in-law, who was the mother, used to fight a lot with her husband, like all women fight and the son used to see it every day, but when the flow comes, then the mother-in-law. She cannot fight in front of him. If she fights every day, she will say, 'Dude, if you fight then why wouldn't we fight?' She stops breathing. Many a times, she feels like her husband's frustration and her frustration also comes out on her lips and the daughters-in-law of today.  Brother, she does not take the day, she does not take tension, she gives tension, because in reality, brother, she is also there, isn't there all the forms of goddesses in our country, even the hot forms are worshiped among the women. She is the one who is worshipped, so how did you figure out that if a lady does this then the other umpire will not strike, then when this happens then it is poison in the world and here I will tell only one person who is guilty.  Or two, mother-in-law's mother-in-law and sister-in-law's husband, mother-in-law and daughter-in-law never have any fight, that is, they cannot be blamed, they are bound to happen, they are bound to happen, if the husband cannot give a new world to his wife, then he has no right.  there is a wedding  The message of doing this is that if you cannot buy a house, there are many houses built in India where you can rent them, but you have to live in your own world, you have settled separately, you will not live there, there will be no peace in life, many boys think like this, I can rent 200 Haj.  I will save, I will depend on my parents, food will be cooked at home, I will save Rs.  There are many such boys and many sons, so here I am not in favor of any one generation and not against any one, okay, all types of shapes and sizes are seen and not small, but very big numbers, they have a lot of experience. Parents, you also do not need to be exploited by consultations when the child goes to college and may live alone in a hostel somewhere, he may be working somewhere, he may be working away, he may be doing it here, even if he gets transferred tomorrow.  Will Chhotu be a baby or is Golu a baby? Will you say no? Then how will we pass our time? Your time will be passed by the husband and wife. Then they will say, he is not the husband. What will happen? People will also ask this and the leverage gets reduced. This is also unfortunately the reason for throwing tantrums. Or fortunately, whatever the question is, then you got that world and then an expert from one of your worlds left and then you say, friend, you yourself can settle this world.  As long as the world of only one person can survive in one house, of only one couple, remember this thing and every person wants his own small world, then this is the conflict. If every person wants the world, then maybe some person Brother, you should be given a room, whatever you want to do in it, you can do it, rest in the drawing room, it will be wheel call the shots, if that person is old then you should accept, if you ca n't accept then living alone should be accepted, you have to accept the choice.  that my  If I wo n't be left alone, then I will be in a room where I have to put my photo, do the puja, put the bedsheet, this is my domain, power and influence, the rest is with him and if you say no, then the house is mine, if everything works according to me, then there will be trouble.  It will definitely happen, it will happen 100% because everyone deserves this world, this momo jamo toh nahi laga aayi hope at toh nahi laga, as I felt, tell me, this is a bit deep thing, it has to be discussed peacefully at home, ok, very  It is important, how will the utensils be kept in the kitchen, at what time will the maid come, create lot of issues, she comes at 6:00, the utensils are falling on Sunday morning and are making pum pum pum and when waking up, the irritation level increases, but whose world is it?  For the one who wakes up at 5:00 am to 4:00 pm, it is already afternoon by 6:00 pm, then it is fine for him, so whoever has this world, I will give him many blessings.  I often say that only the film producer decides who will be the hero and heroine. He does not work more than the director. He who has the money will decide, so it is the same thing. Go for your own world. When you are in your own world, sometimes you go and live in someone else's world.  A person from someone else's world can come to your world and stay for a few days and this is how love and relationships remain, but cherish your own world. Thank you very much."

    "content": "Hello friends a practical idea with which you can affect corruption I am not using the word stop corruption because it is not that easy but you can enjoy it I am telling you under practical example wherever you need to give corruption bribe or any  Try like this and if your work is stuck in the government, then I want to give you a practical tip, at some level you have a lower employee, someone is harassing you, someone is troubling you, someone is going to take money, you know all this, you should accept the money and give it  If you haven't read it, then you must have chewed some nails, okay or something like that happened, okay, actually you should never give it to anyone, but sometimes it is very easy to speak by becoming a moral science teacher, in practical, you know, all across the country, in all the states What happens is, if you are stuck anywhere, you had to give, it means something is fine, you gave and under trouble, one gives out of compulsion, no one gives happily, then I have a small tip for you, not a long video, you tell me that this is like this  It's not bullying but  This is practicality, whenever you give it, go to any senior officer in that department and tell him that Sir, I have given it to you, Madam, I have given it to you, you have got it, you will also get it, just tell him that you have got it.  No, now he will ask what did you get, so I got it, he had asked for it, so now you have to look into his eyes and tell him that I have given this practical idea to many, many have done this, now we will not get into this.  The tantri was involved, he was an officer, he used to meet him, it is so humiliating that he gets his money back, there is still so much shame on him, till now it has been successful, it will remain successful in the future, you should try it and put it in the comment section, it is just a small tip, okay. You are not saying anything to him, you are not showing any displeasure, you are not showing any anger, you just go and say yes, you also got it, right, what what what no no no no then he will come to know something in the worst case worst scenario  Maybe there is no benefit, but you still came with fun, it's okay, at least you had some fun, go to the next one  What you told is correct, you are also getting it, it means you are not getting it and people under you are taking it, it means what is happening, then you are honest, you are honest and people under you are being mischievous you should wake up na and should do and brother you are not there because it is possible that someone may say thank you, yes I got it, thank you then what will you do now, then you cannot do anything, okay but but this does not happen, this is what I am telling you  Till now the reports which are like this no one says thank you, people have so much shame, right now it is so good, our country has not become so bad till now or maybe it was before, now it has improved so much or you can call it fear or whatever you can call it, okay  Okay, so wherever you go, do your duty and say that I have to do this much or there is another better thing than this, if you don't want to give, you can also try it, then if you want to face something like this below, then go to the one above.  Go away and tell him that he is doing so much, there could be less innocent questions and he will look at him like this, there may be four people, five people and there may be more people sitting there. Or anything else directly with s, hello ji, sir, he had told me like this, brother we can give only less this much, you will get some discount when you people, our countrymen, listen friend, you ask for discount everywhere, okay I am like  Consultation is fine with me, discount is fine, I don't give it, it's a different matter but asking for discount is our right, us Indians, it is second nature to us, reduce it a little brother, how much does that thing cost, it's Rs. 100,  He is giving it to you for 500 and you will enjoy even a 50% discount, most of the people don't know that a thing worth 100 is being quoted for 500 and is being given for 450, but if you like the discount then ask for a discount from him  Here, tell sir please give me some discount, oh how much discount should I give, which coupon code should I apply here, tell me sir just apply a coupon code, okay, I have given these practical tips to many people, people have laughed, to whom they first told that friend I have it friend ask for it like this, like this  But it is good, you can get discounts at many places, anything can happen, it will depend on your tire, who you are, who you are going department to department, everything will be fine, but in principle we get angry one by one  It is okay to hate from within, all of them are like this, I will slowly tell you, we are going to make them enjoy, I will make the politicians enjoy too, they will be made to enjoy too, but this one I am showing, I am giving it Guruji type thing.  hmm I am not giving any feelings, tell me friend, when to give, one thing is to remain bitter, to remain in hatred, this is how it is, the system will work like this brother, why will it work, well try not giving it once or twice and see what happens, I will tell you the trick, I will explain it carefully. Listen, how does this Tantra work, what is a mantra, this is what happens, I know it all from inside, it is any office, I am not taking anyone's name, it is a government office, files are found there, anything of anyone comes out in those files, maps are passed.  This happens, something comes to the public and it becomes clear, people say yes to us for the time being  According to that you will be harassed, now this one I was taking seriously this one was also in a joking sense, you can try it, now I am coming to tell you the best thing in a serious way which till now those who have seen the video that I say  I am the number one clarity giver, so listen carefully to how the game is played, what is it in the system that people feel that they have to give, if they don't give then there will be a delay, or the work will not be done, or there will be harassment, or come again and again  There is a thinking that one would not have to go and it has been told like this, if there is truth in this then we will discover it, then in any department, 100 files of common people came, that is you and me, so 100 files out of 100 came, if even one person  If he does not pay the money then he can be hanged after putting an observation on 5, 10, 15 or 20 but cannot be hanged on the bars because there are departments above as well, there are departments upon departments, nowadays you have dashboards, your entire thing is monitored digitally, it is written at the top that this file is completed in 21 days  It should be out, it's seven days of work  It is 14 days and monitoring is going on because if corruption is taking place here, look, I will tell you one thing, whether you call me from any party or call me an institutionalized corruption, the kind of corruption that was there in our country many years ago, is not there at all.  Everyone up and down the system was one, now there is corruption, but it is disjointed, someone is doing something, someone else is doing something else, by doing this, this thing, this pattern is broken, so if something is happening here and  If the person here gets to know that this is happening then it is not like this person will completely shut his eyes to it or if no person gives his opinion then he will say listen brother you can do whatever observation you want to from 10 12 15  I can't put too much pressure on him, take out 85 files anyway, otherwise he will say, friend, what is this, are all of you useless, are they all illiterate, there are observations on all the files, none of yours has been cleared, on top of that, targets come from above, task pending and monitor.  but what about our people  They are already desperate, they feel that if they have to go here, they have to offer some offering, the people felt this way, I am telling you this through the video, things have changed, these are the default settings, wash your eyes a bit before offering the offering. So take it and try something else and see why are you in such a hurry or not? I need it in 21 days or I need it in 20 days only, you can say in 15 days but give it to me after I am not coming. Now when he will write some observation then it will be genuine too.  It should be there and if it is genuine, correct it, correct it, but now you want to draw some wrong meaning for yourself, you yourself do not know about the time, then you cannot blame because then you are a party, you are wanting to give what you should not and  Like this in the whole country we common people say among ourselves brother no matter what happens we will not give even a rupee, otherwise if you go to get the registration done in the whole state then that day it becomes like a father of iron, keep giving money to the band players, keep giving money here and there, who pays where  I don't know what he is taking it for because  Bhai sahib you are buying a flat worth Rs crore, buying property worth Rs 2 crore, Rs 80 lakh, Rs 5 crore, then what are these charges of Rs 5000, 10000, 15, 20, 25? Many people think that these are charges which are either innocent or  They are very rich, they do n't even know, they take it as a percentage, that friend, they have to give one percent to the dealer also, okay, they have to give something to him, this is also something and many times, the middleman who is making the deal  He takes it in their name saying that this has to be given now whether he gave the full amount or gave less or gave half, he has no clue and we too think friend, what's the trouble, friend, this has already happened to us, it's a middle class problem, friend, what's the trouble Do 100 Haj, 20 Haj, I am telling you not to quarrel, just have fun, at least check how much anyone is getting, did you get it Bhai Saheb, did you get it, Bhai Saheb, did you get it, you did not get this, Bhai Saheb, I have given it to you. And then he asked him, hey, you did not give it to the sir, at least have some fun, make them fight among themselves, there will be a lot of fights among them, right there in front of you, I am telling you people the ways to have fun How did you like this video?

    "title": "Are You Going To Vote For  A गिलहरी  ？ [1SDUf6cFQek].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, again interesting topic are you going to vote for a squirrel? Now where did this squirrel come from and what is the contact? Let me explain it. We have a popular actress who has recently got the ticket of a big party and she is contesting from Himachal Pradesh.  I got to see an interview of her who is going to fight and in it she said that yes, we are their army and in their army, just as Ram ji had crossed Ram Setu, if there was a squirrel, we are squirrels.  Whatever orders are given, we will follow them, so I want to ask you, the people, that we who are going to elect this MP, what are they going to do in this election that they will follow the orders of any master or  We have to choose our leader who can present our point in the Parliament and put it before the top leadership and for our benefit, even if we have to go against the party line or someone else's, we are choosing the leader. Are the leaders choosing us or are they using puppets? I have great respect for these popular actresses because they speak the truth openly. Honesty is an innocence. Innocence and honesty in itself is very praiseworthy. She is saying this because  No, no, he is a politician, no, he has got the ticket, okay, no, no, he is saying something that no one else is saying, but his actions are the same, all the squirrels.  You are sitting here to mean someone, bring someone as per your wish, don't you want to use your mind? Are the people of Mandi going to vote for the squirrel? Now won't you say something else? Hey brother, do you have to vote for someone with a brain? If not us, then this will be straight. Why have you put the system in me, brother, make the same person stand there just like Trump and Badan stand there, friend, you two finish the work, don't you, this one of ours comes like this, like this, then his small photo, small photo.  Then this photo and then  He is MP then why are he doing this, MP is fight fund, our MP is Sahiba, he is MP Saheb, is there any need to tease him, don't vote for squirrels and ask this question, brother madam please, you have so much talent, you have brains, you also have courage.  If yes, then don't become a squirrel. This video is my request to the public with folded hands, which Madam Squirrel is saying, please reach out to her team, it reaches there, not condemnation.  No one is saying bad words to them, no one is trying to insult women, but with great sincerity and humility I want to say that please 543 of our MPs who go to Parliament are irresponsible of the political party and  Idol ji, he is the representative of the people, he represents the people who have voted for him and he should openly present their issues in the Parliament if he himself  They will portray that we are not your representative, we are the representative of the emperor or we have been sent as Mansabdar in the Mansabdari system, then this will be a mockery of democracy, this will not be democracy, this is the message, so please do not select Gil Harries and ask that politician who  I am standing brother, what will you do? I will bring AIIMS here, build bridges, build roads, bring factories, bring colleges, bring medical colleges.  Will set up to send children to Israel, will send them to foreign countries, will get them skill development, will bring them under some scheme from the government, what will you do, tell me, you are sitting in Haryana, you are sitting in Himachal, if a grand temple is built in UP, then if that thing reaches UP then understand.  It comes to me, if you do something in Tamil Nadu, then brother, what does the Himachal person have to do with the Haryana person, it is not him, it is only one country, so what is the meaning of what you did in Tamil Nadu, the Haryana people would vote for you, the Tamil Nadu person is not giving you anything, you understand.  No, I am talking about you in Kashmir, you have done something good in Kashmir, the people of Kashmir will vote for you, it is a good thing if you do beyond that, why Maharashtra is not one country, hey, the country is not one, brother, we too have our issues.  So the Parliament is being heard only at this time, otherwise why are these videos of polygamy being made now? Why will they not be made after two months? Who will ask? Now maybe someone will also ask, is there any effect once you become a brother and vote for him? After that they got yours for a year  Got nahi poochna Got is short for Gotra in Haryana Ch is like your surname They are not going to ask your surname Who you are where you belong What happened till now they are suppressed All of them will listen Now we will have to listen to them but we  Everyone is going to vote for squirrels. Now what to do? Tell me, will you vote for squirrel? Please type in the comment section and who is your squirrel? Which one is yours?  He is standing in the Parliament, people don't even know about us, we don't know that we are standing, if you want to do this then brother, you should do your outsourcing of this one, you have left everything to one man, it is okay to leave that man.  There is no one person, why his team also looks so average, lack of choice within the country is the misfortune of this country, if not this, then who can get 10 people, 20 people, 50 people, Idol ji. Amrit PK can also be in his party, anyway no one comes, if no one has won for 200 years, then giving so much attention to the squirrels is not right according to me, that is my message, vote will be of course a squirrel or something else, something different.  You choose different types of animals, you have to choose between them, look at the butt, ask questions, why can't we choose people, who can speak nicely, nicely means not like a song, logic if someone speaks  It has been said that I am a squirrel in someone's army, so now if I say so, squirrel madam, what should I do to vote for you? Well, I am thankfully not in the market, the people of the market will have to do it for us, I think the matter is fine in Gurugram. According to me, there is no other candidate B. It's okay, I don't like squirrels here, I'm okay but it's okay F. You will say which one or which one I don't go, we have only one vote, we can't take 10, okay but squirrels  vote for  You should not be a squirrel of any party. At least you have a mind of your own, if not a lot, you have a personality of your own, but what you are saying is right, madam is speaking the truth, she is speaking innocently, she is a new politician, maybe you will teach her something, okay you? Teach me through this video, friend, speak like this, we don't speak like this, even after being a squirrel, there is no need to speak, if you speak then it means someone like us will come and speak like this, and then he will get scolded.  That you should not have spoken like this, the rest is also a squirrel, it is okay but she is not speaking, okay then you also do not speak, but the request to the public is that please see through your leader and see what is his agenda and how can you tell him about your actions.  The issues are, how is it solving them, the arrival of a gas pipeline, the yellow pipeline that comes to the houses in Gurgaon, in many places it is not coming, so this is the actual sewerage issues, waste.  Management issues: Where will your garbage be collected, will that garbage be sent to the sewerage system, what is happening to the environment, what is happening to pollution, what is happening to the stubble, what are you doing? These issues are the real issues and they are important to the public through their representatives.  We have to raise the issue through the one who represents them, everything has been corrupted, he has done it, this one has done it, there is no cure for corruption, whoever has done it, the court will do it.  Will see, the court left it in Gujarat, left it in coal, now it is the turn of Electron Bund, nothing is being written about it, so how long will we discuss it, who did it to whom, who did not even know, those issues which are affecting you are also mentioned.  Especially the middle class in big cities are not even speaking about the issue, they are shouting unnecessary slogans, stop chanting 'Jai Ho', there will be one message of mine in every video, ' Jai Ho' for any politician, don't say 'Jai Ho'.  If you want to say, say Jai Bharat Mata, she is our country and do it within a limit because that too after time or too much of an emotion also de- sensitizes you because these people also come to you and hail them first. This is also a catch, so when the first one says yes, everyone says yes, then they get the second, third and fourth firm done as their own, so don't fall into this trap, politicians.  And avoid going to any rally. If you have to go to a rally, brothers and sisters, then don't go for less than Rs. 000. Actually, I am saying, take Rs. 000 and first take it in advance. If you give the money first, then you will go and stand in the sun.  No otherwise, don't go for 200, 300, 500. Hey, don't send the children by mistake at all. It is okay that they will go from here to there in tractors. Influence your friends that  Friend, we don't have to stand in his tent, this time he himself will come in front of all the politicians, in the Chaupal, in the locality and in peace, in the park, it is a different thing, 100 people, 200 people, 500 but this is a rally, isn't it five five 101 Brothers and sisters, flop those with lakhs of rupees. Make them flop. Be it any party, make them flop because these middlemen are earning a lot of money.  These are the workers, whether they belong to any party, who are taking the money by holding, these are the ones who have to take money from the electoral fund. If you have to take money from them then do two or three Hajj, do not go for less than that. Tell me brother, you are yours.  See, they will definitely blackmail you that I will not do your work, the work is not in their control, India will become like this in the future, even the workers have nothing to control, the work is not done by MPs and MLAs, these workers will get the work done for your workers. Stop sycophancy and if you yourself are a worker of some party by mistake, then it is the worst job. Becoming a worker of any party, becoming a worker of any politician is the worst job. Okay, that should be the core group of 100-200 people, their address is just here.  Now 11 crore workers have become sitting. When 11 crore workers become then no one has any value. If there are 11 workers then they have value. 11 crore have no value. Clapping.  Do clapping, you will sit down to do clapping when the election results come, then you will get to do this disky disky disky disky yeh yeh yeh yeh, if you dance in the wedding, then some son's father will even give you a penny for diski after the election results.  We will discuss, no one is going to give it, it is okay and when laddus are made to win then anyone can go and eat them, if your candidate wins laddu butter then I will stand up, me too  There is no need to be sad because of the fact that they are about to meet, if it is okay to eat two laddus, then have some respect, Jaago Voter Jaago India ka Voter Jaago, as Jaago customers say Jaago, Voter Jaago and in the matter of these two laddus.  Don't go, charge Rs. 000,000 well and go to every party and then tell every party that our rate is fine, whatever they are sitting with is fine, put their rate at Rs. 3000.  Small party's ticket should be Rs. Because there are many leaders of India who do not have money and they have come on record and said that I do not have money to fight, till date I have not understood that if the average of Rs 95 lakh is the maximum expenditure.  The Election Commission says that one MP cannot spend more than one MP and the political party is sitting with thousands of crores and cannot give Rs 95 lakh to its top leader, i.e. to the third or fourth leader, that madam ji should fight the election. Tell them, I don't have money, hey madam, you can't contest university elections, you know you can't contest local councilor elections and do you have the courage to say this, yes, we are like that only.  We will become Rajya Sabha members, we are non-playing captains, we don't see this dust and bustle of Lok Sabha, we do it comfortably like this, so why doesn't he say the name because brother, he is scared, that's why he doesn't speak and I want him to walk in it like this.  Let's go so that we can speak by name, like 10-12 years ago we used to speak by name and now it is not said that you are a thief, you have eaten the money. Okay, so I don't want to go around here Paramveer, people will tell me by name, do n't you know this?  Whose name am I taking then your GK is strong week and you are not in my audience ok thank you very much"

    "content": "This is a very interesting topic and from this you will get to know about a phenomenon of Indian politics. As you have seen, who is the real leader? It is a simple question. In politics, many people act as leaders. Your little leader will be the big leader. There are many such leaders only.  Leaders roam around, whoever is the politician, the real leader is the one who does not have any other leader himself. Understand that like the top leader who is neither our leader nor his, he is the real leader, whoever is the top leader of the political party, he has no one ahead of him.  If there is no leader then he is the leader right now, just like there is a small party in Delhi whose leader is in jail now, then he is the leader, there is no one above him and he does not follow anyone, in the same way you will see that within the states, many  There are small parties which live only in the state, they have their own, like Tejashwi Yadav is the leader, they have no other leader, Mamta ji is the leader, Akhilesh is the leader, I am telling you now under the example of what am I and why am I hinting, this is only.  it would be better to tell Higher order thinking about this will happen, now that we have seen this phenomenon, now even the Chief Ministers of big provinces are not leaders and many have made such Chief Ministers who at some places are nothing, at other places they are nothing, that is, they do not care about them.  A relative, what is a close relative? We consider the wife as a relative. We are very close. Whether the Sarpanch election is won or won, it is like this. I am not saying this in the form of sarcasm to humiliate anyone.  I am not saying this to show that these days it feels a little too much to cause pain to someone, but I am doing it to explain something by the example of why these regional parties will remain relevant in India, because what is a region, if a very  There is a big political party, like the one with topper students, let's assume that it is the biggest political party in the world, now it has a top leader, so the power is the same, there is no other leader, tell yourself that it is a different thing but it is not.  So I don't believe anyone, no one in your party believes, even the public is like this, so what is there in him, the public can't even reach him with a slip, even for my work, get it changed, get this work done for me, not mine, he is a leader, such a big leader.  If these leaders are worth 50-100 crores, that means there are direct people who want 100-140 crores out of 140 crores, then we also know that they do not want anyone but they are very popular so they cannot reach here, there is a lot of system in between and those in between.  Hey chhut bhaiya leader, I say those two things are not there, they can't get it done, like if there is a small political party in the state, then its top leader and then those at the bottom, then this problem is less, you can quickly solve it.  You can reach a relevant person, even if you can't reach a top leader, then you will reach someone on his right hand, left hand, left finger, right finger, that is, you can reach somewhere near him and get your work done, that is why it remains relevant to people because  India What is there in me, people don't have patience and no one enjoys getting the right work done, anyway, it is fun to get something and get something done, only then this is called a money-spending system, which people like us who are intellectuals, like us.  If we do n't want to get the work done then we can come and put it down very easily, this is not good, the audience I have, this is not in life, what is good in life, what is not good, what is right, what is wrong, do not discuss Moral Science  Don't become a teacher in a country where there are 150 crore people and they have so many problems. If I don't have those problems in my life then I can't come here and become a moral science teacher. What are you doing? You are planting forests, what is this? What kind of politics is this, brother, it will continue like this, it will continue like this because these many top leaders keep roaming around, have you seen the electoral bonds, from where do you get direct access if it means 50  There are many such crores that they will not talk to you below 50 crores or 100 crores. There are many such that they will reduce it to that level. There are many such that they will do it with folded hands. There are many such that after taking 20-30 rupees you have gone away.  So Panchayati will listen to you, only then you will see that the states are like the phenomenon of Southern States, see what the House States have released, this is a phenomenon, will not put it in good and bad category because it is true that the complexion should  Will you understand why playout is happening? If the House is a state, they have chosen their own parties. You have seen Kerala and Karnataka, if you see Telangana, Andhra and especially Tamil Nadu, they do not take the big party because their  The way politics is being conducted now, in the Hindi heartland, all the MPs who take the seats do not count much. They have not been counted for many years. When there were coalition governments, their votes used to be counted.  For the last many years, they are not being asked by Dispina, Chhotku leader, Chhotku party and they are settled there because they say, we have nothing to do with you, you and I don't know what work should we get done, if it is our direct work, someone will give us a TV.  He will get this work done for us, he will get it done in some way or someone will give us something in the canteen, and that is his idea of ​​​​dealing with the same, he is not saying only by doing South, if you see Bengal, it is okay, you see Bengal, you are this Chutku.  Look at the party here Look at the different types of gentry of the people of Delhi in Delhi, when the Lok Sabha elections are going on, now we will see what will happen in the Lok Sabha this time, there may be some twist in the story, but what we have seen so far in the last 10 years is that the people of Delhi are in the Lok Sabha.  If they do it one way here and one way in the assembly, then it shows that when they do it at the local level, they need local access, they can quickly reach the leader in their locality and then they can reach the real leader.  Can  If there is a definition of who is the real leader, I told in the beginning that the less the distance from him, the more people will do it. These are the insecure parties. There is a lot of centralization of power in both the top parties of our India. You see, that is also the meaning of the elected Chief Ministers.  From there he will appoint an appointee, he will appoint a Subedar at some place, as they used to say in the old times, you appoint him and then remove him, how many Chief Ministers have been changed, do you know what that means, any regional, whatever.  Whose name comes out like a bully, like if you look in Maharashtra, he was made the Deputy CM. Have you ever heard of any person saying that once he was the CM and then he became the Deputy CM? It means that in India it is not digested that I am.  I have been on this post, I will work under him, but this is a lot of internal politics. Political parties do not fear the opponent as much as the people in the top positions of the political parties fear the opposition party.  Sister is as much in challenge with her party and this is a constant conflict and they are becoming the real leaders because the real leaders are only in less number. If you ask me in India, how many are the real leaders whom you will say are the real leaders, brother, from 152.  Total is not much  It is fun, but according to me, it is not very good for Indian democracy. I will try to explain it a little more so that you can understand this phenomenon. See, as MPs change, tickets of so many MPs have changed. Your MP was fine, you used it. Accessed with the ill will of not voting for the real leader, he was not the real leader, his ticket was canceled in a minute, tell me, the person who won by 6 lakh lakh votes, has he become so bad, will many people now say no?  merit  This is what we have to give to all the people, oh brother, you are not continuing, tell me, I have a tailor for many years, he takes good measurements, his system is good, some will be a confectioner for some, some will be a family doctor for some, I  People also see the gynecologist in the family as the one who gives birth to a child and they say, ' Brother, I too was born from this same person, my child will also be born from this same doctor, this is the same doctor, so that loyalty and that continuity is in India and people.  I remain appreciative and comfortable, as people learn many things from me, so it is not that I am the one who teaches many things, although I say that I am number one, but it is possible that someone can teach me a little better in some things.  That's fine but still people join because of comfort level, understanding level, continuity level, relationship, so now a political system has come in such a way that first of all there is familyism in it. Asked about, but those whose tickets have been cut now, they were not even people of family type, they were the only ones who were real leaders, like one or two or three in Rajasthan whose tickets have been cut, they have joined other parties and are now fighting, now they are obscene leaders.  Who is not afraid of coming here, everyone knows what is happening, what phenomenon is playing out, then these are the real leaders, only then, now I am not influencing anyone's vote here, I am saying this, you see this phenomenon.  In We feel like sitting in big cities in an air conditioned environment and getting our nails done smoothly by applying either polish, polish or cream cream and making them smooth. It is very easy for us. Yes, it is absolutely very easy to say that friend Bihar. Why do you vote for this party? You people of Bengal are crazy, you do it for this brother, he is benefiting from it, he is able to reach there, he is available, he is accessible, he knows that I will speak, my work will be done. Orders will not come from there, as they say, our orders are from here, the chain is short, that is, the chain of command, as they say, between the top and the bottom is short and they also have identity politics, their language is also understood. You must have seen my video somewhere with such colors and sherbets, that local party does not tell you to lose your identity, then if there is a party like Shiv Sena, then there are two factions in it.  Like NCP, it also has two factions and there is a huge comedy happening in Maharashtra, but I think the public has a lot of brains, they will know what to vote for, yes, they will know if the public is okay with it, then local identity and politics.  Whatever is there matters to them, they don't, those elders say, brother, what benefit do I get and the country's people, they say, which of the country, whom should I select, people and local will do it, some two MPs or four MPs from your local politics. with eight MP  If they come, then who are they who are anti-national, they will also do it whenever they see that when it comes to the country, no political party till date, ever since the country got independence, any situation of emergency has come, the emergency is not the 77-75 emergency, not the emergency like that.  I am saying that disaster has come, friend, everyone becomes one, everyone knows that brother, don't do like this at this time and that is a good thing, our democracy is fine in our country, but in the rest of the time, it would have played openly, not in normal time.  So it will happen and should happen, that is why the real leaders are in great demand in identification times, we are fine in election times, although I will make a video on that sometime too, that all this is foolishness, okay, it is very foolish, no astrologers. Politicians should not go too close because I will explain it on Astrology Channel that it does not help anything because you have so many horoscopes of your rivals. Wherever there is competition, I will give a little bit of astrology.  Wherever there is competition, you can be told something in isolation as to how your marriage will fare, but how will your marriage fare in competition with someone bigger, you will have to look at his/her horoscope also, so if you are fighting between yourself and who will win, then brother, both of you should know your real life.  We will have to tell the date of birth and time and if we find out that he is better then we will say that maybe his chances are better but we have not seen the horoscope of the third one who will actually win.  It is never easy, so much time and so much money and so much date of birth and time. The old ones, who are leaders, are born in poor countries, who are poor, all the leaders, their date of birth and time are also wrong, so some  The benefit is not practical and I tell these leaders and their work to stop talking to astrologers, there is no practical benefit, instead Guruji was telling me, predict, oh predict, anything can be predicted.  Where true and false and this will win this will win this who will win answer all can be done although I will predict but I will not use astrology in that Astrology has been reduced to a very small size in this matter Astrology is not made for prediction brother and how will it be predicted? You can predict the future of the chair, so many people are holding elections, 10 lakh people are giving the IAS exam by looking at the horoscope of 180.  You will make a prediction, meaning is it possible, that is your limit, not you, yes, at this time you will be in a good zone, then your performance will be better, but what position you are sitting on, that will become a little more of astrology, I will come back again.  I will come to this in my videos, you will get to visit many places for relaxation and you will get to learn a lot of things, so if you subscribe to the channel then I am explaining that a leader who He is a genuine leader, he does not need the support of the party like I am, it is okay, accept that I want to become a leader at some stage, although from within, sometimes anger comes out, I know that I can talk to many people well, leaders should have the ability to speak, okay.  One should know how to tell stories. Okay, one should know how to talk sweetly. All the work should be done by me. One should know how to understand people's mind well. Okay, one should know how to do all those things. There should be a cunning person inside, that's it.  It is missing just a little bit, rest I have all the ingredients to make the vegetable, everything is good with me, but if that cunning person has brought it from somewhere, he does not want to use the word which starts with H, HA, start it like this. It is H A R Haryana, not H A R A H A R A and then next comes some M and next comes something like this, I am not talking about that, I am not talking about fraud, if I use some good words then that.  so the public You should know how to use and throw leaders because look at the political parties, they use and throw their workers and their leaders in such a beautiful way. They will give tickets, then they will cut you off and they can't even speak, can't even do anything. The other party's small party is a party of justice, yet this one comes in creating a lot of hue and cry.  Those topper students are finger on lips, they are not able to say anything, we are retiring, how many people have left politics in Gujarat, okay, who was our health minister, he is opening his own ENT clinic, okay, what is his meaning?  Made me go through this because of realization, came because of them also realized, friend, it's not worth it, there is no power, there is no respect, there is no one, there is no you, for how long will you love someone like this  If you go alone then anyone can come and become you. This is the best time to become someone. If you also want to become a leader, anyone will be made any time because all those who do not stand in the fields, do not scare, such people are like this. Make anyone stand because the people are the same, we have to vote for them, only they will take care, so the level of discussion between political parties and the country is falling a lot. That is the message, so it is not identification.  Because it is necessary for the future of that country, we need strong leaders and respect of ideals. Unfortunately, if 30-40 years ago, if you had seen that eating khichdi was fine, you would say, this is not good, oh brother, the aspirations and that of keeping the country united.  It is very important that every person should be heard. This whole thing is going on like this, there is something wrong in it, I am telling you in some depth, if you are able to understand what I am saying.  I am saying that every friend is important, there was an ad by Ertel, Every friend of every kind is important, so we need every kind of leader, yes from you, I like this leader's philosophy, idol behavior and this thing view.  Points you can't but you can't say that then it remains only here because you like others will not like but if you have to exist with them then it is like if you go to eat in a hotel then you like dal bhati.  Churma You are a Rajasthani and I may be you no Marwari and I may be a foodie like me so I want dal bhati churma if I want dal bhati churma then do I have to eat dal bhati churma every time I like it so everyone eats the same or do we need a menu  No matter how little, you will have to divert the menu, do n't you think that you can eat this also, Dal Makhani is also there, this is also there, it is like this, it is like this, it happens because we cater to everyone's palette, every person, everything. Well, the second thing is that not all the people can like the same dish in all their lives. It is not like that which is your favorite dish, no one has it, like suppose I like fig barfi, I like fig ice cream, I have been in Gujarat a lot. I know that figs are also good for health but it does not mean that I should start eating figs every day. Fig barfi is also good sometimes. It is also my all time favorite thing.  Whatever happens, it cannot be your favorite all the time, you cannot say that this is the actor, this is my favorite, I do n't want to watch anyone else's movie, there should be no other actor, only this should be my actor and so on.  Let it remain the same and only this should progress and make only these pictures because tomorrow he will go to make big pictures and everyone else will be thankful to you, so you have no choice, so let leaders be there, let dabang leaders be there.  And today we have told you the definition of who is the real leader. The real leader is the one who does not have a leader himself. If there is a leader above him, like us, they live like us, all of them are squirrels, so squirrels are not leaders. Leaders are numbered in every party.  There are no more than two or three in k and"

    "title": "Attitude , Confidence And Arrogance ｜ What Society Needs To Understand Now ？ [Xe1UZqrkqq8].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today is a very deep topic, it is a very important topic for the society, of course it will also be political, that is why it is coming on this political channel only and today we will talk about the word attitude. You must have heard the word attitude, it is a different English word, you must have understood that too.  Arrogance is okay or you can say arrogance, its equivalent is okay, then we will discuss that in India, now if you look carefully, look everywhere around you, it is okay, do it like this and look everywhere Public Media  There is a huge lack of attitude anywhere in the space. Lack of arrogance. One, I am talking about common people, I am talking about normal people, one is there is a lot of fear, one is also confidence. If women have more confidence, then we will blame that too.  Arrogance is understood. Recently, I had earlier made a video on Vinesh Phogat. You must have seen Vinesh Phogat ji also tried to paint her something like this. Women will be confident wherever they are.  So only one will be called arrogant, this is also a life, this is the truth of I, the second thing I want to say here is that if you have knowledge then there will be attitude, if you have skill set then there will be attitude, if you have talent then there will be attitude, if you are rich then there will be attitude.  If there is, there will be attitude but this attitude has been broken on this political dispensation and eco system, the result is in this country, even in a country, there is attitude.  It should be there, it is not there because only one person has shown attitude, he has given 56 inches to them only, the rest of the coms are communities who run with attitude on default setting, they will try to crush them also like this.  Me, my personal thing is that our community is like a Jat community from which I also come, the attitude is of a default setting, sometimes I also consider myself Guruji type.  So I see, I am not supposed to be like this much, sometimes I even laugh, brother, sometimes he says like me, I belong to the same community, I take you, so many times, and I talk to you, no, I claim myself as you.  I have to tell people that I am above caste, so I troll even my own people, when someone comes, okay, brother, why are you showing so much attitude, then that triggered me, okay? And I'm and then the other person said that no, I'm not taking anything, I'm alive and that's what set me thinking that wow man, it's really a free thing that I have an attitude.  The people of the state say Bhokal, okay then I do n't want to talk nonsense, that Bhokal is useless and carry a gun and father and mother and all that.  This is ridiculous work, I will never support that stupid things but what I want to tell is that if someone is an intellectual, the governor of RBI is someone, which governor is he? Write his name. Mind of his own is intellectual, so is brother's attitude too.  It will happen and you should be able to tolerate it if you want to take the country forward, it is something like you understand Kattappa, people need Baahubali. Want to handle because Kattappa does n't have attitude, Kattappa, does Baahubali have attitude? Does Baahubali's wife also have attitude? There is a dialogue by Shiva Gami in that movie that if it suits Shiva Gami's daughter-in-law so much, then that's that.  What I'm talking about is you'll find that this attitude causes problems to many people. It's a good attitude. Anybody attitude, I will see a little who admires me, it seems that people troll in religion worm, unfortunately such an environment has happened in our country, but still I have to say, Shahrukh Khan ji, Shahrukh Khan ji has his own attitude, he is a family man, he has money.  I am hardworking, I am from a middle class background, I have a race in it, I have airing, I like it, it's okay and that's what I am talking about.  The person who is the boss in the organization or is reaching a good place or can reach or can get promotion or should reach, that person will have his own attitude and that attitude is no longer liked by the system and the people who know them also look at them as useless. Being proud when there is nothing is foolishness, but our society is becoming such that if a person shows a little attitude, it creates an irritation. I also show my attitude, I am number one clarity.  Many people feel good and many people feel very bad, this is a fact but I want to say this in life, brother, you also keep it, friend, such countries keep some attitude, there should be some truth behind it, there is no nara nara attitude when  I say I am India's number one clarity, give it means that in your life I am number one, if someone is better than me then tell me, maybe there will be someone but you are near him, maybe you cannot listen to him. You have to pay 5 lakh rupees to listen, maybe he is a great clarity giver, I say when I am number one it means in your life, if not then you tell me and tell him who is in your life and if I am not number one  So tell me the truth, whatever will happen in your life, I am wishing that everyone in our country should have at least a little bit of pride. Arrogance is also a thin line. It comes with no performance. And that top leader is a little visible in the government and all those things, one of his own, his own thing is going on, nothing is visible, do a little, show a little, if there is a little, then accept it and now after 10 years, the son-in-law is seeing more.  That friend, nothing can be seen happening and they cannot tolerate anyone else. Now if you talk about attitude, then if you see, many people like the attitude of Rahul Gandhi ji, it was like this and because it was not visible because of so much emotion.  It has happened in this country that there has been such a lack of attitude that now if anyone shows even a little, it feels good. When Rahul ji stands up and speaks in the Parliament, he is a devotee and is absolutely from the ruling party. They also think, 'Come on, I am saying something, yes, you also answer' and then you like that your performance is not good, so this is a welcome change in the country, I just wanted through this video. Bring out this phenomenon that is this attitude. If it is your child who shows attitude, don't spoil it in anything, son, don't be proud, son, let me see what is there in the son, is there anything in the daughter, is there anything like this, there must be a little or a lot of that, you. Someone like our beloved Acharya Prashant ji, who reads Geeta ji very well and then invests some of his own money, he too has the attitude of 'I have read it, you have read it, is it okay friend?'  So we will tolerate your attitude also, no problem, Jaggi Vasudev Sadhguru ji, we will see in him too, if he has that attitude, then it is okay, accept it, start accepting a little, attitude and there may be only certain things and that will come, genuine will come, it is not necessary.  It is coming from something, Ramdev ji many times says that how much knowledge have you taken, what is it, where is the certificate from, so I say to Ramdev ji.  Asking for yoga certificate, Ramdev ji has the attitude that he asks me, he talks to me like this, that too is good luck, sometimes you have to give up before the court vote, you have to write an advertisement and that too, look at every person, he lives on  Despite that, attitude is not a very bad thing and when everyone in the country has it, the country will also have an attitude. If I have seen the biggest attitude, then whose is America vs United States of America?  America, every person has his own attitude, one should be an American, oh wow, very nice, very nice smile, what does it mean that he is average than an American, you look at him, talk to him, look at the movies, look at Hollywood's, look at social media, they approve of the world's very nice very  Good you are doing good man you are doing meaning think like us brother you tu tu laat saab who is taking from you bravo means ok you stay in your attitude if this country  If you want to learn, then learn from Jats. Sardar brothers also have the attitude of ours, I think in a better way, and that is good because it comes with feeling also, I also like that very much, it comes from the feeling that we  Whenever disaster strikes, the first langar Sardar ji opens for our brothers. Whatever happens, they will open there. If they have the capability to do all that, they also have the attitude towards their capability. So what?  If there is a problem then we should learn from everyone, we should have attitude, attitude is a good thing, this attitude is everywhere, if one was broken then the second one became happy, if the other was broken then the third one became happy that it is good, then one day everyone was broken for the last 10 years.  Everyone has been broken, everyone has been made to sit, now no one is happy because no one has anything, now someone shows a different attitude, it feels very good that I have greatness in you, you have spoken big because He made everyone disappointed, it was something like someone used to be the master in the class, what did the old ones do, all the children have their own politics, some children might be bullies, some like this, there are all kinds of people in the class.  Remember, the old ones know better that the school master used to slap and even punish with a stick, then one was punished and the rest were happy, then the turn of the other one came, then the rest became happy, then one day everyone's turn came. Went  Now all the children sat like this and Master ji, I am this Master Dinana Chauhani, I am taking the example of this dirty Master ji, not of the good Master. There are many teachers who are sadistic, you all must have encountered them, everyone has encountered them as much as the old ones.  You must have seen that nowadays a good system is running, all this does not happen in schools, but you understand what I am saying, if any of your brothers is showing this attitude in the country, then you should smile right now.  The picture will come Pushpa Pushpa Raj, that picture is a super hit, there is a first part, there is also a second part that India needs to be Pushpa now, it is okay if it means there should be an attitude, that attitude should come from somewhere among the average Indian, we have outsourced it to a man. According to me, who is that person in the whole country who has been outsourced? Respected Modi ji, for how long can Modi ji carry it, he cannot do it, not just one person, it should be in the whole country, brother, in the whole country. Nothing much against him also but the system was made in such a way that only one person will be cheered, no one else will be cheered even in the party, all of them will be out of the screen, no one will get the footage, it's just me, me, me, not only me, not myself.  Do you like Pushpa? You guys like Pushpa. Tell everyone. So, are we Pushpa? When Pushpa has an attitude, it comes through something. These days, it is the one with the hand and it is placed like this and so on.  That song comes today, Mera Brand Yeh Woh To Kuch Jo Bhi Hai I am not saying that now I will give such an example to people, people will say that he is saying to become a criminal, oh brother, this first order person please go away friend, poet from this channel. You can understand what he is trying to say, now there are many more videos ahead, after thinking first, what are you trying to say, become a sandalwood smuggler, many times you have to act like this and tell that there are many like this now.  You must be writing, he will stop now, he said it, this can also happen, you must be writing, what does he want now, no, I am speaking in a positive way, I am talking about attitude, there should be a good attitude behind it, which should be of knowledge. If you want to learn the attitude from someone, which is mine, off late, whose I am, very few people's I still do not use the word fan, fan, I always say, it should not be late, I am liking.  Some buddy and some buddy attitude is ok, now no one can troll on this and do nothing, Magnus Magus is the one I have said, his second surname will you tell, it starts with C and who is he? He is a top player of chess, look at his reels.  Look at his attitude, look at him, he is amazing, he comes running like this, keeps his style, he is like Golu Molu and brother, it is not only difficult to defeat him, it is impossible, he has lost once or twice.  Parag defeated him but he is very good, he is good and very intelligent, he talks very well, it seems he has attitude but a little bit of that, you follow him and see what you see, he is extremely high IQ, rational  An intelligent person comes out of such things. Any random position will win in chess and he plays very, very well. He has a very good attitude. He is from Norway. Magnus, write the period completely and check. Okay, so this is an attitude that we have to keep. So, those who did not understand from Pushpa's example, then I will just tell you the name of Magnus Carlsen. Okay, so try to understand from her example. It should happen and not a bad thing. It doesn't mean that there will be only one person, he is the only one, we don't have anything, everyone has something, to be confident and thin line is arrogance and let me tell you the difference.  A confidence is a great confidence than over confidence. Arrogance is that without any knowledge, genuine knowledge, genuine means stuff is foam, foam is nothing but air, air is buzzing from arrogance and second arrogance is that you are knowledgeable, what benefit do I get from this, I can learn something from you. Nahi raha hai attitude is ki yes brother I am good yes I am not arrogant I like you but I can't tolerate nonsense it's okay  Intelligent People Smart People Successful People People With Good Skills People With Good IQ People Who Are Achievers People Who Are Oriented Focused Will Always Have This Attitude If You Kill This Attitude You Will Not Have True People Then You Will Become A Stupid Country And Here Many  I am repeatedly made to think that I should not be made to have the attitude that someone is sitting with, if the attitude is this  The point is that brother, if you have to get along and if you want, then this is also an attitude and all those who are following you can live in this attitude and it is okay you are still bringing value to the life of Sambayika it will come.  Guru Tattva will be more, Guru will be one among all Gurus, normal people call it a word pride, I call it attitude, I call it Guru Tattva, and will be and will be until it is not there. Till then he can't empower you. Till you understand like this, I will say that I do n't have much intelligence, I am very weak like this, come, don't learn anything from me, it is something like that your instructor is mack, he is a legend, he has got five kills. This air to air combat is what we are going to teach, then this generation of students sees it like this, you are good, then we have to give again, just to prove. Attitude does not work. Today's generation is Janji, they are like us, I interact with them a lot, first of all they are like, ok, you are Guruji, tell me this, ok tell me this, ok tell me this, then it becomes like this, but  Wants some power, needs power without power, the one who is carrying the attitude is a crazy butch arrogant man, I hope I told you as an example and now every man will write about me in the comment section, who is listening till now.  Will you go towards attitude and is that something that you can have an attitude about, knowing how to cook good food is also an attitude, whether a woman knows it or a man knows it, a woman knows it, she can keep it, like I make potato pots.  I am not like this, no one makes it, so after making it up, there should be something, there should be potatoes, otherwise tea, that tapri seller is a tea seller, he is thin to the size, has big hair, he is like this, who serves tea to Bill Gates?  the one  I am remembering his name, I am like this, what do you like about him, we liked his attitude, he has style and skill too, brother, it is coming out like me, even if you burn your hands while sifting, then the skill is definitely there.  If someone is putting it like this then the skill is definitely there but he is also adding some value, he is doing entertainment, he is having fun, it feels good to see him, then if such people have style then they have to make everyone like them in life. Attitude is not the inheritance of one person, in this country other people can also have it, you people can also have it, this is a free country, there is democracy, there is freedom, have fun, enjoy, then how many people will be inspired by this, now they will bring attitude to enjoy and if they search for it then bring it in something.  And brother, if there is no such thing in your life then create something like I am Ludo champion, snake and ladder champion is ok or I am card champion, food champion, anything my friend.  No one can do it better than me, no one can do it better than me, do something, I hope you will like it and these are abstract topics, no one makes, no one explains, it is necessary to make and tell, in this way the country can move forward.  If you think it can be done then please write in the comment section. Thank you very much."

    "title": "Aukaat And Great Indian Comedy Circus [OA2U6FAxgqU].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, very interesting topic Aukat and the Great Indian Comedy Circus, although world comedy has been done but there is a lot of sadness in it, it will be known through the video, it will be fun and a little consciousness will also be awakened, okay today if you watch the Indian setup, Indian  If you look at the setup, here we all are busy in showing our status to everyone. Let me tell you as an example: Girls are showing status to boys. Boys want to show status to girls. Husband is showing status to wife.  The wife is showing her status to her husband. The mother-in-law is showing her status to the daughter-in-law. Along with her status, the daughter-in-law is also teaching law. The master is showing his status to the servant. The employer is showing his status to the employee. The employee is showing his status to the employer. 70 hours  We will not be able to do this, we will not be able to do this, parents are showing their status to their children that they will not get property, you do not work with good manners, this is  Children do not do the opposite, they are showing their status to their parents. So if you do something like this, then we are going to Canada. Parents are showing their status to their children. Children are showing their status to their parents. People of one caste are showing status to people of another caste.  They are showing what fraternity is, now I will tell you what fraternity I am saying, one fraternity is showing status to another fraternity, the policeman is showing status to the lawyer, the lawyer is showing it to the judge.  The IPS people are telling the IAS people that we come here to earn money, we collect it from the government, we IRS are saying that basically everyone is showing off their status and you are saying that youtube1 comes and sparks come out. Everything is like this, the public is busy, doctors are showing it to NursesLabs, NursesLabs 's own work is going on, mine is better, mine is white, mine has good written on it, my old one is  Your new, your like this, mine like this, your useless, my good, my great, your small, my followers, more, yours, less, here, more, there, more, here, more, these will show more status and these news people too and India has shown status to Pakistan, the country is also showing status.  States are also showing their status, one by one, you will see in your country, States, I will not give you water, I will show you your status, and if flood comes, I will leave your water, okay then this.  Smoke will be rising from your place, smoke is rising from there, I can't breathe, I will show you my status only then the states are also showing their status among themselves, all people have one meaning, whatever talk city you are saying, what you are saying in life or  That thing is no more, that taste is no more, that fun is no more, the sorrow has spread, this is a toxin brother, this is a business of showing off your status, stop enjoying this status, stop showing yourself off and everyone is yours.  Know your status, if your stomach is not cleared, if you have constipation, please eat some roughage, eat some figs, take some raisins, fix your stomach, pay attention to your health, pay attention to your child, you are not getting a job anywhere, you are going to fight to play religion, you are roaming around in caste.  If your child is not getting a job then you are wondering whether he can get some benefit of reservation or if no one gets it then it will be applied only then you should check that your child has the same number of marks or just half of them. It was only a number and it was going to be created by that, so much negativity and toxicity. Ever since Covid came, something has shaken up in the world, there has been shaking in our country too, something has shaken up and due to that shaking, the old one has become its own.  The thing was that the old thing is no longer my own, is this also a fact or not, please tell me but when you see this everywhere, all the videos in which he bit her, this showed him his status, today he came to know his status this  think everything and see  We will have to stop doing this completely. Gender is showing status to each other. It is visible in the cast. It is visible in religion. It is visible in jobs. Someone who has become something is showing status to those who are not going to become it. Those who have not become are showing their status to those who are going to become. He is also showing his quotation to everyone, which is called setting everyone, I have set it, if you put so much energy, then there will be no taste in life. Look at this show, look at the show, see the world doing it, don't do it yourself and the world.  Whatever you do, they will try to show you their status. Everyone see their own status. How much work is enough for me, how much can I invest, how much can I eat, how much exercise can I do, how can I handle the relationship.  I will teach these things in great detail, beautifully and very well in my iconic course Happiness Course 2.0 in the end of November, you will have 2 hours of WhatsApp chat over a period of a month.  If it is weekly or fortnightly then he can take ₹ 2500000. If he does well, then most of the attention goes here. When a person's focus is on increasing his own status, then there is no need to show, explain or humiliate others.  If you show such a big status that no one causes any trouble, then if you go on that path then this business that is going on is comedy, it is very strong and there is a sadness behind the comedy, all this is done to show status to everyone.  I am busy in parking the car, I will show it to you. There is no parking inside the house. Outside, one neighbor is showing it to the neighbor. You don't know who I am. Politicians are visible everywhere and are being shown their status. The public will show the politicians their status to the public.  Someone is showing off to someone else, the party leader is showing off to the big ones, those who ask more questions are being shown their status somewhere, then they are showing their status that brother, we are just bags and bags like this.  Taking the frame, we also know something about you, all the people are revealing everyone's secrets, that is, everyone is showing inferiority to everyone and ultimately everyone is saying this, then what is right in this, who is intelligent and who is sensible, many people are not able to understand this thing. Competition is the whole competition in a job. Whoever is the head of the department is showing his status to the people below him. Within your schools, the principal is showing his status to the teachers. The teachers are showing him. Then in the parent teacher meeting, the parents go and show their status to the teachers, everyone is showing it to everyone, this is so much negativity, we as society have to first accept this comedy, this comedy is going on and then it has to be stopped, brother, who is showing it to whom, why?  Yes, you will show that this is the word of social media, which has been promoted by this news channel and they show that we showed this to this, this one showed this to this, now everyone is holding that thing and showing it to each other. Realize your self, do your own introspection, look at yourself, where you are rich, where you are going, what you are, so much energy in the external situation, what you are extracting, you will not reach anywhere with this, there is a little bit of criticism, there is some dialogue.  There is dialogue in dialogue, you are contributing in dialogue and for that you cut someone's point, that is not showing status, showing status is like, above this, just all, all.  You have come to the stage of saying something, there is nothing to do with dialogue in discussion, there is interest in dispute whereas there should be interest in dialogue, so how many of you are for dialogue type dialogue or dispute, those who enjoy it are very good.  If there is fun in dispute, then there is no dispute, we only enjoy in dispute, we enjoy in showing our status, we have to show our status to everyone, these people have shown our status for so many years, now our turn is coming, now we have to show them our status.  Will you tell me their status? Will you tell me then where are you reaching? I told you then yours has increased. If everyone is telling each other, then look at yourself, go in the mirror, what is your status, what is your net worth, bank balance, assets, your intelligence, your appearance.  Look at where life is going, look at your status and keep it as yours, then when you know yours, then what is the problem if someone is telling you about you, you know that yours is mine, now he is showing yours below and above.  He is showing me, he is taking me somewhere else, you are saying, friend, don't show me, do I know mine or do I know about mine, I am roaming around with the numbers of my life, so everyone focus on your numbers, subscribe to That's the Message channel. Otherwise, subscribe, very good feedback is coming, share the messages and those who want to take happiness course then h2 on the number given below."

    "title": "Baarish, Landslide And Tourist Places [oEALyMw_nss].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, recently we saw during the rainy season and every year we see all the religious places in our Uttarakhand, these are the ones inside Wayanad, we got to see land slides, generally we get to see a lot of nature's wrath inside the hills.  These days these videos are made from somewhere or the other pan India in this season and there are more of them and there are a lot of deaths too, so I want to ask one thing about it here because when I have done the research I have reached there.  I am talking about Wayanad, it is not my research. Don't say that no, there is Congress there, that's why you do. Wayanad, I believe is not a religious tourism place, it is okay and that too now green will come in it, which is a very good thing.  Yes, but I should include that also, I should also include Goa, I would also like to include religious tourism and other tourism as well. I want to tell this that these mountains were built not for the infrastructure of tourism.  They thought that hotels should be built here and so many people would come here and in religious tourism, I am also an astrologer and I also understand and explain religion and all our pilgrimages were built in this spirit. What is pilgrimage in your opinion?  Those of the 12th house or the ninth house of religion, by mixing both of them, it becomes one thing that you do penance or somewhere you have difficulty in going into that thing, only then it becomes a value, if we are so good there.  If we build infrastructure and roads and tunnels inside the mountains and balance the ecology, then people called tourists reach there. There is a difference between pilgrims and tourists. You understand that tourists will also go and drink alcohol.  Will also create a stir, will do all the work and we watch small reels and videos. We go to all our religious places and see that be it Kedarnath or Badrinath, there is something strange happening there.  They are among the poorest of the poor and are dancing like this in a strange way. They have created a new system and the trustees of the local temple, the local priest, whatever you call the local administration, they are there.  There is a lot of opposition to crack down, but this nuisance is not ending. Now what is happening as a result? So many hotels and tourism and all these things have come up there that the ecology has already been shaken.  That Jhanga tower is where children play, otherwise if anything happens, it falls like that. No road was to be built there. No, otherwise, what development will not take place there? The hills do not want it. They are unhappy with whatever bare minimum is there for them. Could have done this much, tourism cannot be increased everywhere, keep a little adventure also, they will add this everywhere, they will add that, they will add that there, they will add this tunnel rescue, had seen how with so much difficulty they are making this and that achievement everywhere.  Tell me about Char Dham Yatra, after doing this journey, it is a typical one, I am very fond of Gujarati but it seems to me to be a very wandering culture of Gujarati or not, we have to go very easily because there is no physical fitness to climb, I am not painting everyone.  I am telling the butt age, I am linking because the top leadership there comes from the same state, that push is from there and I have also been in that state a lot and I have many friends and dear ones and they themselves also speak Amit. brother it's just like this  It should not be there, it should not reach everywhere, reach everywhere, tourism is not a matter of tourism, it is that, it is faith, there should be a degree of difficulty, like the temple of Vaishno Devi is ready made, ready made, ready made, that kind of essence you  Look, giving one facility and making it in such a way that no one knows how anyone can come here at any time and that is the difference between the two things and it is very difficult to balance the ecology because there is always someone there.  Someone  Will go and all those doing business will come. Local people are very irritated because they are not getting any direct benefit. All the big business houses and business ventures and five star hotels outside you reach Ayodhya. What benefit is the local getting?  Yes, I see why we are suffering here because we lost because whatever land rates increased and which plots were cut, which groups, which hotels, which businessmen, who got contracts, only they benefited.  What happened is that they are left there only to ring the bell, nor are the local people left there just to ring the bell, the outsider will come just to ring the bell, all the people throw garbage and do so much dirty, yes, we are so dirty, I mean, perhaps some rule has come out in Himachal now that tourists  If we come, we will bring our bags and carry with us whatever smell we spread, we will not leave it there in Himachal, we will have to make these strict rules, we will not be able to live anywhere, in fact the rest of the foreigners would just call us out.  They are our bad ones, but we have a lot of difficulty in saying this in religious places. Some are here, there is a waterfall, some are mountains, there are beer bottles lying there, they are eating their food upside down, they are wearing clothes upside down, why are you spoiling the vibes? Yes, yes, then we are included in this. I myself am a religious person who follows religion very well. I said that I am a professional astrologer. I also make a living from these things. I don't go myself. I don't say.  Go there, I will add to it, I have a lot of respect for Shivji, I love him very much, I have a lot of respect for him, but I am so sure that I will not go there and destroy that place, pick up the car.  Let's take our 10 people and go there, let's go here, four money in our pocket, let's misbehave there, stay in hotels, hotels and hotels and hotels, and what is ours, see, we have done the same thing in Goa, those five star hotels too.  Is  They are also cheap because in India our class system is not such that there are four hotels only that many and they go to the control way and they say there will not be four to six hotels, one is a hotel for the rich and one for the upper middle.  One belongs to the upper class, one belongs to the lower class, one belongs to the poor, Dharamshala, it is not like this, there is no control, no one opens something, opens something and then the cry comes out, oh we have been robbed, oh we are dead and everyone has to go even in the rains because hotels are cheap.  then there lines lines  There will be more mutiny and administration will be done. Local people always know that yes, mutiny is going to break out because they are there. This linear slide is not like it is happening today, I am telling you that it was always happening but now it has increased more because of you.  So much of their mountains have been cut down and there everything is ecologically ruined, now the local man knows what will happen, he will not go to die, more than half of them will die, those who are taking selfies with their faces raised.  And they will go in this season because they get hotels at half the rates. At less than half the rates, we are walking on foot even from the mind. It is a very big country, that is fine. We are walking on foot also from the mind. We have to save money also, a leech.  Pana is the word which I would use meaning which I don't want to use but this is the one which spreads dirt, there is no intelligence, there is no situational awareness, there is no fear of dying, we are okay somewhere  Will go to such a place and then go there and open their mouths and then what will happen after that, these pilgrims will get trapped, now Air Force helicopters will be called, now NDRF team will be deployed, now they will come, now they will come, now army will be deployed, the same work is being done everywhere.  First of all, spread the dirt, use your brain, not your mind. Is there a politician who wants to do politics of four vote banks? He will create a thing at one place which should not have been created, then he will reach the point of madness, which will not go anywhere.  It was necessary and we will reach that time when we should not have gone at all, then use the system of the country, use its helicopters, then you use the army, use NDRF and then take a photo of it and then say how good it is.  Everyone worked and everything is so good, I mean, no one will ask, Hello brother, this raita was in the first place, why was it in the first place, no one is going to ask questions, why did this happen and not this? Ecology has deteriorated, this is the changing thing, hey, you go and build Jhanga Tower, you have built a tower, it is fine, you go into it and say no, I will build it and I will build it, you take it out, it is a children's game, you must have seen it, if it is okay.  They keep making blogs like this, then you shake it, if the wind comes, it will fall, then you will say, oh yes, this wind has started blowing more these days, it did not blow earlier, oh everything used to happen earlier also, earlier also this land slide used to come but  There was no one there to die, there was no one there to make a video, then something came, nature used to fall on its own, then something grew there, then there were animals, only then there was a little space to settle down everywhere, there is a little space to reach everywhere, this is Australia is such a big country in size that this crazy bunch of people can reach Australia sitting in six cities or even reach somewhere in the middle or do not live so far in between. Tell me how can they reach everywhere, haven't they tried? Do research, I am all in the pole.  Like Rathi ji, I will not be able to make a video with 15 people in the team, but if you understand what I am saying, then good citizen, stop going here, the same incidents happen every time, otherwise we will roam around, yes, how? Take a tour of the desert there, there will be no landslides or fruits, go there in winter, we feel like going to the mountains in summer, go to Switzerland, and you are trying to promote outsiders, no soft power too.  is made  You will also bring four knowledge and after going there you may get a chance for a job or a chance for a business. Otherwise, it has been said here that we have to promote locally, someone for a local man, promote for a local man.  This is not happening at one place. Let me tell you openly what happens many times. Tourism worth Rs. 500 crores is happening there. There is destruction of Rs. 5000 crores, which will all be a blind slide. Then this hotel gets washed away.  The men got carried away and then the NDRF team, if Rs 5000 crores have to be destroyed to make a business worth Rs 500 crores, then it is not called a business, it is called a loss, it is called Bawli Butch, it is better to spend Rs 500 crores somewhere outside, make gains from there and go outside.  Go earn foreign exchange from there and send that exchange back to India like Gujaratis and Keralites send, the political ideals of both are different, Kerala.  And you also know the religion-worm system of Gujarat, secular and this-that who talk like all the idols are different, who is BJP inside Gujarat, you know their idol for how many years and who is Congress and CPI inside Kerala. Their idol is completely different but the people here are doing the same work, they nurture their state, make them rich, do good, Gujaratis do it in India also, the difference is that the businesses in Gujarat are relatively  It is more than Kerala, but tourism is also there in Kerala, it is okay, but there are a lot of educated people in Kerala too, okay, so this can be done, you can go out, earn a lot of money and start your own business or some such venture.  You can start it at home, the family members are happy, an illiterate, sorry, educated boy is preparing for the exam here, the child is not earning anything else, better than that, the parents will say, son, you go out and earn money, some parent 80  He is not turning a year old so soon, he will probably need it when you will be 80, now he is only 55 years old, you can live comfortably for 15, 20, 25, 30 years, earn money, when the money comes, then money has to treat someone.  The child has to do it, the doctor has to do it, whoever has the money, someone comes to see, the problem is that there is no money, no one comes to see for free, if the poor have problems, then go to these places.  Go and stop going, they will be saved and what about nature, let me tell you one very good thing about nature. You can make a garden anywhere, garden is fine, plant different flowers and plants in it, make it very beautiful, cut the grass every day, keep a gardener. Plant four-five fava etc., it is beautiful, it is fine and you leave it for three-four months, leave it for six months, do not do anything in it, it will completely rot, it will completely die and the tree will fall and rust will come, so this means rust is nature will always. RECLAIM If you leave the forest, you don't have to go and water it. In the forest, give water, cut some leaves, trim them, no, it comes on its own, then nature is never disturbed, we are very birds about nature, nature is so.  Brother will adjust on its own after cleaning you, nature is not going anywhere people are very worried about mother earth no no no be worried about yourself don't trouble mother earth mother earth will kill you  You will fly away, nothing will happen to Mother Earth. Life on Mother Earth is an issue. We have to save ourselves, so do n't do such things by going there. Stop going to the hills. Stop going to the most remote places where there is ecology. Stop going in the rains. Give it okay, go anywhere with your face raised, then say come to save us, this has happened, this has to happen every time, and now the same scenes will be seen and that water is coming, water is coming like this, here, here, now.  these many people  Well, my thoughts were tantrums in real estate, I used to say never buy a place in the hills, I have been saying this for many years, before real estate, I have a separate channel, I am guiding people in it, my videos are still lying there where I  These tourists have been guided and do not take the place of Pahadi Puri, your entire ecology will become like this, then it is not worth living there, do not live there, it seems that you cannot live there, then there are sewerage issues there, water has come, land slide has come.  Went  Dirt has come, disease has come, cholera, cholera, any disease can spread here, there can be issues of water sanitation, there is no sewerage pipe system there, how will the pipe go like this in the mountains, in a ground, you have water and this is like this.  Put it there, pay it is not easy, if someone is here, then how to pay it by pumping, it is not easy. One who knows even a basic logic means there is no need to know much physics, you do not have civil engineering.  It is very difficult. Maintenance of sanitation in the mountains is very difficult. Be it drinking water, sewerage or any such things, please go and avoid them. And if you are fond of traveling too much, then earn four more paise. Go out and gain knowledge.  Do it and take a good photo and learn how they live decently and get a job there and do good for your country. It will be a good service and these hills.  That you don't worry about your hill brothers, many of them are employed in government jobs, the government is also taking great care of them and they know how to live their lives. Even when tourists did not go there, they used to live very peacefully even today.  Ask them whether they are benefiting a lot from tourism. They say, what are we benefiting from? Which hill is this hotel? Which Uttarakhandi 's hotel is this hotel? All the hotels are here. Now, the hotels of which place are there? Which local man came to the hotel from where? The local man is selling clothes there like a Chhotu. Yes, he is selling clothes, so at least he is earning from it. He would have done something anyway and even if you did not have a hotel. He would have lived, he was living earlier also, his ancestors were living, you don't do any favor by going, or on the contrary, you earn money and invest it there and go there and destroy the world, then as a good citizen stop going, I am saying this.  remained  I am a very ecological free place and what they say is, don't go when you get the call, which happens in Vaishno Devi, neither the mother has called you, let's call you, the mother has called you, so if it happens then please go, but forcefully yes.  Yes, this time yes, I have to go, let's do some work while sitting, it's okay, start roaming around in the mountains, it's okay, don't do this thing, don't do this thing, the country is suffering a lot, there is no benefit, I am telling you, no, that  to local people  Local people will take care of their own, no, those taxi drivers are local people, no problem, they will take care of theirs, if we refuse, it will never go to zero, but only if we create this kind of awareness, we will be able to control ourselves a little otherwise.  When everything is washed away there, the taxi driver did not become rich, he lost everything, his house was also there, he had to live there, then again the car ran away, what was left of the one who was driving, which government taxi is there when the car is washed away?  gives  If you buy it again, it is causing a lot of loss, so I hope you will understand this video, share it, like it, thank you very much."

    "title": "Bhaisaab Politicians Galat Kaam Ke Liye Bolte Hain [U9kRrFHeSWw].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, this is a very deep topic. It is very important. Many people will gain knowledge from this. The topic is, 'Polytan makes people do wrong things. This is the issue of many government employees, call it corruption, call it Nimap, call it an issue. Those who are outside the government, they are treated like this.  Let's see, the government people themselves are very worried. This comment also comes to me in the comments. If you wish wrong, the politician gets transferred, then beyond this, I am going to give clarity to this topic. I am going to tease, it is very easy to say in the media on news channels that the government is corrupt or corrupt or the government employees are corrupt or so. We understand its phenomenon. We understand the compulsions because it is like this in life and what is there and what to do.  And if you are facing this then what should you do, how should you tell, it would be great, before that I have a request, I used to put the request at the end, I forgot to do it, so I will do it at the beginning. Please subscribe if you see this. Because this content will be seen more, this kind of thing will bring a lot of awareness in the society, what is the bitter frustration, compulsion and hopelessness will reduce, so please subscribe and add one or two more subscribers to your close family and friends.  There is a request in the beginning itself because it increases the profit when the subscribers increase. This is a very good content line. Let's discuss it further also in the depending on seniority department. Like most.  There are those below, Group D, Group C, Group B, Group A. Many officers complain that if the politician speaks like this, otherwise we will have to do it. And what is the fear? The fear is not actually the fear, it is not about the posting, the fear is that it is wrong.  Even if you do work, there is a fear of getting trapped. It is not that there is immunity. If there was such immunity because it is changing, then 1015 years ago it used to be like this: Politician said something wrong and you did it.  If you are his friend then don't get trapped and he used to do this, he used to do this to politicians and those who are in government and officials, he used to do this many years ago but now this latest thing has come, this politician will also be thrown like a hot potato.  It will also get inside, it doesn't have that much power, so it can't give you any immunity. You also know that this is the only problem, otherwise where was the problem? 80 90 Where was the problem before?  152 years ago or before, there was no problem that if you do this you will die and if you don't do it you will die, that is why there is a problem, otherwise what was the problem, then the biggest problem is that if the friend does not do it then he will take away his wife and children.  We are studying, we have a wife and children, our children are getting educated, we will have to stay away, we will have to live in a small town and we will have to do ups and downs, life will be complete like this and if it is done then file for 1 year.  It will open even after 2 years, 3 years, 5 years or it can open even after three months and it will not take any hand, it has no authority of its own, this has also become a truth, whatever level of pressure any politician puts on it today.  They do this by someone of their own, they will get the ticket next, they have no status, there is no such powerful leader left that they say yes, we are the top, they themselves do not know, even the CM does not know that his chair will remain and you know the Chief Minister should also be changed.  So much  You must have seen which parties change how the officers are posted in two-three years, the normal ones are posted in a hurry, the posted ones are done sooner, the CMs are also changed, this one was changed, this one was changed in the middle, this one was changed in the middle, like this you also changed.  You have seen that no one has anything, there is a lot of stress in this time and it is a matter of concern for the government employees, that is why I am saying that when we discuss this in the government, we will discuss it in the future as well. Now the video is playing smoothly because  If it is affecting your life so much then less  If I bring such videos, just like the topic of bringing those videos. Those who are not directly affected themselves should understand the pain and helplessness of the government employees. First of all, the government employees have to bring this thing out and bring it out only. Not in my comments or by joining me, everywhere and you can send this video as an awareness shield that yes, this is the truth that if you don't do it, then you will get angry, what is a politician dispeller, what is a wrong thing, it is not that it is a very wrong thing.  Someone says that it is not a very wrong thing, but basically what is the wrong thing which is not according to the procedure, it is a shortcut, whatever is a method, there is a protocol, there is a procedure to do things because the politician does not have the patience and especially this video.  This becomes important because the elections are coming now, now there is less time left in the elections, so many people are in a hurry to show up, brother, any contract is left out, somewhere a road has to be built, somewhere a drain has to be built.  It has to be cut, it has to be made, something has to happen, there is a way for it to be published like this, it will be published in the newspaper, there is Avon, then there is bidder, it has to go through electronic media, it should be in so many newspapers, then that will come, then that will come out, now the politician does not have time for that.  It has to be done quickly in the back date, do it quickly, just get it done on paper, look at Dayspring, whether he follows it or not, that's a different thing, rules, everyone knows what is right and what is wrong.  Everyone knows whether it is right or wrong, so look at you. First of all, awareness has spread. The second thing of this compulsion is that whenever you come under any pressure from MLA, from Minister, from anyone and that is a wrong thing, say it.  Yes, pass it in the Assembly or Parliament, this is the law now, do you think this law is not practical, it is not right, it should not be so much, okay then you change this law, you are not working hard, the law is not working for you.  Change  It does n't happen, you want to take up, no, it's okay, you know many politicians do land work and have become land workers, first they will settle the people, then if there will be trouble somewhere, then you will feel like demolishing them there.  There may be two different parties, one may be with them, one may have separated, okay, they may have separated, now they know that it was wrong because they were the ones who made them do that wrong, now to teach them a lesson and then this is the process.  will support  Whatever is wrong, but if any wrong thing has been done, then that too will go through the legal process, many times, what is the problem that half of the Singham type movies are being made, these are Jawan type of movies. This decision has been made, we don't want to take it out of court, brother, there are courts in the country, it is okay, there was someone like Kasab who was caught on camera and everyone knew that 200 people were killed, he too was tried through the process.  Something has happened, the government people have to give this example to these politicians that sir, things will be run according to the law, you can speak as per your wish because no politician, no senior, and unfortunately, the leadership of the senior people has not gone away, they have returned without a penny. And passed straight ahead, that's why I am saying that I am not very proud of the bureaucracy because everywhere bureaucracy is above one exam, UPSC.  It has been cleared but they don't have a spine and after coming so high and talking about pain, I don't want to show them down, it is a matter of pain for them, they will not take anything on themselves, they will give a direct order like this, you do it, if you don't do it, then say you are not doing it.  Hey, you give wrong order in writing, wrong order, wrong thing is being written by tongue, you simply say that brother, give in writing what you are saying, then it will be given to you in writing that it is not possible despite that.  If you also want to do it, then when it opens, you will be the first one, you will be the number one, neither the politician nor the senior officer have the power to stand in the dock, and the life of junior officers is good. What is the problem of junior officers?  Even if you are corrupt or in a bad job, you will be caught somewhere, that too because whatever you do here, honestly, I still believe that in our country, there can be no exception in a country where people work with complete honesty. They  One cannot be troubled beyond one level, there is a lot of power in truth and honesty, but it is good because the person who is honest will tell, but the problem is, isn't it? Now what happens is that you are doing corruption under your own power.  I am telling this to the officers for whom it is a matter of great pain that when you are doing something for twenty-four eighty-eighths, you not only consider it wrong, not only morally, you don't even consider it ethically. Do you think this?  So no, this is not extortion, it is that, that is, it is an offering. What many people do is that they call extortion as it is and consider the offering as something wrong, that I did not take it with a gun in my wrist.  So this is morally okay, then when the people above also know what is happening to all of you, now even the people above you see it, they say that now you do this much program, then do this also, it is like losing character.  and Now I do n't want to explain the moral by giving any other example of a woman because people make mistakes, although giving an example means it may be right, be it a woman's character or someone else's or anyone's character, once the character becomes loose you become immoral.  When it happens, it happens little by little, just like in a marriage, if a husband or wife is cheating on their spouse, then it happens gradually, first through text, then over the phone.  Then it happens mentally, then physical expectations come, then emotional financial, then the man is not ruined on one side, it happens gradually, first he feels, man, what is talking on the phone? Aam, my mother, my wife was shouting, I told someone.  Now she doesn't talk politely, I do it with her, gradually a man becomes like this, this is corruption, this is the correct thing and then he comes where to trap you and where to blackmail you, you don't understand, then you understand.  You don't understand, what has happened to you, there are many pictures made beyond this, many things like this, you know what kind of honey traps are there and all these words are there that how to do it and get it done, but this  The biggest thing is that no one can tell anyone that he has done wrong. You are showing him your compulsion to correct your conscience because what happens is when you are doing small things wrong then you will have to do big things wrong.  It is said then in your stomach  I start feeling pain that if I do this brother, I will die, only then he says that one should not commit even small wrongs, there is always victory, happiness and peace in truth and honesty. No, I was very honest and got trapped. One such case can cost 100 thousand lakhs. Look at the example of those who become corrupt, they take their own exit route, many people will take up the case of an honest person, whoever happened to be in 10,20,3,000, will idolize him and look at him.  If this happens then I don't do it even though he is the rarest of the rare and is less than 10%, but he himself will do 10 wrong things, then when he is forced to do it then he will say that you were so decent.  Then this also works and everyone knows everything. The clerk in the department knows what his officer does. The driver knows where his officer goes and what he does. Okay, the whole system knows. That system remains silent about who will eat, then the one who is going to do it feels that oh he is very smart, no one is smart, everyone is watching, everyone is watching as if sometimes what happens is that a small baby is a small child.  He thinks that you are very smart and he is doing some wrong things, his father or someone else is watching him, take him away because in the same way, the government employees who do such things and when pressure comes to them, they are being watched. You were being monitored, weren't you that smart?  As much as you are becoming and tomorrow when you are posted again, then you are victim hooded. If victim hood happens like this then sometimes I am not denying it, it happens with people, it happens with people, so understand that this  This is how the job is security, isn't the job, from where will you ever be picked up and thrown away, so what if these people are going to do all this, like Vikas Divya Kriti ji, who does a government job and so on.  There are some big motivation gurus and they do so much for government jobs. Tell them, this is also a compulsion. Brother, honestly, you have been picked up and thrown away, they have not been done. You will be picked up from one place to another and thrown. You are being thrown three or four times. If you do n't understand then see, you have to do the job or not, how are you telling me like this? You have taken it after working so hard, that's why I am telling you, tell me in the beginning itself.  should be given this this this this You will get this in the Charter of Duties, you will have to see who will tell this, the government people should be told, this is what lies ahead, parents, brothers and sisters, ask anyone in the government what is happening, what will have to be done, you come after working so hard.  You pass the exam with difficulty and then if you had to do all these tasks, then you would not have been released because the hard work is so much, you spent seven years in preparation, two-four-five years in the job opened your eyes that this is the kind of job you can do.  I have gone to get married  You have a child, then you don't let go, then you grind, grind, grind, grind, grind. Well, this is the way of life, then it's okay, settle your children somewhere in a big city and keep roaming around carrying your bag and bed, and then the work is over.  Do everything straight, then work like a dhabang, then you want to become Singham, then become like that, do that and see, the fact of life is that it is very grey, it would have been so clean and neat that a politician has no power. Politician is not the only one who asks you to do wrong things. Till date I have not understood why are you afraid. Which politician has power in India? Just write your name in India. Kiki, he has power. I am not talking about top five six.  Four, five, in fact, there is not even five. Four, there is not even four. Three, perhaps there are only two. Well, apart from two, if anyone else has power, then tell me the name. It seems like this anywhere, they do it like this and go without asking.  what is this?  Let's go after asking, yes, yes, this is the condition, it is good or bad, I will not comment on it, according to me, it is good, okay, according to me, it is good, this is their hero Giri, we used to see it in the pictures, the colic picture comes. You must have seen about Manoj Bajpayee, many years ago, there was such an MLA, he was so powerful, no one asks these days, look at the MLAs, he is the one who is the MLA of Haryana, who is Gautam ji, who is he, he himself says on record.  He says, there is nothing for us, says there is nothing for us, I respect my mother for her honesty, there is nothing for us, all these tenders, they had to do direct tenders, they had to do electronic tenders, even the Sarpanch used to follow them.  Do that too, tender route, this corruption will end, then what is left in politics, this is a good trend, when I will disillusion the politician.  If you people support us, there is no need to go into politics, because this money is coming, otherwise the service would not be like that, then politics will be left for people who pass the time like this, they have nothing, neither power, nor respect, nor they eat money.  If you can, then why are you making this trouble, then the realization will come to these people on their own and they do n't get the next ticket. In the previous one, something was made by spending so much money, it seemed that there would be continuity, then someone else gave the ticket. Lame post elections are happening.  Are Lam Post Election means if the top command of the party sets up a Lam Post, then that Lam Post will get votes. Not even a child of a human being is wanted, so anyone else is seeing that and that in the MLA election.  It has been posted everywhere because it has become difficult for MLAs to win the elections. We know that MP elections are set, Ministers are members of Parliament, so anyone can stand and show the victory of MLAs. Otherwise, have you ever heard of Central Ministers also?  If you are contesting the election of MLA then gradually the power of the politician will be lost from the system. It seems that it will not happen. Yes, I agree, it will take more time in a state like UP, Bihar, but in some states, there will be no power left.  I want to tell you that there is nothing, it is the funds of MP lad, they are monitored by 50000 agencies and 500 people too and do with them whatever you want to do, someone has just hit that much, I am more than that.  Sure, if any MP spends the notes in his election, then the risk reward ratio in it is not a favorable investment and next time you will be told like this that if you do not want to do wrong then take your order in writing otherwise you will be punished in writing.  If the posting comes, then you will definitely get something in writing and if the posting comes, then in a small state, there is no need to take tension, it is okay and wherever you go, keep getting your posting done, then the work will be done like that. And once that tag has been put on you that if you don't do this then people will stop saying it too, but what is the problem, they become entrepreneurs after being educated, the Hindi people who write in the newspapers, he took their class, he was measured, he did it like this.  If it is done the way it is, then this is the story and in this government job, if you go in the name of security, you will remain in security job and from here to there, you will roam around, roam around, roam around for two months, four months, six months.  Like they say, there is something that comes with a job, and in this one may be a little shameless that yes, brother, it's fine, it's fine, wherever I have to do, I will do this much, I will take leave, this is how much Saturday is, this is Holi, Diwali, Bhaiya Dooj, this is  Chhat Vat, there are 35 to 40 days of holidays in the state government. I want to tell this to the public that there are 35 to 40 days of restricted holidays. Saturday Sunday is different if one has to take it because if you are afraid of posting again.  If you don't have it then you will definitely take leave, not like this, when you have fully opened your mind, do whatever you want to do, I will not do the wrong thing, I have only this much leave, then you will come to know that there is only 150 days of work in a year.  To do means to get the work done from you, whether you will do it or not, that also depends on you, whether yes, because when you come in that mode, then nothing can be done for you, this is the problem going on in the government, either something or the other. people this  If the normal work is not going on in this mode or in this fearful and wrong mode, then it means that the government job is not for the thinking individual who wants to change something and do something like this. This is for the average people who are not here.  I have heard a little from them that they don't use much brain and are ready to walk like sheep and goats, government job is fine for them, now many people who work so hard and get selected say that if you are pouring cold water on your hot pan, then brother it is necessary.  Is  These channel people here show listening and watching every time that you will come and watch and then don't watch that, today you have heard it, you will be in pain, you don't understand because here I am me and this channel of mine is for those who provide food, clothing and shelter.  He is a bit intellectual, he wants to sit comfortably and talk about everything, wants to learn, wants to understand, wants to tell the society because whoever is directly affected by these things is bound to suffer, so if you  Politician If you are a government servant, then perhaps you may not be able to enjoy it that much. If you yourself are a government servant who is suffering, then perhaps you may feel pain somewhere because of something that is said like this, not everyone is there, I am not everything, so everything never happens.  Who said that everything does not happen but this is an issue, you share it and you tell whether you agree or not. Thank you very much."

    "content": "Hello friends, under Politics and Bin Pendi Ke Lote, normally you all must have seen that I never speak for any one ideology that it is good and never want to influence the subscribers or anywhere here on where you should vote because.  I say that I am above him, don't put me on that level, let the people decide with their conscience, wisdom, consciousness, but here I want to make a call, you tell me is it right or not, this is something  Politicians who are lying without a bottom are Chutku Chutku in the party, sometimes they are here, sometimes they are here, sometimes they live like this, look at the people of Bihar, they have destroyed the truth of the province, the meaning of Bihar there was Magad, once upon a time, it was the culture of the country, it was the capital of the country.  There was a secret, that off-course was done from there, ok, period time, he did it, I am not saying that he alone has done it, but look at the situation, yes, he has already gone, bottomless people suit here.  Let's think here, politicians are going to come and elections will come, people will jump ship, you have to see the perspective of the party who changes the ship so soon, he is not worth anything, he will change again after that, you will be so cheated inside Maharashtra today.  I don't know which opposition it is, I voted for someone, there was some kind of party, where did the party go, where did it break, then where did it go, then where did it go, then what happened to it, meaning, things have been made fun of, Maharashtra Try to those who have returned from Maharashtra without a bottom, now don't give them the reference of what ever it is and if it goes clear this time then man, what did you say about stability earlier, now what was the joke that put that here right here.  I have a doubt that she can vote, the vote goes to this one, it goes to this one, now this is the vote for someone, the same goes here, okay, so you elect someone, first of all, on that machine, on the machine.  Well, it is a stupid thing to do, that is fine, but now if you vote for someone then leave the machine, you vote for someone and he will go there, here, go there, run away, so friend, what is this, at least they will have this one with you.  It does n't matter if he cheats once or twice, even if he cheats twice, how many times will you give him a chance? There are many people like him, he is one of the political parties, he has not gone yet but it is being discussed that he is also someone from Western UP here.  will go Or will I go there friend, I mean a community that votes or is it that there is no sense of ideal, are you so idle, being idle in life, I am not saying that you should be very rigid in life, you should be very stubborn or  It should not be flexible. Yes but friend, someone should be flexible. Now no matter whether it is a bone or a spinal cord, someone should be a little flexible but can touch till here. I will definitely do it like this.  It's okay if I do it like this, let everyone bow down like this, it's okay, it's like our saying, in our community, a broken cot and a bowed bed are of no use, so this is what I say for my community, let's say there is something in each one.  There is something right, I think it is never appropriate for anyone to do such a humiliating work and they are doing this politics so shamelessly, at least troll them, make memes of them, show them below and  What they mean is that I will not go this time, this time it is permanent, this time it is permanent, he is such an old leader and at one time, he was well respected also in the state and was good in initial politics, but what does it mean at any cost, at any cost?  Pay or not, just apna apna this apna this apna so many seats have come, I have to make up to 25 seats, see this, discuss, I am saying, make fun of them, make fun of them, why public?  Why can't you make fun of each other? Politicians don't spare each other, they don't make fun of each other, so why do you people have to feel shy, you also make fun of them and make them the laughing stock. Tell them and their people, whoever is around you and works with you, they do this, friend, what are you doing, what are you doing, then they will say, oh no friend, what are we, oh no friend, what does it mean, somewhere, you also do it.  If you are then call out who you are electing. Brother, why don't you decide on one side, why are you not on one side of someone, why are you not clear on ideology, no one is speaking about the ideology of someone, whatever is right is absolutely right, let him give it to whomever he wants.  But this is a bottomless pot, that is, it is not theirs either, there is no one to give even, so be on one side, that is the message, so I am still not influencing here, but I am saying that those who  They are idiots. They should be punished. Change it in any way, don't elect them so that there is some morality in politics. It is like that friend means someone is with someone at any time, meaning if this thing comes into marriage then the society will remain.  Maybe today I am with this, tomorrow I am with this. I need some stability, meaning there is someone there, meaning there is an athlete in America, this is the Republican Party, the Democratic Party, it speaks like this, it speaks like this, it means breaking from here like this.  What is happening in the mind is fine, we have a vibrant democracy and that is but man, this means so fast, sometimes here and there, look at the condition of those states where it is more, if any was the most famous state, then our state is my state, as I say.  Haryana came, Ram Gayaram was created here, hey, Haryana was created in 66, look what a drama it was in the first seven, eight, 10 years, then gradually stability came here and then Haryana has progressed in those 1015 years.  There was nothing in me, there was a long silence, then once there was stability, five or seven governments were formed, and then Bansi Lal ji came and then a little was made and then a little eating started and after that, the athlete continued for five to five years. Even in Haryana, there were changes in the government, it remained for five years, then it remained for 10-10 years, the first one will remain, then this one will remain, then as soon as stability is coming, it remains the same of the country and province.  But at that time Ram Gayaram came, there was such a thing in him that he used to make fun of MLA by calling Gayaram, he used to sit in the opposition in the morning, till the evening, he used to sit in the treasury, on other benches, on the government side, then the next day, somewhere else, meaning at that time, Ram Gayaram came, he was someone.  Sometimes make a government here at night, sometimes make it there, sometimes buy this, sometimes do that work, some defaults are still going on in it, but then the public has to punish, so these people will keep doing among themselves whatever has to be done.  Took her to the resort, took her there, someone picked her up, this became a party, the party came out of the party, meaning it is happening as if those children and women are not delivered, this is a party and children are being born, now whatever has happened, now this is  The party will be a farce of politics and this farce is being made of the Indian public. They can do whatever they want but punish all these people and all the big alliances that they are doing with them. I feel that by doing this to them too  just want to finish yes  Okay, you come here, now we will vote for you, but after finishing you politically, we will eat your votes. I think it is because people like this have to be eaten, so they are doing their politics right, but the public should do its own messaging. This video is most important, so I would request you to share it with people. If you like the content of the channel, then you can take membership of the channel to support it. Nominal is the discussion on tea, there is a membership, you can take something for them also, you can do such discussion once in a few months on a different platform, thank you very much."

    "title": "Budget And Middle Class ｜ Ab Kya Karein ？ [xirf-v1Yu-c].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, the budget has arrived, middle class and budget and what the middle class needs to do right now. There are two-four things that I will request from the middle class, tell me how many of them do you agree with and how many will you follow on logic.  If you look at the budget, there is no special issue like this, which is okay, it is okay because of an election, it is the budget before the elections, no such popular measure has been given on fiscal deficit. Attention, this is a normal statement, no one has done anything about the tax packs, now instead of the middle class being sad about it, according to me, what are the advantages of the middle class that the middle class needs, you will also get to know in this video under this video. What you need to do: You should focus on where the government's focus is and if the government's focus is not on you then those who do not live in the middle class generally focus more on the poor.  So how can you, the middle class, benefit from it? One is okay to cry, one is to be proud, if Rs 11,11,000,111 crore has to be spent on infrastructure, which is equal to 3.3 per cent of GDP, then raise the price, what is there in stocks infrastructure?  It seems like follow him, follow the companies, here I am not going to tell the names of the stocks, it is okay, they are also registered and all of them remain short and I never stay on the color side always.  To tell the world, 1.5 crore channels have been opened, everyone is busy today, take this, take that, but you should set your mind that you can earn money there and what is going to happen and this is going to happen, the second thing is that the government.  These people are not going to give you jobs in their pockets, neither are they going to provide government jobs, nor are they going to give you any other jobs, they are waiting a lot whether they will come or not, if you see, their quantity has not increased in the last 20 years, it is decreasing.  Whether it is Group B jobs or Group B jobs, the middle class needs to bypass this government job, especially the middle class who is living in a big city because you have a house. Already I assume that you have been middle class for many years and  Another big advantage of the middle class is living in big cities. That advantage is that the middle class has financial history, power to leverage, help to the lower class, everything.  What the lower class is doing is that we have increased the rates of everything, take it from the daily wage workers, take it from the rickshaw pullers, take it from the auto rickshaws, the rest of the expenses are all these, but they still have Loan taking capacity is not that much, some people take loan up to Rs 2 lakh, 4 lakh, 5 lakh, 10 lakh from the government scheme to do business and all this, but still 30  Can't buy a house worth 40-50 lakhs, are disappointed, some are earning 50000, some are earning 40, some are earning 30, I was the first one, YouTube2 copied it and this thing reached a lot of middle class, this world's middle class also got the attention of the government.  Going towards buying, if the government has enabled them here too, now we cannot stop anyone's progress, we cannot stop the progress of the country.  The government cannot stop you from doing what you want to do. You are a middle class person. Your child has been studying at home for 21 to 30 years. He is not earning even a penny. You have financial leverage. You are not able to do anything because you feel that Hey friend, if he is not able to do anything, then throw that boy and girl out of the house and tell him, brother, whatever money is earned, earn it because that money is also a sin.  If she lives with you and is not marrying immediately, then by adding some money, something can be bought in her name and you will then be ahead of the lower class level, otherwise such a big lower class is going to be created, the middle class will fall in India.  And the actual middle class will remain at 2, 4, 5 only. People have mentally thought that there is a higher upper class, there is a rich class, then there is middle and lower class and these are equally  Are not in percentage You can have a big fat lower middle class and lower class which is like 70 per of the country is there in that and the middle class will actually be in very small numbers and what has happened over last inflation is so big  Salaries have increased so much, everything has increased and the values, price appreciation and cost of houses have increased a lot but the definition of middle class is not those people who  Even 20 years ago, he used to earn Rs 30,400. He was middle class. The actual middle class was Rs 30,40 20 years ago, but you still do n't want to change it. The starting pay packages of your IT firms used to be Rs 2.5 to Rs 3 lakh. 1 year ago, now it is 2.5 to 3 lakhs, now it is 3 to 35 lakhs, so now he is lower class, brother, 3 to 35 lakhs.  If someone does not pay tax up to lakhs then the one who does not pay tax is lower class. Middle class pays tax then look at yourself. If you are not paying tax to the government then you are not middle class. Today I have given you a clear cut definition. If your  Wife does not pay tax. No, how will she pay? She is a housewife. Yes, she is not middle class. She is the wife of a middle class husband and is even below the lower class. We have to understand that we are not age families. Now we can tell in the family.  There is a man who is earning Rs 1.5 lakh and there are five members in his family. He has two children aged between 21 and 30 years and they have been preparing for the competition for the last four years. He has six more years to go. Mother 65 70  She is one year old, she has to do it, that means preparation, that means she cannot earn, the wife is like a housewife, she has never earned, this man is now 55, now he too will retire someday.  So in 5 years, if you count heading towards lower class in capita, it is okay and already there will be lower class in capita, heading towards pure class, one more important thing, I will tell you if you agree with this. A middle class, my request is to stop praising the politicians, they take a lot for granted or you should shut up, whoever has to vote, everyone is sitting with one vote, cast one vote.  Whom you want to put in the name, whatever you guys like, okay, he got this made, this is done, put it like this, but stop being his fan, this is taken for granted, you will become taken for granted, you and someone else.  The child who will not ask is the one who remains angry even inside the house, cries and throws tantrums, it is only he who gets something or the other, the elder child who understands the meaning of sacrifice is more straightforward, nothing happens to him, you will keep paying taxes, you do not want anything.  Just wait and you will not get anything and then they will say that your contribution is very good and you are serving Mother India, you are doing this, they will tell you all such stories and you will not reach anywhere, become quiet, get detached, you know.  Don't just go, vote for whom will you vote, I have not come here to influence your vote, I have not come here to make you go left or right, vote for the one you feel like voting for, do it with your family, but don't tell that you are doing it.  Them  You will come to know and even if you are in a mood to do nothing, don't tell us that we are angry with you. Middle class, we do n't know why we have opened our cards. Go on the wings, go on the status, go on forward, only then you will know.  Whom does he vote for? Why is he voting? The one who is against gets to know, the one who is pro gets to know. He is the one who irritates the most. You go to some poor colony and pretend to be a normal person, journalist type and  You don't tell who you are voting for and there is no need to ask the middle class people, then who do you think you will get? You will get something, Thakur, you will get something like Shiv usam bolte kuch hai aapke dekha, dialogues from Hindi movies remain.  You will get something, tell me, to whom will Gabbar give it? If there is someone, Gabbar will be happy, with whom will he be happy? You have to be a little doubtful, a little silent, and put a little insecurity in the politician.  These politicians do not belong to anyone, so why are you joining them and then you also say that everything is useless, useless, useless, all the politicians are useless, then from whom will you choose, you have to choose only among them, is n't it?  Bad B is for Bakkad is fine C is for Chakad is fine so choose among these A B C C Why are you telling me in advance, keep quiet from now on, a little is of no use to you, your candidate is losing.  If you lose, it doesn't matter if you win, then it does n't matter if you win, don't do anything. Look around you, is it getting cleaned? Because what did this system do? It glows. You have given me the mobile phone in your hand. Still, you are in the mobile phone.  You are watching but I will tell you right now, wherever you are watching, pause and look left and right outside. You are watching in the bus. You are watching in the metro. You are watching at home. You are watching in the office. Look a little outside. Things are getting better, much better.  It's getting worse, it's getting worse for you  What is happening in life because the system has made it such that the country's progress can be achieved through just the phone. I don't know what is happening in real time. If I ask you, what is happening in Orissa? Delhiites.  I don't know what is happening in Jharkhand, I don't know, it is okay if the news is shown a little, the rest is just a lot of progress, progress is happening everywhere, this is done, this is done, this is done, but what is actually happening?  do n't know anything but  That was done, neither did that scheme come nor did this come and hey, look at how it is affecting you, you are abusing one, you are praising another, I am saying neither abuse nor sing, shut up when in doubt.  You put it because if the person you are abusing is somewhere in your state, he is not going to ask you, then the other person, whom you were praising, is not going to listen to you, so that means, shut up a little, be quiet about that person.  wise  Be like a boy who shuts his mouth when his mother is criticizing his daughter-in-law and when the daughter-in-law is saying something about her mother, he shuts his mouth. Don't be like that moronic boy because I am a marital consultant.  Examples always come out, there are many boys, their wives are not listening, the mother is speaking bad about the wife, she is saying something, they are defending her, the wife does not have many wives in that scene and  Mother is getting very angry, okay, I fed the thief's slave, made him drink, this is how he is standing today, hey, at least he is standing, if he stands in front of his wife, then at least his wife should do it and then  Whenever that wife tells me that today your mother did this or that, then the mother is trying to defend herself. Learn to keep quiet for a while, otherwise it will get worse, both of you will be ruined. Do this if the mother is listening.  And the wife is saying something to the mother and  Even if you are standing up for the mother, it is okay that at least the mother is seeing that the son is speaking for me, so at least she will make roti, give tea, give some more money, take care of the forest and will.  Like that foolish child, you are becoming middle class, no one is asking, he is doing it in front of his mother-in-law, he is doing it in front of her, both of them are angry with you. Have you seen such foolish boys whose wife is also angry with them and  Mother also remains angry. These are the biggest losers.  There are a lot of me, I get a lot of such people in marital consultation. Hey brother, a party should be happy. Your wife is angry with you because you support mummy ji. See too much. I got involved in politics only then this Guruji is there. Gurugram channel is very cool, you get to learn a lot, if you have made your wife angry, then mother should be happy or you have directly said something wrong to mother, did you tell mother not to do it like this? It is very good. Less  At least the wife should be happy that if you upset your mother, my middle class is the same, you middle class, you can cry as per your wish, you are bound to cry and yours is raw. When children used to play games, in childhood, the small babies used to be big children.  People used to play games, now rich and poor are playing games, and the middle class is raw, the middle class is feeling that I am being asked, no one is asking you, no one is asking anywhere, very good work can be done without you, very good sometime.  you too  You may be fired from your job, sometimes taxes may be increased, sometimes rules may be changed, you may get something, sometimes you may not get anything, you will not send your child to a government school, you will not go to a local clinic, you will not go to free electricity or water because you have more than that.  You have to consume units of ration rice, you will not eat it, you will not take anything you are getting yourself and in future you will not get anything great, it will not happen that you are middle class and have been paying taxes for so many years.  If there is money to pay less taxes, then the government has come and helped, no one will say like this, your child has not got a job, brother, you have been paying such heavy taxes and all this for 40 years, let's set something for the child or here  If it is not possible then we will apply for a visa to Canada, the government will make recommendations, this is our middle class child, we have not done him any good because good is done only to the poor because he is in greater need, so we will help him.  Brother, let's do it, no visa etc., nothing, that government will deal with it, your one on one interview will be one on one, you have to show your ability, one on one is your eligibility, then go, you will not get help from anywhere.  Otherwise, why do you keep roaming around jumping, why are you jumping so much middle class, elections are coming now, why are you jumping, go and vote, this will come, that will come, this will happen, this will happen like this, this will happen, then what will happen then? What will happen if you concentrate on your demat account after opening 14 crores, then accounts are opened in Chaudi, these are ours and these people give the number of 14 crores only, those with too many financial channels are not earning money by sharing shares, they all are at the time of Covid.  I started a new business, earned a little bit, then later I do n't know, I told everyone to buy a lion, I do n't know how to sell it, I don't know what to do after selling it, then it increased, then it increased, what is the problem of middle class people?  Make too much money from share market also because you need money, the money you put in the share market should not be needed, you should never need it till your death, only then you will not earn money but then if we put and  If they don't throw us out then what is the use of the finance channel? I have to open a finance channel. I feel that if you want me to open a finance channel, then tell me the very fact. Why is there any benefit in having so much money? Will you do anything with the money? This is a little bit, I am going to stop politics again and along with that I have added this benefit that if people know that you have money the way they behave with you changes. If Mukesh Ambani has got that much of wealth he is  Not Spending All of It Politician and everybody, take that shell, sell it, I did not open this bad channel, so if you want, I am a little like this channel's Guruji from Gu, very amazing feedback is coming, subscribers are slowly growing, views are increasing.  Good feedback comes, very good feedback comes, this is what I want, this is not what they say here, I have to do it exactly for my parents, I have to do it exactly for the class, I want that this is my middle class, upper middle class. Understand that you are the audience and you have to do something for your children yourself, if no one is going to do it then please share this thing and like it and write in the comment section how did you like the video and ask people in your family group to subscribe.  To their children, to their wives and to their husbands because of the knowledge that everyone has a family together, then it is good if there is a head in the family. Watch what is happening on the politics news channel. Which government is this? Who will win the election will come, it will not make any difference in your life and the one whom I am studying is actually doing his work and earning money and he will serve only him.  Will that poor guy ever want? Yes, he will do it, he doesn't need your recommendation for him, you will show morality, you will show recommendation, you will show something like this, there is no need for him, he will do everything on his own, so I hope this video  Did you understand? Please share. Thank you very much."

    "title": "Can Aam Junta Set The Agenda ？ [d3BsmlzZ2y4].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today's empowering video is 'How can the public set the agenda? General public, politicians set the agenda and narrative. They have the power, but people ask me in the comments and not the general, but the feedback I have received is not from the public, but something.'  Power is not tax, it is what we are told and explained to us, then today I would like to understand one thing with a simple example that power is great and it changes with time but it can also be fashioned quickly.  This can also be done because if you people have got that intelligence that I am telling about these things and you have understood the example very well, then you will get this awareness very well in the 90s. If you remember, in the 90s you will remember that  There were movies of David Dhawan and Govinda in which only Shakti Kapoor was there and in every movie he seemed to be number one, [ __ ] number one, Bibi number one, there were many movies like Gharwali outsider servant number one, This number one, Hero number one.  Like this, you know, some people liked some Tabla, there were many who were on a different level and what happened after one stage, it became Multani Band because the mental and financial problems of the one who liked them at that time.  It happened if you remember because he will not come to 19 after 98, now it seems a little different, when transition is happening, the picture also flops, there are some hits too, caste is very super but de facto.  This is that the narrative change happens, it is the public who does it when you do n't want to see them accepting the thing, then if you don't make it then people run out of things, still Bollywood is going through date, it is okay, you see that the public What exactly do you want Piplaaz is this string, you figure out only this thing, want that thing, suddenly it seems that this thing will not work and he indulges in jingoism as if he  Last I did Gadar, I did it and gave you the like, now maybe I won't make the next one, because I did a romantic with him, Sunny Deol, in less too, one more picture like this should be made, it's bill not working, today's times so  IT'S WHAT I WANT YOU FROM THE PUBLIC IF YOU ARE VERY VERY CLEAR COMMUNICATION BACK TO THE POLITICIANS BECAUSE OF THE POLITICIANS' JITNE CHANGU MANGU HAI OK, THEY SIT AND WATCH ALL  You must be watching these videos too, okay, watching Twitter as well, social media too, watching what's happening, what's happening, and they read Navas and whose leader is more connected to the ground and the better the war is, the better he is thinking.  So now let's do like this, let's do like this, first of all you have to keep your thoughts for yourself in a way that I think in my elder self and that has to be conveyed, you create confusion by raising it that take this mother poor then.  It's okay, so this is my noise.  He is making a noise, whatever he has to do, he needs it, you are also raising the issue and making noise about it, then when you see sir sentiment going here, then this is the one who has come in the scheme, everything is the same address and then you don't get anything, then something else.  If you don't get it then you become like this because every person is talking about this because what is this, he is doing this like this, I am angry, accept that he is doing this to me like this and you have done this, you have done good to him.  now his  Now do good to this, now do this very good, now this has become very good, my what about me, my retirement, middle class, your tax shoes, your GST shoes, your less, your business, who will talk about them, brother, then you should tell us about your coming. In the upcoming episode, I will ask you guys to write yours like this flag, what is this date, it is very important, what problem are you facing, then we will take it logically.  This is not reducing what is happening everywhere, what happened before, how did it happen like this, how did it happen like that, that is very wrong, that agenda is very wrong, this very thinking is very wrong that those who are taken to the paste have a  I will make a very good video that the castes will fight after seeing the example by talking about the paste, if you talk then I had done this, this one here, then you did this one, first you tell this, why did you do this at that time, do you have the answer to this, right?  I guess yes guys  What do you say, I don't want to be happy, they sold, they should have a choice, they should have a lot of choice, you choose, now here it means the choice itself is ending and it is being celebrated, so now you understand, forget it, I am fine.  If yes, then we will tell you further that these are the things of paste which are always being done on every news channel, in every debate, in every parliament, everywhere, every person is doing it like this.  It was done like this, it was done like that, so if you people want it to be done once and for all, after finishing it with an argument, then please write in the comment area that you want the date, the old talk of the video, not the old talk and today's.  If there is focus on the matter, because you want to take it further, okay then please finish writing, I will tell you one such thing, you have to spread the same thing, once it will generate traction in the general media and everyone will start talking about it, then after that  then this  They will stop talking, this mechanism will fly away, then they will have to talk, whatever they will have to do, I will explain it well to you, try to understand and like this video, share this new channel, support you.  We are going on a journey, without spreading raita, without naming anyone, without actually teasing anyone, we will change, we mean me and you, my audio, we will change, the rest will have to change because when we set the narrative, we We will set retirement, we will select the topic, we will tell everything and they will stand like this everywhere, we will talk about it on our WhatsApp, on our Twitter handle, on our social media, so whenever we go to talk about it, then on Somebody Always  You tell him that, but you tell him that they will not give him that, we will definitely eliminate him in the next episode, it's okay, so if you want it to be like this, then please give feedback and it will be a lot of fun, friend, like this too.  Understand the point, it is very important to have power, decency, please keep the comment area large, check in to live a relaxed life, whatever you want, everything will be there, there should be peace and relaxation in life, don't do that much in it, we should be comfortable, I want my audience to be like this.  hoon share"

    "title": "Caste Census In Bihar ｜ Interesting Times [piZ493A7Nr4].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, we will discuss caste census in Bihar beyond that and what can be its follow outs and now the match has become interesting and this is what I wanted, I do not enjoy watching that one sided match and Nitish Kumar ji, you can't.  Ever you know count out, it seems that now it has happened but then after doing something like this, we will discuss beyond that, before that I want to tell here, brother, if this reservation caste first affects you personally and your personality is very important.  You have a strong opinion and you are not employed and if you are in it, then this channel is for you, no, this channel is for those who have risen above the bread and butter house, how much do you have to define, I also know, it feels very bad.  No, you can't listen, if you want to listen, you can listen in relaxation but it is okay to contribute like this, there are 63 OBCs, 19 punts in Bihar, something SC, ST, and now it has been openly discussed. Now this was like that, earlier someone like us used to feel like speaking, now the discussion has been done openly, the match has been opened, now the election is on religion and caste and now there is nothing to say on this, everything has been opened up, at the top. He is also a leader and he has also said that now Hindus are getting divided, this is the religion, now it is Vikas, the cuckoos and that small pot, it is very nice to talk here, I am feeling relieved that yes, please bat now or discuss.  य गोल मोल गोल  Now what to talk about, it is clear now it has come on paper also and there will be a good discussion, so brothers and sisters, at 85, there are OBC SC ST in Bihar, that is why I have now done the census, it had never happened before, so we used to see that many people from Bihar.  Are selected and in Bihar why do people want to go to government job more, you get the answer automatically otherwise you know in other channels I used to say in other channels, oh no, leave the government job, leave it for the poor, that's what I used to say. That thing has also come out, I will prove that the government job is now available for the poor because even in gold, there is a reservation of 10 per cent. Those who belong to the upper caste and are in the general category, there is a reservation of 10 per cent.  If there is reservation for EWS, then the quota for poor and OBC, which is 63 in Bihar, but if it is below 8 lakhs per annum, it is okay, below 8 lakhs per annum.  It means that practically you do not pay tax because that day lakh will be saved in Rs. 8 lakhs and the rest is insured. If your income is below Rs. 5 lakhs then you do not have to pay tax. The one who does not pay tax is poor. It is very clear that you pay tax.  If you are paying then you are not poor but if you are not paying tax then you can claim. It is so simple. Okay, so brother, he is close to 85, so now the next debate will be that brother, if this number is Then why reservation at 50? This debate is also logical, isn't it? Brother, there are so many of them here, why is the census of the entire country not done? In fact, if no one is asking this, 2024 is coming and the census is already done.  This has been happening since the time of the British, 1911 21 31 41 and how many more censuses, brother. Okay, if Covid was in 2021, if it could not be done then it should be done in 22.  When would it happen at the age of 23, why doesn't anyone ask why these things like why the census is not being done, is it not necessary because everything is known in the census, who has how much income, who has how many children, who has how many jobs, what is the average age.  So many people, a lot of data comes out, so shouldn't this exercise have happened or are they just waiting for the elections but now it is like a Pandora's box has opened doing something. Rahul ji had said there that  There are 90 secretaries in our Parliament and only three are from OBC, so the issue has come up there also, so now we have to do it within the promotion also. When I am saying all the things, I am discussing the dick, then I am saying the points of discussion, I am talking about this.  We are not saying anything should happen, should not happen, before what should happen on this channel and in our life, we have to understand what is happening because after saying should happen, who is asking you when issues are raised, people will vote, not you.  should not happen  You should understand the issue lovingly, what is it because you can vote only for yourself, why wouldn't the one who is getting direct benefit do so? Tell me, do it yourself. I come from a community where this is not available but that community does want it. Yes it wants.  At the railway station, on the railway track, there is protest etc. on the track, now it doesn't happen, you are not getting it, people will be the first to attack you, if you were getting it then you and I are on reservation.  I will tell a good detailed video of mine and make it, it will be like reservation, now it depends on Cass census, I have a lot of clarity on reservation, no one in the whole country has as much clarity on reservation as I do, and when I make a video, through that video.  I will also do the proof and no one will be able to explain the way I can, even your big professors, big sociology students and this and that institute are bullying because in each of them they give less with some.  Baggage and further agenda Neither my further agenda nor the baggage is clear cut, it is clearly visible as if a 12 year old child or a 10 year old or a 7 year old child sees something as not that, not that. Ask him, son, how is he?  If he feels like it then he will tell it as he feels and that is the truth, the 25 year old, the 30 year old, the 35 year old will think that he should not feel bad about it, I am saying here, yes, I am saying this, so it is a video of that easily.  It will be done but today let's discuss the caste census, this is a good thing that has come out that it is at 85 and from it the percentage of Muslims etc. has also been taken out. Okay and all those things have been explained and the percentage of Muslims is also higher.  There are castes whose income etc. is such that they do not come in that category and OBC among them, if you add it from 100% then it increases to 102 3 4 also.  The fact another thing which came out good in that on which there was always a feeling that so many Muslims are coming from Bangladesh and they are coming, it is increasing, within 10 years the population has increased by 7 and that of Hindu has decreased by 10.  It's a lot, it's okay in 10 years, it's okay in 07 years, and yes, it can happen in 1000 years, okay, I'm not talking about mathematics, but it's just this much, it's okay, as much fear as you have, you can do it to anyone.  Look, even if half of your marks are cut, you can get disturbed. It's okay, but these things should come to my mind once we know everything, we know the balance sheet of every company. In our country, all our politics is based on this. And what is happening is very unfortunate that I will stop the 2024 elections from being divided into religion, caste, caste and division, I will not let this happen, I will allow this to happen, so doing so on this is unfortunate and this is being said as satirical.  I am this on the face  It is a smile of pain, you understand that it is a smile of sadness and pain and sadness and pain, yes this is what we are fighting elections after 75 years of independence, on the basis of which the issue of partition is coming and it is coming openly.  Till now even I was not excited, I too thought that man, this is how I have to speak, I do n't know, now brother Sulam is open, what is it now, everyone is saying, will anyone say that when the speech is on record?  Lakhs of people are being told in the rallies that it is happening like this, it is happening like this, so everything has come out, it should not happen like this, or it should be one, but it should be like this, anyway, who will decide? Only the public will decide.  Now it is not for the public to decide, so my message has always been that those who are intellectuals and even middle class and upper middle class, all of them, watch this show, this is what we are living in, don't get confused about right and wrong.  Wait because this is what the nation wants, this is what the nation will vote for and majority, so you see the truth of jobs, the truth of reservation, the real things, I will tell you further what this game is next, now slowly I mean.  That's it, everything has been revealed, it's like that happens, first diplomacy goes on, now when the time of conflict comes, then everything starts appearing like those swords are whose or whose, which means the real war.  It has to happen now in the elections, through which medium and there is no principle, nothing, what Kejriwal ji used to do to Congress in 2013, now they all are having dinner together, now absolutely wonderful people and with such smiles because time.  Change happens, don't judge us, they are doing very well, they are making their lives better, very good and mama tune changes, politics is like this and the general public also has to learn this when these politicians are like this, thick skin plus  So why are you going crazy in love? By being loyal to them, are you also getting loyalty bonus? Do you also see who is setting where, who will decide which one is good for the country?  People, not you, everyone will say, we are good for the country, we are the best, we will take it forward, we will do all this by spreading this raita, all of us are such useless, very useless, the biggest useless, this is a competition many years ago, right?  India had imported a plane, MiG 21 from Russia, it is fine, the story is told in it, now it was a plane flying in Siberia, India is a hot country, the settings inside it were hot hot and hottest, it is fine inside because it was a cold system here.  If it is summer then here it is worthless, big worthless, great worthless. Now we have to set between them, the definition of each one is different, that of great worthless, less worthless and less worthless, but this is the comedy.  This is a comedy and you have to select from these, you have to select from these, and as per the number of people, they will become their leader according to the prestige of the people, now you cannot comment on your fellow Indians, people, one you comment on one.  Politician who is the leader of lux and curse of people you are actually commenting on the people who is his vote bank and his because you say I am like this, yes also his leader is he.  And we will have to do like this, democracy works like this, I am happy that you have made the match interesting, this is not going to be a one-sided match, further state elections and beyond that too, I will discuss individually, enjoy, relax, don't take tension, do n't take sites.  The date will come, you will go to your nearest voting center and you will get a chance to press the button only once, so do not take stress and do not waste your time in their free marketing, no, it is good for me, you too will do it like this and he will kill her.  Have you ever seen me influencing you that brother, go to this one, go to this one, I say that you guys have offered me as much money as I have, brothers.  Sisters, you should reduce this issue, it is very important and I will also make a separate video of this issue on my other big channel, let them do whatever they want, deal with them in this category, Baoli Butch Bada.  Bawli Buch, the biggest Bawli Buch, put them in these three categories as per your wish and also tell them and say, it is our misfortune that we have to choose from among people like you, it is not good fortune, it is bad luck, how many will there be in 2024?  It has been 75 years, it has been more than 77 years, we still have the same issue, the same issue was there 30 years ago, now if you are making progress in the same way, then where has the development gone? Mr. Vikas, find Mr. Vikas and bring someone from somewhere. So this is the end. Nobody can blame the other people for bringing it in. Everybody brings it when you make something. They come and say, Hey, this is theirs, we created this, we gave them that power.  So it is said that we are also giving power to them, then it is okay and the one to whom power is being given is called and the one who is being appeased or to whom anything is being done.  One thing is that people selectively make speeches. Some Prime Minister gave such a speech that our old Prime Minister said that beyond the resources available, the first right is of SC ST OBC minority. First of all, I do not understand what is the need to say who has what right?  Have I not understood till date what is my right? Someone distributes coal and gives it to me, saying, \"Take SC, you take this much coal, this is ours, it turns out to be iron and this is yours, it is not like this, first thing to say.\"  I don't know what was the need, but now someone should come out of it and say minority, no, it is SC, ST, OBC. Hey brother, your OBC, SC, ST, is at 85 and the minority people are at 90, so the upper caste people are poor people. No one is asking him and his poor people too, they have been put in the Revadi, it's okay, take 10, but you also take 10, they too are happy, infact if you look mathematically today you  Have the highest chance of getting a benefit of reservation if you are in upper caste EWS. If mathematically you will see r because you are very less and out of that you are getting the quota of 10. Okay and when so many people are OBC and SC ST and  If it is in this, then the difference in cut off will also be reduced, if one day I will keep 100% reservation for the video, otherwise.  It will be long, okay, okay, so I will stop this at here, if you want that video, then write in the comment section how not to be fooled, how to take advantage of stupidity, I always say that someone can fool someone.  No, people are fools, everyone is fools, I will also be a fool, in some aspects of life there are fools in all aspects of life, but such people are only one, two or four percent, okay, but in some aspects of our life, we are blind.  Spots because if we did n't do it then how would we know that we are at 63 and we will remember, now that figure of 63 has come, now that figure of yesterday, this figure of yours is not 73 and 53, it does not change so quickly, you have seen.  That the population demography changes by 5.7 percent within 10 years, it was shown in the survey that only this much change happens, but now it is known that now the rest of the states will also do the same.  There is a state government, they will also remove theirs in a few days. Those who benefit from it will not be removed from those who do not see any benefit. But now we will know what is where and what if the representation is to be done there accordingly.  According to the calculation, if these people are on 85, then they will go to the Supreme Court and the discussion will be on the basis of ratio and on the basis of logic, then say that you have given reservation to people on 85 on 50.  What is this justice? Anything can be done if something is done at the country level then it is a Pandora's box and elections will be fought on this and it has become an issue and till date the ruling party used to set the narrative as to how the pitch will be and how the batting will be.  The game used to be played according to how many runs will be scored, now from where did these opposition people learn to hit fours and fours, now they are setting it as a topic of discussion and it will become like if brother is 90th secretary in IAS.  Three OBCs means they have to be given even in promotions. If we give such promotions, then the country will become like this. Who will decide that it will become bad? Who will decide why out of 90, 50 secretaries cannot be 40 OBC secretaries, whatever the ratio?  Why can't we be at the top level? Who will decide? The public will decide and who is sitting with how much percentage. Now you know, where will the buttons be pressed, then it is time to see, we have to take sides in this, what should we do?  What is the benefit, especially I am saying this, this channel is for those who are facing these things only then you can discuss. How can you discuss a subject in which you are directly affected if you go to a barbarian and ask him that do you need a hair?  Cut and you don't need a hair cut. Barber is never going to say no. He will say yes sir, these are only two hairs, get them equalized on your head because his living depends on it.  Saying yes to you only will never say no so if you are from Sambalpuri give 100% whether at 150 or give a few and there are few of us who are like that may be many of us if we look in absolute numbers then we have this  The channel is only for those people so that we can get some space to discuss, all the people have to come here for a while who are so politically charged up. There is one more request if you are very  You are a politically charged up person, isn't it brother? It is not necessary to see how many channels are there in your channel, there are all types of them, this Godi Media is like this, there is someone else like this, there are many channels, as soon as you open the channel you come to know that this is my channel.  Is it sweet or salty, whatever is your choice, is it cold or hot, then catch it, there are crores of channels, don't come to me, what is the thought process like me, so that we can discuss something and we can also share our coolness somewhere.  Enjoyment because this channel has been made for us because this space is a vacuum, there is no one here, so here also people are needed to discuss, is there anyone, we can enjoy what is happening without making any noise so that a  Stay with the detachment, my aim is to be detached, this political thing that is going on, no no, things are better understood by being detached, when like you say, he is a doctor, he operates on everyone, but when his  If it is someone of your own, he cannot operate. A doctor cannot operate on his own child and wife. Then it is some other doctor because when he does that, he gets the feeling of his own. You all know this thing, so that is what.  It is once we are too much into this, the same feeling will come, then rational thinking, logical debate thinking is not possible and it is okay because you may be in this life.  Situation were in you are very much affected by all these things so of course you can not participate but if you get an independent opinion again I will say not neutral then nothing is neutral nothing is there opinion is always one sided then independent opinion you  If you want to know then you will get to know in off course. Thank you very much."

Will do very well, everyone's happiness is being discussed but you have to look carefully here are the athletes who are Indian but yes they are also coming different shapes no orientation date is n Fact: Here I will discuss especially about my North Indian brothers. I will also discuss a little about the people above Godavari. There is a news channel in Noida, all of them are the same, all of them are fine because I know the trigger, this is an original topic for me.  Because of his trigger, I feel that what a stupid thing is happening brother, I do n't know since when did nationalism become a part of our country, what stupidity is there in our country, if you agree with this, then tell me.  I am not saying to read ballads, I am not saying to hug, to make love, but I belong to this, listen to his pride in Arya's tweet, there are photo votes also, first of which disclaimer date for those with this kind of thought process.  I am an astrologer, I have a lot of knowledge about religion and all this, astrology and all this, I am a tree consultant in these aspects, also, in the tweet of Gaurav Arya ji, he has just written.  It has been written for the Malvi teachers of Pakistan that what are they doing by showing such a telescope that when you look at a few people then you should see the flag of India before declaring the date of the big festival, I want to ask them one thing and then India  Salute, first see the flag of India, then salute it and then declare the festival. After seeing it, ours is called Sanatan Dharma or whatever little comes out of the mouth, the name of its religion is called Sir, I guess you know.  No, what will become of our saree festivals? Our festivals are also seen from the moon only. Brothers and sisters, the dates are decided by the few who are there. Which festival will be held on the day of the full moon, when will it be on the new moon, when will it be on the full moon, when will it be now?  Rakshabandhan was celebrated a few days ago, so is America talking to India on anything? Oh, they also have their own ideology, religion and all that is America too, oh do you know what people follow and tell to the whole world. So you will not reach them and you will salute the whole world, why have you come so many times brother, North Indian especially our South Indian brothers, when ISRO was launched, see who were the people on the screen when clapping was happening and they were  He sent me such fish pumps just because he is an educated man, he will do it and today I am saying on my face that brother, learn from your South Indian, he is an educated intellectual man, I have made a video earlier also that on North  They had come under attack, bloody history is there in Panipat, one Panipat, you are Panipat three, all the fights, quarrels, yours, India, Pakistan, Punjab, have suffered more than you, the North has suffered more than you, this matter has not been done by going there, it is in our DNA, because it is on our face. That a BMW has come to your house and your poor neighbor takes a broken scooter and if you do such things in front of him and tease him, then his children will come at night and scratch your BMW. Mother goes, then you have to keep a security garden so that there is no crush, then you are the bread, my expenses are flooded. Hey, in the first place, what is necessary for you is his scooter, does he know that you have put a BMW, he automatically gets burnt even after seeing like this.  I felt that everyone is jealous, Neighbor's Pride, Onida's ad had come, so I felt like doing it on my own, go and do all this nonsense on his face, he is facing 10,000 troubles of his own in the country, Jim. They have behaved like this among themselves, they burn the houses of their soldiers' journals, that is fine and they are attacking their soldiers, this is the situation going on there, Bankrupatsi is like this, Rakhi is the most failure, incompetent student of this class.  What do you have to complete from your 100? If you go from 30, 40 to 60, 70, then you have done it only with the child of number 15 and number 10. Now move ahead.  See, 70 80 90 100 lakhs of people are also sitting with them. Now change it. You had studied that one when you had to study it. There were orbits of electrons. If you have studied chemistry etc. physics etc. then this saree has an energy in it. If there is a caste, then the inner orbit goes to the outer orbit, that is your progress, if there is a caste, other people go to Chhath, then does he have to come to another place and I have come here, I am a  You went and stayed there, friend, for how long will you do this? By doing all these ridiculous acts to them, you make them one again or do it. If you want to think strategically, if you want to think like enmity, then there is neither enmity nor irritation from within, nor anything else.  To do this, Guruji is teaching the streets to be strategic. There is a lot of savings among your neighbors every day. There is a lot of savings in my wife, there is a lot of fun in the children. Children do not support their parents.  Your house and family are going well, you go and pierce them and they all become one Jain, then that wife should stop fighting with her husband, children, why did you do this to my father and all are standing with pots Jain, then you will enjoy a lot.  Hey, leave it, I am teaching them such a big thing, I am telling them a deep thing, because if you are watching the beginning of the video like this, then should we perform Aarti for Pakistan, what did they do with us, what did they do, why so much of this?  Do you like this you can see these things  This is what I am talking about in tone and tone, this is the caste that talks like this, these are especially such people, please do not become my audience by mistake and if you are watching this video then do not watch the next one also because I am telling some people in India. In our country of India, I have been telling this from the middle of my channel, we have to get this foolishness out tomorrow because it is not out tomorrow because there is fear, because if there is fear, why do you feel that Gaurav is coming, then So Called seems so nationalist.  This is what he said if I said it  If he says anything further, the match will be declared. Tell him, tell him and send this message to us. Band it out, friend, an intellectual man, a man with guru element, good institution, good training, your Hindi is good, English is good, but what fun are you having by breaking things like this? Meaning you are enjoying, you come to a level like this, now I am like, I also want my channel, I also want big subscribers, I also want population, I also want my message to go.  Will you then lower his level like this, then what happens to you, you know, some times, when your audience becomes such a fool, then you also have nothing else to do and he was very political, discovering that you are the parent. Whom did you set out to attract and who all got attracted and you can't do it to the audience by mouthing it like I am doing it, my channel is small, I am just saying that brother, like this, those who are like this.  Whatever type of person you are, you are a chillum chilli person, there is no need to be associated with anything, brother, such people are not needed, there is no benefit because neither he has any kind of content nor he definitely does not have any kind, this is very typical North.  Indian phenophena, it happened in Haryana, it happened in Punjab, you see it in the songs here, my Rohtak is a very dear city, I think it is a little safe to take the example of my people and tell it because someone else  Tell me, Rohtak has become less sahib in Rohtak, so the bus in Rohtak is not enough, Chandigarh is less city, you are less city, Delhi is less city, why did you go to so many matches, what will the rest of the people stay for then, what will they see, why are they rabbiting in, I am telling you an example.  There is some community here, there is some community here, which is stupid things, this is stupid think, we got a little bit, just got a little bit, and the same think, oh brother, our Chandrayaan is so good. Our achievement is that the foreign media has followed me but the media has done it so lovingly. What are our people doing? There is one anchor, Deepak Chaurasia. I don't know any anchor. Rasulpur is standing wearing a beard. Is his name like this? So next to me, hey Deepak ji, I saw today that you got goosebumps, what goosebumps, he is wearing a suit, ca n't you see the goosebumps, what are you saying, people of Noida, all the news channel people of Noida. Opened the news channel up down up down I thought youtube mix more sense they should boycott this stupid news channel didn't know how he is singing one who is gay who is Anup Jalota ji and he is talking Hey my next one to chand  Par hoga main to next wale pe chaand pe woh karunga apna kya bolate hain music concert I know you excited I know it's proud achievement I know your happy but unit When you talk like this it is also visible that  Friend, what have they got, the party has just started, the technology is working, the reach is good, there is still some good work to be done, one should be happy to have done so much, but why are you imposing left and right on such people's faces like this, friend?  How did you like this video of mine? You can share this one, please share it so that people's thought process changes. When achievement is ours, we will achieve it with our hard work. Those people are so humble, look at their face, it means showering.  Dignified means how do you feel after seeing this man, because both of those things do not exist, so in North India right now there are 20-23 people, the country's border is very secure, nothing is happening, they can't let it go, it is in the DNA which is behind in our subconscious. Also you belong to this area only and I understand and it's high time they get out of this do you agree with this because it's a little important isn't it  Will remain intellectual and we are absolutely boys, I am Agri's Olympic medalist, they come from our place and there are people in general forces too and we have to keep ourselves absolutely fair. If he is not asking you not to finish it at all, then you can reduce it.  These are the marches on social media and by doing these tubes and doing this, they are becoming private, aren't they? Which of your tests is Australia? They say that those biting dogs and those ones and those thundering clouds and raining clouds and so on.  something like that  There are a lot of proverbs, so many of them are of Hindi, if I am not that teacher type, then I am not going to get them out quickly, but you must have heard them, increase their mobile number, connect with them, connect with their organization, contribute something to them, give it to them, I don't know how to play bike in IPL. So please this is something which was triggered in the tweet I will be getting de content. This will give you a lot of clarity, will give you peace and will leave you restless and anxious from inside.  Will not go will say yes many people will say which is my audience till now so I have been six which is this ideology I have to speak and spread this ideology that friend keep some peace they are coming something but next n country every give  So They Bill Have You Future Little Beat Differently They Can't Di Can't Be Business Hai Usually First they used to speak like this then they used to do like this Dees which are trades of low self esteem people whom something they  If it happens then he has to do it like this again and again then date it d think I hope you like and share thank you very match"

    "title": "Choosing Negativity Or Positivity ｜  Is There A 3rd Option ？ [HTQCRKvlNyc].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, very practical practical topic Politics and Negativity and how the general public who is the subscriber, how do you approach it, it is very practical because you cannot escape from it, what people understand is that saying something bad about something  Don't say whatever you want. Someone has said something about your leader. Your leader may be your own leader. Respected Modi ji or Respected Rahul ji. It may be someone else. Respected.  Arvind Kejriwal ji may be listening against him or criticizing him or you find anything negative, I want to tell the public to bring one more word in your life and under some examples I will take you towards a higher order. And that word is Seeking Positivity Itself is a Negative Thing Write this Not Able to Talk About So Called Negative Thing is Also  A negative thing, one word, remove the positive and negative from your life and what to write in its place, listen carefully, remove the positive and negative, write the word, write it down somewhere else you will forget. You will see the video every day, so many come, so many come, so many others come, then it is good.  It will feel like a satsang and if you are not able to use this word then you will not be able to give knowledge to the world and you will get trapped in the cycle of positivity and negativity.  This is negative preparation. Negative preparation. You can see its very simple examples below: You drive a car, any car you own, do you wear a seat belt in it? When you go to drive, do you think the whole time, I will have an accident, I will have an accident, I will have an accident. I will die. If I die, I have to wear this seat belt to save myself. Have you said this somewhere? It has been set in the environment that wearing a sealed belt is for safety.  If you have a car with airbags then it is more safe. Do not drink and drive at night. If this thing is clear to you then it is a negative preparation. There is no emotion in it. You are not seeking positivity in it.  If you are learning then don't wear it. Tell me that someone will do the same. When you are crossing the road, you will look left, then look right, then look left. Will you cross the road carefully or you  Do you cross by being positive that no, nothing will happen, nothing will happen, nothing will happen, that next person will see, all people are good, no one will beat me, can you see how things are on the roads, so you have to prepare in the same way, whenever you are competitive.  Prepare for the exam. Whenever you do anything, this negative preparation will come in handy that brother, if it is done then it is great but if it is not done, then in the same way if any political party is political.  If a leader or someone is doing something, then as a public, we are only asking questions, so this is only a negative preparation that what you have done is so effective, is n't it? If so, then please explain and if you are not able to explain, then  Brother, then we will have to get ready, brother, either tell the government, everyone will get employment, there is no need to worry, we will give it, tell us, and if it is not in your power, we will prepare to go out, brother, tell us in gestures, tell us directly.  If you give, it is even better and the best thing is that you type outside, however, do not send them to Ukraine, that is, to fight Russia's war and these Israel and Hamas are also being sent there where so many of our children are being sent, this and this and so on.  We are also good countries, but we should be told, brother, what can we do, how much is in our control, what we can do for the farmers, what we can not do, where is our money going, are we spending water, then if their things, if we question.  If you ask here why people should do this  It is said that this is negativity. In the pursuit of positivity, you will be deprived of the opportunity to move ahead by understanding the things in your life. In the relationship, if something is not going very well between the husband and wife, then just discuss it.  Not doing is not positivity and discussing is not negativity. You are asking yes brother, if this continues then the relationship will break.  This is a negative preparation, let's talk openly once, yes, what is the issue, no, it is not right, it is ok, I cannot live with my parents, I am being tortured a lot, I cannot live here even for six months, I have bought a house, let's shift.  Let's do it, we will have to talk while going on rent, it is not like that wife comes every day and is sad, this is her reality and you come, do not spread negativity, talk negative about my mother, your mother should not let her live.  As for you, you remain missing in the office for 12 hours a day and even on Saturdays you are playing the program as per your mother's request. Okay, we are going here, we are going there, today that mother's gone, aunt's gone, aunt's gone.  Gone there, went here, new marriage is yours, you are not giving time to your wife and you are my wife, don't talk negative, don't talk negative as soon as you open your mouth, life doesn't work like this.  There is no negativity, I had made a video on that thing earlier also, it was good, I hope you saw it and enjoyed it. What about cognitive dissonance, you will find within the country, the reason is happy with reason, not happy with reason, so you don't have to take sides.  It has to be realized in advance that not every man can make every man happy, not every man can be ultimate, to run this country, to run the world, many men are needed, many people are needed, many idols ji.  There needs to be a consensus, no one thing can be right inside a house, only if the mother is in control, then you know what will happen, if only the father is in control, then you know what will happen, only the children cry, they cry out their pain.  And even if you don't listen to your parents at all, you know what will happen, only by working together, raising your issues and raising your pain, talking, raising people's pain, because sometimes what happens is, like us, this is my channel, how have I  I have told you that this is a channel for the intellectuals, it is not very much for the general public, even for the poor people, so now many people will come and say that hey, you are easy, you can do anything while sitting in the AC or on the sofa.  You, brother, of course, only if there is comfort in my life, only then I am getting a chance to think and think. The man who is the smartest and the one who has time is the one who changes the world. Remember, these people who are running away are the ones.  No idea comes, only one person sees it like this  Many years ago, we were carrying goods from here to there and picking them up. The one who invented the wheel was not the same person who was busy. There is a man sitting like this, he has so much free time that the apple is falling and  To think why the apple is falling because the world had seen the apple falling many years ago but brother Newton was sitting comfortably in front, normally a rich man, a little above a level, a plateful man, he was near Archimedes.  He had the luxury of realizing that while sitting in the bath tub, he was sitting comfortably and thinking how is this flute, then he took out Archimedes' principle, then you have to realize that whoever is thinking, will be doing philosophy, will be thinking, he will be in his own right.  You must have risen a little by thinking and if all those people can't do it, then just because someone is giving it to you and is doing it ready-made, then you can participate and can do it to other people too.  That we should not consume things just like that, if a bridge has collapsed and many bridges are collapsing, accidents are happening somewhere, there are pot holes in the roads, train accidents are happening, accidents like Hathras are happening. So we have to see what is the pattern in them, whether it is being built quickly, on one hand, the infrastructure is already there, we are doing so much great and it is being built so quickly, what can be built slowly, it is very easy to say that they have done so much, we have done so much. Hey, you cooked the vegetables so quickly, then the vegetables came out burnt, were they cooked on high flame or were not tasty because many things get cooked on their own time, you do everything quickly, last time, you were in a hurry, Dwarka. You know that a person had fallen on the expressway. After the fall, the inquiry kept going on and it got delayed. Do you know those who are residents of Gurgaon or not, you must have heard that Dwarka Expressway was being built, a person had fallen.  And he had said that he will be blamed. It is not easy to blame. If someone has put pressure on a company then he never even made an inquiry to understand what happened, who was blamed, why is it possible that you blame someone?  Speak quickly, do it quickly, it is said that the work of haste is of the devil, so this is to discuss things, to speak to the general public, who should not call it negative, everything is good in the country, it is not going to happen by saying that everything is good and like in the country.  Is  It will remain the same by calling yourself a Vishwa Guru (Vishwa Guru). It sounds very good. There is no Vishwa Guru anywhere near him, there is no Dhore, otherwise there must be a desire but we are far away from that, first get the basic things right, you will see the video in Economy.  You will see other things also coming, you will enjoy the content of this channel very much, do not get confused about positivity and negativity here, talk about negative preparation, after a certain age in life, after a certain age, there is a pill which is sorbitated.  If something happens suddenly, like pain in the heart under the tongue, it does not mean that you are a negative person, that you have prepared, if someone has a BP machine, then if there is high BP, then it is necessary to check it at home.  If there is a negative preparation inside then there will be some high blood pressure or some heart related problem, so I have made my own arrangements. Okay, if someone has asthma, then he has kept the Fush Fush ones, or if I have an attack, will I go to the shop? To meet that time, I make preparations in advance to speak, think and do about these things. What is negativity? This is a negative preparation. If you go anywhere, do you not keep everything in your purse or the cards of the purse?  The purse is gone, the money is gone, you go out somewhere, you keep your wife in two or three places, you also keep it in your bag somewhere, some such bag will be in hand, one will be here, the phone is also kept by the man.  Sometimes it does n't happen at all, well, many people do n't think like this, many people are like this, they will keep everything in one place and then go to sleep and then it will be oh, I am done, there are many such people, maybe they are those people.  Those who learn positivity, don't think negatively, don't think negatively, or someone else, only then there will be negative preparation because this is another big disease, all is well, that is in Amir Khan's picture.  People liked it very much, L is well, L is well, I am for Mark, Mark, yes, those who are completely losing their life, many people start losing their life as soon as they think negative like this, so brother, all is well for you, but brother, many of us are.  There will be people who will talk, who will prepare for all the things, so there is a channel for those people also, who can listen, yes, yes, this is going wrong, if these people who awaken intelligence, wisdom and consciousness go more, then this will happen to the population and  it  This is happening and this is happening there, this can happen, yes, we can discuss this, rest of the people should talk positive like this, do not speak ill of anyone, do not speak ill of anyone, if you will not speak ill of anyone, the reason has to come.  Whatever you tell me, if there is a lie in this world, then the truth will also have to come, because what is the system of truth that by the time the truth will tie its laces to get up, the law has traveled, the world at times rotates so fast.  If any person comes, he is telling the truth in his situation, he is giving another perspective, don't speak, they will understand on their own, oh brother, if someone has heard your lies, it becomes the truth because the truth has never come.  Hey Guru ji, don't tell me, we know this, you don't know this much, even after knowing, they start believing it, then what is the problem, he went ahead and someone read it, it has flopped. Therefore, now through this digital medium where people can talk about People Need Faces, brother is explaining in such a manner, then when people write in the comment section also, then they also put their mind to it. When such videos are made, then they comment.  When people go to the section and write something, the person feels like writing something wrong, he sees that there are 50 people writing this, am I the only idiot that I am feeling different, that means everyone is feeling this way, so this is a Better a medium has been made, you guys write in the comment section that how much you agree with what has ever been told in this and are you now guys going to do and prepare yourself in life no negative preparation to NP likh lo ek term hai ek ek I have given a definition and for negative preparation, I am telling this to the men also in gender, I am not saying this.  It is said that women do not have intelligence or they are not there but as a gender a man and man of the house the father and all the heads or whatever Sambalpuri is ok. Negative preparation is that brother the vegetables are getting less so I should do it like this is ok.  If too much chilli is added then what is the remedy? If too much salt is added then I should add potatoes. This happens everywhere wherever the mind is running. It is not that everyone has the capacity to talk about negativity.  So this is a very good term of negative preparation that anything wrong will happen, we are prepared for it and back up to backup to backup and in our true thinking, thought is after this and if this thought is after then we are very relaxed, confident, only then there is peace.  You come to know that some or the other thing is going wrong with you, learn positivity in it and go to sleep. You will not be able to sleep because your intellect knows that brother, if some scandal has happened, then why should that person do it?  That knowledgeable person was telling me that it can be like this, see it like this, my work will be in the videos from here onwards, I will talk like this but at the end of it, I will also take you towards the solution, Dhruv Rathi ji, as he is our dear.  Now people also say that it is good that they raise issues, but they are not able to give solutions because they live outside, that is fine and the complete understanding of the situation is also not good and they present things in black and white only.  I have a lot of subscribers because high road thinking is not needed. Look why I don't have any subscribers because I come here every day, sometimes here, sometimes there, sometimes here, I told you that in cognitive dissonance, a person's mind becomes crazy. Cognitive dissonance is nothing but. Who would like to connect with the nurse of the mind, then you also want a butt like me, the day you go over this hurdle of mine that whatever I say, you will understand it.  Oxy Maran seems like something or there is a contradiction or cognitive dissonance or brain fog, whatever you want to say in this way, it feels like a stress on the mind, then you will get trapped in it, it is possible, I will end on this, I will try to tell. Modi ji is very good and thinks about this country. Rahul Gandhi ji is also very good and thinks about this country. Arvind Kejriwal ji is also very good and thinks about this country. Drav Rathi is also very good and  This Thinks about the country I am also very good and think about this country and you are also very good and think about the country and mostly people in this country are like this but just the way of doing, the way of thinking is different And it is something like, I would like to tell you very well that every person wants to represent India in the Olympics, but not all of them are able to participate in some sport, does the country give a chance to those who demonstrate themselves that I have done this thing?  If there was a gun then my score was this much, in archery my score was this much or in running I was more, everyone's intention is that I, I, I do it, mine is mine, I know everything, okay, so everyone's intention is there, but who will the country give a chance to?  The country thinks that who is the best, but who is the best? The question is, can be or not, everyone's intention is good, it is like that, I will make the vegetable good, I will make it, then someone should be given a chance again and again, but if someone's vegetable is not good.  Now I feel that it can be made better or is there any harm in telling him that brother, put some of this in this one, last time it was like this, I don't feel that we are going well, I am saying the rest, brother, to whom.  Power has been given to me, I have gone and cast my vote, it is the Constitution, I should also listen to the one who is telling me that I have been given a seat or something like a driver, if the passenger is saying, brother, drive properly, drive slowly, don't go left.  If you are sleeping then take a break, take some rest, sleep a little, don't you have the right to drive in a car, leave everything to the driver and sleep, all or many of the people are there, the conductor or the one sitting in front is a little smart.  They keep checking to see if the driver is taking a nap, if he is tired, then it is important in life, it does not mean that you do not like the driver, brother, you are the one who made him sit there, what is the problem if he driving too fast  So tell him to drive very slowly, what is the problem if he is not taking the right turn after looking properly in the mirror, last time he had taken a left turn, he had narrowly escaped, what is it, no, no, don't say, no, he is a good driver, don't speak. Don't think anything negative, nothing will happen, it does n't happen like this, there should be negative preparation, yes, then please share in the comment section, I hope you guys are understanding this thing and also like it. Thank you very much"

    "title": "Conflicting Ideas And Emotions ： The Tough Path To Become An Intellectual [9VbHVY3A0Bs].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, it will be a very deep topic, it will be beneficial for everyone for the subscribers, also share it. Last time, I had made an Adulz video of mine just to tell what I think, it is episode number 100, today I want to tell something deeper than that, many people enjoy the content.  We are doing it and many people are facing problems, this is also a fact, so I will address those who are facing problems, those who are doing it to enjoy, they do not have this problem.  Which is beyond what I will discuss today and what is the issue for those who are not able to do it? You guys should note down one word - cognitive dissonance. If you understand this thing then there will be a lot of progress in our life against Modi ji.  Say something, say something against the present dispensation, is there any condemnation against it? Who are we going to protest like this? Are we talking normally? Do this, do that, simple form of cognitive dissonance.  The thing is that conflicting belief systems cannot be kept in the mind. For example, you have a very close friend, a very dear friend, you have been a friend for many years. Sometimes you catch him stealing, now he sees it in front of your eyes. Report or maintain friendship, this is cognitive dissonance and there are many such contradictions in life as to what to do, you may like some, you may not like some, then you should understand this. If you want to understand the deeper thing, go through this channel of mine.  I am taking you out of the matrix, brothers and sisters, Red Pill, Blue Pill, Black Pill, which pill will you take next? If you have understood all the things then it can be done easily in Hindi language without giving you the exam of MIT, given by Harvard, given by London School of Economics.  The level is very high from IM, that is why the subscribers will not increase so fast, they will come and go, brother, not many people come to the top notch colleges, I also know that this is 1 lakh.  I know that it will take a lot of effort to reach the subscriber base, but the subscribers who remained and those who remained kept watching the content and did not think that this is political content, what is the benefit to me, I make videos only to benefit you in your personal life.  I am not here to do anything politically, I am telling anyone how to focus on one's life. It is necessary to include such different types of knowledge transferors in every 152 videos so that  You also have to keep hold of your audience, it's like vote bank politics, what is happening, otherwise will you make many people feel that this is a rant, many people do rant, oh this is not right, that too is not right like this.  This is not right, nothing is right, many people have started comparing me with Dhruv Rathi ji, you are Dhruv Rathi's father, I am not old enough to become his father, yes, it is fine, he is in his 30s.  A little more than that, he has washed his hair of knowledge, what to do, okay then Dhruv Rathi ji also has his own respect, he brings things by shik shik shik, I take them to a higher order, I am for the intellectual, I am for the one for whom  I say again and again that whoever has the time to sit comfortably, if you have a driver in your life, a car, a bungalow, a bank balance, whatever Amitabh Bachchan was saying to Shashi Kapoor, whoever has it, it is okay, wall picture.  The dialogue that was in  They are understanding that the channel is for him, not for the rest of the people. Now, how can that man say what else, he will not understand. He is worried about where the money will come from tomorrow, he is worried about his job, he is worried about being fired, he is worried about his life.  Will it happen? It is not for him, it is for intellectuals, it is for influence so that we can influence the society, my subscribers, my family in a way, show the truth, bring it out of the matrix, it is for him, it will not be for everyone.  If a first class child comes, there is talk of PhD, then he will not understand the off course, nor will he go away sulking. Which is okay, then even if you want to become one, it is not necessary to have a bank balance, a car or a bungalow.  That is, if you have a desire and believe in capital science, then you are right and do not become a useless moral science teacher and you are not respected in everything, or you will be insulted, there will be a huge budget. How did you do this to many people? In the last 10, 12, 14 years, it has been explained through marketing through whatever media that countries like Russia were still won by Modi, there too they said that in 2014 it was like this. Let's talk about 2024 as it was in 2014. Modi ji is absolutely right. There was a lot of disappointment in the country and Modi ji came and got married. He is absolutely right about 2024.  There is no need to speak because it seems as if Modi ji is going there anyway. Go to Russia again and condemn your own country. It is not a good thing even in 2014, like someone else does every now and then.  So you should not speak out, friend, the standard should apply to you, so whoever you are a devotee of BJP, what is the difference between me and Dhruv Rathi, I want BJP to do well, I don't think so, Dhruv Rathi ji, he is very bad about BJP. I want to point out the mistakes. BJP is a very lovely and good party and right now it is going into a deep decline. It has taken in so many people from around the world. It has taken in so many people from outside. Now they are signing the slips.  You must have seen that Mawa Mitra ji has written something. Is there a minister whose slip is being cleared? Whose KG? You tell me in the comment section. I will come and learn and he does not want to do it like this but it is getting stuck everywhere in the wrong place.  Everyone is becoming lax everywhere. It has become such that everyone is like Modi ji, this is a game of hockey, no no, you will only score goals, we will save no goals, do as many goals as you want. I am watching the direct collapse of a good party.  Which is not a good thing, so what should BJP do next? It should do good. You will also give advisory to BJP because of me. I have seen many in many comments because of this. If you do not speak good about BJP, then it is not good about the ruling party.  please tell me  Let us take this from you even if you are a Congressman. Let me tell you one thing, let's discuss it in a little more detail. Whatever I talk about will lead to cognitive dissonance. You will have two belief systems. Friend, tell me straight.  Congress is good, BJP is not good, Congress has done all these things, which BJP is doing now, Into the five times, 20, 30, 40 years ago, BJP should dismiss the elected governments.  At least they do something like Operation Kamal or Tack, they directly abolish 356 there, it is so out of phase that sometimes elections are held in Gujarat, sometimes in Rajasthan and sometimes in Andhra Pradesh.  Sometimes elections are held at the Center and they are different, all out of the face, they started happening from the same time, 69, 70, 71 and the 80s and governments were dismissed in them, so all the work is being done, all the work is being done on them.  If they have kept it, it does not mean that even their beliefs will be justified in today's time, because the country has moved forward, earlier they did not know anything about social media news, one used to know Doordarshan, Salma Sultan, she remembers like this, 'Laal Phool Laga'  K Salma, we have come today in such Doordarshan, in 15 minutes it seemed that the country is very perfect, even today if you watch Doordarshan, the country seems as if everything is healed, okay, at that time only that was there, now at that time.  You Could Get Away Doing These Things Which You Can't Get Away With Today  His grandfather had done something that he can do today. Let's see if he has this conflicting belief.  Systems Do Not Become Fan of This Politician We have to make ourselves powerful to the government. The correct word of democracy which is in our country and in the world is more correct word than this democracy is representative democracy. We send our representatives, we do not rule directly. Once we voted for him, we gave him all the rights of decision making, with whom to sign, this has to be done from Russia.  If we are meeting and will get upset with the western country, then we have to stand on this decision that if we are meeting with Russia, then now we will say this, we do n't even know, we will have a lot of knowledge, we must be doing some great work, we have given it to us. Now you don't have to say that anyone can sign anywhere, can do anything to anyone, we have given the right, but brother, questions will be asked in between, friend, tell us also what great work you are doing, tell me exactly what.  is happening That treaty could be signed inside the Artic where our Indian Navy would be able to go, Russia could not and what exactly happened, many a times we tell you what happens, you all have to see, watch the video, understand the entire content.  At any time, an issue is made so big that it seems like a great achievement and nothing happens in the next 10, 20, 15 years. For example, if you remember Manmohan Singh ji.  The first one was the government, before the second one came, there was a no confidence motion and the left had come against it which had supported them earlier. Do you remember on the nuclear treaty with America, it seemed as if we don't know what is going to happen.  The government stake was put down and then after that, you must remember Mulayam Singh's ad was Amar Singh ji and he had supported the government, somehow it was saved and at that time songs like Sing Is were used to come.  King Sings King and later, I don't know, do you people remember that time? Please write in the comment section. It felt like we have achieved something good, very good, but what about which electricity was generated there and how many megawatts were generated there?  What exactly was the benefit of that treaty? Do you people remember anything about it? Now it will continue like this, some will come, some will say, some will not be understood, it will seem that something has become great, everyone will say yes yes, everything has become great, why because everyone  are speaking  It is great, it is going on in the news, leaders are also speaking and my boss is also saying, this is the national pride, I have made a video recently, you all must have seen that the person with respect is very good, it is getting views.  Look, now we have become like a country, earlier we could have been accepted, I am talking about the public, I am a politician by birth, I have to tolerate the crowd, that is why we rule, brother, we rule only, we are the ones who say this.  Take  If you rule us, then they already know this, but now they also have to tell us, we are the people, we are the people, we are the people, we are the people, we are the master, we have to tell, we are becoming aware, we are getting to know, we will ask questions, we will know everything.  If I ask and if I ask everyone, then if Congress comes to the state governments and you are in that state, then questions will be asked about them too, if they talk about some foolishness then their point will also be told, but now the budget is to come, the most powerful is the central government.  She sets everything at the end of every video. I will tell you a little about GST. What data is the government hiding? You write in the comment section. Is GST being hidden so that Chandrababu Naidu asks for more increase?  So give us I do n't know and secondly you will keep coming such small videos which will keep giving you clarity about these things and in the coming time if you want those who are supporters of BJP and those who are devotees.  Those who are also ex-bhakts, I am not ex but those who are called devotees, who are still there, then you are also my subscribers, I will tell you also what should be done, you tell the people of BJP to do something, I will give them a lot of advice too.  I will give practical advice, I will give such advice which even Prashant Kishore ji might not be able to give by taking a consultation of Rs 50 crores, I will give it here for free and you will say wow Guruji wow, so you are not from Congress then neither am I from BJP.  I am neither of BJP nor of Congress, nor am I yours. I am bringing the public out of the matrix so that we can see their drama. That video was a great hit of mine. We will also watch this drama with a smile. If you people have not seen it then watch it.  People also enjoyed it a lot, the way I am bringing these things with ease and with simplicity and relaxation. In this way, you have to watch the channel like youtube1 and enjoyment, only then you will be able to enjoy and if you are watching this till now, then you  It is a request, because look, there is strength in numbers, march towards the figure of 50,000, increase two or three subscribers from your circle because here you will get more political debate for yourself than anywhere else, what will happen to the rest in the debate? Congress people will show BJP down, BJP people will give the address of Congress, what sins you committed 40 years ago, they will tell what are you doing today and hence I will end for you, did you just listen, yes, that's right.  This is fine, but this election, now these next elections will take place after the next 5 years, the power is not changing right now, understand now and ask questions, that is the question, the main thing is that you have the right to ask questions.  And so that the discussion can be correct, Politics is becoming very important, you can directly gain a lot in your personal life from our country's politics, video of that is also going to come. How can youth also join politics? If you want a video, please write in the comment section. We do not pass time in politics. Negativity people are saying that I am very negativity. I am a good person even beyond that.  I will make a video for you to listen to what negativity is and what it is not, so now I hope you got to know what is cognate dissonance, I will also tell you about its negativity.  I will make one more video and you will enjoy it too. The videos will come back to back. Watch them every day. Subscribe to the channel. I want something better than the fuss on other channels and news channels to take away and get a good night's sleep. I want this.  My subscribers should sleep well, yes, I am slowly and gradually starting to understand how this game works and if you subscribe to me now, in three to four months you will start getting a lot of clarity. How are all of them and you can no longer fool us and how can we get them to do the work? How to straighten our own owl? First see what your owl is and then how to straighten it. How to use the politician. This is the biggest thing. Politicians are the people. Here I am teaching people how to use politicians, slowly people come, you are a Congressman, you belong to them, I will do something about BJP in two videos, then Congress people will run away, you would have run away.  This is why I have to make it little by little in between. Please like the channel and subscribe. Thank you very much."

    "title": "Corruption , शादी और एक Learning [jNC_ggKAyqo].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today's topic is very interesting, you all have to see it and share it with everyone because if this thing is done in the society first then people will know the topic. You must have seen it, corruption, marriage market and great learning of corruption. Now, I don't want to do that to any particular person in the country, but as an example, I will put the template for other places too. What happens in the marriage market, there is a girl, there is a boy, and the girl has you. And if you are the father of the boy, then here we will first address you that if there is a father who is corrupt, is in the government system, like there is other vice, then how is the marriage market affected by the corruption money from him, and who is not, how is that? People are affected, they say, how does corruption fit in with Sanu? If someone is doing it, how does it fit in? That is a great learning. I am going to tell you that brother, I don't have to do it, I don't do it, but still how can one be affected and you will understand this completely, dear.  If you go then you will not be affected and what do we have to do in such a society because many times I get comments like this, is that corruption so bad, there should be capital punishment, oh friend, leave it friend, do disgusting scandals like capital punishment, there is no capital there, you are in corruption.  You are late in capitalizing. Practical people say that you are angry from within. You will not reduce the next time either mine or Guru ji's element is less in the world. Tell me.  You understand about the girl, if she is corrupt then you would do well to appoint an officer in the government department, it is okay at different levels, there are different departments, you have appointed something, now if she is getting married, then the girl is average, mother.  I am average in appearance, I don't have any great education, so I have to invest money in marriage. Do you understand what they say, money is not earned money, it is the money of corruption. Now the boy who is coming is a boy's. are a  Boys, they are coming, they also know that they have a wonderful family from behind. Today's definition of a good family would be that they have reduced the wealth. Well, it was more than before but they say that Lakshmi has come, Lakshmi has not come, she has brought Lakshmi.  And what Mataji is saying is that Lakshmi is the one who stays because Lakshmi stays only with Saraswati ji and Saraswati is the one who has wisdom and knowledge. You are bringing that doll with lot of money.  That money has to be taken out because no matter how much money father has made in marriages in his life, big money is lost in marriage, it is lost in singing, it is lost in clothes, car is lost in Guddi Mill caste, no one is giving five rupees, so much corruption.  There is no Let Me Tell You Witch in India, it is a good news, it is okay because I have not done this much, but in the rare cases, which I am telling by calculating the average, then that money is bound to be lost and the girl is with you.  Do n't check to see if she does anything less, because what is there to do less, that means it was money anyway, so now she is of no less use, after a few days, when he goes away, there is a tussle again in marriages and  What is the roller effect happening due to this, there are some girls who are his friends, there are in his friend circle, there are in his relative circle, who are good story with him, Lux is fine even in these terms off, now you will not even speak, why do you say such things to people?  loss and  Also, this is the marriage market, this is India, I am not expressing my views, I am showing the mirror to what is happening to the society, no, not all are good, what is this girl, take mother in studies too, some are good, some are doing jobs. Looking at this she says that if he has got this Lot Saheb, now he has got this Lot Saheb on the basis of money, whatever Lot Saheb can happen on the basis of Papa ji's money, it can also be in the government system or any private or  something If it is possible in me, then she has got this. Okay, now this girl, the other girl, if this girl has got this, then I am this, so I will get this, but now this girl does not have father's money, nor does she have that much.  It is strange that this girl has got this, on what basis has she got this, either she is innocent or she is not going to tell openly, she is not getting such results now because these are east fencing plots, some boys.  East Fencing Park Fencing  Those boys who have corner plots, those plots are taken first or if there is a fairy on them, then the booking should be done first. Due to their caste, they do not get it. Now they live in Kavariya, now they are doing well in the job. The boy would be 29 years 32 years old.  Well, what is the definition of a good boy? The story of one who earns more than you and the story of your friend 's husband. Well, this is the definition. Otherwise, we will reverse this story that the boy's you are corrupt and the boy's where you are. too much  There is corruption, there is a lot of money here, this innocent man does nothing because the money is visible in the same way. In 8th and 10th, he was roaming around with a big phone because it would be a cash register. He is roaming around with a phone, spending it, wearing jeans.  If you have a mobile phone, if you have grown your hair, if you have a bike or if you have taxes, then which exam is he going to take now, this story is not going to be taken care of by anyone, so he is close to you, now you have to marry him too, because brother, it is retirement.  They Dad, who has earned money, the story is there is some system, some of it also has to be stuck to the truck, some scene is made of it that it reduces, it reduces the property, some of our houses are being built, some are real, listen for a long time.  There is a caste but it has no status of its own. Now when a girl has attracted her family member that everything is so visible to that sir, this house is like this, there is this and the marriage should be done like this. But brother  He doesn't have anything, he doesn't like anyone in himself, so now when this worthless person finds a worthy girl, Idli speaking, marriages should take place. I am telling you that this is the girl who was there before and the girl who was here. This girl had told that the son of a corrupt officer and the son of a corrupt officer should get married, but she also knows that he is corrupt and this one is corrupt, they do not marry each other because no story, no story, you get jeans and Jin Tal family respect. False respect, real respect, that too is needed because we have got a lot of money, now if we want respect then we will take respect from another officer who is here now and then, they think that the girl's parents will also be under their control, they have given so much money, no one likes it.  She belongs to a poor family, now we are giving it to her, we are setting it up, everyone is doing less, so this will remain so, their thinking remains like this and here also there is a similar relief that we have not asked for anything from the girl's family because and these people.  also thought that We are giving so much money, so the boy is under control, my boy thinks that the girl will be under control, there is no relief under control, this is also the truth because it has happened, now what next, so this is what is wrong regarding money and this middle  This type of relationships are happening more in the class itself. There are a lot of reports of breakups here. Today, a marital council consultant is telling you that I give airtel consultation in this problem.  The effect is that in the beginning it will appear as if she does not respect her parents. That story will come like this when you listen to the story of Eastern Dog, Eastern Dog, Eastern Dog, then for the second or third time in the whole day, the background is revealed. Now no one tells themselves, but  That is our imagination, what is the game in the story, when you see this in corruption, when you go to weddings, an officer is an officer of this level and in the wedding there is a 80 lakh 90 lakh 1 crore hydraulic lift.  You are giving so many flowers like this, where has the money come from? We always praise corruption that corruption is very bad, but a relative of ours is doing it and if we get a phone then it would be better uncle, ok you ji.  He will become a good brother-in-law, he will become a good relative, he will become a good uncle, he will become everything, they also tell that many of them become very good, now so and so has a son, brother, she has given birth to a lot, brother, she is our son and she is elder.  Because that little robin got up  He used to do it a bit to avoid being noticed and Choudhary is also making it a bit but we never say that we should marry his daughter because fear was a time in India this back, many people in the audience may not know when  Look at these things, Dr. Apna, when it was said like this, now Falna was her in-laws' house, meaning the food she had was probably less, she ate only a little or I don't know, Moral Values ​​are in our country in India, people are listening, see, I am sitting, I know the whole thing.  in the ears  There used to be a fear like this, now no one has any hesitation about getting married, if you want to get married then it is a very good thing brother, there is this much of the above and then there is this much of the other, all this is hypocrisy in the society, we discuss it with a lot of pressure, yes we  So we don't do it but we are ready to do it with such people, brother, when that money comes inside the house, it is okay inside your house, you cannot call her Lakshmi ji, she is not Lakshmi ji, she will not last, she is Lakshmi, Lakshmi.  ji's  Twin Sister, I will teach you this concept in the Astrology class sometime. Wherever Lakshmi ji is present, Lakshmi ji is not visible and wherever she goes, she is a symbol of hatred, distress, stress and frustration and the only way to keep her full is that you  There should also be Saraswati in the house. Saraswati level, which is a symbol of knowledge and wisdom, does not exist. All these corrupt people are their commonality, they are not such big investors. They don't understand how to invest money, they don't invest because firstly its color is not right and also the matter is getting tight and on top of that it is based on these things and hence marriages are further broken. Ask anyone, you did corruption all your life so that you can give up in a marriage and in that also your daughter does not get peace and that money also goes away and you don't even survive in the story after that and then you retire because of corruption.  So till then we can do it, no one is in a job, the job has to end some day, everyone's time will end some day, you have just turned 60, so this is a sign of corruption whenever you attend weddings. Look at the weddings around and see how many people are involved in corruption. Avoid them and praise them. They have a very good arrangement. This is the big one and then in front of it is the street of corruption. Don't say 'D Samaj Haj', you call out.  This society Haj, you call out and all the corrupt people want to do, this is a request, okay now they too must be listening, it is not like there are not all types of listeners, brother, if you are corrupt and the money of corruption is in the world.  Corruption is low and the money of corruption is not to be talked about. Please do n't make this useless show to him. You are telling others that you are spreading chillies. People will look at you from this perspective. For one thing, in the middle of the video, you have made people aware of others as well.  Everyone knows where he is coming from. Everyone knows that brother, there is no government official from peon to cabinet secretary whose salary no one can know. Everyone knows that the top most is Rs. 2.5 lakhs. Basic.  The smaller ones start from 21, they are launched and Dr. Kitna 40 42, whatever percentage is going on, this is how the salary is known, everyone's level is known to be 3%.  There is an increase in the salary of a government employee even after 5 years from today. It is possible to tell today that brother, it will increase so much in SPN, your basic is this much, your level is this much, there is this much increment, if you beat your hand, you will get promotion, then it will not be a simple math which will not be possible after knowing the salary.  The rest of the things you see are when they get married, it puts a lot of pressure on the society and then the honest government is like this, in the government not all are dishonest, now there is something missing but one.  What does Kammo say? The atmosphere has been created in such a way that even the one who is now a normal and honest government has raised expectations from the whole world that brother, this is what happened in so and so's marriage, this one is on a higher post than him, so this one should do more than this.  If there was a need then people extrapolate a lot and when they go to get married they call it time, we do n't want anything, we don't want anything, the meaning in itself is that of another vice, you can clearly define and tell that please don't do this.  We will spend this much. Call both the boy and the girl and tell them that this much will be spent on the marriage. Tell me how to do it. We have to do it this way. We can give you 10-20 lakhs. You can pay your documents and get that 50-60 lakhs.  Buy a flat or you guys make your life like this, this is where genuine marriages take place and for these marriages in a genuine way, I have made a course of premarital consultation.  There will be 2 hours of comment in the area. The one who wants to buy can also become a medical consultant and the fees are as much as his own and the pizza and in that all the questions are openly asked, first brother, tell me what is your account and what next.  There are expectations after coming here because if you have to ask a third person then there is less of a professional even a medical consultant. Before marriage, the boy hand in hand with the girl, the boy hand in hand with the girl's family, the boy and the girl separate from both the girl's family and then the boy with the girl's family and so on.  Apart from the family, so that those questions can be asked to them in the settings, take everybody on D page till this, I am teaching this thing and the video made in this my experience, this corruption is very closely linked with the troubles of marriage because he has troubles only in money. This does not mean that there are only troubles and there are no other troubles. Where there is no money, that cordalter is not true, but wherever there is money, it brings a lot of trouble. Do not even accept such money. Neither perform their Aarti nor clip it, only then corruption will be reduced in this country, just by saying that corruption is bad or corruption should not happen, how it is destroying the fabric, how it destroys the fabric, how corruption destroys the expectations of the people.  How do they tease, how does it happen in weddings, there is a lot because every person is extra political late, father has given so much at the wedding, father-in-law has given so much, their program will be there in future too.  It is set, she has just become an officer and after a long time we want to meet her, but if we don't meet her, I will make her the next son and the next expectation is that this was just a trailer, this is a picture, so I will look good for the whole life, so this is it.  Visions are being crushed and broken under the burden of all expectations and corruption even has a link with marriage. I have made this video with how beautiful it was, I have a request to you all in the form of Guru Dakshin.  Give this video a little spin, people will take their own input, there is every kind of party, there is every kind of party, spread awareness, send it to family group, subscribe the channel, these kind of issues which are having real impact on the society are real issues. Only then will I bring it, the expectations are so high that brother, we have done so much, now the next one should also be taken by the government, now you will marry the government one, now people will not be able to do that much because the system is becoming tight, it is becoming digital and the system will be in the next 5-  10  It will happen in a year that nothing will happen, otherwise that too a call, you have to see, then you get your daughter married in such a place, in the government, he is roaming like small lions, your daughter is not able to work, power, you cannot give endless money.  Now the relationship you built with her was more than money, the girl is no longer a fresh supply, otherwise she will not do anything to you, otherwise her son-in-law will not be very good because you had attracted him with money only, whom you had attracted with money, now that money is yours.  Can't give and and him  If you are not able to find the mother, he is also in this system, then there is a lot of trouble, this too, write your story and keep it in your diary, if you get an idea, then please lionize this person and we have to reduce corruption in this way.  That one who is doing corruption should not be allowed to be rewarded. In personal relationships, corruption outside is bad. If you prepare someone else's relationship then it is bad. If your neighbor does it then it is bad. If it is done in another district then it is bad. But if someone is doing it in your house then he is bad.  So it is the nature of a good man that he does not do it for himself or he is very simple. Who said that the people who do corruption are ill-mannered? Who said that the people who do corruption will look like dirty people or will use some abusive language? It is not necessary but.  Bhi very-very very -very decide humble garden bow and get very kar to dat is de greenness of human beings and you have you decide also  Actually what you want and what you don't want, so always remember this thing, this is a base and in future, if you marry like this, then there will be trouble in marriages. You are sure of this and it is happening and you have seen this in many marriages.  Those who have seen and agree with this, please write in the comment area so that other people also feel that it is not as if I have an empty casserole, I do not come like this and narrate the story by saying hello friends. This is a very clear cut establish trade which I have not been the same for many times. I have repeatedly reconfirmed and confirmed. Have you seen this trade, have you seen it around, have you seen it in some circle, please write in the comment area. Thank you. You"

    "title": "Delhi Coaching Centre Incident ｜ 03 Practical  Points Which Need Focus [feswfm7jWbk].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, Daily Coaching Center Tragedy, you all know that this video will be on the very painful accident that happened. I would like to highlight three points on which no one has paid attention. I always make the video a little late by three-four days so that as much as possible Discussion is done and whatever is left out, discussion is very important. Whatever is left out, go beyond that and tell me two or three points. I will tell you three points. The third point will be very important and will be very beneficial to everyone. So please watch this video and comment.  Will definitely participate in the section. Let's start with the first thing. Firstly, BJP has maintained the bad condition of Delhi and this is a basic problem in your fight. All the things in Delhi are dirty, these people wash their hands with LG.  The Chief Minister washes his hands in the jail and the people of Delhi were thinking for many days that if he wins all seven seats here, he will win here and he will give free electricity and water. Brother, the two boat ride is causing a lot of trouble. Inside accountability, you see further, I am not talking about taking anyone's side here, but this issue has to be raised, this is a big problem, it is a basic problem, the second thing I would like to tell in this very first point is where this study takes place. Children's coaching centers take place in commercial areas like Mukherjee Nagar or Old Rajendra Nagar, where these hubs are built, which is a commercial area, whenever we talk about a commercial area, it is a residential area.  Apart from residential, one area which we call commercial institutional, brother, we also call it that there will be shops where people will come and buy some goods, sister will buy a suit, someone will buy sweets or there will be a restaurant or there will be a showroom of electronics meaning.  There will be a space or it will be an office. What happens in the office is that any company has an office, there are employees there, they have work stations, there are offices, so there is one place, in both the places it is I told that a defined number of people can go, a defined number of people cannot come more than that, in any shop you cannot see that 200 people are given a set, but these coaching centers are practically schools which have their strengths like  That this is the Rao Academy where this happened and the rest too which were sealed or thousands of children come on any given day. I am not talking about the time when this incident happened. How many were there generally when it is the peak time because last year also there was a fire in Mukherjee Nagar and children had jumped there, no one died in that much accident at that time, perhaps 61 people were injured when that fire broke out, so first of all it was  Who will define, the government will define, MCD will define, brother, how can you let the children enter, so many agencies, it is deadly to go inside the basement, I ca n't breathe, Ava Dhaja ji's me.  I was watching an interview and told that one of his colleagues died while teaching in the basement of a center in Karol Bagh. He was a famous economics teacher. The entry inside the basement is normal. It is filled with water. It was a situation. This was the situation, I am saying it is normal, if some issue happens, there is no stampede, short circuiting happens, small fire happens, one entry and if you put 500 people in it.  As soon as she leaves, she will die, so the biggest issue is that he is going to the basement, why is he going and why is he going, I will tell you further also, no, you will not blame him, where will you blame him, where he is going, ca n't you see?  Your life is not in danger, I will come to the third point and explain it well. So, am I to blame them? Oh, they are to blame. Anyway, trains are derailing, bridges are breaking, you can see what is happening here now.  developmental disorder and  Awadh Hoja ji has come to the center because he has the presence on social media, I am not saying that there is any direct development fault of his, although there are differences of opinion in many ways with Divya Kriti ji, I am fine but Despina is not at fault here.  There is a famous dialogue of his which is going on a lot now that if nothing happens then it is an experience of the people that the anger of the children is bursting, the anger of the children which is bursting is wrong according to me, I will tell that.  Next and children, if you are listening, then listen carefully, this is very important, the third point will be very important. Coming to the second point, why do they study here only in Delhi? Today I am going to reveal that secret, what is so special here?  Why can't they study online? The reason is that children come from small towns and are ready to pay Rs 2 lakh fee in Delhi. If the same knowledge is taught to them in their city and explained to them, then they are not ready to pay the money. Awad Hoja ji said this.  but some calculations  Told and I personally appreciate it because they speak straight on the matter of fact, they say that this is business, which is, this is absolutely business, the teachers here and the coaching centers are businessmen and the children are consumers and so on.  The work of both is demand and supply. Here, Guru-disciple should do this, hold the feet, do this, do this, do not hold grudges. Divya Kriti ji operates in a different zone, which I think, if in that zone  If you operate then you will have to face these shortcomings. You should keep it strictly capitalized and on that basis only, services are being given and money is being taken. Services should be good and money should be talked about. It should be a simple matter.  Awad Hoja ji told a very interesting thing and which is very important to understand this coaching business that he said that there are local famous teachers in Allahabad and those who have studied coaching.  IS coaches used to charge 20 20 25 Hajj for the complete syllabus and even after paying 202000, the kids there felt very stressed and were not ready to give 20 20 2 Hajj when these famous branded players land there.  It is fine in Allahabad, so they hired the same local teachers, no one will come from Switzerland to teach there and now  If the brand comes then it is ready to pay a fee of Rs 1.25 lakh or Rs 2 lakh if ​​the fee is increased because look, the teacher will go only to the good teacher, where he gets more money, the one who teaches and if in Delhi then what is that command?  You can make more money because brother, it is considered an expensive thing, Delhi education is the same and why can't it be done online, after this there has been a ripple effect. Thousands more used to come to Khan Sir's coaching center there in Patna and Varanasi.  If the coaching centers were sealed even inside, then it has started that how was this thing being run and there could be something wrong here. We saw 22 children died in the gaming center in Rajkot. Even before that, all this happened.  This keeps happening, so I come to the third point that firstly, on this second point, I told that it can be done online, what kind of knowledge are you teaching in IAS that you have given him complete education, that you have done that to him?  Paper check will not be done. Paper check will be done.  There are also mediums where you have written your paper, scanned it, sent it and there is an actual competition, they will check it and give it to you. Why do you have to be there forcefully for all the things, because what, parents also feel that recovery is the only way to recover.  When the class will be online then nothing will happen. You tell me brothers and sisters, there is a teacher who teaches on the board only, on what else can he teach and the height of a teacher will be 6 feet, he will have a face and he will have a voice. So many people are sitting, thousands of people are sitting there, the first 10, 20, 30, they are seeing someone, the teacher and hearing the voice, the rest behind, don't know which mic they have put on mute, so now you can watch this video.  You are watching it comfortably and quietly in your ears, if I stand here, put a board in its place and start writing, let's teach history, Mughals came for the Battle of Panipat in 1526, then what is there to understand in this?  They came in 1526, you have to understand something, then there was a fight there with Brahm Lodi, Battle of Khanwa in 1527, then Second Battle in 1556, then Sher Shah Suri died in 1545, then Akbar ji left in 1605, then this Taj Mahal was built, then this is how Aurangzeb came, Aurangzeb came.  1707, then this period came, then the Maratha attack, then this came, the British came and quit.  Make India, friend, whatever you want to make, give me the notes of the rest of the book, give me the notes, the man will read it, what kind of new knowledge are you going to teach, can anyone be good, but only I have to come in those narrow streets where these children study.  The focus is getting more, I want to focus on the places where these children live, my third point is very important to remain constant, now secondly, look at the places where these children live, there is no air and they are 3030 40 50 yards away.  These are ghettos and if something happens there, the children cannot run away. Many news channels have shown the conditions in which they live and look at the food conditions of their messages, what a compulsion, man, are you becoming an IS? Become better than this friend, at least you will live in a clean place, at least you will not be covered with leather, in such a condition it looks like IS Esperance and everywhere IAS Esperance, Esperance and all this, this,  12th pass, 12th fail, the picture that was made is still going on, a picture will come in many circles, otherwise, this is a struggle, you have to go through it, you have risked your life here, you have unfortunately lost so much of your life, you are in such unhygienic conditions.  Where are you staying, what food are you eating? Come to Okla and see what is the compulsion, what are you becoming? Friend, you study at your home, it will be good there, but many people have to study at home too.  We have to run away from small cities or will we go to big cities because there are many other activities happening there and there are many scandals, this is also a fact, not all are coming to study, not all are even studying but they are asking their parents. How to withdraw money on daily basis, on monthly basis, two-three years will be spent in preparing for the exam, but let's see, let's have some fun because in that small town there is nothing happening, boys and girls, roaming around, dating, sex and drugs.  वशा वो वाहो  If there are no programs then that's why there is that other wise person from the big city who wants to study genuinely. He should come and roam around once, take his notes and do something, do that and do it online, there are all the facilities and let me tell you why are you coming brother.  If there is no environment to study in your house, then brother, take a hostel somewhere else and stay left and right in your city. And if there is no such environment then it is necessary for the people of this city to become like a fool everywhere. Hey, what kind of heart are you like this?  It can break. Hey brother, life is going here. Here I come to the third point which is very important. It's very easy to come and blame the government. Government, life is yours. Where will you go by blaming the government? The train descends, it descends. This water of yours fills people while dying. The third thing that I am going to tell you is that remember one word, it is used more in flying which is pilots but it Write importance in your life if you want to avoid situational awareness. In other countries things are taught in life. In our country no one cares. I am telling you as an example. You go to Goa and people get swept away in the middle there.  It's not like there was an ocean, there was a beach, it's okay, you didn't know how to swim, you went too close because the world was moving, the world was doing it, it happened with you too and someone got swept away and died, so how much news comes. People do not have situation awareness. The children who come from outside cannot survive. They have such easy dream eyes. In this case, like there were two girls, there was a slow reaction. Hey, what are you doing now? Why are you blaming them for this? Hey friend, don't blame them. I am doing it friend, blame the MCD, blame the sewer, blame the common man, blame the BJP, blame any minister, abuse him as much as you want, give whatever you want. I am not diverting them but I am teaching you that if you cross the road then you should be aware or not. If suddenly a life death situation comes then who will teach these things, these things are not taught in our schools, parents do not teach them in US.  There is a lot of shooting, Tatt guns are fired there, as soon as there was an attack on Trump, you saw that everyone bowed down because they have been trained, they have such incidents, they know that if a bullet is fired, do not start running, the bullet is fired first.  So everyone lie down, a basic drill is called, we don't have these things here, there is no awareness, there are dreamy eyes, their focus is on mobile, I am telling them, people taking selfies in mobile phones are dying, there is no situation awareness, it is raining outside.  It is pouring water outside. Water had come earlier also. It may be coming. Someone is running from inside. Someone is shouting. Be aware of what clothes I am sitting in. Am I wearing shoes? Women  Many a times I stop her from walking around wearing slippers because she has nail polish on her feet and that's how they should be worn. Look at any woman in school, that is, wherever you go, who is wearing sports shoes, which are for survival?  The most important thing is to run away, wherever someone teases you, if you have to run away then men roam around wearing these, here they also roam around wearing heels, they roam around wearing sarees, now that country is no more, if you like it.  If you don't understand whether you have to go to work or wear a saree and go to this grand function and there will be so much crowd these days, then who will teach this practical thing to the children and tell you that you have to be extremely situation aware? Let me tell you a small thing, outsider bomb.  In Mumbai, boarding and de-boarding the local is an art and the one who doesn't know, the outsider will die, that too is an art. Many years ago, I just say by God's grace, say something, I am very personal.  Give an example: I hate it but I have had a privileged childhood. I did not know how to get on and off the buses. Otherwise, when a person first starts earning his money, then he realizes that he is spending a lot of money on taxis, so one of the Days I was going in a DTC bus, I was fine and had to go somewhere by going to the railway station and catch a train, so I had luggage, so this was my first experience of life and it was many years ago.  Why and I remember the experience because after that I never had another experience and let me tell you why it didn't happen. I know that DTC people do n't just stop the bus, they slow down, you are supposed to get down and even if your suitcase with luggage is one.  Yes, but I did n't know how to get down, and as soon as I got down, I got down and the train came from above, I was about to die, that was the day and the last day, brother, then I had to board the DTC buses.  It does n't mean anything, but I know that every big dozen of these children cannot afford it, so brother, for that you will have to take a training and after living in a small town, when you suddenly come to a big city, you know.  Not only survival, how to climb, descend, sit, what to do, for that you have to be extremely alert and these things, parents and guardians and where those coaching centers are, these are the divine creations, they should also keep all these things.  Those children who come from outside will have to say that brother, how to survive here, this is not your small town, go here at night, go to this place, tease a girl, do all this, all these things can happen, who will guide you, otherwise tell me, the country.  Look, there should be fear, but can a girl go out at 2 o'clock in the night? Can you watch for it safely all over the country? Once Sheila Dikshit ji had said that if you go out at night, you would be a big troll, that's Chief.  She is a minister so she cannot speak, she has to maintain law and order and all this, although Delhi Police does not come under the Chief Minister, but she had a government in that time center also, but the fact is that life is mine, life is ours, isn't it here?  But if we are not aware of the situation, then no matter how much you argue that this should be fixed a little, that is the track of the railways, these people get down here, this is the track and from here, those three are going to climb, there is a gap in them. Age  There is a huge gap, I don't know now, it has been changed or not, but it was there since ages, many people used to get stuck in it, now keep talking, the government is stupid, keep talking, many people are risking their lives and instead of going from above, they also take shortcuts.  There are many crossing gates for trains to lower the train and take it out like this, people do this and they get away, many people are very expert but what happens is that if someone copies many things, then I do n't know.  If it works, this situational awareness is not instilled in our society. For example, how many times have we seen children from Bombay or Chennai or a college somewhere, who went to Himachal Pradesh for an outing and took a bus like this and they went somewhere like this.  It looks like a dry river and in the middle it looks like an island. They are going there to take photos and the dam water is released there. Water is released there every day but no one told them not to go there. There was a board in front of them.  He was looking crooked, no one noticed, everyone was clicking their selfies. How many times have we heard such stories of five children being swept away. So children have this age, isn't it? This is the age of 20 to 27 26.  I have a very dreamy mind, I do n't know where death can come from, we will have to give training to our daughters and girls, they will also have to be smart, brother, if you go to the basement somewhere then make them a prisoner in your life today.  Those who are listening to me, ban them from going to the basement, wherever there is any commercial activity and that is Palika Bazar. Why do you have to go anywhere, anyone inside, anyone below, there is anything inside, anyone, wherever you are.  The crowd seems to be huge, stop going, see the incident of Hathras in India, see the incident of Rajkot, you have to go on the same day, there is going to be the same crowd, otherwise we 500 children will study, how can I, and Avaja ji says that the government.  Don't you want to limit the number of children to 200? Hey, hit the limit in the classroom. There are 40 children. How can you put 200 children in a room? How many will they come out of? And they are saying that the limit should be kept below 200, why brother, why should it be kept below 200? Why don't you shift to Greater Nod, it will be good for that city too, there you will get commercial and cheap accommodation, you will get residential, you will also get hostel, do that either you or them.  Make it mandatory that you will have to take school premises. For coaching, type with end schools. After school, do your runs all night long. You can type with schools with private schools that we have our own coaching center here. What do you need, classroom only.  So you need to get AC installed there, you earn so much money and take those four, five or six classes as your own, take as many school premises on rent as you want, type them, start teaching in government schools and other government schools.  Within the schools, the government can give subsidy to them and can say that you should give tuition to the children of the poor because we have given you these resources. Those of the government schools also say that Delhi schools are very beautiful and good, then brother, Delhi government is doing this. So which one is in your hand, you are crying in the name of BJP, Aam Aadmi Party people, tell me, this is a government school, there are so many of them in this area, tap this, no one will die here because government schools are open, aren't many?  only open Traveling there means it is very comfortable, they will sit comfortably and teach you and whatever their fee of 20 paise, calculate it and in return tell the poor children that these 10 more children will sit, what difference does it make to them if they are getting premises.  This is where they are teaching 100 thousand children, they will teach 100 more, what is the problem with them, do this type of vote bank politics, how is the idea, tell me, my work is to watch every video.  You have to give solution also, do n't wake up from hopeless despair, don't have so much dependence on everything, this is the case in the government too and wherever people are sitting, they are sitting just like our intellect, they are not very intelligent, they had passed some exam, it was a mistake.  It is not like that their IQ will increase a lot since then it has only decreased and these people cannot think so much out of the box, so spread this thing, spread this video, the third point is in our hands.  We can do whatever is in our hands. If you are listening to this video, then whatever can go wrong with our children, from crossing the road to boarding a plane, we have to be situation aware everywhere, no matter what happens anywhere.  When a person goes in a plane for the first time, then how to check in from there, how is the luggage going there, where to enter from where, you should be aware of something, otherwise you can't board the escalator anywhere.  An issue for people who  Those who have never climbed a escalator can fall in life. What is it for them? It is safe. Many people may get scared. Many people may have issues. So please spread. India is a country where situational.  There is no awareness, it seems that if something happens, someone else will do it. Recently an incident happened, a grandmother left her grandson. 5 year old was looking at the lifeguard mobile in the swimming pool. Run after the builder, grandmother. No one will ask why she left her grandson because the grandmother is an old woman and the grandson was a child of 5 years, no one will tell her that she has left all your life and property, let someone else protect them and if he doesn't then it will become his.  It may happen, but your child will not come, nor will yours come, here it is a simple thing, I want to tell all this, in our country, the rider is responsible for his life and property, it is also written somewhere that they will not do, they should not do, they should not do.  should should do  This should not have been done, now do it, uproot them, what will you uproot them, what will you do, you will punish them, then the punishment has become compensation, then why did you leave the grandson in the care of the grandmother? Because what did the mother have to do, what was the father doing? You have made SO pieces of security inside your house. I want to awaken this for everyone. I was thinking that this will see, this will see, this will see, no SO is there because the boss sucks the soul there.  If he has to work there, then the children are naughty, they leave the grandson to the grandmother and come to the house in that swimming pool and ask her, but this is not a normal thing to do because the one who gets the grievance becomes the one who gets the grief because the same thing happens.  Isn't it the wrong thing, brother, blame someone else, it is better to blame someone else who was responsible, but are you living your life relying on him, wo n't you check something, is there so much dedication, look, you have to do it for the doctor, but  to which hospital  Which doctor you go to is also in your hands, you cannot control all the situations, in some you will have to surrender, you will have to have faith, but there is no need to have faith in everything, in others you can control your mind.  If it can be used, you are sending your children to Mukherjee Nagar and Old Rayar Nagar, so brother, there is a lot of dirty work there, stomach upset, diseases, food poisoning, eating dirty food, there are many issues, don't send all your loved ones back. Call me, I am saying through this video, there is no suitable place to stay here, coaching has to be done, whoever wants to pass, he has to pass and whoever has to pass his time, he has to do the examination and do it like this.  Will get it done even with money, there is danger to life too, stomach is also bad and there are more chances of getting scared due to bad habits, so please spread this message and I hope you all will follow this. Thank you very much.  mach h"

It is in danger, but I will tell you what is in danger and you must watch the TV. Start enjoying. Wherever these people say that religion is in danger, ask where it is evident or are you spreading more stories. Take it out and see the danger.  Is it visible or is the story more visible to you, this is one second thing, I want you skis, Indian has democracy, we collect government, small government, state's big central, all big democracy, if any  There is a kind of danger to the citizens, it is a failure of the government, brothers, whether it is there or not, I will talk a little logically and they say no, I will do it, is there a word in Haryana or it means embarrassment, it is a word of a higher level than embarrassment, please people of Haryana, if anyone write,  And if you know the meaning of butter, then listen carefully brother, if the government is failing then the government will have to be changed, or else tell me clearly that it is not in danger right now.  But if you do something then you will be in danger, you understand what I am saying, my subscribers are order thinking people, okay, if you don't say no, there is danger there, let's take it, there is danger, so now this is complete.  Our map of India is like this and here the story is going on, are you okay with this, so now the government collects here, the voting percentage of the people there is 75 80%, it has come from a similar province where there is a lot of Allah match. Brother, then the voting percentage is 80% and in that we also know which party got how many votes. Okay, in that we also have an idea of ​​other things as to who is within which percentage, so that means you are in danger.  You are saying that the brothers who are a threat to them have voted for the government which is a threat to them, then that means they are crazy, they take their mother, they do not have their own brain and intelligence and they have selected the one who is a threat to themselves, but you are there in you.  have to save  So you can't have a child through WhatsApp and Twitter because in our country in India, only votes will suffice, so you pick up your sack and bed and start living in the state and become the water there, two by five, 10. Change your home in 15-20 years. Why not save your religion? Do you want to save your religion only by shouting, you have one purpose, you have one purpose, you have to fulfill your courage, wherever you find something wrong, you all stand up.  Of Which does not seem to everyone or is just creating noise on social media, it means not going into actual, if you do not have courage in actual, then you have to see this is the biggest thing and what is the biggest threat, I will come to that.  But you will read and answer the questions with me in the comment area which is connected to me. It is okay because it is okay to say who has been expelled like this. Hello in Manipur, do you not know what is happening in Manipur, live so much, which one is yours there?  What program is being discussed? Do you have any idea about the meaning of anything? This is my request. Those who do not know all this, please do not come to this channel. I want to take them forward by doing intellectual talks with intelligent people by doing a channel 'Chutki'. I want to take them forward, not a fool.  To attract those of you who don't know what is happening then please you do n't need to watch this video. It is not necessary to watch this channel. There are 10 crore channels on YouTube. Anyone can watch it. Intelligent people want to listen.  Those who enjoy it, please do it sometime or if you can answer then tell me one thing in which community or religion there is a threat to marriage. In which community there is a threat to marriage. In which community there will be area 498, no marriage. In which community is gender device more prevalent? Men are not good. Women are not good. Which people of the women's class do not want to do anything? In which community are the people who also want lassa?  Those who want only government jobs and those who do not want to show anything less, talk community wise, from the puncture repairer to the carpenter to the plumber to the lake electrician to the garbage collector to all these, the hands are less, the tailor is less.  Which will not be done by your IA, which will not be done by laptop, which will not be done by sitting in the office, I am trying to tell you, brothers and sisters, I am telling you now with the example of Guru Gaon.  It is a dead month old incident, I am making some noise here, you know it is fine, it had an impact here also, later on you will become three brothers who in the coming 5 years will do at least one particular thing from then, put your mind to help you.  You don't get less, you do n't change the bed seat, you don't have your utensils, you don't take out the garbage, nothing gets less from you, I am speaking the truth, I am an astrologer myself, I have to understand religion, I am practicing, I don't have any English, this is a suit  I am definitely wearing ghost type. Next time if you tell me, I will come wearing kurta-pajama and that too is less. Many a times I have to go for a story interview in the office. To get a job, I have to wear it. Before that, I had given my timing history in Gurugram.  I told you the situation, what happened to the daughter-in-law, the troubles of the daughter-in-law and how is the gender divide, who goes to which group, you tell me where they do not want to live together and cannot where the cases of divorce are more like this.  What is happening in the family court? Go and see what is happening in the family courts. You will know on your own what is the biggest defaulter. The last one I will tell you is Acharya ji, who is he? Write down his name too. Wisdom, conscience and consciousness have started to awaken. Only the words of religion, blessings, laws, big and small will save us. If we go only there, then there is a mess of numbers. Which foreign country are more people going to? Tell me, those from our country.  Many children go, 100 children go, some of them are going, you have all this data, some are irritated and go, what kind of atmosphere have you created for 24 hours. If there is any picture on everything then boycott it.  If any actor comes then boycott it, I have done such a big stupidity, now I will tell from the middle of this video and I will also correct it, I said that the Jawan picture is useless because I have mistakenly placed it on top of the picture.  Took the eye because I thought like a logical person, people did it through religion and joined me, it's absolutely fine, their do it, I am God, what kid of people you track, Shahrukh character video on it, I felt the picture, when Gadar nonsense was done, I said it  You are this, when I said this is useless, then I said yes, it is absolutely fine, then people don't want to listen to it, hey, we are talking about a movie, now he will pick up some topic of a movie like this and that movie will be cinematic.  This is nonsense but if the agenda is not hit then it would be very good if you say something against him Dog then you will say that you have become the Ganges of religion, you have become against this person, you have become against him, I am scared to open my mouth in my own country.  If religion is in danger, then say that it is important to understand the matter, not from anyone else, but from the people, why are you so sentimental, come on, it is the Indian family that is most in danger and I and I too have something better.  I will also tell you something, listened carefully, did you enjoy it so far, then tell me, Indian family is in the most danger. Yes, in Indian family, husband and wife quarrel, children and mother do not listen to you. The parents who are gone are the ones who are the most forward. Their children do not listen. I do n't know.  Who are you protecting whom? First protect your home, don't protect your home. Let's not talk. I know the real status of the society because you know it too, but what is the bigger picture?  Let's go so that we can listen to our people who are relieved inside the house because talk outside because they are all in danger. Today I want to tell you one thing very openly and with love and I will do some intoxicating video.  No, I am not an intoxicant at all, meaning I have never given up, I have never taken any kind of drug in my life. Yes, sometimes I drink tea or coffee and lie down. If you want to add that too, then I do that and lie down, but now this  The video was made without any coffee. So, you can't comment on this at all. Whatever I am going to tell you, listen carefully to my subscribers who like and want to bring the story in their life. Listen carefully to the person who wants good sex in tent amount, sex and quality food, mother.  You get these two things, you get forgiveness, you don't shout, these two things are available to very few people. Across all the countries and in the present times, this is the real reason for frustration. People are asking for it and holding on to the rest of the things.  Chilli is just a big factor, next time anybody shot is generally shooting, what is his brother, his program has been spoiled, some bad habits of childhood, no one has explained about the topic of porn and masturbation, I will make a separate video of mine.  It is pending on Clarity Channel, Guruji can explain exactly what it means, with utmost attention, what is the meaning of sir game pressure and to press and to do, I am not ashamed to tell you exactly what to do with it, to oxidize routine with dopamine.  All this has shaken the public and these hormonal cells have happened, now that program there has gone wrong, so there is a lot of frustration, there is no such perfume, no one is so religious, no one is so religious, at least check with some person in the morning.  What do I do in the evening, I don't do less religious work, but I scream the most because I need a sister to scream, I am in pain, I am in pain, India needs you to talk about this sex, the children who are growing now and those who are from the Middle East and the uncles too.  There is a lot of frustration in life  More because the wife has become ill-formed or the wife's program is bad. Come and see this, you will laugh with a straight face, this is adult content, that is adult adult, now how can she tell her that in reality this is the frustration, tell this to your children in the society.  Tell him if his wife knows then he has set out on some purpose in life because the energy has to be extracted from within, right by chilling the story, next time you see, next time you see.  These people are like brother-in-law, they are not even getting food. If they don't get sex, food is normal, even if they get food like mother, then there should be peace on the basis of caste. They got good food, even that which belongs to mother, women are not cooking it at home, they are having trouble in marriages.  And if someone is reducing it, then someone is not doing it at home, the food is being cooked cold, in the microwave, ask one of you how much is the food cost per gram, how much is the food per gram, who is getting it for the flower, brother, and  his second one is less isn't it  He should relax a little, as much as his wisdom is as quick as his intelligence, he does n't necessarily need the story of running away. Two items, no one told him, everyone would feel ashamed, if no one told him on YouTube, then first of all, they have you, you are in the house, you are in order, you are home in order, you are family in.  Order yes, we will discuss this also but what is the thing in danger, it is in your hands, people's stomachs are not cleaned, the public is lying in the concept, oh your stomach is not in your hands, the stomach is not cleaned by you, the body is in your hands.  no blue  Look at the report, more than half of Vitamin D and B12 are low. Whoever is listening to me now, who has not done both the tests in the last 6 months, I request with folded hands, there is no affiliate marketing by typing from someone live. John is saying please go and test yourself, you will get less of both the things and the one who shouts the most and WhatsApp is saved the most and those who are from TV channels, everyone's B12 and di, when will they get it, okay this Chillam Chilli.  has come  That's why I am telling you that one, I told you, that good one, that program about sex and food, that one, this one, give it and fix B12, this too will start getting better, the stomach is not clean, the blood is the story and there is relief, there is relief in becoming irritable.  You keep sitting, there is no axis, the bus has tightened, everyone has tightened, shout at whom and then say, shout on religion, there is no purpose to shout, right, these days we don't want wives, we will shout at the wife who picks up, civil, give it, won't you understand?  You have to shout at the children, even the children will be strong on this day, they will put it to rest, even the juniors don't take much, then what to do, what to do, then they used the space on user one, two, three, five, this is the reverse, the direct meaning, look at the name of theirs, whatever is mine.  They troll, right? I have seen the pattern. No human being's child has a name. They have the name of a donkey's child. Okay, that means donkey ji should not be defamed. It means some strange name, digital type. Don't have so much courage to do something.  what is your name  It is okay, he can write something and if you have not written your name on your own social ID, then what kind of power do you have, friend, will you save me? Hey, save me, you have to save me, if she is in danger, then I am, I am religious.  I am a human being, brother, I follow all the rituals, I follow all the studies, I practice, I also provide services in the profession, I am telling you that first of all, if someone else tells it, then everyone will think that this person is from the other side.  Is he there or has he gone to Kim or has he gone anyway? Brother, I am just practicing, you can't do more than this, I don't think so, then you are sitting there exactly like him, which means I wish you great silence and great love. Understanding with sensitivity and affection and with love, I have been saying that get your brain and your body in order and give a date to your closest family members, take a long breath, this brain behind one vote will spoil you so much. Tell them brother, when you come, we will give you mother's talk, don't send it. I was reading the message, we will give you one, give me peace, I am thinking of this, think of something, if you can give one, then you ca n't give, why does he do all these things?  You are roaming around you love someone give vote no know you bill also do if you know do you know it's in danger to danger will it go will it be 10 months now danger's pick will increase meaning graph like this like meaning someone like that is there isn't that  There is a danger of failure because if you are passing the exam then you will fail, you will fail, danger, danger, danger, that means then that danger is completely cured, after three years, there is no problem, see guys, what is happening, take a deep breath, everyone.  It's great, you don't comment, we just take a breath, this thing has been going on for 15-20 thousand years, it has nothing to do with it, you are in danger, your intelligence is in danger, your decision making, your logic, your life and your  Peace is in danger, if peace is in danger then what is peace, the trouble has gone so much, Acharya ji, I want to ask him one thing, he has a very big dad crore, so keep subscribing and he supports you a lot, ask one thing, brother, I have a lot of knowledge, people call me  You do that with them, you do the scriptures, you do it, they will do it for you in a minute, yes, they will do it to me, but ask me a question, sir, he has the knowledge of everything, sir, he has the knowledge of religion, music, Vedanta sir, he has the knowledge brother.  If If that frustration, pain, bitterness is visible on his face, I don't want such knowledge. I am telling this by saying follow dose people, those who have peace on their faces, it is fun for whatever reason and I am telling you this fun only after getting intoxicated. I don't think you have any anger in my face too, I don't have the chip of Yuga, I want to shave and become Baba Ji in me, I feel just like you in me, I also tell you the story, is there any frustration in my face, is it easy? If  If you know the basics of something then be happy then it should be fun and you don't like this training, just like I talk too, I do n't understand what I say, so if I know and that knowledge.  I have it on my face, still there should be a little smile on my face, so it should be like this, why is he angry from inside, because your point is not accepted, this is a point of force, see, the country is free, everyone has this freedom of speech.  everything should be said When I speak, I never do that to anyone, they say, you are a dead crore, you are also creating some ruckus, but a counter view should also come, at least someone should stand by, he tells me many times, hey, you are here, you are here. So much is going on that Yeh Dil Peepal Hoon, you know like me and are me subscribers and the farming that I tell you is the same thing, brother, you are also like me and it is such a big balloon, there is a lot of basil in it, okay, you need more than this. Man, one guy is enough  There is someone to tell and that once this intelligence and understanding of the thing spreads quickly because of what I am spreading, then he will be completely at peace and it will keep decreasing in the caste market and it will not have any effect. He will keep doing One Vote.  And religion and rule and democracy and whatever, all this will always remain like this, you can't do this like this, you people say don't talk about this, no we will have to talk about politics, many times those who are seen as very intellectual type say no let's say  note talk  About religion and politics they should not they should always talk about politics and religion they should know you talk about it only problem is they don't you talk about it we are afraid that I will speak my views I will speak my shoe back  This is where the story will become a hot topic in the gathering, this is the fear that we have from authorized politics, this is called extreme politics, so in the family of India.  Political religion should be discussed completely. Religion, all religions are good, all the things of all religions should be discussed thoroughly, rest of the color interpretation, we can whiten it. Wherever Jha does not get peace and happiness, he calls things as words. Do whatever you understand, take as much of it as you like, and if you understand it well, it empowers you from within, just take that, that is the religion, it is the education, it is 100%, so no one has taught it, it took the whole life to learn it.  will go Even then you will not be able to learn and then you will learn ultimately that it was only that much, that is, even if you had learned this much, it would have been enough. Gautam Buddha comes to his house after 6 years, when he got the glory of knowledge, he meets his wife, the wife asks.  That brother, I got this knowledge, I went for good knowledge, this knowledge could not be got at home, so the intellect says that we could have got it because it was possible, then why did I go because this thing came to light after going there and the conversation is recording.  Whatever is the conversation, which is told from the middle of the storage of our books, how much of a story it came to know after going there that this could have been known here also, so when we have come to know about it, then why should we do it like this?  Our ancient ancestors, Across Religious, tell them that some of their things are good, so just do it, there is a need to reinvent them, today live peacefully and take long breaths in your life, do not give the same as you saw in this video and so on there.  Tell me what happened, they got thrown out of there.  Migration happens, people leave, now there will be less, cement will go, nothing like this is happening, from where will the soil go, will the cement go, do you have money in the bank, you register the plot, to whom the money has gone, the ability to earn money, the hard work in it.  Works hard, means to earn money in real life, which is the only way he is focused on this that I will make him win from here, then those who don't win will win, then only those who have it, then understand what depowers him this today. So I hope you will continue to get videos in future also, you guys will please share like this, thank you very much, this is a request for match and subscribers, if you are liking this thing, if you are posting it on the group, if you are your family, then please subscribe, just a little attention where.  Let's make it bigger because if we move ahead we are touching 10000 subscribers and then 10 to 20000-20 to 30000 then  And you will enjoy, there is a lot of clarity on this matter, please subscribe your friend, please do it, friend, I mean, listen once, yes, if you understand, you will like it, only off course, it is okay, but do it once.  And if you have some other kind of view point too much then brother this is no yes I am coming and understanding d other view point also you keep your own once come and see for yourself maybe you will get confused maybe you will come to know  Hey man, this is a narrative, this can also go on like this, thank you very match."

    "title": "Direct Tax Code ｜ What Will Change For You ？ [r3fm2lbVwL4].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, the direct tax code will be brought by the government only, it is an invitation, that workout is not happening, the situation is a bit thin, after the elections of BJP and the government, we will know where it will be held now in four states, so it seems like this in the month of February.  This is another hope from Modi ji and the government that the tax burden on the common man will be reduced in the Direct Tax Code. These slabs will be reduced, maybe the top slab will be reduced to 25 i.e. 25. And then one by one after the particular income, more M-shares are inserted and they will be deleted. Normally, it is claimed in the government that whenever a new thing comes, they say that we have simplified it, however, it is quite the opposite, there is more curd in the brain.  Recently, this long term capital gain which went from 10 to 125, how much remains in the budget, first removed the indexation, then imposed it, set aside the conditions for imposing it and further complicated it by chartering it.  Accountants also say meaning, will tell, will tell, will tell, it was like this before when GST was implemented, then such situation happened, every time they do like this, it means that the claim remains something, they do something, then it is a fact, so it is still DTC.  We will say that we have to simplify it, time will tell how simple it will be, but relief will definitely have to be given, so it is possible that your tax used to be ₹ 1, now it will be ₹ 80. It is proposed that a wave of ₹ will run in it. Hopefully, which elections will be coming next time, Delhi elections are next year and Bihar elections, maybe they will do it before that, Bihar's are late, Delhi's will come at that time, but 20 will mean something if your money is saved.  So the wave will run but I feel that long term capital gains will increase everyone because when you have money left, you can do only two things with anything, you can either enjoy it or spend it which is good for the economy.  Because you will spend or you can invest beyond that, long term capital gain on investment will be increased sir and let the highest limit on everything be the same long term capital gain. People will make any narrative that there is a profit on FD.  If the old man pays the full slab tax, then if he tells some story by doing this, then the only thing is that he will reduce the money today and he will say where will it go when he puts it somewhere or he can spend whatever is left. Even after that, we will have to pay GST, VST, and what is the principle of the economy that it will increase liquidity a little, the second thing will be if you invest somewhere, it will increase for a long time, then Waraku ji Ankur Waraku ji, our calculations will be all up and down, they will have to do it again.  They will have to do calculations in Excel. The Rs 900 crore that was going to be made in 90 years may now be reduced to Rs 600 crore because the tax package will increase. So that's fine.  This will be in the calculations but the most interesting thing that I see in practical is that real estate and equity are the main ones in which people invest, they also invest in gold etc. but what you invest in will make a difference, real estate will definitely have a great advantage.  If this is a capital gain because at some point of time in equity you have to book profit and there is no cash flow. If this happens then it is all speculative but  You can prepare from now on in real estate. Have you bought a timeless property? Have you bought a family property? Taxes are being charged on it as much as the profit but the rent is coming and you are not selling it and you can just sit through it.  It is not like this in Generation on a Good Property Versus Equity. Which shares did father buy? The next generation does not know. Wife does not know. No one knows. So when it comes to them, videos will be made. Right now, speckle is in it but it is important that some  Nothing will change due to increase in capital gains. If the stock increases in the market, it is okay. If it increases, then there will be a possibility of correction in the market, but since the government will reduce the income tax, then money will come into the hands of the people, then this is good news and bad news.  The market will become like this, meaning it will not be disturbed much because if you are increasing the disposable income by reducing the income tax in the hands of so many crores of people, then it will definitely have a positive effect. Yes, the market will come.  Will get used to that I used to earn ₹ 1 on which I had to pay 125, maybe if I bring maximum ₹ 2500000 to 25 then you will be paid on slab rate, there may be more participation in it, demat account will increase further.  The women in the house who do not earn money should have income in their name, such as investments should be made in their name because giving or receiving money in blood relation is not taxable.  The income that comes from giving that money is taxable but giving money is not taxable, so yes, that can also be a thing, if the government will do something for participation, then it will be called Direct Tax Code, it will be a simplification, we will see how much simplification is there.  But yes, something exciting will definitely happen and if so many mpshows will be removed, those noise shots will be removed, then if all these things will be removed then at least once the person will feel that yes, it is mine but the man will cry.  Before this, everyone's tax rate has been reduced so that the government wants everyone to come into the tax net. Otherwise, the low tax rate should be increased because of inflation, but the government is not increasing it because the government says that you IT return is enough, it means no tax is payable, it doesn't matter, it is not due today, we will follow you up because otherwise, what else wise, according to me, there is no tax till the income of ₹ lakh.  There should be even a single drop of tax, but that means you can practically reduce your tax by saving a lot of money, but to do that, you have to file a return to show that you are not like that, I don't have to file my return at all.  If you are not put in such a situation, then this is the determination of the government that everyone should come once and get everyone's PAN Aadhar linked, after that you see, it is okay, just fill the return once, next time I will ask why you did not fill it, is it okay and  Where is he going, what is he doing, this is mopping up, taxes are increasing, definitely increasing, participation is increasing and that is our usual cry, like people say that people give only 4 per cent, only 5 per cent people give.  They pay like this or so much, people pay tax on so many rupees that one starts crying, how many children are there among the 140 crore people, how many are unable to pay, how many are illiterate, how many are poor and how many are rich.  Sorry, there are so many old people who are very mean and their income is not coming. Somehow, very few are left to survive. How many are employed? Shopkeepers are paying GST from within, shopkeepers are paying GST, it seems like tax.  That theft is happening, it is happening, I am not denying it, it may not be happening, but it is not happening as much as people think. This is also a fact. One of them lives there and he took the income by becoming a farmer. Total in that.  I checked  Last time people claimed only Rs 1500 crore, that data is there, yes, some people make their income by becoming farmers, every time it is made, please check it carefully, that is the entire tax point. 1.2.3 That decimal part is not even made, but that topic is good for intellectuals to talk about, not that these are these rich farmers, if this happens, then our tax will be reduced. It is not like that, it is not like that, it is not like that at all.  It is true that the figure is so high, you can check the figure. Everything is made to look like it is GST so everyone is paying tax. Too much tax is being collected and some ideas are coming to collect more tax.  every  The government is having to increase the world over because it has made so many promises and made so many boring promises and inflation and has printed so many notes and in all the states of Maharashtra that Ladli Brahmin scheme is running, 1500 of them are running first in Maharashtra MP.  It was happening everywhere and in the same manner, if these people want to win the election, then there will be no one there, they will just keep paying taxes, it is very easy for many people to get frustrated and say that they should leave India.  Brother, even that doesn't leave him, he is desperate to leave India, if there is a party worth 10 15 20 crores, then he has Jugaad, he will go, a normal middle class man, an earner of 30 40 50 lakhs a year, said, the person earning 40 lakhs is middle class, yes middle class.  Unless you are in the highest class, which is above 50 lakhs, who is the middle class among the middle class, who pays taxes and who is below 50 lakhs?  If the income is between Rs 50 lakhs to Rs 50 lakhs then middle class is there, of course and from Rs 30 to 35 lakhs you will call it upper middle class, between Rs 20 Rs 15 to 30 lakhs you will call it middle class, below that you will call it middle class, again there are many beyond that.  There is a discussion about how many dependents are there in the family and all this but the government will take it with one hand and will make the first arrangements with the other hand, but where will we keep our assets in that?  How to do restructuring, what things need to be known and understood and how it will make a difference to us, and yes there will be, according to me, Advantage Real Estate, how, when, where, I teach that in different workshops and webinars, if you are not connected yet.  If it is from me, you will get the webinar info information in the comment section, join it, it is free at Rs 70, 80, 90, it is paid at Rs 10, 20, anytime, like John.  If you want to join the one then you can join. I am definitely seeing the advantage. At this stage, there have to be changes in the Direct Tax Code, otherwise why should they be made? Something big will have to be created to create a stir. And those headlines will have to be made that the tax rates will increase in the reduced base, the base is increasing and will increase further with the Direct Tax Code. Hope this time the government genuinely simplifies it.  MP show seems to be removed and simplification is visible, how much will happen, how will it happen when he comes, then we will see Nirmala ji is the Finance Minister and will continue for 4 years, no one else is visible, okay and she will become India's longest serving Finance Minister.  Is it okay or is it already done? Please write in the comment section. There seems to be little lack of talent in the government. Is there out of box thinking? And even bureaucrat.  Also, it is not visible that there is someone like Mantek Single Wali who is teaching or there is someone in the planning commission. It is not visible that any bright spot is visible. It is like who is running it. I am not able to know the name.  I am finding out who was the economic leader, first he left, then he left, he made Urjit Patel, he left, this one left, that one left, so now even such a powerful person is not able to see it. I hope it comes from somewhere, but what is normal?  is that  A strong person has some attitude of his own, he has his own style, he cannot tolerate this dispensation, what is there in Modi ji's dispensation, Modi ji is the only one who cannot tolerate anyone's attitude, and then now only the people will be licked.  There is the same thing in them that talent will be less is a fact of life, this is also an art of politics and powerful politicians who become top leaders at the level. Tolerate People Good people they have attitude they will not do everything and I told them they will have their own point of view they will be independent in thought process and then they will deliver This dispensation has helped every such person in the last 10 years  But like a fly or a mosquito, I stopped you from outside or else you come out, you go out, now all the matter that came up, that whole thing should be said.  Even I am not able to believe that this can be celebrated, it seems like a tiring task, nothing has changed, it will be 15 years, by the time the tenure is over, there will be a government and Modi ji has also started talking about the next one, that I will be the next one.  I will come, if it continues like this then the next one will insist and will not let you come. For now only the results of the election will tell. An overall is needed and an overall cannot be done unless you change the top leader. It seems like you will say no.  Where are you from, direct politics is politics after all, yes DTC, don't praise Modi ji so much and BJP so much, look at Haryana now, everyone is leaving BJP and joining Congress and you seem to be their own people who have been working for so many years.  They were saying that we, the Vice President, those big leaders are going to BJP, why do you fight for them in Congress, why do you fight for Congressmen and they will come to BJP and then they will go away, John is winning. You will go near here means like this  Be crazy, I am crazy about love, which one movie, she is crazy about love like this, you watch it first write me in the comment section, crazy about Modi ji, crazy about BJP, crazy about Nadda ji, crazy about RSS, crazy about Hindutva, crazy about India. Who are you crazy about? If you live the ideology of the country's leader's party, first get clear, everyone is different, Modi ji is not in BJP, he is India, Indira is India.  Beyond that, he is not even talking about that thing like this is that, he is not even talking like that, Modi ji is India, he is not even talking about India and India is a big thing, he is not a human being.  Maybe it's okay, although Mohan Bhagwat ji is also saying that one should not consider oneself a god and this Mohan Bhagwat ji is not troubling me much, ok the video will be separated then, I stop this in the direct text quote, be very careful.  Government Will  Do because it will affect your life, I also used to think two-three years ago and I had also publicly told that shoot politics, focus on yourself, that was my message which will change. Now people many times ask, my old subscribers who  We watch so many channels that now things have changed, we don't let it last, we also want that yes, you do your politics, eat, drink, do something of your own, take advantage of it.  You will not do anything to us, leave us, leave our pants, this approach was used by many earlier but now it is not so, now it is like this: Brothers and sisters, you are sleeping, get up, you are doing this, do n't even do anything, tax, give more this and give this and this should not happen.  Whatever happens, water does not come out of them, roads are broken in big cities, infrastructure is in bad condition, it is okay, roads are being built where they are not needed, they will be broken where needed and this is why SUV sales are not increasing in India because  Here  Indians are very arrogant and have spent more money like that. SUVs drive on the road. A normal car will scratch itself. There are so many potholes that it means it will remain and cannot come, other than SUVs. And people have now become so fed up in sales. That car video is going to be made, what is the reason for the low sales of cars, so thank you very much, share, like, thank you."

    "title": "Disconnect From Work Bill ： The Middle Class To Raise This Issue [ujndIxCIOGI].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, very positive and good feedback is being generated. No, please share and like the channel. You will definitely participate in the comment area. Today's topic is a private member's bill. I will talk about it which is done inside the Parliament, that is, disconnecting bill. Supriya Suleji. Tried to bring a bill, its current status is not known yet but it is a very good bill and this is one thing which middle class should break up. Disconnect from K or Disconnect.  A means Saturday, Sunday or after working, your bus should not bother you, your organization should not bother you, there is a very good and excellent bill on that, if I can link to that article, I will try to give it, otherwise you can just Google it.  Okay, this is very important for which the channel bill says that today even basic home is not speaking. Bedroom next to you, do you sleep with it at night or are you at home after 9:00 pm, after 10:00 pm tomorrow? Some message is sent to the group, someone wants some feedback, someone has said this, now people will not say, what happens with the law, this is what I want to tell you, in this country, people smoke beedis and cigarettes like this.  While drinking, we used to ride in the Haryana Roadways bus, nowadays it has been many years since I sat there, but when you tell me the current status, then this is how you do it, that is, you say something like this, brother, don't drink or the story of breaking the law in the park.  are you staying  So when the law is made then you can say yes, you are breaking the law, there is a challan of ₹ 200. Friends, now you do not see people smoking in public places as much as before and if you are also smoking then you should go to that place.  You can say because nobody wants you to be seen today breaking D Dr. This is also a fact in our country when a law is made then people get scared, so if this law is made like this then it has very good provisions. Also, if you want to reduce after working and the employee is ready to do it, then you will have to give more time, whatever be his salary rate, if the salary is ₹ 2 lakh and 20 days is less than 22 days, then ₹ 10000 is 8 hours. If you reduce it by Rs 1250, you have to reduce one hour extra, reduce it by 2 hours, give ₹ 2500, then it is useless, now if he gets the bus done for less, then if you want to pay, he will reduce it.  There will be an order because every institution will be asking in every form whether it was not done in normal working time, it was not done in normal working days and extra and whatever circumstances are there, please give it to any organization. But if you have to reduce B less extra A on Saturday, you have to reduce it for the whole day, or give it its complimentary off because if you want to reduce it on Saturday, then B is on Tuesday.  Don't come on this Wednesday, this Bill Wickham is the talk of the town, please share this video, tweet it and tell that all the citizens of India, the middle class, the corporates, and even the private jobs.  Chakki PC is going our way, we need this bill, any politician, be it Supriya Suleji, whoever it is, now what problem does the Parliament have in picking it up and passing it?  How much money is being spent by the government, which poor man's rights are being violated in this? What hue and cry will there be in this? Nothing will be left. This is a disciplined thing, which Indians need very desperately, because whenever we go abroad, we are there too.  Which color is this, which is non-fact, which is disgusting, please comment, is this true or not or whatever, this channel is for intellectuals only, this channel is a relief for discussion at intellectual level.  On this note mate, I cannot define people whose thinking is below one level, nor can I take interest. This is the thing that has spread to the country by sitting in a drawing room and talking to an intellectual who has been insulted a lot in the last few years by saying that this is how their agenda is relief, this is bad, they have sold out anti  We are not national, now no international thing is happening, no wrong things are happening, good things are happening within this, so please spread this thing, it affects all of us, the future children will go to your job. effect them  We do this to save brain juice. Even in foreign countries, we do less work for Indians. Today, without taking any money, we spoil their environment. It is a fact that their Saturday behavior is such a big thing that even after today, no one is touching the video and working.  We went there and started spreading relief there too. We do have such churches in our country as well because they think that money is useful or less, what do we have to do, we have left the country.  so this is a thought  We are there, if we go there, we have to learn from the people there, we don't have to talk or speak, our walk ethics are many, we are together too, there is no fix, there is no fix in life, that Hajj is so distant, you become today.  Difference between K and Home has turned completely blue because K is from home, so there is no timing in it, open the laptop anytime, it is less that you are thinking about it, you are doing less on WhatsApp.  So Even the phone numbers should be separate, the numbers of the people in the office are given, it is possible to keep two phones, the middle class can comfortably keep it, but it will become easy if this law is implemented, then you can tell your bus, implement it for everyone.  The company will have to make improvements. Due to this, some people feel that there will be productivity loss. Productivity will increase. There will be no loss when the employee can sleep comfortably, can take care of his family and himself can spend time on his growth.  If he can, then when he comes to that place then he will not be naughty there, he knows that my soul will be sucked in the evening also and my soul will be sucked till late night, so why suck here during the day because that can be done later.  If you want to show everyone, here we drink coffee, we kill Gabbu, we do something less, this is the approach of our Indians, there are a lot of ghosts, there is a lot of work across, it is offices, across is better than offices.  So this thing is very important in this, now what will be seen in this for government employees, then you can also comment because there is something for many government institutions and those who do round D clock, or is it only for private jobs because there  It becomes very tricky, the people who work in the government are not less and by the way, if you say so, you can be contacted at any time, 24 hours, but I am not taking this video towards that right now, so that no one can do it. Don't add any confusion, but whatever is normal for you, I would like this thing to be discussed and when you take a job and the money is negotiated, please talk about the salary also, let it be asked, let it be right and give it.  You are in writing, it is okay, if you trouble me all the time, please do it at 2:00 in the night, then please set the salary, then do it accordingly, set the salary like this.  They give you happy happiness and when it decreases and it increases, then there is some limit to it, when your recruitment is going on, after that you don't see their face, then you feel different, they just do it, it is a relief, so it should be made an issue in this, according to me. This is a very good issue and please follow it further, thank you."

    "title": "Do Politicians Make Fool Of Us ？ [1Om-2-WZxU8].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today's topic is this question, okay many times I have written in the comment area about politicians, what I don't like about politicians, this is a date device, they give us lessons, they make a fool of us, okay, I read two things. Today they are making fools, the second thing is that divided society will discuss this because no one told me, I start with love example, there is a family, there is a son, there are mom and dad, now the girl is married, the boy is married.  No, brother, it is not only this, so you too must have families like this, you too have a family, you must have seen around, the boy is not divided with his father, the parents are not divided, this son is not divided with his mother, anything can happen, anything.  It is possible that a girl is getting married, a girl has come, it is already being said, there is a boy of 27 to 28 years, there are parents, some scandal happens in the house, there is a quarrel, something happens.  did it That's why it happened like this since then i.e. before that we were like this, only politicians used to do it brother, before that our society was like this, in 1820 century, in 1900, the British had already divided them, they just exploited them, someone divided someone else. No, everyone takes advantage of it, you are not being fooled, yes you are a fool, your stupidity is taken advantage of, now someone will just tell your subscribers and you will run away, this channel is like that.  I also feel that many people think of me as 'part two' but I am still very dear. People understand me and many people understand me, those who are following me from both the old ones and the new ones will also understand.  If you messed up and withdrew money from Paytm settings, it does not mean that if you reduced it then you are a fool. At that time, your mental situation was such that you simply could not understand, which is called brain fog. gets into things  And in many things your fair and grid are taken advantage of. Two emotions are our fair and grid. Whether I get any benefit or I do not suffer any loss, society sells both the things to you. Doctors, Astrologers, Lawyers, all these professions are not defamed except one. Arkit is doing whatever you want, whatever profession comes to your mind, brother, he plays such safety security, he saves his car, he sends it very strong, so that I have so many.  There is an airbag, it also creates that if you have an accident, you will go back. If you already know with complete clarity, what is the game going on, will you be able to understand now when you watch it in the future, how are the movies being narrative?  How is it being set, what will be discussed further, who is defining the syllabus, who is talking, then only this is visible in the background, what is happening, I know everything but I will vote for someone, I will not tell. You have to become like this, you don't even have to tell me who to vote for, people, tell me first and write the paper, this is mine, you are such a crazy book, do more things, I have committed, after that, I will become Salman Khan myself, he will be mine.  Brother, you Salman Khan in D movie character note, the actual one Salman Khan is fine, the character in the movie is the one who hits dialogues, so don't hit so many dialogues, do n't commit to the politicians, I don't know whom I will talk to from the left side.  If the voting people give him the day, he can vote, he will rise from the right side, he will rise from the left, he will rise from the right, I don't know, this will happen, we will see what will happen, so brother, I hope you will understand this message, I would like to leave only by sending a very small message. Please rice above this, you are not fooled. Many of us have already done more in many things. If someone takes advantage of our stupidity, then you cannot cry. Anyone would have come and taken advantage of your stupidity. All these possession schemes are running, all these are chit funds, in these also you are taken advantage of, so he fooled me, oh you were a fool, brother, he came and took advantage of your stupidity, so what is his fault in that? Stupidity is taken advantage of, it has been lifted by Janma Janma mantra and will be lifted in the future also, so instead of running in it, he has fooled you, you rise above foolishness, apply the cream, you are fair, what did not come ahead of coming, go to him and say, it is mine.  fooled  Diya is advertising, emotions are taught about desire and want. If society has to be sold and if something else has to be done, then it will be fair and green. In the future, it will be like this, it will be like that, until someone tells you that it is raining outside.  Will you go and buy an umbrella? Will it rain now or not? Have you bought an umbrella? If it doesn't rain, it will tell you that it will come tomorrow brother. Sometimes it will rain. It can never happen that I gave you an umbrella in April, so neither did it rain in April nor did I.  Come on, if she doesn't come in July, she will come in August, so I will tell you, see if you have bought it, it is expensive to buy it, if you do n't get it here, you say, then we will make the selection, study in our school, you will become like this, how much will you become like this?  It is not true that you have to use your brain and intelligence. Look, if your brain is not capable of using your intelligence or your intelligence is less, then his cry cannot be understood that my friend was less strong in me, he took advantage of me, so he will have to learn from the story. so the same  I am watching you all from the middle of this channel in clarity. First of all, I want to make the public cry because my initial videos will run now, this way a platform will be created somewhere else for my 15-20 episodes, after that you will get clarity. In this, from the 22nd onwards I will start telling you, brother, do this crying band, do the helpless band, do the song, Na jhukte hai, the world needs someone to bow, so the politicians need to bow, the politicians need to bow like this, the poor people remain the first ones to bow.  They remain inclined towards defaulting, now they remain inclined all the time, such a system can also be done, there is pressure to reveal the name of linking up, what is happening now to the politicians, people are pampering each other, this is a politician, he says this, this is bad, this  He says it is good that they are fighting among themselves, I am from this group, call the politicians good and call them bad, call him bad, he is a human being, what is good or bad, tell him clearly that this is his thing, this is good.  And this is what Babli asks, so a person has a father, a mother, a wife, a husband, and children, he can do some good things and some bad things, there is nothing in the whole, now you have to vote for yourself.  Among mom and dad, which one will you do? Think for yourself, is mom bad? Puri is bad. Mom and dad are bad as a whole. If you have to do one, then what will you do, how will you do it? Tell me, I tell you guys, you have two children. Vote for one of the two.  Both elections are to be held. Whom will you vote for? Is there something good in both or is there some bad in both? Then you say something that my retirement is this. If you keep this flag, it will fix things, then I will vote for you.  It does n't matter to me whether you are following this agenda, this flag is not of my importance, this flag is of little importance to me, you can do that, I have no problem, but these should be less of mine, these are my duties.  It is less, you will not do, will not talk, will not speak, will not speak, that is the election paper, it is the manifesto. If you will not put it in it, you are not going to put it in it, so if you are not going to do it about me, I am not going to do it about you, this is  You will have to say that my retirement is this, give this thing education health, the middle class is becoming poor, no one is asking the middle class, no one is asking everyone is asking the poor again and again, am I  Not anti-poor brother, this poverty will become my class, one day everyone will become normal class but it will take next 5-7-8-10 years to become that, the middle class today is going towards lower middle class, date this.  The problem is that no one is catching them, there is no incentive for them and the biggest problem is that this bawdy book middle class is its own, when you want to play cards, you show its stomach in the beginning, then who will play the game? You will bet on your cards already, brother, you are sitting with us brother, I love you brother, you are the only one I win, you all play, we are the only ones standing, this is how it happens, can't you find a glass on your stomach, why are you showing the channel?  My question to you right now is, am I pro or anti? I am not particularly interested in all the landscape politics. I want to create a different thing and I have the power in this.  This mischief will be reformed. These are the people who do stupid things. They don't do stupid things. They do this. Politicians do things like defending on the mass messages. The messages have been shaded. This is the shine. They wo n't bet again because I am in India. I will say this again and again.  I am in India, it is easy to mislead people, it is difficult to understand, I am trying to understand, it is easy to mislead people, but you tell me, it is difficult at the same time, but it is easy at the same time. Which will be reduced? The benefit of asana is immediate and there is no such immediate benefit of reducing difficulty. Am I making a channel towards a particular ideology, like the world has made their channel? Today you can watch the YouTube channel. Look at the news channel, look at someone's words, you can tell in two minutes that this brother is crazy about him, you can immediately tell that he is talking like this, now I am not talking neutrally, I am talking from an independent point of view.  I am telling you that the location should be neutral. Kabir, no one can be neutral. Brother, either you like tea, you like coffee or you like lassi. When three things are being asked, what is neutral? If it is neutral, will you drink all three? What is the meaning of neutral?  No, because in life you will get choices and you have a bill, you take you card, I will take any C, you can take any C, even then you will have to take one, you will have to take any C, you will have to take one anyway.  You will have to take it, will you eat potato paratha or gobi paratha? If I can have neutral of both then brother, I am not getting both, but when you go there to cast your vote, as many as these neutrals will beat you in whatever way they try to do neutral neutral neutral neutral. So brother, you  You can vote for even one party and you can vote as per your wish. You belong to this party, then no one is neutral, nothing ever happens, so mother, you are not neutral. Brother, I am telling this truth of life for my children, that is why I belong to this channel. Can't proof, you are also a gold gold standard Chutki channel, so what happened, the talk button has power, it is empowering you, there is a smile on your face.  This is seven-eight, around 7:00, my videos are released almost every day alternately, this will bring a smile on your face at 7:00, at 9:30 you see all these things on news channels, this one is more than that.  Consume it and spread this thing again tomorrow and discuss these buttons of mine, then go to sleep at night feeling empowered. Next day, after watching 10-20-50 episodes, you will feel that you are reaching the story and you will understand something.

    "title": "Dulha Dulhan  Awas Yojna ｜ An Election Manifesto Idea [OgaRd9E0fm0].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, the time for DD Awas Yojana, a game changer election, is coming. Advice is being sought from the general public on Namo App or our PM Modi Ji's app. So I am giving an idea to the general public. Go and write on that app. And it is possible, it is definitely possible, so many people will write, so many people do not even know that there is an app, or they are asking for advice, if you want to give it, then I am going to give advice, elections are coming, people can put it in the manifesto for the government  Yes, you should put it there, I advise you to put it there, what is DD Awas Yojana, DD DD no DD DD is the full form of mine, this is my idea, the original idea is Dhula Dhulan Awas Yojana, now what does it mean, it means that whenever there is a marriage in India, if  If within a month of that, you buy this newly-wed house and the expenditure in that wedding has been reduced and whatever money the parents of the boy and the girl have given to them for buying that house, then some tax rebate will be given for that and under this scheme washed under the dust for a few months  If you are buying your house within Rs. 2 crore then you should get rebate on your home loan at Rs. 3 crore and keep a cap of Rs. 5 lakh only. Or I am not saying for houses worth Rs. 4 crore, give it and keep a cap on the amount also to be.  If the girl's father gives 10 lakh rupees, then give him a rebate of 2 lakh rupees as reward, take out some section for this, it is fine if the boy's father gives 10 lakh rupees or keep a cap on whatever amount he gives, so if you want to save money from 10 marriages only He will help only the middle class in wedding functions. It was said in this budget that a scheme is being made for the middle class. It is not told why the scheme has not been made because if it is told that it will be done then I will be responsible for that scheme only.  I am saying this because it will only affect the middle class, because we have many schemes going on for the houses and for the poor as well, if they are also being taken in this way within a month of marriage, then everyone should get it, rich  There should be no discrimination whether one is poor or middle class, rich or poor, whatever date the marriage is on  If this is happening then it is very good for young couples because the next generation which is the generation of judges will not be able to buy houses otherwise houses will not be bought from them, even on a loan of 75 lakhs, the loan amount of 50 lakhs works out to be Rs 49000, out of which also 25 lakhs  If someone else gives it then it is not very easy, somewhere in big cities the houses have already touched 75 lakhs, in small cities also there are 40-50 lakhs, so this government needs to do this thing as per my understanding, how do you people like this idea  So please spread it and put it there, there is no compulsion in this, it is not necessary that it has to be given to the boy's mother or father or mother, don't give it to anyone, don't give even a single rupee, if you give then you will get the benefit and that  It is deposited in their account and is going to the builder or for booking. Economy will do well, real estate will do well. If the house is arranged after marriage, then there would be no fights and quarrels.  And the ownership rights of this house that will be taken will be in this Dhulan Dhulha Dhulan Awas Yojana that it will be in the name of both, it is not that you are taking it in the name of Dhule's mother and not Dhulha Dhulan Awas Yojana, Dulha Dhun Awas Yojana means 50 for 50  But for the loan and in this you are getting rebate, the interest rate has been reduced a little, you can leave the money in the registry, the government can leave it little by little, Rustia is the subject of the state government, so brother, take it out there also, now on 8 or on 7 or something Tell me, is it your gift, is it the state's gift, is it the government's gift for getting married, brother? If you book or buy a house somewhere within a month of your marriage, ready to move in or under construction, everyone knows the date of the marriage, it gets registered.  It is a wedding date so you cannot hide it. So if you have booked it within a month of the wedding date, you can do it for one month or two months. You can discuss it with the marriage.  have to do smoke  If the dust is okay then suppose you have done it within 60 days, then you must have done the registration on 3 only, so there is some amount left on 3, 4, 5, okay or you can save it in GST or any government can leave it anywhere  The government should leave it to five-ten, the boy's parents should give a little, the girl's parents should give a little, the huge expenditure that was planned for the wedding should be reduced a little, this push start of the new couple will start the car, after that there will be irritability, fights and quarrels.  They don't happen in life because what is there in life, whether it is marriage or anything, rent has to be paid and if you don't have to pay rent, then school fees remains the next chapter, beyond that also I know that some videos will be made  School fees and rent Today, children's school fees and rent is the biggest ticket size of anyone's expenses because even if the EMI of the house is going, the house rent is still left or the rent is coming or the income tax rebate  What you are getting becomes the biggest expense of today otherwise These are the two expenses of the middle class, food expenses are very low as a percentage of your salary, so I hope you all liked this idea, you will share it and please write in the comment section and brother, I have many such ideas, I will bring them  I will stay here and what ideas do you have, you can write in the comment section because I can put them on YouTube, put them on the Namo app and everywhere, give suggestions to the government, many times the government also wants to outsource ideas, so tell me.  The public does not ask every time what they want. It is something like the electorate's birthday is coming, elections are like children are asked what gift they would like to take on their birthday. Also, now that elections are coming, it is being asked at the time of elections.  It is there later, we will not ask after 2 years, so it is being asked right now, let us post it, who knows 10-2 thousand people may see this video, let's say 20000 people out of 20000 may see this video Let's say even 5000 people go and put it on the app, then brothers and sisters, will this idea reach people, will this idea be felt that 5000 people have done it, will any intellectual, bureaucrat or any consultant who is hired by the government sit and do it and say that this is very good?  Because there is pressure from the society, there is pressure in the society to not spend wasteful money on marriage, you came here after eating and we did it, but if any government scheme comes out like this then everybody will start utilizing it and it will benefit everybody  It is such an original and great idea. I liked it very much. It came to my mind that if this scheme is made for the middle class within the budget, then I kept searching that there is no scheme for the middle class.  It will come, the government has given the money for it in the budget, so brother, when it has been given, then this can be part of the scheme because marriages of all these, now you will say no, why can't we do all this, look at the marriages, they will have to be done incentive wise, on time in India.  If there are no marriages, they will continue to live in live-ins like this and will not marry, will not get married, will remain afraid of home, if a boy is earning 50-600 rupees and a girl is earning 30-40 rupees and they are able to arrange for a home, then they will get married  We will do it friend, so the government needs to incentivize a little, there is an opportunity, it can be done, interest rates should be reduced in four-five things, father, those who invest money should get income tax rebate and do something on the loan done loan, reduce GST  Do it or reduce the registration cost, if you do a little something for all five, it will be great for the people, good, like the channel, subscribe, share it and definitely share this video, thank you very much"

    "title": "Dunki Review ｜ Should You Watch  It ？ [CT5HmbJKawg].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, the review of Donkey Picture will be for you guys, it will be hot oil pakodas, detailed review, there will be no spoilers, there is no such movie with spoilers, there will be no spoilers, it is not like this, but still it will not be there, that is the disclaimer.  There will be a verdict in the end, there will be a clear verdict, what should we watch on Friday, Saturday, because we have watched on Thursday, so I am going for you all, okay, disclaimer before starting. Out of so many film stars over period of so many years, I have a little liking factor towards Shahrukh Khan, this is my disclaimer and that is why I watch it but I am not able to keep the energy level that high, the movie has made me tired, ok so on to the movie.  Let's discuss about Rajkumar Hirani ji Hirani ji's picture, what is missing is the film, the promise of the movie initially seems that something wow will come, that wow moment.  You keep waiting for it and the picture ends. This is such a picture that you can't hate it, you can't say too much bad about it, but you ca n't say too much good about it either. It 's like The Ted's Talk.  If you people must have seen Ted's talk, it is like a feel good factor in someone's life and your life doesn't change much after watching it. Neither is it able to raise the emotions, nor is it able to polarize, nor is it able to wake you up, because somewhere or the other, something  Emotions should be awakened bhai Sauro ke Sadsukh ji, if you would have made lemon soda and there is no fizz, end to the credit of Shahrukh Khan Bhai, Shahrukh has put in full force, has worked with full intensity and you I feel, I feel only in the whole movie.  Bad for him, he has put in full force, he has done full convincing, he has done it all over the place, that is, he has tried to put in full force, but it did not happen, there is a mistake in the direction, there is a mistake in the story line, there are many places. This is a mess and the core audience that you want to capture is not there because you have set it in Punjab, now Shahrukh Khan can't speak Punjabi from anywhere, that means it is not so tangy, what would be the other thing like that now if?  You look at Shahrukh, he has a very fit body. Look, from behind, brother, he is thinner than a 25-26-year-old 27-year-old boy, but there is an age on the face too, one is age with the hair, you reduce it by doing make-up.  do it Do more, do it, there is one thing which comes in the face, if you get wrinkles then you cannot make it that young and Taapsee Pannu cannot be that old, so she is a mismatch in chemistry, even now in the age of heroine and hero.  If there is a gap of 23-24 years and we know the actual hero, then there is no chemistry, although Shahrukh is a very lovable person, we talk generally and all.  That's charming which word can be used but the matter is not so much Vicky Kaushal has been wasted and Boman Irani looks the same Jo sab jahaan rehte hain mere ko is quite repetitive In fact if you watch this Raju Hirani movie Raju Hirani ki to unne na  I am getting déjà vu, which one comes with one breast? In Fukrey, déjà chu is said, neither is déjà vu, I am feeling all this to you.  The feeling is the same as when they come together in 3 Idiots, but there is no high point when they come together, then they go to the flashback, go to the flashback, but the story of the flashback also does not seem like this, brother, it has the feeling of a thriller.  It doesn't come in the form of adventure, it does n't come at all, the jokes are those jokes. If whoever Pankaj Kapoor, who is Shahid Kapoor's father, used to come up with a serial, you people have seen it in which  Used to teach English. Okay, it was a copy of an English serial. Exactly, what is the name of that serial? Remember the person who remembered it. It is the same feeling. After watching the movie, we are getting the feeling as if we are watching an old serial.  Is it old or does it mean that the big screen does not have some feeling and charm? The whole meaning is that you are watching a happy-go-lucky thing. What I want to say is that cinema has become like this, there is a lot of inflation, tickets are so expensive in big cities. If you go then popcorn is more expensive than that, without it people don't do all this. Take some tea or coffee. Take one half of that and you get the experience of three things. If four or five people go then it should be worth so much. There should be some background music. Big picture.  If it's visuals, it's fun. If it's visuals, it's not like that. In the middle, I just want to tell one more thing. While reviewing this, we will discuss more things. Watch the whole thing comfortably. Clear cut at the end.  I will also tell you what should be done if you are an audience, then in 10-12 minutes you have to go to the parking lot, get ready, buy the ticket, sit down and these days, they keep showing ads 25 minutes before the picture, then that interlude is also so long, if the picture is 2 hours 41 minutes long then Listen to the review in 10 122 minutes, you will understand as I will tell you in clear cut, people tell it in roundabout ways because now this picture becomes a super hit on the first day and I will say something here.  Then she said that she was going to eat my food, hey, you had done it like this, but I don't think that the picture is going to be such a great super hit, it will not become a thousand crore rupees, people will not know about it for five days till Christmas, after that it will have to fall, the movie has such a twist in it. No, there is a trailer inside the movie of Fighter which we have seen on YouTube, I like it very much, it is these kind of movies, now I feel that it is worth going to the cinema hall, where you get disc, disc, disc, something like that which you can enjoy at home. sit on Why should I go to the cinema for that experience? So don't watch this movie, it can't be like this. Look, I call a movie a test. Watch any movie, good or bad, it has a test, I have a test, you tell me yours.  That can also be a test, what makes a good, great movie, if you remove even one scene from it, should that movie work or not? It doesn't work without this scene. There are such scenes in this movie, almost all of them. all i  I would say that in fact I ca n't remember any such scene and I make big notes and give the movie with great enthusiasm. The work of my review is a big responsibility. It is a big responsibility to push you in the lives of people. It is big to stop a movie to watch it.  It is an act of responsibility because it is immediately visible that someone says that hey, you let me see you or it was so good and you refused or what ever, by the way, it is okay that actually it was not useless, you said it was useless or Actually it was useless, you said it very well, then it is a very responsible job because in this the verdict is out very quickly and in the beginning, giving it so quickly, people see after a day or two, seeing the general reaction, they were also trying to laugh and those who  I would say that I am 20, 25, 30 years older than the current youngsters. I mean, I know the things from earlier also in which it has been shown that even then I was not able to have a relationship, I definitely had a relationship.  Can't figure out whether you are going there, there is struggle, there are emotions, they are not able to wake up, they reach England, yes we reached England, it seems as if we were trying to reach somewhere, it does n't seem like what are they acting, you vehicles.  I am going secretly and you are jumping like that wherever you land, then why are you going secretly? You could have sat comfortably like a man and gone and are risking your life to go and there is activity every five minutes.  In  They are doing it in such a way that they should be sent back. They did not seem to be coming from anywhere. You can identify with their characters. Pankaj Kapur's serial used to be less entertaining than that, it was very less entertaining, give no entertainment, see no entertainment, no shock value, no sound value, no.  Background music, no wave factor, no chemistry, nothing is coming anywhere like this, yaar recover isko other than that, he is a lawyer in the whole movie. Gujju Apna is fine, his acting was a bit good, yes, he felt completely in the character, yes there is such a lawyer, Gujju has become a Patel Bhai, look other than that, Shahrukh is insisting in the whole scene that he should do something to the movie. Take on your shoulders, do something and emotions and all this but brother, you are as good as the screen play and the story and the director, this is the thing, now that is what Shahrukh did this year, what did Pathan do with YRF?  In the franchise, the South director took Jawan and brought Hirani ji, everything was tried and tested that brother, that program was not running well for so many years, if it has to be fixed then the plateau will be there in Jawan, I did not believe that there should be so many.  But she became that too, I did not want to accept that she would also be a Pathan. Now after looking at these three, Pathan Jawan and seeing this one, I would say, Pathan was the best, okay, and Jawan, the one I did not like, I would say, friend, this is better than this.  It was the same, at least there were some scenes in it which I can remember, two or four scenes were such that you can cherish them, the opening scene of Jawan's picture, the opening scene and the one where he lands in the mountain and in the plane, that scene and the beginning fight.  The one in the middle or the train hijack one, there is a little high pot in the one, some four or five high points, there were a few high points in the athlete Jawan, a movie which I didn't like, a movie which I didn't give a good review, okay, so this is a dinky one.  I have not even seen those four scenes. There is no scene. If those who have seen it can also write in the comment section that brother, this review is going in the right direction, is n't it so that you are rolling with laughter and emotions?  You became emotional and everything was great and I definitely write so that I can get a review of the review, that too for Guruji, it is okay, brother, it is not because I go to watch movies to understand the public.  Where is the public connected? As a creator, it is very important. As a social observer, it is very important because the pictures that come, which are big, they do this, they are connected, just like people have become very connected with animals, now what is being shown in the movie. Realization Comes from Not Being Showed When You Go to a Movie That's Dark People Want to Connect Disconnect with the Outer World and Connect with the Characters and the Movie and Get Into Some  Land, that is not here, here in the movie, it is like drinking a coffee, as if someone is sitting next to you, bring coffee, bring coffee, this la means you, if not you, then in any good movie, you will feel like going out to get coffee, you mean going during the interval, if  You would like to drink in the middle and you come back and you don't miss anything in it, as if one character dies, okay in the middle, it's okay, in the love of love, I heard it on the phone somewhere, so my friend, such emotions are these days.  hee  It is not that they are against the girls these days, they will not marry 498, all this is youth, so I think it is because of the identification and the shooting and voting that is going on, they are going somewhere in Pakistan, it looks like they are from Thailand.  They are inside Pakistan, I don't know which beautiful beauties they have shown these scenes, it seems that the shooting is happening somewhere in Thailand or somewhere else in Phuket, somewhere like that, they are going from there and then it turns out that they are out in Sindh.  When we go to Sindh, we come out somewhere in that side, then that area is not like this, while coming back also we were telling some stories in it, Bhuj is also called Bhuj, this and that, there is no idea of ​​geography, nothing, which sea is visible in Bhuj?  So it is 70, 80, 100 kilometers inside, okay, so I don't know where you wanted to go, where you wanted to land, correct the geography a little, you are making a movie, you should see this little or what?  What are you saying? It did n't seem believable. When they meet again after so many years, it's like friends, there is no chemistry in it and Taapsee Bandu Pannu is normal. I have seen every movie you must have seen. She is a fine actress.  You can't tell them that they don't know active acting. One of the better actresses of the present times, but I do n't know what happened in this movie, meaning the director said that you should act like this.  Kar or what he meant was that it seemed as if the payment was not being made, the money was not being kept, that is, he was not doing it in his mind, that was the way he was in the action and it was as if Shahrukh was so engaged in doing it like this, that yes, it is fine, that means no, he is feeling like that. You do something, that is, show love, show emotion, show this, then Shahrukh is acting poorly in his name too, but there is no chemistry, nothing, I do n't know why this is happening, that means I feel like he is a miss casting type, that means I am off course in that.  that much  Young cannot be shown, if Kajol ji was taken but especially if she was an old actress like Kajol ji, then she would have shown her skills as if she is coming to India again and is putting that feeling on the soil. Taapsee Bannu would have looked like this.  They are tourists in general, their departure is not justified, all these people are leaving pretending that why are they leaving India, no one has had such a sad story as so many are leaving. Well, you go to Mumbai first, come to Delhi, come here, come here, you are showing it like you are risking your life, if you had tried India first then you would not have seen anything like this.  There doesn't seem to be any logic in coming back, so I feel like the movie has fallen flat, without the fizz, like a Coca Cola, take it, gas comes out, there is no fun in it, there is no high point in the movie from the beginning till the end.  You don't have any smile  Meaning, the high point is nothing, you keep waiting, you keep waiting, please do something, Raju Hirani, now what is that, Raju Rani still in Munna Bhai MBBS mode and the three idiots mode, now three idiots Munna Bhai.  Even if they go, they will also flop, friend, the public has gone ahead, there is no emotion, the public is coming 204, the public is sitting at 23, so they cannot awaken old emotions like this friendship or  I don't know what that means, they ca n't relate, what is the bad condition of the directors, especially Hindi cinema, Bollywood people are not paying the writers, it is not South Indian, it is better than this, at least they make the movie like this by making noise.  Meaning that everything is flying in that cinema hall, lions are coming like Triple R or something, some style is coming and something like Rajnikanth's Jailer or background music is being played or something like that is flying. if he is getting up  I mean, it feels like there is a buzz on the screen, there is some adrenal dopamine, this is this, this is not like this, this is not even able to make you feel good, this is not even soft, this is such a movie that women will like it, like women. Sometimes it happens that some movies are liked by women and not by men, there are many movies which are liked by men, there are many which are liked by both, it does not connect anyone, right?  Neither the one that connects the youth nor the one that connects the elderly nor the one that connects the middle aged people, it is not able to connect anyone. The movie is bad because it seems that it has taken a top star and has invested money and you will charge the money by pressing F.  I have to come and tell about Tiktok that brother, I feel even worse, people work hard, this is not a shooting, it is done in two days, now let me admit that I make videos, I don't go and hire anyone, right? Spending crores or making lakhs of rupees I too make a video and someone comes to me and says, 'This video is nonsense', every person feels like this, but if this happens in my life, today as a very small creator, I am very responsible.  Friend, whenever I make a video of 20, 25, 30 minutes, the aim is to add value, it should be fun, there should be clarity, there should be some takeaway because  If too many times I take the audience for granted, one half will forgive the video, then people stop watching and stop watching. As a creator, your program is over. If I keep making videos like this so regularly that no one has any connection.  If there is no value and no add, then if I as a person judge, have not been a trade in cinema, have not been a trend in story writing, have not been a trade in creativity.  Any past big experience like this, I am not a film star, I am not a public person also, so if I too can be conscious of this thing, then I do not understand that when such a big picture is made, then Gauri Khan ji is not shown.  Are you okay, are n't you showing it to anyone else, everyone is saying, it's working fine, it's a lot of fun, it's a lot of fun, show it to someone like us, friend, to the normal common man who is your friend.  Hai means like I said na Shahrukh jaise ko means I hold in regard means because of the personality and generally the person and the passion Okay then show us like this Do you hate me?  If someone goes to see it then he might be a fan somewhere. If not a fan then it means he cannot be your enemy. So this movie should be shown somewhere at some time or the other. How are they working out? Something could have been done in some other way, meaning maybe it could have been done or maybe this story line is outdated because or if you are showing an event of war then it is a historical event, there is such a historical thing that people can still connect with it.  This is what happened in real time, what were the circumstances of this, whatever process is happening, what you are showing is this of a different state of society, are people not going to Canada right now, are they not going, are there some illegal routes, not so many now.  leaving just now  A few days ago, England's PM Sunak ji said that we are becoming so strict, 7 lakh immigrants used to come, now I will bring only 3 lakh, if you don't want to bring me and don't add value, then he raises a question about leaving India.  Meaning, even today it is unfortunate that it has been 75, 76, 77 years of independence, but even today, leaving India is considered the biggest achievement for the country.  Leave it somewhere at the end and they tell you to do something, go back to the soil from which you have come, I also teach and explain this in astrology, Ketu is your roots, you should not go away from it, ultimately the soil from which you were born is never there.  I explain it well on a different platform, but man, even those sentiments of patriotism did not come. Nowadays, there is such over saturation of patriotism as if the tickling stops many a times, so does patriotism.  There is an overdose of every emotion. Now you cannot call any emotion that bad emo or patriotism is bad. Patriotism is good but there is an overdose of anything. If you eat or drink too much of something then it is for that.  A person gets desensitised, it is something like this, all the emotions that have been aroused here, a person like me, who is very perceptive to emotions, it is okay, it is the work of astrology, it is the work of marital consultation.  My job is to free people from sorrow and pain. Happiness course is going on. I still have to enroll. There are still a lot of classes left. If you do A2, that's all the work. So I am a person. Who is a person? What is this? I am saying again and again that I am into the business of feeling and the movie is also the business of feeling, so I am not the only one who understands feeling. I do it a lot in the movies, even if there are not many scenes. I tried to do it, there was no embarrassment, there was no moment, I tried once or twice, there is no such movement in the movie, the movie is absolutely flat, the verdict is yes, you can completely avoid this movie, it is more important with money.  There is time also, don't waste it, it is a clear cut work date, you got up and went, got your juice or made tea or came back or if the door opened then pause means you will not feel like doing this movie.  After pausing, go, you are understanding that you are watching many movies like this, you have to watch, don't kill, there is nothing to do, you have to pass the time, so that movie is playing, you are watching, if the movie is playing, then the bell rings, then it is a good movie.  It happens that when the husband is watching, what happens when the bell rings and one says, you see, okay, I am pausing, look, pause, pause, in this it will happen that the wife will also go and open the door, the husband will also. Will open it, you won't say this in this, you go and pause, now you have understood, I am explaining it with such a good analogy, I don't know that factor is not there in Salar, maybe I will not have the courage to watch that South Indian one, I don't normally do it but I am feeling it.  That maybe there might be some more heat in it, I am feeling that it has to be seen, so maybe I don't know, if Sam Bahadur has got down, then it is a different matter, otherwise it has to be seen, that feel good factor of Vicky Kaushal, that feel good character.  It can also be seen on the big screen, although there are not many scenes in it that you can like on the big screen, but I had reviewed it, I hope you guys must have seen it, still you can go and see it, okay come. I will try to complete the review of the movies that will come in the future. It is very risky for you people to review web series because you have to watch it yourself and it takes a lot of time, but if someone 's feedback is good then I delay a little. and then properly  I do it with the help of Jaane Ja, I had done the movie, many people appreciated this one too, as I have told you, when you are feelingless, yes without I watch it, I don't do spoilers, I didn't do that, so you can tell that this was not the meaning of this scene.  You are stupid, how did you do it like this, there is a small thing in it, Taapsee Mannu's character has been living abroad for 25 years, so it is not a big thing, it is not that, spoiler man, this is what we don't know.  What she does in 25 years is not known there, the whole picture is not known for which she was going to a foreign country, she had such a great desire to go abroad, she reaches there in 25 years and in 25 years she comes back as if she is about to come.  I don't know what she does, but the protégé knows that he too, that is, he has been sweeping there only for 25 years, so that is also a great learning for the people, friend, go there and you will get onion in Indian restaurant.  If you only want to bite or sweep somewhere, then stay in India only, then there is no benefit in going there with a raised face, this is also a message but in general which is my target audience which is you people.  Whoever is middle class, this is anyway identification for you. Anybody is a picture of big cities, this is Shahrukh's, this is such a normal young man etc., still he has made aunty by making him aunty but this is so.  It is not just like this, okay, so this deja is the same in all the scenes, friend, I have seen all this in every scene, you will feel like this, yes friend, I have seen Dubai Bhateri, now he is the brand ambassador in Dubai, Shahrukh is fine.  So they will show Bhurj Kalfa in Dubai, they will do it in Dubai, Dubai, Dubai and the picture will be released there in five days, there will be an uproar until the truth is revealed that no, it is not so good, which will be known on Tuesday when it will fall.  So till Monday there is air, there is Rahu, there is foam, it will not burst, wow, it's very sentimental, this works that works, I think there will be very few people, who will review so well, because it is suiting, not a top star, good acting, Bol.  You can do it, it's okay, you put full emphasis on it, Shahrukh has left no stone unturned, but man, he doesn't connect, he doesn't connect, he doesn't connect, it's not his fault, the story line itself is Bedi's direction, it's like this too.  Much granted means to keep it so simplistic, it falls flat, there are some scenes in the village, there are some like that, no adrenal rush, no sentiments, no emotions because those emotions had to be connected which should have been the high point of the movie, like the climax scene of the movie. It doesn't seem like anything happens in it. It's like this and the last scene of the movie. There is a scene after the climax scene as well. A little bit of that happens in it.  There is a need to use laughter, that too seems a bit strange and then just finish the movie like this, end the movie like this and you like, Hey friend Shahrukh, if you don't cheat like this then there is a lot of request to Shahrukh ji, you have many years left. Play your own edge. You have to stick to your action genre. Is the action okay or does it mean something of your own? Do something of your own. Some meaning of the edge has to be different. Brother, I don't know, this did not work, no, now this love is pure to get over, boy, young.  you are done  Let him come, he seems smart, okay, let him come, you will have to give up at some point of time, no matter how much he is, you will have to give up, this one is in the genre, no connect with Taapsee Mannu. Taapsee Pannu seems to be taking it by taunting, okay Boman Rani and those two and the other side actors, I don't know their names, one is Sardarji Bane Bane, another one is Bane Bane, they are not able to connect very much.  There are scenes, there are many scenes, but laughter and connection are not possible in any scene. If it is not possible genuinely, then there is no laughter, no emotion, no anything, then time is wasted and money is wasted. It is not a good picture, it is a time wasted picture.  Hey my verdict is don't watch it, there is no point in giving this star tour, I give the movie one and a half out of five, I give four and a half movie brother, either go watch it or don't watch it. Okay, it should be clear, so I am very clear in that regard, if you guys don't watch this movie, then you will not miss anything. After making the review and uploading it, I will definitely check whether I am saying something, the public is saying something, I found out.  He was out immediately, okay, so I will see that too, rest of you are my audience, those who have seen, tell me whether what I reviewed was right, those who have seen it and those who have not seen it, can avoid and wait after seeing the review. whether it was right or me too  You can flog me that he is reviewing nonsense, then you can tell me if it is okay and whoever saves time and money is okay, many people say to me, why do you watch me, you call me many times, not to watch the picture, it is mine.  The job is to go and observe. Are people watching, who are scientists? Are people watching? What is the calculation going on? It is my job, it is a work. Like many of you people went to work on Thursday, we went to watch a movie.  If it is okay for you guys to make a review, then I hope you guys will like the review review now, what would you like about the picture? I was just wishing that if the picture had been like this then I would have said okay, I am not feeling good at all, that is, I mean.  You don't feel good even speaking bad about it. What happens sometimes is that many movies don't feel bad when you say bad about them. They are so bad or the people in them are such that you are mean like this. If you say bad about them, you don't feel bad.  But it is not so in this  It's Shahrukh, whose speech I find difficult, it's difficult for me to speak badly, it's ok and Rajkumar Hirani is again Raju Hirani is again he is a very good ad guy, he is a very old man, a wise man, and I don't know how he did it.  He get it so color this time he is in that MBBS Munna Bhai MBBS mode, he has not yet come out of those necessities and that thing and India has changed India  Meaning, now the Indian middle class, together with us, has become such an animal, okay, there has been a change, people have changed, parents, children, thought process, everything has changed, now you too will have to change, so you will have to do it, otherwise it will not be so much.  It takes one and a half years to make a picture. It takes Rs 100 to 200 crores. There is a lot of effort. A little can be caught at the level of the story line. This story line was such that if you read it two, four, five or six times, there was nothing inside it. But I don't know why Shahrukh was thinking of I am working with Raju Hirani, so this will definitely set a new milestone because it was Aamir Khan's, Sanjay Dutt's and then it was a picture like Sanju, which is absolutely no topic Sanjay.  Dutt is not some big guy, meaning he is so iconic that a movie should be made on him and on a contemporary actor, and what does that mean, but that too will be such a hit, 320-330 crores. Okay, so Shahrukh.  I thought even my new one will cross I'm I think better than the last of them, but it has not been made till date but it is a dozen that way, see how much the movie earns, what does it earn, but according to me, not so much as that blockbuster level.  This work is not definitely a flop, nowadays it is like Tiger Tha has earned so many 290 crores, 280 crores, so many top stars earn so much these days, it is like that so many runs.  So it will definitely be made, if Virat Kohli comes then the matter is the same otherwise share the review, tell people and save your time, save money, thank you very much."

    "content": "Hello friends, today's topic is one social responsibility which offers should follow, whoever is my subscriber, you know that there is a little bit of hi-ruter thinking, there is a very good response to this new channel, I want to talk about this social responsibility. This means that forwarding a video or any message, especially in WhatsApp, is a social responsibility that we have to see, but we will come to you. If the video is creating in you these emotions of indifference, hopelessness, then please do not forward it because the debt bill just increases the debt. You have to see that you do not have to be a part of someone else's agenda. The truth is that there are many things.  A lot of things are going wrong in Indian homes within the four walls, that is true, that too, tell me again and make more videos and forward them. Child drama on children's distress, bias and daughter-in-law's own children.  Farmaishi Program with Respect to Parents Not Listening to them Not Respecting them Becoming Important Most of the people I am are scenery citizens are doing too much not less they have some fulfillment in life so they feel as if by doing all this they can achieve something  They feel that by doing all this they will create a better future for their children, otherwise, brother, something like this will happen if we do not forward this to you.  This forward came from relatives, friends or friends, join hands with such groups and say brother, don't send it to me. I have given anxiety to many people in my consultation. Now I will tell you about astrologer also. Videos like this are coming. Astrologers are like earthquakes.  Ketu will go there, what does it mean, first of all, I don't agree that anyone can predict so much like this, if you have to make predictions, make predictions every day, meaning every day in the world.  There is neither a story nor a story, there is neither a story nor a story, this year it will go flat in 500 places in 200 countries, okay predict anything, something will come true and cry so much as soon as you make a prediction, something or the other will definitely come true.  Let's forward what does it mean that there will be a world war, it means do not apply for a job, do not do anything sitting at home because there will be a world war, India will also be there in the world war and India will also end, the world will also end, everything will end.  What does this mean, the world was ending in 2012, then that picture came out, then that in 2000 23, we look forward, first thing, don't consume only once you note, consume note, forward topic lets you know what is going to happen.  In this, you have a relative who has varicose veins, there is a medical condition, there is a good channel, a good video has been made, someone has exported it, he has told some things to me and I forward it to him. Whenever you do forward, what you should know is that the person who is forwarding that thing has a pain point which maybe that video will resolve for you, maybe both of you have a common point, 2 women are connected.  Arthritis is the disease of both of them, relatives are friends and someone comes and says to reduce the grains like this, it is worth doing exercise like this or to control it, then give D off course forward on IT Becomes Interesting. Bill you forward and aa video of late se n disease like authorities and other others like this you random people home you do n't know ki yaar uska pen hai nahi hai to ye wala kyun ho raha hai kya matkar ke forward karne ka whatsapp group pe ho  Then it is being discussed, abuses are happening, fights are happening, that time passes, those who forward it to all of you think that there will be some agenda of ours or that we should  You have to vote for this person, you like him, his ideology is very good, why are the workers sitting for free, if you have a lot of fun in reducing it, Bhai Saheb, I can't control myself, see, the suggestion is that all these people's trees are IT.  Go there and get a job from the cell, friend, at least you will earn some money because you are giving him the lesson of the agenda for free, why are you getting this money? Take the money, then you are doing his advertisement, aren't you political about anything?  This is the work of the party, the ideology is being advertised, you are a fool, you say, I will forward it to 500 people every day, give me money, although I am saying this sarcastically, it is okay, I hope this little audience understands me, right?  The one who is doing everything is very clear, what he has done in his life, what we do and what happens and the world, he is Illuminati, he is controlling but we are here with their agenda. And there are a lot of pains in life but we have to be foxes, we have our own issues, there are spices in life where we have to be foxes a lot but in that people leave their foxes and wonder what happens in my child's life.  My daughter has just been delivered to the doctor. She has a small baby. Come let's help her. She will go to her job again. What is the least we have to do in the morning to move forward. People are seeing all these things in life getting settled in front of them. All the diseases are spreading a lot but which  Somebody has you no because of the moment, people don't need to share this video too much, because that's the way it is, look, fear are people, what am I disgusted with that and fuel get after 78  Yes, it is a matter of time and it is the evolution of the society, of the country, so to say immediately why this is happening and it should not happen, does not matter to me. I want the audience which is connected with me, this should be like this, don't utter such words as to what should happen, focus on what you have to do, the middle class should also get something, there should not be a new free B, no, no one will be saved by saying this.  It does n't mean what do you need, there is a lot of frustration in your life, your miserable life is going on but it is a part of someone's agenda. I have seen that it is a part of an open agenda and all this reduces personal life, so many people who  They were living their normal life, they were working on money, they were fox on entertainment, they were fox on their good luck, they were fox on their career, they were fox on their relationship, they were fox on their health, just pick them all up and say, you haven't seen all this, this is a fortress, this is a war. What will you consume? You have many things to eat. But what you end up eating and consuming is defined by you. Think this, so I hope this bill will be understood by me.  The audience is very good, I am getting very good reactions, there are very good comments, this is the intelligence and this is the only thing that we have to take forward, just stay connected, if such a forward has been shown and you have not subscribed to the channel, then do some 10-12 by now.  Videos have been uploaded well, please go and watch them too, enjoy and it is not a journey but a story, you will reach the destination and you will also see the destination, it is exactly like the 9:00 o'clock debate, not like that.  You will leave me, you will never listen to those 9:00 debates, they will give you so much anxiety, you will sleep late at night, now you can see in my voice and tone, you can even sleep while listening to this, please know that there is a little peace inside my voice.  Healing power is there, I am talking peacefully, I am singing a lullaby, but this once, yes everyday, if you consume this channel, by extracting the juice from your external, this noise that has been happening, I will cut you like a letter.  I am giving it by typing in this way, please enter metro happy, mute Jain from that group and remove him for a few days, Jain and tell him, 'Doing this detox from those who do this detox, what do people do?' Why would you go through social media, which is a good thing, you cannot get rid of it directly on the phone, there are many good things in this phone, there are very bad things, consume it consciously, I have to consume it and its only one.  It is the filter and test which takes you up, makes you feel good, makes you feel good, gives you peace, gives you peace, gives you fun, gives relaxation, only that content is right and which is not like this, leave this one, this is like yourself.  Chhath will pass and people will become one, it will last for a time, after that it will become ours, let's start, start, as they say, first things to tell, many things to tell about me, I feel that there is someone nearby and who is better than me.  audience  For example, there has been a change in the society, I am an observer scientist, hello or even a reformer, because what happens in this old time, in a very old time, Vidyasagar ji is Raja Ram Mohan, it is a thing because he was educated, the rest of the people were not very educated.  Things did happen when I came here before this note match difference between me and you in terms of vativer study written and de baby look and talk and speak in this  Think, everyone is expert in their knowledge, these days every person is influencing, every person is doing something or the other, in this you are saying this, it does not mean that you are the one here, this is the one here, right now in this video.  People will also write below that it means you are like this. Okay, so first you will relax. Do not forward this kind of thing. Forward this video to your parents who keep sending such messages in the morning and evening. Tell them, Papa, Mom, have.  If you are looking at the youngster and if it is you yourself, it is dad and mom who is sending then tell me, look at yourself because you are seen forwarding it, now this will happen, then this will happen."

    "title": "EVM Par Charcha ： A Much Required Insight Given [vy4Sx_VQryI].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today we will discuss, we will discuss openly on EVM. Do you understand that EVM is fine? It is okay, so let's discuss EVM once because no logical discussion has been done on it till now and my job is to talk logically because  There is always a doubt about EVM that it is not known whether the EVM will be manipulated, sometimes it comes to Sukh Butt and in the opposition parties they say to you, today elections are going to be held, so one thing we will tell you in this video.  Through this or the public, you are ignorant, let's clear one thing, it is okay with these political parties, especially with the opposition ones, it is okay that friend, is this a scam in EVMs, if you have any doubt in this, then tell me right now, then let's discuss the issue.  There will be no manifesto, settle this thing, tell me brother, this will not happen and if it is not happy, do not push that the result has come as per your wish, then brother, then yes, it is fine, EVM gets fixed in Karnataka.  If the result is fine in Bengal, then brother, if it is fine in Telangana, then the EVM will be fine there, this EVM is like this, it means that some will be fine there, it has got damaged from here, if you have doubt then brother, sit completely.  Stop the whole country, brother, do it to EVMs and if you are not raising this issue, you are doing your campaigning, releasing your manifestos here and there, chanting Jai Ho Jai Ho and not discussing EVMs. Brother, don't open your mouth again, Leo, but I will also tell you my take on EVMs. I will discuss from the other side, but this is a clear cut for the opposition parties. Brother, you settle down once, not that the result should be slightly favorable on 4th June.  If something seemed right then brother, it was okay and if it didn't seem right then he said, then why are you contesting the elections? Then brother, if you like that I am the top leader of the opposition party and I am on the EVM.  If there is any doubt then I will leave all the work and say brother, he will do it otherwise we would not have fought because we are not here, it is not that if you say a little or do that, if you lose then the EVM is bad and if you win then the EVM will be fine there, the public is selective.  A clear cut message has to be given to the politicians that brother, tell me whether the election is going to be held or not, otherwise whether to give the paper or not, you tell me, if the opposition in the country says that you should not give me the paper, then brother, then the issue has become.  Then VVPAT count will have to be done everywhere. Then do the ballot paper and if you feel okay because now I will tell you my take on it. Yes, EVM is fine and does anyone think in EVM that even if there could be a technical glitch?  Let's accept that it can be known, although it has not been proved yet, but it is said that let's guess that its age is If you could, then how would you know that these question papers are leaked? So many people are developed in checks and balances. You have to understand the procedure of Election Commission. So many people are developed in it. Group D, Employee Group C, Group B.  All the officers, the whole system is evolved, caste, gender, everything is evolved, so you can call it such a big scam, call it theft or call it a mess.  No political party can get away with it, all of them are sitting with mobile phones, within a minute all of them become like this But brother, the actual one, you can't pull through this, that money heist, as if it was a web series, this is also a high type, this, no one can pull through, no leader even if he wants to. If it can be done, if it has not been proven yet that you can do it, it has not been proven yet, but I am saying that even if you can do it, no one will do it, no, this is the biggest thing. This is a thing and we have to fix it as a country, we can get out of this thing and as far as there are suggestions in it because the random wife pats are those who are like me and my opponent and they are our agents for polling.  ones  So they can make a match with any of them, friend, now all the rice is cooked, all the rice is raw, so you won't tell me that I have eaten all the rice, brother, after eating some of the raw rice, you will come to know, so I am saying this randomly, okay, 543  If the seats are fine in the country, then count all the VV pats on 10 seats. If there are more issues, then you should be aware of this. However, counting all the seats is a waste of time, but what is the value of that time in India?  There is no cost, it will take two, four, six, 10 hours more, count once, if you have to do it then that is one solution, other wise, random check is being done, all the agents who sit there, whatever policy they see there, they see it and randomly, you have not checked any box. Picked it up and you can match with it. Even if a thousand votes were cast, it was counted, so how will it be fixed at random? And in the old times, there was more match fixing in the ballot paper.  My friend, at least go there, fast, fast, fast, fast, now here at least you have to press this button, it is VV pat, it is a human's child, CCTV is installed, Aadhar card is there, sorry, you have to go with your voter ID card, all that is yours, you have to do that. So in one thing, the country has reached the level it has reached. Don't reinvent the wheel. Now, if you start making LPG gas again, then no, we will go and make Chulle gas again. No, this is right now.  Has the electrical vehicle arrived or the big engine petrol is running fine, no yes, we will go in that one, we will go in the old model, no yes, that is good, no, we will not go in the cross steering car, yes, it is fun doing it like this.  Some technology has come, this has happened, let's settle it as this thing, don't discuss it, there is more problem in elections, beyond which I want my audience and the citizens of our India to open their mouth, they should open their mouth that brother. If I press any button on the EVM, I will win, whatever I want, but Susra, even after winning, he will keep doing what he does, you will uproot him, the problem is there, isn't it, in Maharashtra, just look at it by making a joke.  Question that thing, you keep doing EVM, EVM, no result comes, no, EVM is there, it is okay, it says no, Supreme Court says something, they show elections. After doing commission, this is cheating, it is like children, elections are being held in the country, that is the question of children, so do this or not, those who break it, now I want to tell you, brothers and sisters, listen, the topper student is in alliance with 50 parties. And I don't know how many other small parties are there in the opposition. You will vote for all of them and these votes will go to their account and they will win some of these elections.  I am not a scam, but the scam would be that the person who voted for this idol went here, as soon as he wins, there is an MP election, which one of them, you will install that one on 66 and that system. Only one man said, today I live on that of RLD, one man wins on my name and surname, now I have gone to this party, I have to wear only the belt, whose belt will I wear?  Sorry to use this word, wear it only with a strap, say go there and wear it in a minute, will wear it on anyone, what guarantee do you have, did you put this or that after thinking, anyone can go anywhere, beyond that, there is no discussion if You have seen that some party is coming with two MPs, is coming with 250, is coming with 300, is coming with 70, is coming with 100, it is not easy to break such a percentage of 66, but brother, if any three MP comes, then  Of the party, two of them have come here, now the EVMs are being scammed, there is no EVM scam in this, people have applied their mind, awakened their intelligence, conscience and consciousness and voted for him, they cast their vote correctly and he also won, but now there is no control over him. Wherever it goes, the same thing happens in MLA elections. You see that operation happened anywhere in Madhya Pradesh. What do they call these toppers? Which sign of the party is that? Efforts were made in Karnataka and efforts are made everywhere in Himachal.  So this game is going on, you vote for someone and start crying over the EVM. I am saying that there is nothing in the EVM. If you vote for someone, he will fly away. Tell me, what treatment will you give to him? He has to do it, right? What is to be done by questioning EVM? This is a bigger mess that I vote for this person and if the vote goes to this person then there is nothing wrong with the technology and process but if it goes somewhere else then that is another topper party like this.  Sitting comfortably, vote for someone, he will come to us, I had made a video earlier, if the water of the sweet ghat of colors and sherbets dissolves itself in me, then everything will be resolved, sitting like the water of the sweet ghat, ready to dissolve once.  If you call then the problem is this, stop crying of EVM, it is nothing, EVM is absolutely fine, everything is good, the problem is ahead brother, it is not in it, you have a small exam, if the question paper gets leaked then that.  We are caught because we are like this, friend, don't tell anyone, this is actually happening, or something is strong in our stomach, we have not been taught so long, if you see, we have a problem, brother, and this is also our advantage in a way.  Talking about the country is not something I can stomach and there is also an advantage, one half of the army is a military man and we keep all of them secret. Well, that's a different procedure. Otherwise, how can you do this work?  Will you, friend, talk to someone in the stomach, whatever is there, there is Group C, then there is Group B, there is Group A, there are officers, there are phones, everything is there, no one can escape, no one can fix it, then that fix cannot be done since this is why no one can.  He is not even doing it because it is foolish to do it. If I fix the human being, then why do I need to fix the machine? To fix the machine, one has to be caught. Fixing the machine is also not easy and yet.  Not technically proven but it can be fixed by a human being in two minutes. You are having an election, this time you will win. Fat brother is winning. If you win, then see how easy it is to do. You will come to know as soon as the election is over. Political parties have started elections today, you have to judge who is winning, you take your car once and come to the polling booth, everyone is sitting there, who has the longest queue. And when you get the slip, in which line you get to know which one is right, if it is very close, then a little one is the other wise, roughly everyone knows where the program is going, set the program there in advance, if you will win.  And this one, one, one, one, one MP, two, two MPs, three MPs, now in Bihar, I don't know how many are fighting on five seats, brother, fight on five seats, if two of you come, come, come, come, come under the tent.  come here  That's why there is so much confidence in crossing because it is already crossed brother, if the number comes then if you do n't cross then you have to cross anyway, do whatever you have to do, you are feeling sad here by discussing on EVMs, by discussing on ideology. Most of all, feel pity on that political worker and the political worker of the topper party, who is old, has been beaten, has been lathi-charged, has done everything and those who beat him are going to be the boss over him because he is the one who Look at the pain of the parties and understand that if you have a political work which you opposed from within and they did the same to you, now they will come to your party and sit at your head and they will have to campaign for them and speak. Brothers and sisters, we will have to get them to vote, there is a lot of politics, I would say that it is a shameless act, if I use the word, how can you do like this, friend, you mean you do n't even question your leaders.  What pills and stories are they feeding you? I want to hear from the one who is a loyal worker, who is loyal to ideology, hard working and has even faced the baton, what story would you be telling him before he comes, these days, he is on the leash, these days, no every political party.  I have made it clear that if someone of this level comes, he will wear this belt, wear this turban, these are kept in the store house and they are like that, if you go to Allahabad or anywhere else, you will get that coconut. Then you throw it, then people jump and take out the coconut and then they catch it to you, then you, then the next judge throws it and then they take it out again. This turban is also like this, it is kept there.  20-30 turbans of different sizes, depending on which leader comes, only he wears the turban, only he takes it off and then he moves it forward, this drama is happening here, this drama is happening from here to here.  Question them and these dramas are happening before the elections and they will happen after the elections too. Right now they are happening before the elections, after that then again mumma again mumma then tune change Kolaveri de Kolaveri de mumma tune changes. Their tune will always remain mumma tune changes.  Is it ever from here to here, from here to here, the public has to focus more on this, beyond this, there is more discussion on this, EVM is a time waste let's not discuss.  It's because I told you that first of all it has not been proved that there is something wrong in it, second brother, there is no way to escape from it, where will a man come from, no one is even trying, he is not trying for any party, and if like I told you in the first example, if  You opposition people who are crying so much, looking at your paper it seems that you will cry on the 4th, if you are okay then brother, if it will come out then tell me strictly now, sir, what do you say to me, I do n't like this one.  You make me another one, now you make it an issue, you are not making it an issue because you also know in your heart that friend, this is not wrong, you know it but it is that I want to feel it, otherwise in the last move, then how will you say no to us?  So the public did not trust us again, then tell me, this is not yours, this is not right, there is no delay like this, and all your agents are there, everything is there, the entire system is very good, friend, so let's not question our core system is fine.  Don't question him, there are many other things to question and I told that beautifully in this video that brother, you vote for someone, only your man will come to me, why are you feeling sad, even if you have won the election, it is yours.  A person will come, change things again and again and resign again and then by-elections will be held. This is a joke. In this, 20 people came to the assembly and then they resigned and then by-elections are held again.  He fought and then he became a minister, then you had voted for him, look at the stupidity of the public, first he won, then he ran away, then he ran away, then who made him win, how did it happen, how did it happen, the public is not paying attention here, I hope the channel liked the video. Subscribe, request is to increase the number of subscribers. The political environment is getting hotter. Along with the heat, the atmosphere is also getting hotter. It will be a lot of fun. It is the dance of democracy. We have to come and dance in it every day. And every day.

    "title": "Fall Of Godi Media And Rise Of Youtubers ｜  A Great Idea Also  Shared With All Subscribers [nIT5JyknpMI].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today we will discuss on the rise of users in the political space, the downfall of Godi media and why people lost faith in the media. Over period, other wise, media was a very big thing, newspapers used to come first and then this newspaper, this news.  There used to be channels but over a period of time, I want to tell what happened and we have to understand this phenomenon and so that we can know in future also what will happen in the future if you look into the political space.  If we look at the popular channels, then the content of Dhruv Rathi ji is okay, I would say it is political, although he brings something else in between, Ravish, this is why, there is Ajit Anj, there is one, Joshi ji, there is a lady, the name is remembered by me.  I am not able to understand that your Deepak Sharma ji is a 4 PM person, he is a topper student, despite making promises, a good political channel is emerging, which I am telling the subscribers.  It is okay that there are huge number of subscribers and there are other channels as well but I told you in general and Godi YouTubers also have two or four of them, if you ever go and watch them then they are very extreme.  It's okay, he is from Jaipur Dialogues, you would never know by watching his channel that this person is the retired Chief Secretary of Rajasthan, he talks in such a manner, he is as mean as he says.  Isn't that figure ok and there is also a Bharti Ajit Bharti Karke, he is a little on this side, the other people you will get to know in the political space, I am telling you about the stars, which is ok, so one is Anand Ranganathan ji, he has his own.  There are also people who do an evening show, there are those people too, then there are more people here and there, okay, I don't agree with all of them, that's a different thing, I am not a fan of any of them, I just think so. My  I think the content is better than all of them, but I told them why all of them have risen because it was being discussed on a podcast that these people have risen a lot, they should be heard a lot.  It is fine and that is Ashok Wakhar ji, he is listened to, Deepak Sharma ji is listened to, Prasun Vajpayee is one of the anchors, he is also listened to a lot, the rest are at small level, small channels and states.  There are many level people, okay, so why did this happen? This happened because what did they do? Real media means these are your big channels like all the channels, English Hindi ones, whatever Arnav Goswami one, Aaj Tak ones, these are the ones.  They reduced going out and reporting, used to live in AC office and started getting so much revenue from the government, state government, central government, beyond this, check the data, thousands of crores within the last 10 years. They get money from advertisements, they do n't even need normal advertisements, so they go and do the reporting, send people to do it from there, now all of them sit and do podcasts, this work is done by voting, I give you the knowledge, I also give my knowledge whatever I know.  It is understood that I am giving, they are also giving in the same way and now people are on mobile in their hands, they also listen to us on mobile, many times our things seem very logical, it seems logical and one of them is  On the other hand, now they are meeting, now they are smiling, it is raining, flowers have won next, they have crossed 400, they have become Sikhs, now I have seen that many who are of BJP have many supporters, whom many people troll like that. A word has been created for doing blind devotee. It has already become a word for them. I myself do not like to use but give. Today, it has become such that whoever is there is called a blind devotee, then those people who  they too are there now  People like us are coming to our channel or are coming to other channels because they are saying that we also need another point of view because we are bored, the same kind of narrative is going on here and there, so the country should  Now with the freshness that is needed, I am now telling you what is going to happen and what should happen. You all have to become YouTube because what was the case earlier if your agenda will be too visible or will be divided or it means checks and balances on you. WhatsApp is not only 2 but they do some things with them but they don't have any viewership so it doesn't help that you have such a random one, now I don't make you use the wrong word to call any class or poor or rich or like that.  But just like that, a random person has made some videos and is a very wrong speaking person, so no one is giving him any importance because he looks like he belongs to us, his IQ level is visible from his face.  Okay and it is visible from the way he speaks, so this is the space that I told you, what is there in this space, now the channels are your main stream channels, how many are you watching in Hindi, you put 2025 main channels, this is ABP News.  And this Rajat Sharma ji and this Hindi Ke Laga Lo Main Main which is 20 and the English Main Main Laga Lo 10 which takes the top viewership means between them take it to 95.  If we go, then these are 30 channels, but these channels like ours are coming now, now there is no limit on them, although even among the popular channels that I have mentioned, people are watching them at 70-80, but more channels will come here because there is someone in it.  It is not that 50 crores of production cost is required to open the channel, so you people also make it further. You people who are my subscribers, please also keep an eye on what is happening around you, beyond that, all the YouTube cyans do so much color. They were crying in all the survey agencies, what did the posters say, their team betrayed them and gave a different report, then you are as good as your team, sitting at home they said that Modi ji is winning by 400. We went here, these people are winning the elections, these people are winning, we gave a report, asked someone, it takes a lot of life to go physically and ask in the sun, didn't we ask ourselves and gave a report, then the local channels which are on today's day.  Are Local people are there through the comment section and they are more aware of their local issues and this is why I want all of you, who are my audience, to become citizen journalists and two to four five crore YouTube1 people should stand up.  Then you will go and bring milk, you will bring a pot, you will bring tea leaves, you will have to keep the things, if you make tea, people will start coming, hey, tea is available there, tea is available, tea is available, this betel leaf is available.  There are shopkeepers who sell beedis, there are cigarette people, they stand anywhere, they do not ask whether people will come or not, they know that they have to come, they have to come anywhere, I am telling you, I mean, I do not promote gutka, paan and exam at all.  I am telling you that in India, you open something, people will come, open the pav bhaji one, it has gone viral, is it pav bhaji or bada pav sari vada pav wali vadapav wali?  Anything works in India, so you open it yourself and what will happen from it, will there be true democracy, then Godi media will not understand and yours is yours, I am saying this as an example, you live in a society, society means.  If you open a channel with a flat of a thousand people, today there is this activity, today there is this problem, today there is this, then all your subscribers will be from that society, then do two-four such societies and you will be successful in that too.  goes  You can earn a lot of money even in that amount and become relevant. You are giving ideas to every society. I am giving ideas to RW people. Open your so and so area, so and so sector, so and so society, RW Association, so and so, threaten, open all of them.  It will slip out of your hands, no one will be able to control anyone else, I am giving you the idea of ​​strengthening democracy, I do n't have any expenses, my subscribers are also increasing, you like it, do n't you?  People will increase, I will also become lakhs gradually, make videos every day, give knowledge to people, add value in the life of some people, then here I add value in your life, subscribers increase every day, views come every day and I  Tell me what am I saying wrong because when you are dependent on others then you have no platform to speak, your view point and keeping your wisdom and conscience right, tell the society a genuine thing. Show me the mirror, how good is this mic, isn't this the mic of 8800? It seems like you can take an interview with anyone. What do you have to say? Okay, then okay, how did you like the movie? How did you like this? This issue is coming. Okay.  How does this budget look? Hey, nothing has been done for the middle class. Hey, what has been done, what has not been done. If you have done well then you will say good things. Take an interview of 50 people. Genuinely people will know what is happening in the country. Wow.  Should we do this? We will have to stop all the channels. This is a different work for the channels. Now you saw that a case was filed in the High Court, the decision came so soon. An anchor said something to someone, he said, he abused me, he filed a case.  And he said that he did not abuse and while now he cannot speak on it, you people know that for what ever the court decides so quickly, by the way, there are so many people here waiting in the queue, he says to someone, what is the urgency given that the decision will be taken where.  but guys And now you are understanding the meaning of this, everything is fine then who should come and question whom should they question on this, if they question the politician then they get scared from here or if they question the officer then they get scared from here, okay business man.  The public is scared everywhere because when everyone starts opening their mouths, this is democracy, then I am telling you to stand up, apply force, the guidelines are very clear and simple.  Just do follow them, don't follow anyone in the name of one religion or in the name of others, whatever is your genuine thing, come and speak from your heart, no guidelines are folly and some channel's channel also looks like this, please shut it down. Dega, no one can stop it, funny videos, educational videos, this video, yes, what is the problem in that, put all the educational videos, we have to disillusion the politicians, are you with me, political?  The powers have to show their status that we are the sovereign of India, we the public will tell you we are the boss, we are the judge, the boss, we have to become Pushpa, the public has to become Pushpa, Pushpa Pushpa Pushpa Pushpa, we will come straight, we will not bow down, who means the public politician? Hey, we have to keep them bowing, they bow only twice when they come to ask for votes, once in the Assembly and once in the Lok Sabha, they don't even ask about their caste, find the MP, go away.  Whatever problems I have, is there any way to meet them? This is my helpline number, this is my PA's number, you can take an appointment here, I go to this office from here, if you ever go to a doctor, then it is Doctor Sahib's number.  You know that this is the time of OPD, the doctor sits here on this date, Wednesday is here, Saturday is here, at so and so time, you know that the slip will be cut there, sitting is here, there is a waiting list.  The system of meeting you leaders is like this, they are public servants and then they will come to take their votes and then you will vote in the name of religion or in the name of caste, you vote on this name and then you are happy. All of you can create your own channels. I want every subscriber to create a channel. Any subscriber who wants to create a channel can write to me in the comment section. If I get 100 channels then I will create a channel. However, I have hired a professional. I have done a paid workshop, but now depending on my time, I will do one more video on this, but I will use it for political purposes, then the rest will become professional, not for spare, but he will have money, then I will take the money, I want to do it for free.  I am doing this work of doing politics in it, you get money in it also, some get less, some get less butt, everyone gets this channel, according to me, everyone should have this channel, everyone should have a channel, today I went there, I saw this going wrong. My  This is my opinion, what is your opinion, what is your opinion and many people, so I will address here that if you are friends then you can also create a channel with four people because it is owned by one person and many times he cannot upload content like I do.  There are many channels and I am doing this full time but you may be studying, working, busy with other things, if you can't dive, then you are four different people who are friends from different cities or something.  You can create a channel together. You can contribute that content and share the money you earn. Open a joint account and do adsense in it. I will tell you how many people are there who would like to create a channel. Please write in the comment section from anywhere.  If you are a resident of a small town then what happened, tell me what is the problem there and go there and make a video and say in the video, see, the sewer is blocked here, the water is blocked here right now.  Gurgaon will be flooded, I am already telling you how much the government can do, elections are coming, we will check, I am telling you as an example, you are from one city, you can be in any city, you can see anti-social elements anywhere or anything.  See something wrong happening, see some wrong activity with some children, see some wrong activity with some children, make a video on your channel and upload it and if you feel very scared in it, then I will teach you in another way for at least one hour.  You will feel that I cannot make such a big video, so when you want to open a channel, I will tell you what to do and it will go to the authorities and it is not our intention to let anyone down, brother, don't think that I am here for some kind of revolution. I am saying this to reach out genuinely because if something reaches those government people sitting in the office, then they will automatically take cognizance of it when comments come in because in a democracy, voting is done, so every person comes and takes part in it.  As someone is speaking now, let me give you an example of NEET, there is a physics student in NEET, our Alak Pandey ji, he went and lodged a complaint and lodged a complaint with the minister and they said that the guardian had lodged the complaint, oh brother, he is also affected. Why can't I enter as a citizen of this country? Even if I am not directly affected, at least indirectly, if they are coaching people, then they are affected by their children traveling.  There is no man who should try to be a student of the children or a leader of the children, you have an agenda, you are a coach, the father of the child, hey, the father of the child does not have a lawyer, he has no money, he has no energy, he has no influence, so he is the one who has to stand up. This is what the politician wants to become powerful himself and leave you at this level. Hey brother, after 1500 subscribers, he does n't say anything, but for me it's only 31000.  The same is happening in my other big channels too, but in this, you have political acumen that yes, we have such strength that people listen to it, in the olden times people would take 10 people in politics or go to the Panchayat or village.  If you take 20 people with you, then go to the politicians only. Brother, if there are 20 people, then by going into four, you have 100 votes. Well, let's do their work brother. Subscribers are also family, I am an idol, it is right.  You will do it because if a person is telling him that something is wrong, he is telling it logically like I am saying, Agneepath scheme will have to be changed, Agniveer, it is an issue, so if you people support it, you are curious when it comes to this.  It reaches someone because they also calculate that so many comments, so many likes, so many channels are influencing the election, the entire vote is taken, there was a video with a dictate, Dhruv went to 12 crore people.  Rathi's brother played different roles in that sphere, good is bad in elections, he was against your IG, he had agenda or not, good or bad for the country, that is a different discussion, I am talking about effective, effective of platform because now this  Godi is the media, its effectiveness has become zero, it has become zero, because now even the devotees are not watching it, then it will end like people have become disillusioned with cinema, some movies from Bollywood will be released.  If you go to watch some movies, then the same thing will happen to them, like they will go for information like business channels will continue to run, stock market discussion, some promoter is speaking and the other wise, that too will reduce.  If you have to show yourself like this 24 hours a day, then where will you get the quality of content, no one is coming, I have my own genuine intelligence, as I say, I have a lot of intelligence, why should I go and work for any news channel?  Go upstairs and waste half an hour of my time, I will open my own channel here and this is what these people are doing, who are famous in all the media and have brought genuine talent and genuine feeling of journalism in them, they all have their own Today I will tell Anjana Om Kashyap ji to leave it and this Sudhir Choudhary will tell me, leave it till today, make your own channel and then talk.  Let's see how much power he has, then Aaj Tak has done something and everything for so many years, by being the fastest and coming on the platform there and Shik Shik Shik from behind and today coming in the helicopter, clothes make-up shakeup, all this.  That is easy to do. Come genuinely and sit here. Like us here, genuinely come and sit on the sofa and genuinely talk about the public's issues. Talk openly and involve them too. Sometimes their comments come and sometimes it becomes known.  Is it ours, the status of every video and every topic, we come to know within an hour how much the video has played, how many people are watching, how many likes are coming, how are the comments coming, have I made a relevant video, have I not made it, and the feedback is so quick.  From this, we who are genuine creators, I consider myself genuine and many people are genuine, they come to know that yes, this is the right thing, we talked about something of ours, if they consider us to be agenda driven and  Do not understand our feelings, what we were trying to say, that is, there is a communication gap. If my intentions are good, why only I know about my intentions? Others may think, I can claim that it is good, but I only know it.  If my intention is right and the public is misunderstanding it, then that means what is wrong, there is a mistake in the public, no, there is never any mistake in the public, the mistake will remain in my communication, I will correct it in the next video, I will correct it in the next video and  others will also check  That yes friend, now its communication is fine, now we are understanding, isn't that feedback coming constant, Godi Media people themselves do not listen to any feedback, Paisi has crossed 400 in the studio, he has crossed 400 in the studio, so now this is coming to an end.  In three to four years, all of them will disappear. Check the listed share prices to see where they are going, but they were as much equal to the government as the state government and they were indirectly.  In a way, giving a bribe means that you are giving them so much advertising money, these people started getting money so easily, their anchor fees increased so much, they became star anchors and then they became heroes.  Now you tell me who is the owner of all these Republic TVs. Tell me, all of them are politically linked and they have channels of BJP people and Congress people too, do I know something which is theirs?  Who all are linked? Whose ownership is this? These political parties are owning the channel. Directly, indirectly, through businessmen, through friends, through industrialists, through someone. Everyone has made some or the other setting within Tamil Nadu. You know about them. So only the TV channels are running, that Sun TV of the political party, whose Sun TV is it, tell me, okay, brother, we too have to open our platform to the public, open it more.  You, many people have told me that you were running such a good channel, make good videos, keep making them there, don't make these, do n't talk like this to many people, hey, what did I do less there too?  As many videos are being uploaded as can be uploaded, but here the video is being uploaded because this space is a blue ocean opportunity, here I am giving advice to you guys, don't stop me, don't do this friend, don't say such a bad thing, say this, do this or this.  We don't like it, we don't want to see you in that group, just talk about shares, talk about property, houses, jobs, relationships, marriage, there is such growth, this one, this one is also important because we cannot skip it. This is the politics of a country decides the ecosystem. How will the pond be? If the pond itself gets spoiled, you will travel. If there is a fish in it, you will travel. You cannot individually say, no, I am a fish, I have to eat something here.  I am getting it to drink, it is doing well brother, it is affecting the pond also, if it is getting messed up then people will have to say, hey brother, don't put this in it, don't do it like this, don't do it, so this is also very important.  All of you will create whatever channel I want, brothers and sisters, all of you create a channel. Now, as many subscribers as I have or as many viewers of this video as I have, create a channel. I will create a special group in the comment section.  If you want to join for anything, you can gather a number in Guruji from Gurugram Kagram. There are already thousands of members on it. If you can become a member then their details will start appearing in it. If you just want to join, then I will not give the link individually. If I can teach each and every person how to use Zoom, then what will I do? I will tell you, come to that group, I will become regular beyond that and I will tell you all that  I will make those who have become irrelevant politically relevant. No one is asking you who is my audience. I do n't know what my audience is. No one is asking. You are becoming crazy about other people's marriages, your issues are your issues and how will you raise them.  All voices will be there, now I will not just one, but all the 3 Hajj channels who are my subscribers will take it and then you will also open it in the family and through that the voice will be heard. We will narrate the voice here because Godi media is not going to narrate it.  These representatives who have brought votes in the Parliament, there is no way to reach them, so our channels will definitely reach them, whatever channel, like my channel, I have feedback, even Kha Kha is talked about, now in Agniveer you have seen I have seen me making noise two-three times, then I became a little quiet because I got feedback from one place that brother, keep calm, change is happening, so my aim here is not to become a hero, this is the issue.  I have to do the right thing, if the confidence and assurance that I have got is that I will not see the direction in 15, 20, 25 days, 30 days, then what is my point, my hello friends, it will start again here, I am telling this with the confidence with which I come and speak.  Brother, it makes a difference if you have 31000 viewers or subscribers, it makes a difference and especially when you talk genuine, if you talk agenda driven or forcefully.  All you have to do is to criticize and if your problem is more about the person than the issue, then those people also understand, the audience also understands, the politician also understands, but what is the best thing about the politician, he understands the intentions, he knows that  Is he doing this on someone's advice or is it genuinely driven by his own instinct and genuine people are joining and this is where I can hit the spot on politicians, so we can support channels like ours.  They give so much respect because we bring real issues and tell them such things in which they get clapping because their own political workers are not able to give that much intelligence and officials are not able to give them the wisdom to do this, they are politicians after all.  He keeps thinking what work should I do, what should I do to make the public happy, with whom should I do something, because all the time he also knows that listening to stories will not work, he also wants to do something real, so like us and I want like you too now.  Connect and tell the genuine politician, brother, please do this, if you do n't do it, then look again, then you will have to change, okay what will the person doing the change do right, if he does n't do it, then we will change him, do we have 5 years in democracy in politics?  If you put someone on your throne, you can change it in 5 years. It is not necessary to become a devotee, nor should one perform Aarti from him, nor should such a thing happen that the public should perform Aarti through a politician.  And the politician came and performed aarti for you like this, why can't this happen, why can't it happen the other way around? So please subscribe, like the channel and I will make everyone a channel. Thank you very much."

    "title": "Fertility Rate In South India And Delimitation Exercise [SCk8fYgCv98].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, I want to start a very interesting debate. I and you all want to participate, it is a matter of our country, we are Indians, we Indians have to discuss, I do not want to do any North-South in this, but I want to tell the point and what is that phenomenon.  Chief Minister Stalin Saheb of Tamil Nadu and Do Saheb of Andhra Pradesh are very aware about fertility rates in their states and it is a I also agree and this thing so.  I was saying for many days that the fertility rate is going down in both the states, that is, women are producing less children. The fertility rate in India has gone below the replacement rate. The replacement rate is 2.1. If every woman produces 2.1 children, then catering for If you are a husband and wife, if two people are gone, two people are left, then the population has neither increased nor decreased, if two children are born, if less than two children are born.  If one woman does it, it means the population will decrease. In South Korea, there are 78 son-in-laws. It is different for other countries. There are 36 places in India. If you count your total separately, then Union Territories are also included in it, so 31 out of 36 states.  In stroke union territories, we have gone below the replacement rate. There are five states in which the most greedy country is the country. I am saying the states, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar which have become factories for producing children. Now I will say that I feel bad that 3.6 Now it is not injustice in Bihar that UP Bihar keeps increasing the population so much and now in the delimitation, you know the government dispensation, by increasing the seats there, the power will remain in the North, UP Bihar are not discipline about child means population.  It is okay because if you combine both then it will become close to 50 crores, maybe it is better if it definitely becomes 40 crores then every third person in India is either from UP or Bihar.  I am not getting anything done against them but I am saying that when this GST is deducted and distributed which goes to one center and one state and after the center distributes it back to Bihar and bridges collapse there then man there. What is your fault, you are here, you are provoking them, this is South India, South India, no, I am telling the truth, friend, I am telling the truth, they study in Bangalore, do IT, they are smart children, they produce less, they pay more taxes.  are everything  We do it and here within Bihar, why should I not speak, the government cannot speak, the political party cannot speak, Congress cannot speak because they also want votes in Bihar, BJP will not speak, others will also not speak, but we, the countrymen, can speak.  He said, what is this or if the people of South India have shown more discipline, they produce less children, women get employed, your sex ratio is that of South Indian states, it means more females than males.  Females on 1000 mails are 1050 1100 in Haryana, after suffering for so many years, they have reached 800 850, what is their mistake, they have also done women empowerment, children are also less, now women empowerment has happened, so now she is saying that I  I have to do a job for the children, I can't support the children, I will reduce it, now the population is also decreasing and they are paying more tax, they are also getting less GST. They don't even get the political share in power because the brother who takes UP, Bihar and North India gets seats in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Delhi and if he forms this government then this one is within the delimitation and if this happens then it will be very big.  I am not just talking about this as an issue, I am raising the issue of South only, it is a bigger issue, many people will say that low fertility rate is very good for the country, then again this issue will come up, religion is dangerous, religion is dangerous.  the matter also comes up  So if religion is in danger then why don't they give birth to children then why do you keep talking about the danger of religion because religion is not in danger everything of ours will be in danger Economics because dependent population will increase Today our elders and elders say People are old people, they should not feel bad, it is okay to be called old, if they are actually old, if their hair is white and it is not there, then perhaps it may seem okay, 12 crores.  If 12 crore people are above the age of 60, then 12 crore is enough but not too much because the population is young and as less children are born, the young population will reduce after 20 years because it may not have been born and which is 40 today.  The 45 year old is going to cross 60, the 45 year old is going to be 50, the 40 year old is going to be 55, the 40 year old is also going to cross 60, so their population will increase, now this  There will be dependent population and there will be no one left anywhere. Till date, no country in the world has been able to reverse its fertility rate. In India, it is something like that, how can you talk about increasing the population of Kalpalayam, but this big elephant brother, once again below.  Gaya, it is not going to come up and at the rate it is going, there is concern there, now they are incentivizing that those who do not have two children, we will not let them contest the elections or they will do something like this. Look at what they have done in Korea, you can bring a nanny from a foreign country, you can do it like this, they will give you this, they will give you money inside Japan, the government will give money, just imagine, the government is giving money to give birth to children, so is India.  Immediately, according to me, the government should solve this problem. See my recommendation. I don't just come and cry and then go away. I talk about practical things and they are heard at very high levels. They are also implemented.  And I am happy and I am not under any misconception, so today I will tell you, if it happens then only you people will judge because like it happens earlier, even then you tell that if it has happened then it feels very good and the rest is YouTube and the rest is someone else.  And there is influence, there is some leader, brother, listen, someone is talking good, someone is giving good idea, someone is speaking logic, if you make that idea your own and spread it on a large level and take all his reputation and fame, then I will feel a little bad.  My [ __ ] clapping is your butt, there will be peace in my soul that whatever was said and heard will at least sleep well at night, so the idea is I am giving a clear cut, how the government has to now do it is okay. Otherwise, women have been de-incentivized to get married, to give birth to children, my demand is to increase the maternity leave from six months to a year. If only it should be increased in government jobs too, because the government is  You can immediately do it for your employee, there is no commotion in private, what will happen if she takes leave for one year, then how can the maternity leave be increased from six months to one year and the child care leave should be kept only for two years but in that  Sharing should be done with the husband also because these days many situations arise such that a woman's career is going great and she takes leave for child care and the child is 12 years old.  14 year old friend ca n't take his father, if he is also a government employee, he can also see, maybe his situation is such that he can take leave, because what do women say, why should I take it, why should I take it every time, then I want to take a career. Why should I travel, then it should also be given to the husband who is a single husband. What do you call a single husband? He is a single father. Sorry, how can a husband be single? It is okay for single fathers too.  It is good to get the opportunity of child care relief and so that the problems being faced in giving birth to children are removed so that children are born and the biggest sinner in that is the schools, these schools start charging fees at this much, one day you Will run out of children because people will not produce children only. Tumhare na ja raha hai, the biggest scam of schools, if it is in India then it is of education and private schools.  The builders keep complaining that the rates have increased so much. It is okay that they complain about the builder, but he robs the house once he builds it, he does not rob you every day, the fees here are like this, if you cannot buy a house worth Rs 2 crore, then you are not a disgrace.  If you do n't like it, don't buy it, buy something else, live on rent, but if you can't pay your child's school fees, then you feel humiliated, do n't you go and fight with the school people that you have made the fees so high, that school  one will say the other  Don't have a child. How many parents are there who are not having another child by saying that the fees for one are so much, I have become so tight, inflation is going on like this, I will not have a second child and those who are poor people go to expensive schools.  Those who do not even want to educate their children, perhaps there is no limit to them, they are giving birth to more children, that is why you see Bihar is the poorest state of India, UP is also poor, so children are being born there because they are  So there is no problem, right?  If the government gives them everything, then whichever state is higher but in terms of per capita income, like Karnataka, children are decreasing there, Andhra is decreasing, Tamil Nadu is decreasing because there we have to spend money to educate them, now that expenditure is tolerated.  Women are working, they are decreasing, so this is such a stupid thing, how can you incentivize poverty, we have to take care of the poor, but how can we celebrate poverty, the children of the poor are oppressed.  If you don't educate someone, what will happen in India? The one who becomes rich, the one who becomes poor, leaves the country, no, only 5-6 Hajj people are leaving, Guruji, there are not many millionaires, so many, oh brother, every 50 people are leaving.  5000 people are leaving the party worth Rs. 500 crores. The one with Rs. 50 crores also becomes Rs. 100 crores. His children too could have done well in India. He could have taken India forward. Only your best batsman should leave.  Then what will the rest of the team do? You send out one of your best bowlers and your best batsman and say, you will not play, you will play with the rest. Take out your best center forward in hockey, who is your best penalty corner specialist, and let the rest of the team play.  If you take it then where will you win SA country and the whole problem is this, the biggest waste is that the private schools have included it in the fees, the child is not eating enough food and the second one is that there is no money for food, the biggest hit is the school fees.  What cannot be afforded is the biggest issue. You all have to share this issue and raise it and in our country I am telling you that you will grow old before getting the demographic dividend. Young Young Young Young, no job, no job, no job, no marriage.  No, no marriage, no children, no children, then everyone will be old and so many old people will roam around. Now Nikhil Kamat ji, who did not buy a house, has typed it from someone from an old age home and has invested there because  Those who are smart are seeing what is going to happen, they are having one child instead of having two and those who are not marrying are not having even one child and there a different campaign of losers is being run in which I am a part of every  Every now and then I have to tell in the video that I have got 5 crore subscribers, Wisdom, Vivek, Consciousness, Marry only when the work is big, don't do it otherwise, and here, nature not only knows that the species that produces it, survives. This is what people with conscience and conscience keep roaming around with. Whom will they serve? There will be no society and there will be no Chunnu or Munnu, what Acharya Prashant ji says jokingly, brother, how will that work, no, you marry someone who will take you up like this.  I don't get to marry such average people, I have to marry an extremely average person, I have married an average person and have given birth to an average person, you keep waking up, we will manage with this, what song do you have to force, then it means Kishore.  Kumar and Lata Mangeshkar, I ca n't sing a song until it happens, oh the peace of my heart, I feel like singing a song, I don't want the voice of a teenager, brother, I don't have a mood, so what has happened, do n't sing.  Reach that level and not this level, friend, this is the life of an animal, yes, animals are also needed, not everyone can become gods, some animals are also needed, it is okay here, otherwise you will realize that we are no longer just animals, we have become animals.  I don't have any intelligence or discretion. Who checked us? Animals don't dream. If animals dream then someone checked. What might you have seen in your dreams? Do animals dream? These big narcissistic spiritual gurus have come a lot. I am not a practical man but I am down to earth. I am an astrologer, I have read all this book, all the scriptures, I have read all my books, I have read all my old Vedas, but I do not come here and shake off his superiority that you have read this chapter, I tell myself.  I am the most knowledgeable person, you listen to me, if there is no life left in life, then tell me these big things. These 5 crore subscribers are also someone's children. If they had not even given birth, then where would they come from? I will repeat this again and again.  I am saying this because the atmosphere has been set to not have children, marriages are not working, marriages are breaking up, girls are doing body count of 498, girls are becoming more and more, girls are like this, they are from Switzerland.  Girls do not come, I am telling all the male men that Can You Attract Females from Switzerland, Denmark and Finland, the girls there are good, they are very cultured, ours is a sinner here, we will not marry, so where will you go there?  Do it somewhere, if you get a good one, otherwise I will have to tell you many times Guruji, if you are marrying, will you marry a girl with high body count, it is a very personal question.  Will marry a girl with high body count see you will tract what you are and you have control over yourself only then become something that true person dozen come no mere ko to yahi takraw rahe hai kyun sari aise sari aise hota kya hai na woh black swan  Reading a book with events: Unless you have seen Black Swan, everything is white. It is something like this. If you have not seen Peacock, then everyone thinks that Peacock is there or everyone has it.  Peacock's wings would be like that because you have never seen it dancing, because it is not there in them, so until you have not seen anything, it is the same thing for you. The person who has never driven a cross-steering car, has never seen it for him.  It was the same but if you use sharing once, then the second one does not work, then it means that your reality is yours, the environment in which you are living, that is yours, the relationship course is also going to start in a very good way, if you enroll for it.  If you want to do it then write R  So brother, so much curiosity has been quenched with money, no one is going to do it for free, here I can put the basam for free, the thing that can be explained in 15 hours, 20 hours, cannot be explained in 20 minutes. This question is very interesting, are you married?  You will do this with a girl whose behavior is like this, you will do this, you will come and tell me, you will not get the answer of yes or no so quickly, you will be explained, you will be explained, your curiosity is quenched, if you want to satisfy it, then you have to spend time and money, now I understand, hey.  dude like this  You are also a robber, you don't tell it for free, it is a copy of Rs 50 and Rs 00, it is made up and so much knowledge is available in Rs 500, this much knowledge is available in Rs 500, so the knowledge of every Rs 50 is worth Rs 50, and that of Rs 500 is worth Rs 500.  If you try harder, then this fertility issue that I am telling you about in your life is going to be a big issue in India, getting a job 30 years from now, getting married, having two children is a matter of pride. Everyone was able to do whatever was seen in the middle class and life was going on very comfortably and we did not celebrate that life because it was like 'Ok hai yaar bicycle hai scooter aayi chalal Maruti 8 is aayi'  Life is going on nothing, achieving this thing today has become such a praiseworthy thing, if you catch a 30 year old boy today, ask him if he has got a job, if you catch him out of 100.  If 30 are not found, then out of the remaining 70, I am getting a job. I am getting married. No, I have n't found a girl or don't like her or am going to ask her. Then those who have got her are doing well, so many of them are doing well.  Those who are not doing well and those who are doing well are unable to have children, those who have done one and the other one is not doing so, then the percentage will be such that among these people, if you get married, you will get a job, you will get married, you will have two children.  gone and your marriage is not breaking up  And the matter is going well, these five things are happening, only 5 to 10 people will remain, the system system, everyone else is roaming like this, the stem is awakening, the intellect is awakening, the relationship is living in, this is living.  If he is living then this whole system is doing great work. Hey tell me one thing, if there are so many people doing great work, then I do n't know when the country will become great, the work is great, where is the bad work.  means to  The work is not that I should do something or have gone to do a great work, the world is the work, where is the main work, where does the work come from, the work comes only when the marriage takes place and the wife says, bring vegetables, before that, what is the work?  So mother will say, pick up aunt from the station and come, you will have to do the work, do it for your wife, do it for your mother or do it for your teacher, this is the system, you will leave who will leave an empty person, who will leave an empty person, come and do great work.  do our Join the organization, go around on a motorcycle, distribute leaflets, gather people and also tell them what a great work it is to go around on a motorcycle and distribute these copies and acquire complete knowledge. Is n't this the knowledge of Vedanta and then it is like this? Is it bad?  It is not bad, at least do the rest of the work and why do you take so much trouble in knowledge, if you have any knowledge then tell him or take money and tell him, say that as I am, I am a capital man, this is the knowledge, you will get this much in life.  Now there will be a change, if you paid money, if you did not have knowledge, then abuse, you looted, looted, looted, looter, robber, or get some knowledge in life. There is a need to discuss that knowledge so much that it is going on, do you know?  What is written in chapter number 100 and what is its meaning and what is the meaning of that verse? Before having children you will have to get married and do it and the marriage will not be with a great soul because the great soul is neither you nor does it exist in the ordinary way.  you are Get an ordinary girl, have ordinary children, live an ordinary life, this is ordinary, just doing four ordinary things will become extraordinary, okay, the rest of the people who are going to do extraordinary work are not getting anything extra from them, and ask, what have you uprooted, nothing extra, brother 42  45 years old, he is a loser, his hair has gone, his stomach has also become fat, his body has become fat, now you are no longer worth anyone of the opposite sex.  The gown case is not going to come from you, even the gown case is not going to come, so what is left now, you would have ordered it first, what work did you do, marriage is the pleasure of the body, yes, it is important to take the pleasure of the body, you got the pleasure of getting married, after that what did you do with the children, you are done.  That's what animals do. Yes, animals have done all the work and after having two children, the wife should educate her two children, reduce the school fees a little, have children, brothers, nothing else great is going to happen in India.  The biggest thing is population and recognize it.  Because if there is population, then some work will be done and I am not saying to increase the population, I am saying to control the rate of population decline, and that will have to be woken up today and suddenly you cannot bring that missing thing in Haryana.  In 1990, girls will be missing, there will be feticide, then the girl who was not born in Haryana in 95, 96, 97, 98 because she was killed in the womb, that girl will only be available for marriage in 2024. No, it is not available now, then the boys are roaming here, some are roaming in Jharkhand, some are roaming there, some are not found and are moving there, then this pension has to be started for those who are not married in Haryana for 45 years.  Why don't you kill all the wombs, I am taking the name of one state, those incidents have happened in Delhi also, Delhi's sex is also very bad, Chandigarh's is also very bad, Western UP is very bad, Punjab is also bad, only Haryana.  there is no sin in this  Then go back now in 2010-11, our girls will be less and a little better now, things have started to get better, in 5 years the tantrums of the girls will also be fine because the ratio will be fine, it is not like that, here I do not just tell the boys. Get married, have children, live an ordinary life, there is no shame in living an ordinary life, how can all the extra ordinary people live? If everyone becomes extra ordinary then they will remain ordinary only.  It will become ordinary, don't you understand what I am saying? If everyone has a car and no one is on a scooter, then what is the value of a car? Then people will ask about SUVs. If everyone has an SUV, then there is a small fee and for those people.  There will also be some separate sessions if you take membership. You can also take membership of this channel. Thank you very much subscribers, please increase it among your friends. This is a social issue which cannot be discussed.  I am not doing it because it does not suit me, it does not increase the vote bank, it is fine, but still we are social observers, we have to raise these issues, what do you people want to say, write on the comment section on this, thank you very much."

    "title": "Fighter Movie Review And Analysis ｜ Should You Watch It ？ [2G4DkHB3AKo].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, we will review the fighter movie, we will do a little analysis, there will be some take aways, we will also get to know some extra information, I don't think it is like this, YouTube's is okay, it won't be a wow movie great and must go, so I can do it as pragmatically, in detail and objectively as I can.  Will do that much if we start with what's they got right normally which is not expected with movies what's they got right dev got the body language right  Very very body language is absolutely suiting all the actors. Everyone is suiting. Dev got the uniform right. Dev got the minor details right. They got the lingo also mostly. It is right. Specially, the actors who are there are the ones who are their stars.  They are still from the Air Force, but the senior people brought by these people are from the senior Air Force and by the way, they also seem to be real. What happens normally in that?  These actors are brought, don't they, they look so loosely shaped, some of the work seems to be a joker, if you use a joker type word, they look like this at all, it is not in this, Siddharth Anand or whatever casting director is there.  Judge Got It Right: All the senior officers who are above Anil Kapoor, like Anil Kapoor is playing CO, Group Captain, the officers above him look decent, that means their acting is also right. And the body language is also good so that is one thing which is good villain movie ka villain movie ka amrit ke ke aaye hai, by the way in the movie the name is A but Rishabh Karke is the new boy I think he should go to those places the acting is quite good according to me  Very good body language, acting, action etc. are very good and even from Pakistani side, the generals of ISI etc., they have made it absolutely true, they wear nails and they are actors.  I don't know which one they took, they could not have done so much research, I think they are the same but they are looking exactly the same, so this is that way, it is a matter of praise for the movie that everybody and the commandos also take these which are Garuda commandos.  His body language drill etc. looks absolutely sharp, absolutely looks good, what is normal, that young man was roaming around in the picture as if he had a big belly and by doing like this then no one can do that. Man, nowhere will you feel that this is some fake thing, that is, it looks like yes, it is all fine. I would call the animation effects far from these rebel movies and the action is now shown in close quarters as shown. It's like a plane is made like this so the frame looks different that this is different and this is different, they do n't look the same and the plane doesn't even take off, I think the take off scene could have been taken with real planes, that too using a VF.  do the ship  They look different while standing on the ground. They look different in the air. Everyone knows that yes, it is used on everyone. As if you are the same thing, it is inevitable. Comparison and real shooting with Top Gun was real. That calculation was real in the plane, but that.  This is a picture of 250 crores, Top Gun was 1300-1400 crores, so the difference of the budget which is 17 crores is visible on the screen and that was also expected, one thing is a little more to me.  It seemed strange that Hrithik's character was done by Shamsher Pathania. If you look carefully at Hrithik, quite a lot of old age is visible from here, from here in the eyes, old age is visible from here, only then he is looking like he is older.  Skan leader is not looking for normally what is the age of Skan leader 27 28 years old become 27 28 ok most like if I am I think  Mostly I Should Not Be Rang, he should have at least been made Vin Commander which is visible in his age and Anil Kapoor is very fit for a 66 year old but then again he also becomes a Group Captain at 38 39 but I  I don't think that after seeing Anil Kapoor, I no longer feel that the acting done by Anil Kapoor is very good and should be replaced by some other actor, although the handling was the same.  The Aircraft Model Left Something A Lot To Be Desired I Think He Could Have Taught Them In A Better Way The Story Is Too Much Like This No, Above Balakot That Is More Of An Events Put Together Okay Above Balakot It Is Absolutely  Lot of details they have got it right in terms of whether the flights were flown from Gwalior and what all happened and how so they have got it infact a  Touching scene, what I felt was CRPF Kanwai's group talking to their families on mobile etc. before the blast and then the blast happens, it was like a little bit touching, that's fine and you know in a newspaper, we are the ones.  When we read the news, something has happened and there is a lot of difference in the way it is shown in actual. In the newspaper, it is not so much that the public gets to know about it, but somewhere or the other.  Then somewhere that movie which was tight in the first half, the movie Let Me Tell You was tight in the end, that is, reasonable things were happening with it, after that after the interval, the director did something stupid and did something too much, those Indian Air Force guys are like this. Gone like Fidan type, one after another, one after another, meaning ego type infact, if someone looks carefully, I don't know how many ships, meaning I don't think any pilot has become Indian Air Force's ship, what he has made in acting.  It's okay if you don't know, these 500,500, such expensive 600 crore ships were sailing like this, they were sailing as if you know Pichkariya and doing that disco disco type thing on Holi or Diwali, so I felt a little like that.  And from his side he was holding only two, okay, one is the villain with red eyes and one is his pilot with red nose. Instead of pilot, instead of red nose, I think his name should be black eyes. I don't think anyone from Pakistan Air Force would fly in a plane with kajal on, the way he is showing I don't know what they wanted to mean show it as for what ever. Okay, that was too much to stereotype her, so I'm like, she's got so much mascara on, and then it gets a little bit ridiculous, that plane you're talking about, I don't know which one you magically  You have caught hold of the channel and are talking to each other saying, \"Sir, we will leave, we will kill, we will take revenge.\" It becomes a little more funny at the end but it is okay, you can grant all these things in movies, you can show all the close combats.  In the class of aircraft like I and Su 30, they are firing guns at each other, that's fine, and they are firing missiles as if by means of means and flares, but on the heat seeking ones, normally radars have become active these days, but  Of course, if you hit the radar active one from a distance, then it will not be any fun in the movie, it is more correct and there is one thing in it by shafting, it is aluminum file type, you can call it very small pieces, even that will not be visible, flares are good to see.  Looks like but they are showing flares, it was looking very fake, I mean, VF is definitely more desired, it is the element of Air Force in which the training is shown. In between, like once she goes to the training academy, there too, I will address Deepika Padukone's character here, in Lady Carrots, it is also shown that if the girls want to do something, then I will tell here.  I would like the girls to become their own fighter pilots and right now training is going on in NDA too, then why would it be like to stop Deepika Padukone till the helicopter only?  Even girls became fighter pilots incidentally in Pakistan Air Force. If I am not the color most like, lady fighter pilots had become there before us too. So this barrier is done and dusted, now it is seen in the movies.  To show that something new is happening, my thoughts are not new, it has been many years now, so how many years have passed since independence, after 77 years of independence, girls are now  Celebrating that she is coming first, I think she has gone far beyond that. Indian Air Force has also gone far beyond that. As far as I have an idea of ​​the figures, I think there are 15 to 20 lady officers in our I think Air Force, which is a very good number.  After watching the movie, I think that there may be further increase in that number and it is a very good thing that girls are coming, incidentally there is a fighter controller, the girl who sits on the radar.  The surname also I think Agarwal Dev got it right so they have got a lot of things right in terms of minor detailing which was not so expected so it is good but in the end it becomes a little too far-fetched like the whole establishment of Pakistan in the movie. One Urwadi is controlling him, he gets a bit far-feasted, it's okay and he doesn't even die, I don't know if he is coming after eating nectar, he beats everyone. It's okay man, I'm not doing any major spoiler here and then at the end of The Way They Decide, the red nose guy's part about how he navigates the plane, that too was a bit funny, practice tickly, it's not possible, okay but then.  If he had not done so then the hero would not have been able to come down and engage in the fist fight, then that fantasy would have been too much of a fantasy. After the interval, the movie 'Other Wise' was going on tight and ended. I did not see much points in emotions and clapping, however, in Omus Mall, in which those directors cut that chair and it becomes like this, they are like us. In one hand, we have dal bhati churma in the other and we are clapping more.  No one was doing it, no one was doing it, because it was so full, I had seen the morning show, no, if you look at a normally full show, you would come to know that yes, how happy the audience is, it is not happening, but still like this.  Whistling movements did not come, such wow movements did not come, there was no such surprise element where surprise was visible, like if you compare with Top Gun, then when that ship comes to the end, a ship falls behind them and that.  The end is coming and finally then the plane flies away, then that guy comes, here an attempt has been made to create such a movement but it is already known, hence no spoiler.  That's exactly what I am trying to tell, an attempt has been made to do two-three such things, but then that is there, otherwise this director could not understand that he should go towards action. Jingo is not very much, in fact a character.  I liked it very much and you will see the scene of it, I will tell you about two or three characters, one character is of Emraan Hashmi, okay, he comes suddenly, he is also flying a plane, a big transport comes suddenly, he  Also, how did you like this suddenly come, so that role is good, Talat Aziz is playing the role of his father, it felt refreshing after seeing it, I think for the first time, I felt like this, there is complete emphasis in the casting, there is freshness in the casting, okay, then there is one in that.  He is an actor, I ca n't remember his name, now I will not tell whose agent he is, he is an agent, that is, an agent of a spy agency, he takes off some of his masks at the end, he looks very dangerous, that means his appearance is probably  He is seen only for 15-20 seconds but he seems to be completely into the role, which means I would give it to the casting person but he could not fit in that much, maybe these are such good fine actors, the acting is amazing, right, Deepika Padukone is totally her own.  In the uniform, she looks exactly like the one flying the flag, she is fine and it does n't seem like she is acting, she is completely confident, there is a body language, she has got that body.  The language is right, so that is good for the actors, but it is missing, still I am not able to give it too many stars, like they say, four stars out of five, five stars, three stars, so I do n't watch it anyway.  So should you go to watch a movie or not, I would say that you can postpone it, if there is some other important work in life then you can do it, you will not miss it too much and you can watch it somewhere later.  Yes, I mean, I don't go by giving a clear cut to him, but I mean, somewhere, you will not dislike it, I would like to tell two-three things here that in Indian movies, all the people kill their own people, they make martyrs martyrs.  We should learn something from Americans, Americans are so touchy, they do n't kill even in their movies, they don't kill much in real life, so accept it, forget killing, they do n't even let you go to the movies, so they force people to kill, isn't it?  To arouse emotion, you have to include a scene of a funeral where a brother is going there and his parents are old people. It would have been standard to include it and I have seen it in every movie. Now I feel that this should be avoided. Should means we can avoid it, meaning it is not necessary, it is also a fact of life, it also happens in life, but now I think about it so much because of the reason, I tell you brother, I feel like brother, people will not  Enjoy This Movie End Reason You are wrong to tell me which is right Main Reason When we go to the hall to watch a movie, the man wants to go to another world, it becomes dark, now he wants to hear some things like this, wants to see something which makes him  Refresh it or take it aside, now this much is happening in our real life, like Ram temple is fine, we are not speaking against anyone, but the environment has been created in such a way that it has come into our consciousness so much, it has come into everyday living. Already happened  Now go to the movie and turn feelingless, yes, according to me, it has been done now thanks to Akshay Kumar, I feel that it has been overdone, now this motion, as if it is now a flag. They are showing the flag outside the flag again and again from the helicopter. Hey, those helicopters are moving above them. The fans will enter into it. I mean, you cannot sit with the flag like this, the helicopter will suck it.  He will fall down, he is hanging like this, he is showing it like this, it means that some practicality could have also been shown, if the body language then it is very good, you people have seen that progress happens slowly, even movie people do it slowly.  Then overall I didn't enjoy it. Overall I didn't enjoy it because it's 24 hours, so WhatsApp is 2 hours long, I feel like I can't do it, then I'll do it, then it's like this, then yes, it will happen, then it's ok to suffer, and I suffer.  It will depend on the situation. How is one's opinion? Okay, but I feel that even in entertainment there is no entertainment. Many bomb blasts have happened, our forces have done a lot of good work and many late befitting replies have also been received.  Uri was made okay, it was a lot of fun at that time. Okay, now it is not the same fun as Uri was made at that time, whereas there is more action and money involved in it than Uri. Uri had a lower budget because it had a lower budget.  There was not much expense and water because there were no ships in it. Okay, so there is more expense and water in it. It is at a higher level and at the end, there is that feeling from within. Now just like it was in Uri by doing House the Josh in it, so it has House the Josh in it. If you watch the movie then you will know that it is a similar joke, it is not a very special joke but on the same, he himself is making a joke. Okay, so some how means I did not pass the test, which is called no end  I will not elaborate on its region even beyond this, I feel that this genre is over done now, it will have to be given a break of 2-4 or 10 years, now India will move forward a little and do some different things, if you take a pause on this movie,  Now, as if they were showing me the station, the trees were looking big, the trees were big, it was not like it was Srinagar, it was as if a shooting had taken place somewhere in the North East, now that can look carefully  He can tell which station of North East is his and which station was that and if you do the trick then you will probably come to know that perhaps the shooting took place there too. Actually, it is fine, so it has been generated by a lot of AI.  The area is fine because those who have landed in Srinagar, there is an airport in Srinagar, it is the same airport, which is the same, it does not look like what they have shown, it is not like this, which is okay, I think, maybe from the security point of view. Even if it doesn't, it will have to be shown, but overall there is no wow in the movie, you can't dislike it because the effort has been put in, everyone is looking smart in the uniform, they have got it right, the emotions are also good and there is a lot of Jingoism in the first half.  Nothing happened, the first half was quite nice. I would say that if I felt that the first half could have been taken a little higher, like there was promise in the first half, if the second half was somehow better.  If we had taken it under the story line, it would have been a different matter, that on the Pakistani side, they have kept that boy who is getting all the work done, he is the same villain in all the scenes, he does not spare any money and secondly, he has another red nose.  Is that the person wearing kajal, his kajal looks like it will enter into the eyes, it is okay and the kajal is visible because here, if you apply a mask, then how much space is visible, if you apply it like this, then the eyes are visible. Lampblack  He is sitting wearing a mask, it is okay if he sweats a little, it is okay if it gets inside his eyes, okay, so that was a little comedy and then he has made us fight with the fighter pilots and mostly the people of India are more beaten up.  They were staying the same and all the ships were bursting and the way they were conducting in the last half, please send reinforcements, I was not able to understand what they were doing, they have to take one man and so many others in his wake.  How to make others do such things, it did n't seem like there was any control, meaning in this way, she seemed to be a little bit torn, you can't send a ship like this, a ship can't go like this, there was a little desire of mine from inside.  Look, Suko, I have shown that the real evolved ship was its fighter in shooting down the F16, which I would call a real fighter because one person sits in it, okay, many people get troubled by it, but no problem, okay.  If yes then they should have shown a clip of MiG 21 somewhere of 20 30 50 seconds because now we will not get to see it. After next year I think they will retire from the world, they have already retired everywhere. I think ours  From here too, next year my thoughts will go to 2025, so if once we had shown something for 40, 50, 60 seconds, then it would have created some memories of that ship forever for him too.  Farewell happens because that aircraft was evolved that aircraft was evolved in the actual which you know happened in F16 shooting and all that and that's it shows comedy to Pakistanis which I think is not a good thing, according to me it is fine Because you show anime like this, you can't show idiots like this, ok according to me, their general does those things right, he is speaking in Punjabi, hey hey  What have you done, people do it like this, I will not spoil it, I found the best scene of him speaking and then he comes to listen, there is one scene in it but that one is completely Punjabi.  He gets it right. He gets the accent right. He gets it again, the body language, the attitude and face. I am saying that no one should give him any other award for this. Whatever Filmfare Award he gets, National Award too.  Must have been given for casting. Yes, where did you get all those people from where they are traitors? Well, that one, in the end, I told you that the spy who turns out to be a very good person, I do n't know, if I am not Rang Narayanan then No, who was a good actor before, if I am not my color, I have not checked further, it is okay to see him, he looks like this, he looks right, I felt it very right, he felt very right, his general of ISI seemed right.  villain  I also liked the role of And Apne Ya Apne Hrithik Roshan's acting, you can't fault Hrithik Roshan in anything, what ever was expected of him and expected of him, judge did it this thing very nicely, that after credit song also comes which is also That money means a little bit of recovery, if someone has a little bit, then it will be from him, it is okay, so it is a watchable movie, giving it a lot of time, taking out time for winter, so whatever I want.  I have subscribers and I do it with great responsibility. People say, 'Hey, you have seen everything and then come to us. Hey, I am seeing it for you all. Then why do you spend your time? You refuse us. Hey, I am.'  I earn money even by doing this, so I am I, my tummy is mine, my tummy is mine and the road is also fine, whatever happens in between, don't get it, why are you looking at us, then there will be no loss, I know this much.  Because if it is absolutely good  Like I told people to go and see in Samam Mainak Hall and people who came after seeing thanked me a lot, so my reviews are going very well, the ending of the movies is quite balanced, a lot of detailing is going on in the movie, I feel.  That we should take a pause for a few days and not remove the atmosphere that I was trying to create, which I also thought would probably happen, it would not happen, there would be something political about it, that too, I will make a video for you.  Would you like that we stand on 25th January now one Apna Ram Mandir 22nd January, that event has already happened, 25th January has already happened, so what is the fuss, is it as much as you were thinking or will another picture come on 14th February?  Or will someone else come and the atmosphere will continue to be like this, so I feel that this is the last election. Well, I will tell you later, otherwise it will be like an election, we will leave the review for now, it will not be like that.  Pai Na was not able to go towards movies, he too has got some realization, he has got feedback, people like us must have given, at least someone must have given that friend, keep this thing to a minimum because the taste of the public is changing a little, so give it. Corrected it that way, you won't get the over-gist, you won't get much of the jingo stick that it seemed from the trailer, you won't get the same as it seemed from the trailer, but Despina is saying that man, now it will be coming, aap har  The rest of the place is outside the hall as well as inside the hall. Now people want to go there in the fantasy world. May Be That and the South Indian movies are doing well because they have nothing to do with real life and people just want to.  You know go and enjoy that only I feel like this. How do you guys feel? Let us know by sharing the review, liking, subscribing to the channel and if you want those videos, you can read Current Political in two.  I felt that a lot of efforts were being made for the event but how much benefit was not achieved. What is the current status. Beyond that, I will make it very well. Thank you very much."

    "title": "Focus Needs To Shift From Kisan To Others [oKdMcC0x0_0].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today a country de Fox needs you to shift from this, I will tell you which drip is there and where Fox should shift, where it should be, I will also tell you that thing, politicians can never make it on social media, they can never come to this.  I don't want to discuss it further because there would be a lot of issues in doing so, but still I have brought it. If you people are into agri, then write in the comment area. There is too much focus on village dwellers and farmers. As long as there is Fox on them, the country will not be able to move forward Fox because because they are sitting with votes, the key to power is in their hands and today I am going to tell some truth tomorrow, people who live in villages will be pained to hear this.  Is it true that nothing ever happens in the power of everyone? No, we should never say anything in the power of everyone, all the politicians, all the businessmen, all the film stars, all the middle class, all the government employees, this is not even there, but you have to see that in India there are so many people who When he is in the village, there is fun in the village.  If he doesn't come, then what is the reason that he lives so much, why doesn't he come among the lions, if his income is so much then many people are sitting on the property, his brothers in the village who were hard-working were trying to do something, he could see this de sense.  There is nothing to be extracted from farming, only half an acre has been reduced and they have been taken out, whether they go out to work as laborers, whether they are employed as lower class employees, whether they are employed in government, whether they are doing Sugi, Zomato, or they are doing anything, the hardworking people are there.  There is no salary, but there are many people who are left behind, especially those whose brothers were fired by the government and who went abroad. This is a relief from the story of occupying their land. It will be painful to hear, I know it is very controversial but this  One paan because these people are less in conflict management and all these issues, I am seeing this daily in consultation, it is a greed, they also know about living but now they have got water there also.  The saree of the government has gone, their facilities have come, it is a relief to squeeze everything and everywhere else they get pampering, they get the same heart from politics, they also get the feeling of brotherhood, they keep it as their own that yes brother, this is a village.  This is village Guhan, many people are living in this kind of feeling and Sir Fox, productivity is above them, some of them have nothing in GDP, if you look at agriculture.  Even 10-15% does not contribute to the entire GDP and 60, 70, 80% of the people are bribed. In this, you tell me about his condition, someone's condition is bad and the person is running by giving his hand, he is giving his mind and hunger is not there.  If it is going towards suicide, then brother, before that, something else can be done because of this, what is there in store, suicide is happening everywhere in all the stables. Has anyone ever asked that in the last year? How many farmers are ahead in committing suicide, how many A percentage, how many film stars, how many TV stars are there and how many N percentage are ahead of them, how many government employees and their percentage, and within the quota, these children are doing it, which is more masala serious.  Is it for India or will farmers continue to be farmers because it is vote bank politics? That Jawan picture also because it has become such a super hit, so where people belong to, they have become farmers, there they have made Punjab into Haryana.  which we  So I have n't seen or heard anyone here, are all the farmers the same, do they all have the same condition or not? So this is something that needs you to be called, they just say, rich farmers and save income tax, no no, I am rich. He is not even talking, whatever he is, it is so much, someone sits on YouTube asking for Rs. 111500 crores, take it, take it, hey, you too do this, friend, you also become a farmer, then this is so much.  Yes, you have to live on tax, take the land, you also take income tax, 1000-1500 crores, the bank which came on the last date is not there, there is no salt, this is not an issue of Richmer, this note is de issue, issue is of de pur harmer who  This is how someone has become a rich farmer and has earned Rs. 1500 crores. What a child, what has he done, has done this, has done this, this issue has gone to the note, this is always what is made an issue by the politicians.  He has become a farmer, he has become a farmer, he has made Rs 1500, therefore, it is not the farmer's, it is the poor pharma who is selling pesticides, who is opening bottles of medicine, who is speaking poison, that poor, that poor, he is also a scoundrel and before this he trolled me.  Do this to me, you say something like this, I am also a farmer, what is a farmer, the one who has connection with banana village, farming is big, now those who go and grow crops every day, even these farmers are not doing it, these laborers also come from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.  From  Okay, so according to him, I am also a farmer. If I go for five days, I also work in the fields. Now it is not necessary for me to give that photograph. I am telling you, so you understand that I am also a farmer and I am telling you this thing.  Earlier it used to be like this, brother, this wheat belongs to the family, do not put it in this field, when that also ended, then to what level has the poison penetrated into the farmer, first people and good enough, intelligent enough.  that he can do it in the fields that belong to him.  We used to think that we will do it in others, now not even that, now we will poison ourselves, we will poison the world and there will always be crying everywhere, hey, you don't know how much life is left, I know how tough it is and if so much.  If it is tough, then why are you doing it for us? No, they are doing it for us. No one does anything for anyone. No one does anything for anyone. He has only one choice. His mother is taking care of him. They are keeping him in a system. He is in his house and the one behind the house.  It was a cousin, he left it and went away, that 200 rupees would be his property because no one is coming to the village to claim it, I do n't have any idea about the physical property of the one who is in possession of it, he started asking for a buffalo, then he Started keeping the tractor, then it will belong to him and then he will say brother, this is mine, if it does n't happen like this then he should have come, then brother, you will come again and again, take the selling night, don't do it like this and then he can't do anything, whatever people do.  Come  We live in Haryana and you must know what Jitwara is and the land belonging to someone else, his land below so and so, this one, that one, you do n't even know what are the land holdings, a little here, a little there, a little there, the one who went to the city and the one who went to the village.  All the people will stay in the real world, I will stay in the village, brother, I am coming to us, yes, I have left this region and they are not getting any benefit from it, no tycoon is being made by staying in the village, but that is useless.  Greed is useless, lethargy is useless, laziness is useless and there is no passion. These are the people who get irritated with the city dwellers. The villagers and people like me will also say, 'Brother, I was sitting in a circle and talking in Gurgaon. Leader, big generation is at fault, not one but two.'  No, you are a rich place, the whole of India was a village, my generation too was a village, the next generation is a village, it is a mistake, they struggle like this, then slowly In the year 20-3050, the human story is set in the city, it is not so easy but these people do not have the passion, Armatization, Haj is happening and urban is pure, but Fox should go and it is lower class, urban is lower middle class, then let's go middle. They don't even ask about class number, they come from lower class, they live in unhygienic conditions, they do n't have any, everyone is pampered, everyone goes to the village and there is a truth about the village too.  And let me tell you, take the example of Mumbai, take the example of Delhi, the population of a big city is not the same from Assembly seats and Lok Sabha seats as it was earlier in the villages. But still in their delimitation exercise manner, brother, if our country is 144 crore and we have 50043 543 seats, then it will be according to some logic, is n't it?  This area of ​​geography will also be seen. Now the villages of the people are becoming empty but their Chaudhar and vote bank is full because the person who picked up and went 500-1000 km from there is not coming to vote, hence he was not asked.  Now they are roaming around in Gurgaon, I don't know, many people from Bengal side and other side and from Bihar side, now perhaps they do not go to vote and if they go then they do not vote here, so it has not been asked here.  to the country  He is keeping all the votes from here, then go and ask him. If he asks, then he will go to Bihar and Bengal and if he is giving then will he do anything about it, will he sit here and there, his villagers will have papad, there will be papad for the villagers.  Aarti is being performed. Who is doing it in Bihar and Bengal? Who has shown the courage to give up the courage and come and struggle to reach the story of life and he enters into the tax paying circle, in the village no one pays even ₹ 1 tax.  If as in the city  You struggle, start from 20-30 thousand, start from 40 50 60 70 80 thousand, if your salary wants to increase or your business gets less, then you and pink tax are given by the government, you are the one who needs you to be focused on debt by the politicians and this.  These are my subscribers who are educated, I belong to the intellectual era, this is what we have to talk about, we have to speak further, no, this is not the village.  Note something that they have, you are a fox, you are a field candidate. If this many generations have not yet come out and everyone will come out, then who will cook? Who cooks in America? America has only 4% population. There are 35 crore people in America too. 60% of the population is engaged in cooking their food, 21 crores are engaged in cooking their food, do you really think that if half an acre is bought by a ticket, then that is disease employment.  One acre, two men retire and there are 6 people hanging on it and everyone works less by two hours, then the tax people are disguised as employees, they think we are working less but it is not required and it is this that you should be called doubt.  And in North India, I am telling you what I can see. In North India, no one's child has been taken out by a farmer, everyone has taken a mobile phone, no one is doing anything, everybody is roaming.  On mobile in hand, the one who will come to the city, still has 20-30 work in the village, otherwise he has no chaman, otherwise there will be people in the village, you will not move out, then who will do the farming? You go, their agent, do some nonsense, go to Gujarat and see that all this is going well there, no land has to be sold to anyone, this much is so much in between, you have maintained that division of 25% land.  Caste should end, do yours, do yours, friend, you are their agent, you can say whatever you want, you will be someone's agent, I am an agent of logic and an agent of progress, this is my claim, you have to make someone whose agent you want to make, they will make it.  Stay, she doesn't have anyone else, okay, she will continue to be a public, you have to see that people in the village are lethargic, lazy, oh no, no one wakes up in the morning, I do n't know the story of 50 years ago, a Sunni woman used to pick up, open the vagina, she was a caste.  You used to take Barota, now go and do the latest one, tell me, no, will you still have it? Yes, Maa Lia, this is yours, this is that in Vidarbha region, there are 6 lakh villages, Chhaila village, all the places in India mean this much, go and see lazy punks lying in the cot and smoking hookah.  Yes brother, it's done, this time brother started doing his party from morning to evening, again that is against the pension, pension above 60 years is ₹ 6000, don't know if we will give so much six, we will give five, yes, that same man pension.  If pension is received then it is okay to die then it is cancelled, live till 99, they will keep giving pension, they will keep reducing donkeys in the city, villagers and someone else will come and say something, don't say anything to the farmer, brother farmer, all farmers, anyone, buy one acre of land, buy it 10 15  Lakh rupees ₹ 5 lakh 8 lakh boxes are lying at many places, you also become a farmer, there is a power in qualification [music] GDP is a big power, upside down, when it is written further, first less was written, then bigger was given.  That everyone should get old age pension soon, that old age pension, old age pension and on top of this all this vote bank politics is going on, this one should give old age pension, this one should give it, she should give it because they would have got all the ticks otherwise they would not have come to the city.  It has become your family identity card, it has become this card, it cannot be because this is your income, you run away from saree subsidy, you mostly come to the city, you will get saree in village, you will get it in life long, stay there.  The government will also keep giving, this will also keep looking, they will also keep giving and keep roaming and then remain poor and take Aadhaar hospitality too, Aadhaar people too, we are farmers, the support of farmers is getting so bad like this, hey brother, I will tell you if  Are you in any profession? Big business is happening with you in corporate. Bill you bill you tree you do something. Politician has to get votes and he is easy to get votes from lazy people. Easy is a hard working man.  You will have to impress someone by doing something to make them understand what is happening in the village. Throw money for just one minute and do this 22 times till the last and this is a lot of politics. Those who gap the whole day and do a card fighting, everyone goes to Mukkad 10-10.  Ladies will still be seen doing less. You have such a big situation and North India has a very big situation. Okay, we will discuss the South separately sometime. Let us know about the idea there too, but right now I am very North Indian in the audience. Ladies, you will still be seen doing less during the day. I have left the man's world and one half of the peon is gone, the teacher is gone, the master is gone, he is managing bananas even yesterday and is also a husband in a government job and wants all the system.  He wants to set up the system from here also. He has set up the job, he has set up the exchange, he has set up in the village too, he has given bread to the buffalo, given it empty milk, then sent him back and everything is in order.  taking it and her on  And sympathy is also coming and resources are available to him, he is getting everything, there is a government job in his family, there is Buddha pension in the family, this pension is also there in the family, this facility is dispensed and he is not left short and there is relief nearby that he is spreading.  He was from Geetwade, he can do a little bit, he can make it a wall, he has made Mahesh's band free, he has also kept constipation, this is a miserable life and this is the biggest reason for India's progress not happening here. And only a particular level of people who consolidate their holdings and do good agriculture, do not do lazy agriculture, will raise songs where water does not come and then export, then this India is exporting water, this someone asked this rice in Punjab Haryana  Where do they grow? Why do they grow? Brother, this is a rice-eating belt. Do you keep adding so much water to the rice? You don't even make anything else because you are lazy. You are like Israel.  Why didn't the fruits and vegetables and flowers and all these things come because I feel stressed as to who should do, who will be there, who will go, who will stand here, do this brother, do this, do that, you used to be rich 200 years ago, there will be controversy, in the same way everything will seem less.  We are doing it because we don't want to reduce others, there is no greatness in it, someone should tell this to the electrician, the electricity goes out, even to the mill poisoner, you can tell everyone the data, instead of the groceries, the brother comes and the one who does the sewerage.  The network runs among the lions and among the lions there are so many struggles. Among the lions, there is the struggle of the everyday man. The struggle of the village seems to be bigger. You see, I am less, all these people go here and here see what is happening in the city.  The lower class of the city needs the support of the government and Fox is not there because there is no vote, it is just a simple thing and hence they do not feel that those resources are theirs, then if the government supports them there then it will go up because the life  Whenever I do too much of one thing, it will always be bad. From this side to that side, a different video will be made. Son, if you do everything here, then it is a different stream and that is a different example and you will enjoy that too if you  If you want, please share and like these videos. Thank you."

    "title": "Forget Sandeep Maheshwari And Vivek Bindra ： Know The Real Scam Ongoing In India [hpIGZ2R_lFE].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, you already know the Sandeep Maheshwari Vivek Bindra controversy, but where it is the real scam, we will analyze it, there will be a little higher order video, you guys will watch it and tell me whether it was fun or not, there was some understanding and this is the one in which I will raise the issue.  You also please spread it a little, I will not say much on Sandeep Maheshwari Vivek Vindra, I will try to quickly go to the real scam which according to me is the real scam and it  No one is asking, Sandeep Maheshwari accused Vivek Bindra directly, then indirectly, in the beginning, then directly, if he sends any course etc., then I am not coming here to defend Vivek Bindra much, but I am coming to tell you that you both should see this.  There are 5 crore plus uter subscribers among them, 5 crore which form a big part of the youth. Secondly, it is the motivation gurus who are fighting and spreading negativity.  Specially, if seen in this case, Sandeep Maheshwari himself says in his motivation lecture that one should not go on negativity, do your work, move ahead, do like this, do like that and now you can see the difference between words and actions, that is one. Why don't you stand, this is Vivek Bindra, you are silently doing your work, you support Vivek Bindra, you are sold, first you have to watch the whole video, Vivek Bindra has bought you, this is not a Good thing without knowing Vivek Bindra Networth and My Networth Worth He has bought me Who can buy whom Who is checking whose balance sheet Everyone is checking Okay so first before accusing because it happens This is why I said that this channel is for everyone  This is not the mistake Vivek Bindra made, that course is not for everyone, it is not told, it cannot be good for many poor people if they are given something which they do not understand.  It can increase if Stanford offers Harvard courses and gives huge fees to those who pass the entrance exam there and when they become a person, if they give it to someone for Rs 15,000, I am not at all saying here that the standard of their courses is anywhere near that.  I am not saying that as an example, if they also give it or I take the example of India, I will go to IM Ahmedabad for two years and after going there for two years, I will do whatever.  If I condense the knowledge gained somewhere and give it to someone for Rs 15000, then he will not understand it, it will not be of any benefit to his life, but all these institutes test you that if a person of this caliber comes, then only he will be given this knowledge.  He will understand this and he will also pay such a huge fee for this, the quality of the course of Vivek Bindra ji is not being talked about, there is a lamentation that no one could earn money from that course and the way those videos are shown.  It is as if the rickshaw puller has sold people, it is a woman saying that I have given the jewelery and have come, looking at that very thing they are feeling that someone will say that they are classist, they are racist, I don't know what English terms will come but brother that is the same.  Big needs to tell friend, who has given this to them, brother, where will this benefit come from? Madam, it seems as if it is not going to be of any benefit to you, that course was not for you, but whatever happened to you, is it like that of the people below?  It spread in the eco system, no one opened the course, did not read it, started sending it to each other, no one was to benefit, so miss selling is definitely wrong target audience and the second biggest mistake that Vivek Bindra did and which anyone ever did.  You should not return the money. There should be no point in returning the money. The moment reason joins you with the intention that the money will be returned. Then that brother will accept the money and will accept it only after taking the money. This is the refund policy.  There should not be any risk, it should be straightforward, you don't know what it is, you do n't know what will happen, so from this I come to know that where is the real scam, you will know there because no one opens the mouth there and be like them and who is that.  Indian Education System, Schools and Colleges, why is this situation so bad that people said this 10 day MBA, 10 day MBA, that 10 day MBA is not possible, then by doing my business associate, he said, this is your business.  If it is not a Master of Business Administration, then it is my Business Associate, so he is doing something smartly, but it is also a requirement for people like Vivek Bindra, there is a requirement for those people who have 93, 94, 96 percentile in IM. Those whose 99 pages did not yield anything, but this is definitely not for those who do not know what this terminology is.  And IQ is analytical skills, math skills are, communication skills are comprehension, these are the basic things which are tested like whenever you give any MBA exam or CAT exam, your [ __ ] is tested.  Your English is tested, your Maths is tested and then you get a rank from it and then you are selected. Just use the word to a poor person while walking on a random road.  I will tell those who do not have money, take this course, do this, then you have made Multilevel Marketing a chit fund scam. I think the best thing is that take this course, take that, the way the system is.  So there has been a lot of loss here and no one questions the education system as to why the condition of the children is so bad because what is there in education, why are there schools left, no one is getting a job after studying them, nor are they getting a college.  But why can't parents go to school and college and do higher education because first they do your admission in such big cities so that our child gets higher admission, then you will pay the fees, then they will give you homework, get you tested, declare you worthless. Your marks will be less and you will not be able to say anything to them and you will have to pay fees every time and as soon as you open your mouth they will say that your child is worthless, you are worthless, you have no brain, say make a competition, every school can do less.  And from the fact that one of our children also passed out from IIT after completing 12th A B C D E F he becomes the poster boy of some school. Now if someone from all the schools there says to us, the children say return our money, ours has not gone to the IAS people.  Also, they never claim that everyone will become IS and we will give refunds. Somewhere if you say this business of refund, everyone will be ruined. What happened because of this, that a good knowledge could have been given at a cheap price and it could have benefited some people.  which and  We deserve in life, the ultimate good in life will be of the one who deserves it, not of the one who has taken this empty thing like a pill of Vitamin B12 and D, that it will definitely increase, that now I have taken this course.  Took the course, don't watch it after opening it. What to do after opening the course? Hey brother, now I am telling you a simple thing. I have just watched three-four episodes of Vivek Bindra's 10 Day MBA. I liked it very much. It is free.  That Sandeep Maheshwari, apart from crying, write down what is RR, except doing RR, he doesn't do anything, all those subscribers and we are with him, we are against him, he is against, at least learn the same.  Vivek Bindra's fire against Holi, his wife 's Holia, Holia is still standing, next is everything against him, Ali is still standing and is coming again and again  So at least see who has more positivity. Again I am not defending Vivek Bandra. There were 100 holes in his business model. The next one should cover it. The next one will do it. Will not do it. The guy has fallen down but after falling down he is getting up again and that.  Sandeep Maheshwari is getting the same reason for teasing, no video has been posted for 1012 days, not even two lakh views of Sandeep Maheshwari come above 3 lakh.  Other than that, Vivek Bindra's standard of controversial videos is 15 lakh 16 lakh. Whatever videos he is posting, these MBA people are teaching him, the views of the one and a half and one and a half and two hour videos are 5 10 15. Minutes of videos are not available and the scam is actually neither his nor hers because I am not ready to accept this. Brothers and sisters, India is our country where we even buy tomatoes after seeing them like this.  Are you not rotten? Are you not bad? You are taking a course worth Rs 50,000 here, no such fool, he is taking it out of greed, he is taking you out of greed, let's accept the fault of the one who gave it to you, give some percentage but you are in this grade.  If you come, it cannot be the fault of the next one. You were given a miss sale, which is called no, you were not fooled, you were a fool, your stupidity is being taken advantage of. In the tenth line, I am saying that I am following Vivek Bindra's business model and what is the problem below it, when you want to expand quickly, do not want to grow organically, you are repeatedly saying that my content is good, I am happy.  Young says, 'This is good, that is good, I have brought this star, I have brought this star, that the billionaire likes, that is fine, I have accepted it, but the actions of the employees under you. Any normal person would ask if someone has an IQ of just two paisa, there are 200-300 employees below him, they sell these courses, they audit, they edit, they animate, they do all this, why not just attend this course and earn 20 lakhs?  Why are you taking ₹ 40000 for Hajj job? No one would have thought this or asked or no one had the brain to do this. Basically, accept that I am selling my course.  Below are the employees, what is their salary, it is in this range of 15000, 200, 250, 30, 40 and I am saying that these magic pots that they are holding are my employees because they do not have access to the back end of all the content. And he handles all the things and creates half of the content, whitewashes it, shows animations, presentations and songs in it.  Gune, whatever music background, whatever effects, etc., all of them have got access to that content. This brother, why doesn't he make these 200, he is selling this course, then it should be understood that it is definitely beneficial but he is not such a magician.  If I were a magician then that magic would happen to those who are selling it. If I am selling something that will make you steely then I am selling it to my employees. All my employees should look strong, right? First of all, see for yourself what kind of body they have and what they are selling, they are keeping all the Sakhu wrestlers and we are selling the goods, which means you don't know what it will make, then look scam scam.  Before doing this, you should apply your brain and wisdom a little bit. Education system is the biggest scam and we just can't call it out. Your government also can't do anything. They say, read this.  Given and actually the fact is the access to that education should not be available to everybody since it is available it has to be made available to everybody, its quality goes down. If the quality goes down then that degree is written on which paper of yours.  It is not worth it, it is so much student loan, students study by taking loan, higher education in America is so expensive because they say brother, all this  Not everyone is worthy, there is no need for so many people with higher education, not all of you are worthy that if all of you come here to Stanford in the Ivy League, then you will have to pay the fees, no more than the brother who will give the money or pass the test or take the scholarship.  That is because the one who has money has the default intelligence, people are killed by saying that all these things are good, political correctness that only the rich are intelligent, the child of the poor will never become anything, this is political.  Correctness is achieved, a poor child will pass the exam where the government has to take it, something has to be done and if he can pass the exam here then he will go here too, I am left and will pass somewhere else, but a poor child who cannot clear any exam is a us.  They catch the child of a poor person, they catch him that no one can take any exam and the child of a rich person, he does not need to take any exam, Mukesh Ambani ji's children do not go competitive, right? They go anywhere to give exams, in big schools, in big colleges, they have more exposure, so by default, they will be more intelligent than this poor child, by default, only on this matter, because he is the child of a rich person, only on this matter, what about the child of the poor?  A child may be more intelligent than a rich child, it may be off course, but we are taking such a case that 99.9 percent of the children of the poor are not taking any exam, because even those who are not able to take the exam.  The ratio is, you know that 99 plus percentage will fail and less will pass. If we consider all the poor then even the poor are not getting 99, so what is the problem in speaking, understanding and saying this thing, brother.  Someone starts teaching you some very strong English and your basic English is not good, you don't know anything basic and someone sells you a course, someone starts selling you future options courses.  You start using so many difficult terms inside stock market trading and you don't know what is Sher, what is face value, what is book value, what is Pawa, what is your cash flow, how to see the statement, returns.  What is the difference between return on equity and return on capital employed? What is dividend yield and how are balance sheets viewed? If you don't know why, then jump straight in and say, brother, this telegram is here.  There is definitely a seller but brother, you don't understand that when you do n't know how to ride a bicycle and the next person is saying that you can ride a bicycle while standing on the bicycle seat, then you are not able to understand that this is not possible for me.  So I don't know how to ride a bicycle. If I know how to ride a bicycle, I know it very well, then maybe I will ride it without leaving my hands. People ride bicycles even without their hands. Have you seen that hands do things like this and I don't know how a bicycle moves like this?  If you balance your mental condition then everything will be fine for everyone.  It is not necessary to ride with your hands left aside. Those who do not know how to ride a bicycle are special. The one who jumps and dives from the top in the swimming pool is a great artistry, but he must know swimming because even if you do not know swimming and diving from such a high place and you  You know that whenever I hit you, I will go far below the water level, so what confidence will you have, then there is a mistake in explaining this, quality content was sold and then it seemed that this IBC should make IBC and this is 500 thousand crores.  If it happens quickly then that thing was bound to happen and there is no limit to the fact that it was supposed to happen, now it has happened, let Sandeep Maheshwari ji dedicate his life to destroy Vivek Bindra ji. For the motivation of both of them, Guru Bhaiya, calm down, the court has said, now do not post each other's videos because you are worth five crores, the court is intelligent, the court knows that these five crore people will be made to cry.  They will confuse you and it is the job of the children to get confused because they are not that confused, then why are they going to take injections of motivation? Have they got the morning dose? Have they got the evening dose of motivation because the education system has failed them and  That is the real scam and no one has the courage to say or do this. Give our money, take it back from the college to which you gave 20 lakhs and yours 400.  If you don't get a job, take it because he will say, yes, my dear child has been placed, if there is any fault in your child, then start believing the same thing, many people are making a video like I am making a video like this or someone else like me.  There is a video on the channel which I make as a very knowledgeable type in my life, that Higher Order Thinking and many people enjoy it and many people also abuse in it, so that is the same video which has been said.  many people positively  It influences them, they get to learn something, they understand something, many do not, it is as simple as that, so the biggest mistake in this is to say that a consumable item will be refunded if I say eat pav bhaji.  If you do n't take the test, then return the money. Brother, this India is such a poor country and there is so much poverty in India and there are so many poor people and I don't want to use the word further. If not two or three, then that will happen. Brother of the controversy, he will definitely ask for the money back because he said that the business they are doing is crazy butch, he is saying pav baazi is not tasty, I will get the money back and then I will eat that nice vegetable biryani during lunch, he will also say money.  If it is good, then take the money, then I will eat three meals a day for Rs. I am in this, no one in India cares whether it was tasty or good, or less good, he enjoyed it or not. You said Lal Singh Chadda tell me if you don't like the movie then take the money back or take it from papa or donkey, whoever did n't enjoy it, brother, I didn't enjoy it, what kind of dinky dinky were you doing, take the ticket of Rs 400,500.  Lee, who gives the money, it is not returned yet, I did not enjoy it, there are things like consumer power which give you such things as if there is a warranty guarantee on the car, then the warranty guarantee runs there too, if any fault is found in the car, then the manufacturer.  He will say that I will change this thing and the car, no one changes the money, no one gives the money back and now people have to understand that the clauses will be like this, you have to take it, you don't have to take it, but it is very correct in this.  There are people who can't even go to MBA and are able to give presentation in the same way. One person is teaching some things for free and some is teaching for money, so many people have that much money to spend on that thing. May all children be poor today  Yes, you are a very poor child, you are roaming around with a phone worth Rs. 30 30 20 20 15 20 thousand, then if you go beyond that, do some education and spend some money and yes, there may be cheating in it, but cheating is not all cheating, there is learning and  There should be a review system where you put it, you say, this course did not help, then the next person will say, brother, did you do what was told in this course or did you not do it, someone comes and tells you that this  This is a diet of nutrition, it is of 1200 calories, you eat like this, I told you to take diet benefit from you, what diet did you follow, did you eat that 1200 calories, it is not that you also ate 1200 calories, after that you also ate shortbread.  And then you ate samosas and jalebi too, then diet will not work, how is that mechanism to check, schools are very strict there.  People go to school, come to school, give your marks and say, you are already at 60, at 80, at 70, at least you are less, so if all these things are being made to fail, then the Indian education system is failing because Indian education.  How the system is failing Not that the Indian education system may not be good but it cannot be without money unless you say that every body should get an access to higher education that  The person has to deserve you just can't go to higher education institution because you want to go No I have to go my child has to go brother no this is your child should deserve this education because so many people do not need the country you are here  But you will waste 27 years and half the people in power also know that the jobs are not as good as they want and those who are there are not going to do it. Please keep it so that you keep studying till 25, 26, 27 and then keep preparing for the competition and you become yours at the age of 35 and that's it, that time will pass by and by so that there is no noise left about jobs because jobs are governed by the marriage market. The Shaadi Market Governs The Job System If you want a video on this I will make a video But The Real Scam Is The Indian Education System And We Need To Call It Out For Not  Being good is one thing. What kind of education is being given where school fees are so high and college fees are high? Many colleges are like this, which means the faculty and teachers are on the verge of closure. They are not worth anything because they don't have a salary. Now there are only good universities which are in Sonipat etc. They bring foreigners from outside. Their fees is Rs 303 40 50 lakh because the quality will come at a level. If you make the price cheaper, then he will teach the same tea for train, train will not speak, assume in pronunciation, then he will speak with pronunciation, okay, this is how you will get brother, okay, and by studying a lot like this, you are not reaching anywhere because you are saying that I have studied so much, why am I not getting so much money, no, that is what I deserve, you have spent so much, you are worthy of this, and in between, dream makers come, then these dreamers are like IAS people, now they are coaching.  Do  If yes, then they do not claim too much, they know that brother, yes, whoever gets it, they show two-four-five photos of it, but others say, come, this is the syllabus, we will teach you, the tuition person is also like this where you claim.  Have you done this business? You swore that you will become an entrepreneur. Brother, promises cannot be fulfilled. It is a big thing that a man can guarantee his child. Secondly, from where will he get the guarantee of the child that he will see it, open it, read it, internalize it and so on? Now you have taught him Canva, you have taught him thumbnails, you have taught him video editing, he has taught you this, he has taught this to a child, he has taught a child of this ecosystem, he does not have access to those types of clients.  He doesn't get along well with those kind of people and after doing a few classes, he thinks, this course is of no use, I sell it to him, then he starts selling the course and sells it again to someone.  If it is not needed then your courses are bought by 70800 Hajj people who will not get any benefit from it because there is no such ecosystem in it. Now if you have acquired the knowledge of big marketing from the bicycle repair man, then he will not be able to do that.  It is in a small town, it has a small ecosystem, he should have that much understanding and he is smart enough to come up with ideas, be it 12 videos or 15 videos or 20 hours.  Even a 15 minute talk can be found in the content like this, it can actually change your life but that is for the people who are not very intelligent, but are a little intelligent, now they are not even a little intelligent and are roaming around, so how will their course benefit?  Now, if the seller of that thing tells it so openly, it will not be beneficial, then of course his courses will be sold less. Now like I am on this channel, you put it as arrogant, put it as cute, put it as practical.  I myself say that this channel is for people who have money, who have time to sit comfortably and chat, who are not in a hurry to go anywhere and who have a little more patience level and who understand things on a higher order. What is being taught is correct and those whose level is one level above in both money and intelligence, I don't even listen to you as soon as you say this, I think many people who are not at that level will run away, however, those who are not at that level will run away.  which i  I define it but if they are understanding my words then they will also feel good that yes man, he is saying the right thing, there is a difference of level and we will also reach that level, we will also become like that person, a little.  There is no touch, I told someone, I called a fat person, I said, Hey, you are fat, there is no need to be touchy, become thin, someone is feeling poor, someone is feeling poor, someone should try to become rich, someone should say. I am a little less intelligent Try to be intelligent, why is it being said everywhere that we are good as we are, brother, you should be happy with who you are, clapping will not be forced, this is the biggest problem of happiness in India that they are saying.  Brother, we will remain like this and say that we are very great and this means praising, body shaming, classes are racist too much, doing that, doing that, discriminating is not a good thing but it is on a moral standing.  So this is what I am saying, I am not saying that what should be done but what should happen and what is happening, I will have to accept, if you are fat then you will not get clothes so easily, you will have to sit tightly in the seat of the plane, you people  You can pass comment. You have to understand this. You cannot say that I will eat and am enjoying and my relationships will also be good and if I do something like this then people have to understand that all things are not for all people.  If you have then please share this video, like and comment, thank you very much."

    "title": "Govt Employees And VRS Decision Making ｜ Calculations Given [njA3XhVG6b8].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, Why most government servants above 20 years should take VRS is going to be a very interesting topic. If you are a government officer, if you have completed 20 years then you should retire from the job. We will discuss about that. Some reasons will be discussed if you  If it suits you then tell me, if you like it then tell me and share this video with whoever is working for your boss so that there is some value added in his life. And even if it is not there then it has to be written, it is an issue for discussion, okay, how some buddy goes about it is a separate discussion, if it has been more than 20 years, then it means he is in the old pension scheme because 20224 is going on, it was closed in 2004.  If it was done, then whoever has brought more than 20 will get the old pension. Brother, those who are getting the old pension, you are a very good son-in-law, so you should give the money to the government for doing the job.  Now you will ask how, then we will discuss beyond that because the monitor is not a benefit and the service to the country has been done as much as I thought and you probably are not having much misunderstanding about it that we will change and tear apart.  Will give and that matter has cooled down a bit, especially the one which is not on the Rajdhani track, Shatabdi Rajdhani, and nowadays is it not on the Vande Bharat track? In fact, nowadays even on these tracks, there is a problem with derailment and that derailment.  Sorry Railway Minister, we know that we see those memes etc. but if you are on a goods train track, on a slow one, there is no promotion happening, no one is asking, nothing great is going on, it is not fun, you are away from the family and you feel. How to leave the job because you have not done those calculations, then I will tell you the calculations very simply, everyone will listen carefully to the officers, let's start, if you are a person with 20 lakhs and 20 years of service.  If you are a government officer then your basic pay will be around Rs 1 lakh depending on the department, I am talking about officer, I am talking about Group A, Group B and C people can also do their calculations, I know many are trolling here.  And by the way, hey, these people eat grass, friend, don't say it like this, not everyone eats everything, not everyone even gets a chance. Okay, remove both those things and that thing, otherwise all the calculations will be done like this. Even the shell eats, then you stay and become everything, then there is no need to make any video because those who are not engaged, they feel like this only, they feel that it is there, it is not such a thing and in the coming time it will end completely.  So we told in the beginning in the calculation why I know right now it will come like this, hey, they do n't work for job, they don't work for salary, someone else tells them that they get salary every day, please, this is loose talk.  should Don't do that let's be serious there are real people out there they are doing good job and they are doing good job and they think they are doing good job but a life decision has to be taken see if you have 20 years of service then your  Age may be around 45, plus or minus two years. Okay, you still have 15 years of redel service, but still you have to leave it because if your salary is Rs. 1.5 lakh. If your basic pay is Rs 1.5 lakh, if we calculate it today, then beyond that you will have to pay DA, you will get something else, then it becomes your salary, which is your total salary, beyond that you have to pay tax, the government has to pay it to every person.  If you are working anywhere as per your wish, whether you are working in corporate or anywhere else, then after that you save one paisa, one paisa, note this money, then if your salary is X from lettuce, then your tax is deducted.  If you consider  If you have to leave and then tell me what to do, now if you retire, your basic will be 75, half your pension will be 50, but you will get a chance, not a commuter, but a commuter. This is a 20 minute topic in itself and if you write cute in the comment section then a separate video will be made. Should you cute your pension and should you not cute? It's okay because that story was earlier.  Now that factor has been put aside, if we get something now then it is a topic in itself. I assume here that if you come to the computer, your brothers and sisters will get pension of Rs. 75000. Basic and DA is going on.  When you are 50, you will get 37.5% DA, then 11500% DA, now your pension is done, whatever is your gratuity and your leave encashment, that is what you will get when you add both the things and some is yours, some is everyone's insurance and some is being done by the government.  It is different in every department, by adding all these, all the benefits are as follows, if you get 50 lakhs and On 50 lakhs, you earned income on 10. Off on 10, 50 lakhs is 5 lakhs. Which is close to 42, 43000, 42000, then 11 and 42. If you sat down, then it was 154. So brothers and sisters, I brought you 155. I brought you this 155 without you.  You are getting it for work, you are getting it without working, you can subtract from what was the total salary there. Lena, now what is the twist in the story that if you are not living with your wife and children, you have to live separately because of your job because their children are in school because when you complete 20 years of service, it is assumed that you will be left till 2022. Children of those who have served a year are in 10th and 11th. In 10th and 11th, they have issues related to exams and education. And you people are living separately from any other person in the family.  If he lives separately from his family, then his minimum expenditure is an additional Rs 40,000 because now he has to run the AC separately, he has to keep the broom and utensils separate, the rental has to be kept separately. If he is getting some house also, then he has to pay for water and commuting expenses.  If you have to do this, then this is the bare minimum, it could be better than this and it includes the expenses of traveling and traveling, the child's exams are being held, I have to go to get it done, then it is a competitive exam for the daughter.  There is something, your wife is worried, you are not able to manage alone, so this is 40000. If you count these 40000, you will realize that you may be getting only this much, so if you are not living together then it is a complete loss. Plus one of the biggest things is that when you retire at the age of 44-45, you can go out and do anything and you can earn money by doing whatever you want.  I haven't run out of oil, when you retire at 60, then you are worthless, then your shop is closed at 60. Versus if you retire, 44 45 43 42 46, what ever depending on when, who started you, next 14 15 years will  Establish Yourself in Something Else and Now You Won't Stop at 60 You Will Continue  Till 75 So It's Not Just About Money Part It's About Stability In Your Life And You Keeping Yourself Busy Till 75 I Will Make Another Video For Government Employees Who Are Leading A Very Happy Life Who Have Completed These Days  One who is leaving after doing full service feels lost. One only comes out to a world where only one has to interact.  With non- government employees and going into the society, one comes with his own attitude and arrogance because what would happen is that after 60 years, you may go to such a position that you will not realize that it is only you who is running it.  The country is fine but when you turn 61, then no one will ask you, then you will not be able to sit in the buses, in the metro, forget about doing any small work, you will feel like, hey, how am I doing this and the money and We see that many officers who are IAS, they all do it at 60 to 65, sometimes the government makes them the chairman of this place, sometimes of that, sometimes their brother, they do IAS and YS.  There are so many lakhs of people in the government service, no one is asking you about the rest of the department, there are many people in such government service who retire in 5 55 57 years. No one asks after that, so instead of going there, brothers and sisters, now what are the many things? A hint is enough for an intelligent person. Some of you are geniuses, all the things are not even told openly because what do we have to do here, no one knows me.  Do not cause loss of affection, even the government has to work. Who all will come after listening to my videos? After the release, you give a chance to a youngster. If the post becomes vacant then someone else will go up or if a vacancy is created then the youngster will get the job. Okay, it will come, but it is not of much use to you, especially if you have become like that in India, as we have seen in Haryana many times, what happens when an elderly person lives so many years, then he turns 85.  He does n't do much good, remains a little irritable and people give him a little respect but don't even talk to him. Now he is sleeping so we don't know whether he is sleeping or awake and will say to him thrice, ' O uncle, have you eaten the roti, let's go.'  eat bread and have lunch  Your dinner is over, he is asked two or three times, I gave him tea twice and that's it, any big child will also come, he will go through the see, Namaste, no one will do this, I have seen a bunch of government employees become this and that in their organization. They have become those idle people to whom no one asks much, they just lie on the bed and talk to them about 'hi hello knowledge' as if I am telling them about practical life. So we are just living, that is, we are alive but we are not looking alive, and many employees and the government have also taken hold of us. The government will be too happy to retire from your heart, oh my dear, leave it, someone else will come, this is such a marriage.  It means that according to the marriage, neither the government is gaining nor the employee is gaining but they are not being left out, the government cannot remove it because something like this  You did not commit the scandal, there is no reason to expel him, however, the government has made the point that at the age of 55, he is nothing at 45, you are working silently, your soul is somewhere, your body is somewhere and this is how you are.  If the program is going on, then this is a life, the human body was found because I will not leave the vacancy, if I get a seat then I will stay on it, brother, the bus has reached and half of the people are not able to leave because they are thinking about what they will do after coming out.  at least  Here we go to the office wearing some clothes and our wives probably think that we are busy with work, so perhaps we have fooled our entire system into thinking that we are doing something great. The day these wives come to know the calculations, they will  You will come to know that this husband is staying there unnecessarily. Many husbands are happy even by staying away from their family. They love those husbands who know all the calculations and there is a lot of consultation, I say.  Guruji, I know, but how can you live there with Kalesh's wife, after retirement you will have to suffer all your life. Now come on, job is meant for you, see if Kalesh is your wife and this is the situation, then also I think you should retire because of this job and hold it. Go away my friend there if you are treated like a bad person because the person is like well in his 80's and your age is 40's  So have a heart, my friend, take a call, why do you have to be so insulting, why do you have to do it, and there is one more thing, after seeing you all, there are such people in the organization who, after seeing them, people just move away, saying, this is so.  They are bitter because many people have also become bitter because these people are not on the Rajdhani track, they are not on any great post, they do not have any connection with anyone, it is just that their increment on 3rd is bound to start on 1st July. By doing increment on increment, it shows the rate. Brother, by doing compounding, it becomes very high on basic. If you are not on 20, then it will become higher later, but if you take a call sometime, I will tell you when I will calculate the amount. People should ask how much money they will get, when will it be restored, that is a very interesting topic, what will you do with the money, how much rate of interest can you increase, what are the advantages and disadvantages, that is your own.  This is a very good topic, okay, that one is its own topic for discussion, so I will do the calculation by doing that also. If you don't want to be cute, then brother, I did not do that because it would have got a bit complicated here because even with the extra money you will get, You can play, you can earn money from it in life, that too will come to you, in whose name you can do it, how you can do it, but I think I want to tell one thing to people and finish that it is  Never Ever I Will Repeat Very With Great Authority With Great Love Affection And Khalu Siyat I Want To Tell Everybody And Lot Of Sincerity It Is Never Ever Worth Staying Away From Your Family Because Of Your Job And Because You Don't Know How To Earn Money Other Wise  And these four calculations cannot be done by you. Here an expert like me can come handy.

Daal Dunga Webinar Info Group Hai Wealth Creation Sam Sam Group Hai Mera If You Are Not Already In Touch With Me If  You are all in touch then so you know it is okay then join him so that at some point of time during this last week of September I intend to do a told workshop on it so that your decision making is good because lot of  People are paying me very hefty consultation to take this decision and I have realized that how much money can I earn from each one?  And when that person gets bored, then the person thinks that everyone should be explained in one go because this will be an I will not say epidemic i.e. Padme type, this has already happened and that organization will also be very relieved that brother, get out, you friend.  Leave, you are fine, leave and let the fresh blood come because when the work is not that much, there is no respect, there is no money, then neither the organization is getting any benefit nor you are getting any benefit, then brother, leave a little.  If you do something else, you will do good to the country. If you come out and start earning and start doing something outside the government, then you will also do well. Now, what is the government's orbit? What is orbit? I am forgetting the word which is restructuring of assets. Something goes wrong inside the company like insolvency proceedings. Yes, there is a lot of demand for insolvency proceedings.  There are a lot of ex-government people and if you can train them, you can understand and there will be a lot of growth in the future as India's economy grows. There are not even 5000 people who can do this work. 50000 more are needed. There is a lot to do. Independent Director Company has 10000 jobs but  That is the only thing, isn't it, this is the only thing, you are holding on to it, now you are saying like this, I have to do something else, tell me what to do, what should I do, this brother, do this first.  You will have to leave something, if you want to catch it, you say, how many phones does he carry, he is making money on one, he is not enjoying it, he has to catch it, so brother, the government 's rules are like this, you cannot catch one.  Caught the other, the rules are such that you can't do that you can't say that I will do moonlighting, Government servants can't do this, it's okay, they are prohibited, it's okay and it's not  Good brother, even suggesting will have to be left, brother, leave it completely, hold it, if you don't enjoy holding it, brother, hold it, if you don't enjoy it, hold it, because once you have freedom, then it is always easy like I keep telling all.  It becomes dark humor but then some people are like that I have been divorced and some of them are very scared of marriage. I said, I said sir or madam or whatever, the client remains, I said.  Friend, once you have done it, you know how it happens. First time, you feel scared. First, you have to give birth to a child. First, you have to get a divorce. In the second and third, the man is not so scared. Okay, you get to know what is the procedure, what is where and where.  If you want to go, how to do it, then it is also like this, once in a while, you feel scared, but there is victory in front of fear. Which ad is it, it is victory in front of fear, so the last line is if you come staying alone and watching this like this thing.  you will  Feel like a loser and if you feel like one that feeling is correct staying away from family for making a living living and staying it endlessly because family some times refuses to come don't know tu where post main nahi tere saath aana aapki madam jo hogi na woh  There must be a teacher somewhere, 0000 He says, I am not coming, the children are studying, I am at home, my capacity of roaming around has reached you.  If you want to travel then do it and stay away. Husbands are like this. I have seen that they start drinking alcohol, they do not remain in control, time does not pass, they become bitter and what is that thing, I want to tell it to many people through this video. Touching how many of you [Music] Identification Seven years of your healthy life call it or overall life gets reduced because you stay away from your family Second is your family get so  Used to be so used to staying away from you that when you come and meet them on holidays and some times छुट्टी लेके बोल्टे हैं सौरी हैलिडे बोल रहान मैं अधिक हैं टो दे र लिक ये कब जेगा यार क्या है यह है and I have seen youngster Because a lot of people are in pain and I told you, I do consultation from them to them. Guruji, the child says, Papa, why are you telling me now?  You will go away, then we will do the same thing, why are you even means suggesting us and the parent who comes, the father who comes, wants to come and impose discipline, why are you doing something like this, why are you doing this, why are you doing that from behind.  A different system works. Father is very required in a family. Mothers are a very important for a child from late till 10 years 12.  At Years When Children Are Like Above 12 13 A father is 100% required and in that, if the child was your father then he would have become this and if there was no father then this would have become this Opportunity Cost You will not even realize Like I told you that if you retire  Early Take Care of Your Family Start Doing Earning More and Keep Your Pension and All That Money Well and You  You are stable, the joy in it is that your life will increase, diseases will not come, you will live longer, how to prove it, because you can't live two lives or you live like this and you live like that, now where did the research come from?  Who came before me, who came after, who went here, no one is doing this, but what I am talking about, make sense of it, because if you are joy full because.  The food you eat at your wife's house will still be much healthier than if you are eating outside. Whether your department has made a system for eating some food or you order it from Swiggy, you eat it ready made or you prepare it yourself.  Or that Chhotu comes and becomes your cook, he presses all the ingredients and adds such oil and seasoning that you then roam around in your kitchen or the program becomes yours, then that food is not a taste, it is not a family. No life, no marital life, nothing, it's not worth it, get out and those who are living together are also living together, now I am living together, even though I am married, a stage may come when you will have to live separately. Why are you waiting till that stage Take a call Take a call in fact What people should do after hearing whose should they start preparation First one to two years of preparation What is something you should do  Should be done, those workshops are for webinars sometimes because look, below 500, even I don't speak, there should be so many people, I will give it to two people, then I will not give consultation at all, consultation is already going on.  One on one is your payment, infact you want to take consultation, which I am not very keen on because I am bored, still there is an option because its fee is very high, brother, it is fine, it seems that the government takes it for the government people. Because government people are used to giving less only and not giving at all. Okay, who gives money for knowledge, no one in the government gives it. Okay, they say that we are so knowledgeable, why would we give money to anyone, but many times we have to take help of astrology. Sometimes your situation is such that you have to do a little tailor making, so yes if you want to take that also you can take but the bottom line is never ever stay away from your family. Beyond a particular time, a few days are necessary under compulsion, but do not indulge in complete compulsion, life becomes very boring, bitter and your family is not able to connect with you mentally and I have seen that connection breaking in many people and that  One thing is that it breaks and does not connect again. This is also a fact because you are no longer the same person, you become bitter and then they keep increasing the distance that they have maintained with you. They do not get incentive for reducing your family members. These are very late things. Many people may not have even understood. Those who are not suffering from it, but people are identified. So please subscribe to the channel. There are many more things, platinum membership.  If you can take it, then what do I have to do? I will have an idea after that, thank you very much."

    "title": "Govt Employees In Transferable Job And Marriage Market [Gd_kqATfsUs].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today's topic is why you should not marry a government employee in a transferable job. Many people are adjusting the marriage market. It is okay but it is an opinion and I am telling this only to women. There are two things in this. I have caught a government diploma, if it is not transferable, then there are some government posts like this, which are less but where there is no transfer, then do it and if you live in a big city.  So do it, don't do it the other way but today there is a lot of demand for government servants in the job market. My point is that it is not the job market but the marriage market. There is a lot of demand in the marriage market. I am a marital counselor. I know that actually it is a negative thing and this. In the marriage market, we will have to do government job, only then this ghost of government job in our youth will come down because it is like an animal, man.  The female selects whom and the male wants to be like that, the whole world goes but this is stopping the progress of our country, GDP growth is stopping, time is being wasted, the youth of the youth are going to give this paper, that's why my me.  From within I feel that I will have to attack the marriage market, so today I am addressing the women, today I am addressing the girls that if your son-in-law is transferable in a government job, then you Why don't you want to marry your daughter? There are three reasons why marriage is taking place in a government job. The reason is that the job is secure. The second thing that is happening is that the mother-in-law will be away, perhaps she may not be well nearby.  Do you live far away, right? Two, these are two, these are the two main reasons. Third, you get an assured status because if it is not you, then you don't know about others. Now, like in a government job, if you get married, then you are a Group P officer.  is b is c is d is well  If it is defined, then you actually know where you are going. This happens because of three reasons. You will not catch these reasons and the biggest reason for not doing it is that after one stage in transferable, so much frustration comes, the lady's married life starts becoming different.  And the same husband whom you were thinking that I will stay away from your mother-in-law, makes you sit with your own mother-in-law permanently and says that brother, I am going to a small place, so stay here for separation.  This happens a lot and if there is no separation then the education of the children would have progressed and the woman who could have done a job herself could have gone ahead in her life. Today, all women have to do a job, they all want to do it, everyone has their own aspirations, they don't.  Keep roaming around till you are fulfilled. Opportunity cost goes a lot in small places. Future of children is actually getting spoiled and no mother would want separation as a result after one stage.  Only way out do you want to live a married life where you don't live together, where you are living separately for years, many people will get hurt which is there but it is okay, those whose love is there now, they will not be left either.  There is no need to go through that trouble, I am dissuading those who want to go here, not everyone will be there if I do it, that is also a different thing, but as many as will be there, I am for that audience, so no matter how much is my own.  You have daughters, tell them you are a person who has stability of a place yes job can be up or down house groom if your set is somewhere big city there is an ecosystem set that she is a lecturer in this private college your daughter is a lecturer she is tuition  Teaches, does, is a better prospect than a group, an officer, nothing is washed, nothing is left, what I want to tell, I keep using this Haryanvi  Thing also because of North Indian audience is connected more there is nothing the government servant is able to save because rolling stone gates no gathers no mass no network is formed nor its system is formed nothing from here and from there to all the government servants from here Today I can tell you the salary after one year, there will be an increment of 3%, the slab is suitable for all of you, whether this is on this grade, this is how it is, these are the others.  And we know how much DA is today and how much it increases according to what. There is no excitement in your life and those who are thinking of getting married today will remain married for the next 40-50 years, there will be life and there will also be a job in it. 30-  35-40 years brother, nothing to taste, I am telling you, you will feel very behind, you will feel yourself as a couple, if even today you marry a person with a job of Rs. 0000 and you yourself are 30 years old.  35 is 40 and 80 and your city is fixed and you do not have to change the city, you have to grow and keep making your progress. You will do much better than getting married to a government group A. I caught hold of group A.  Because Group B is below Group A, C is below that, don't do it brother, don't marry them, don't marry them, I am telling men also about stability of job, my women who are in your government job are very transferable.  It can happen anywhere, so don't do it. You will keep adjusting all your life. It is not worth it. Married life and life itself will not survive. You will keep crying. You will keep adjusting. Don't do it even with such a woman. If  If there is a woman, then don't even talk to the woman because she will have a job. 30 50 60 70 800 A man of Haj does not roam with a lady, he has his own business, so he  This is also wrong but it is permanent, then it is a different thing that the place is fixed or the school is here, you have to go here, it is nearby here, then it is okay to make adjustments, otherwise, there is so much unhappiness in the lives of so many people, because I am also doing a happiness course.  I have completed the research and tell people that this is a big reason for unhappiness. Not being able to live together makes money look like status but brother, nothing is left because ultimately how much you earn.  This is one aspect, how much you are able to save is also an important thing. If you keep moving from here to there to here to there to here to there to here then nothing happens then people come into it no no no corruption too.  It happens like this, brother, nothing is going to happen, the first thing is that it is not happening all over the place, no, it is not a good thing, it is okay and it is being tightened, and the good thing is that it is being tightened, and in the coming country, absolutely.  It will be tight, okay, so this too, do n't give these stupid reasons, it's okay for me, which I don't like as a, I mean, I don't want my audience to be such that those who talk like this, do wrong things, it's wrong, that's okay and  That thing is also ending and there is no pride in it anyway and what is the main reason in it is separation, no matter how much money they earn, earn in the opposite way, they are not living together, they go to small districts and live there.  If you go to that department, go to that city, go to that state, then you are not going to live there. If you are not from a different country, then what is the taste in your life? As a lady, yours is yours as a daughter, she will keep struggling, if you keep raising children or  Will you keep helping her or will she keep troubling you? Come, Papa, come, Mummy, come here, these are gone, they are gone, all these troubles will remain, brother, don't do it, tell me, tell me this video in the marriage market.  of government employee after  The value should fall in the market, this is M and this fall in value will be of great benefit to the other boys, so overall it is good in the country, those who are married, now that is done, so what will happen to them if the value falls. They will not go on this matter but this thing is being suffered, that will be a truth. You put your hand on your heart and for those who are suffering more, I will tell you something else. I make videos on relationships too, if you want.  If you are suffering from that thing then please leave your job even in government, if it has become pensionable, the old ones, the ones before 2004, leave it brother, it is not worth it, otherwise if you want a separate video, then I will make it because there.  People are also fed up, the reason for people's pain is too much, staying away from family at the age of 45, not getting food, not being able to pay attention to the children at home and also fulfilling the requirements of their parents.  All this is a big issue in life and I request you all to watch this video pragmatically and spread it and this was a big issue, I hope you all understood, thank you very much."

Many people wrote in the comment section, I was so happy, it's good for real estate, no, people are telling me, I feel good, I understand things in real estate, I also understand the benefits of indexation.  By removing the benefits, brothers and sisters, real estate will go up and there will be benefits. It will benefit in a very good way. If you want to know about this then I have posted a video on it which is about 10 minutes long from my second channel Sango Real Estate, the link of which is available to you.  You will find this video at the top of the comment section, please click on it and get the secret that now she will be comfortably in her stomach, Gudgudiya, he did this to us, he did this to the middle class, now she is Gudgudiya, why is it good?  Go and watch it and also subscribe to that channel. Specific real estate channel is my exclusive real estate channel and which opportunity is coming now. Pick and choose is becoming a good market for real estate. Government is encouraging only real estate. And how the indexation removal of real estate which is currently going on at 363, this is the explanation of indexation, when was it first started from 100, go and watch the video and understand your curiosity. Calm down, send the link of that video to your friend circle, understand yourself, explain it to your friends, if there is any doubt left, and above the budget, there is nothing for us middle class, go to Dubai, go here, if you have so much money then go, then go.  If it is so easy then it has to be somewhere, so we left just this little, left only a little, the benefit was only 17500, I thought it was 175, but it was such a slip of my tongue, 7500 and I  Had added the deduction, it is only Rs 175 so the benefit is very less but ok, peanuts is if you pay monkeys are what you will retain. Ok peanuts if you pay, you will get monkeys but ok in my opinion, I will reiterate again.  I will do it, although people are not liking the budget very much and the problem is when the government has to ask questions and not applaud, then I got tired many times.  If you ask questions to the government and BJP then they don't say 'hi hai ha' and if you ever say anything to them then it's okay then don't say 'hi hai', hey let one side live, one side do clapping but it doesn't matter where you do whatever.  The same thing will happen, I say it again and again, it is easy to mislead people in India, it is difficult to convince them, I am giving a hint through this video, it is not an easy pick, it is not easy to make money, it means you only get that much time by doing a job.  started thinking  The individual will earn money and the rest will remain irritated and the irritation is not because the government is taking tax, it is irritated because the employer sucks you all the time, you do not have time to learn, to understand, you are just someone. Yes, it is bad, it is not bad, it is not bad, it is not bad, because if you get clarity by watching these videos of mine, then subscribe to that channel also, you will get the video in the comment section, brothers.

    "title": "How Can You Deal With Angry People ？ ｜ A Life-Easing Gyaan [8L4N5q0GI_s].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, there will be a little deep topic, it will be interesting for you guys to listen till the end, the topic is how to deal with angry people and how to deal with your own anger issues, basically how to deal with an angry person who is a human being or if you get very angry then you should do  It will give a lot of relief, I will try to give clarity and please share it in your circle, it is definitely your responsibility so that we can get this clarity in life and life.  If we remove anger from people, the world will be a better place, our country will be a better place, productivity will increase, health will be less bad. Okay, so let's start the video whenever you feel angry or someone is angry at you because anger is such a thing.  We see it on daily basis, we either get angry ourselves or bear the anger, wife's anger, parents' anger, children also show anger these days, okay, we will go to the office, boss's anger on the road.  If you go somewhere, someone is driving a car, that person is angry, you are standing there, something has happened ahead, Pa Pai Pai Pai, Indians have a lot of anger, North Indians have a lot of it, South Indians have relatively less anger, although there is a lot of anger in their movies.  I get to see it but still I am very twisted and have been there. I am comparatively more angry in the North than in the South. Okay, relatively, the South is okay. Relatively okay, so both places are okay. So is the rest of the country. I did not understand Western and Eastern, the population is very high in North and South, so why does one get angry? Anger is an emotion, it is a very strong emotion, but why does it arise, that is, what is its source, because if we know this then only we will be able to address it. Only if you know this then tomorrow if any man is getting angry with you then you will know what I am going to tell you then your power to tolerate him will become very easy and if you are getting angry with him  If there is any problem then you will reach out to him and address his problem. The base of anger is fear. Where there is no fear, there can be no anger. Tell me, what are you saying friend? Do you understand this, anger or fear? Let me tell you with two, four or five examples. You are going.  He is somewhere or some other person is going, wants to reach office or wants to meet somewhere and is showing anger on the way, is showing frustration, he is afraid of not reaching there on time.  Either I am late leaving or there is some emergency. Fear that wherever I reach, I will have to be scolded if I reach there late. I am angry because anger is breeding anger. When you are angry, here is a small example.  Let me tell you how anger circulates in the family. The owner of the shop slapped the employee in anger or scolded him. Well, not a slap, but a very bad slap.  That employee came back home and was angry, his wife did not do anything, that is, he thought that tea would be served on time or he asked for something or something happened, he caught his wife, now the same wife got angry because the angry shopkeeper told whom  Gave it to the husband The husband brought it into the house Magnified it The husband gave it to the wife The wife got it as she got The woman got it The boy was not doing homework The boy was not doing homework or was not doing anything  Whatever the mother had already given to the boy is fine, now when the boy came out in frustration and the child was 10-12 years old, he did not understand what to do, so he saw the dog, it is fine, he threw a stone at the dog, picked it up and  The dog ran in anger and as it ran, it collided with another man and he bit him. Now this man was the shopkeeper who had given data to his father, so this is how this anger is traveling in this world, Karma.  E traveling one man to another here we have to break it and after understanding the information I am giving you will understand that you are angry on your children, read it, do something, do n't do it, always read, what is fear.  What is the fear that maybe he will become something, he will not become anything, otherwise he will be a shame on you, if he does not earn money, then the fear lies in that he may not have any money because if the child of a very rich man is not doing drugs, then he is not doing any illegal work.  not working  He is not doing anything moral, he is reading something, he is generally passing the time, he is generally decent, he is not harsh on that person and is saying that yes, it is okay, that means he could have been even worse, now he will come of age, I will let him  I will set it now, a little he accepts what I say, a little he will accept it later and by the way, no friend is generally decent, he does not run away in the pursuit of friendship, he does not go anywhere for a walk, he does not stay late at night, he is satisfied but the same. Parent of lower middle class middle class parent is not satisfied. If he is afraid then he is angry. Same thing, same thing. When the wife gets angry at her husband because the husband has given something to his parents or gifted something to his sister or given something.  So, the distress of the wife, the anger, the lies in the fear that I don't know the resources of our house, this husband is a stupid [ __ ], I don't know where my sister is. If this woman herself is doing a job worth Rs 1 lakh then it will be less because she is doing something, so I am telling this.  I tell you all that wherever anger is coming, recognize that anger and where there is fear, try to address that fear, otherwise anger will always come, will always come, husband does not listen to me.  Why do you have to control your husband? You will be controlled by your anger. Same works for the husband also that you are making him angry. Why are you getting angry? You have to control your family so that everyone listens to you and everything you say is heard. Okay.  Okay, so this is the same thing that if you are a boss and are very angry at your lower employees, okay why because they will not work, then what will happen then that project will not be completed yes then what will happen  Then you will not get promotion, then basically you are afraid that if these donkeys do not do the work below, then I will get scolded from above or I will not get promotion, then address that fear, why do you want such a strong promotion, so what if there will be no promotion.  No no, what is it like this, the whole organization is like this, why be angry, why be afraid, fire him from the job, call him, brother, you are not working, ok, open the register, there must be some system, warning paper of appraisal.  Work's hair by you have been ass to brother you are not working and on that day you didn't work you didn't come you didn't listen to my comfort abuse Kalach's anger whose anger is whose fault is it whose lower employee's body is bad?  You are having a heart attack, who will you blame, who has done the mistake, if your boss is angry at you, your wife is angry, your parents, anyone.  If he gets angry then tell him a simple question, whose fault is it yours, if it is my fault then why are you punishing yourself, why don't you shout at yourself, shout inside and see whose BP is increasing, maybe you are 80.  But you are sitting on the blockage and you get a heart attack by shouting, I am so much worth in your life, you get so angry that what is your fear? Tell your wife, what is your fear, brother?  I will not get you, not my parents. If I stay here for 25 years, they brought me up and made me something, do this then I will leave you too. If you only want me to be your slave, I will not do anything to my parents.  If I forget them, just like I have forgotten my parents, I have forgotten my brothers and sisters, I will also forget you. Why anger, what is fear, when I am not even leaving my parents, where can I forget you?  Tell me to leave, I will work double time. Don't be angry, I will work very hard. Address the fear. Whenever your wife is shouting, the thing she is shouting about has got nothing, that is a system, where is the seed, where is the fear, a very big fear and  When you think like this, whenever someone is making you angry, you will think where his fear is coming from. You have to address him directly and tell him that his anger should be calmed down.  Tell the boss sir, I will get you promotion, I will make my life one, this will be a mistake, don't worry, if the boss is not big then in the beginning it will be like, my secret has been exposed, and all will be revealed slowly, boss, say sir, earn the number.  I will give you, why do you worry, I will do it like this, I will flatter you too, I will teach you how to do it, I will flatter your boss, ask your boss to give you a number, speak directly, what is such fear, why are you getting angry to someone else?  I will not tell you, this is how the conversation is happening between us, I am giving very practical tips here, no one in the world is making such videos in the work they do in life, they do not sound sexy, and they also do not sound very diplomatic.  And don't make that kind of sound, raise yourself so high that what nonsense is that, there is no need to raise yourself so high, concentrate your mind, do not get angry and whoever gets angry, then your personality will become like this.  Wherever you go, everyone will smile like this because they know that you know how they think and work. Then it is not anger, it is anger in front of the person where something is hidden. Once you can feel like a child is getting angry on something.  What does he need, what is he afraid of, he will miss his movie, you will not bring his school bag, he will not watch cartoons, even small children get angry, what is it, ask son, what happened, you will get to watch the movie Ghummi.  You will also roam around, tell me what is the problem, what is your fear, if you want to address your fear, then in the family, in the office space or even if you are getting angry on someone, then go to that place and see what that fear is and call it fear. Tell your wife directly to fear that my guests are coming, they are my relatives, I know you do not love them, do not like them, I am afraid that you will not welcome her and I am afraid that you will insult me.  If you give it to me, I will be insulted, I am living in this fear and in this fear, if I burst, I will get angry, but I am telling you in advance that you should wear a mask and spend two hours properly and I will be with you.  I will bring a saree for you, no, why do n't people talk like this, why do people stay angry out of fear, and if you talk to your wife first, then she also knows that man, she also knows, that is, if you understand, then what would have happened.  do you know  There is a fear that then they come and your wife makes a face or is not so devoted or she will disappear on time or you did not like it, she does not respect the Embarrassed one that much, if the wife does not agree then sit and accept what I said in the first one.  She said, sit down and tell me, get your own things, arrange for food and drinks, and tell me brother, my wife, why don't you do the unworthy thing? He is the one who tells you okay. Bo, I do it for you, I do it for her too, become natural, fear.  Rise up, there is victory in front of fear, there was a fight, there is victory in front of fear, there is victory, don't be angry either on your wife, nor on relatives, nor on juniors, nor even on seniors, don't be angry at seniors, why are you there, it is a compulsion, this world is afraid.  And if you are running with greed, then you will see fear and greed in everything and all the anger is the same as when a program spoils someone, any action of yours is spoiling someone's program and he cannot speak, you have to see.  That What is his hidden program, what is his agenda, which has been spoiled by this action? What is his chessboard that he has laid, which you have spoiled in innocence, foolishly or knowingly, depending on the situation. Just think about it and address him and tell him that yes, I did. If I have done this to you intentionally, then tell me I will do it like this and if you tell me politely, then we will become friends, then I will not do it, don't get angry at me or else.  They say unknowingly, Oh Lord, what is the mistake, Guru ji, have I committed a mistake, tell me the truth, it happened to me unknowingly, because people are not able to tell either the actual reason or the anger, they ask for something else.  And sometimes what happens is that you had given him the reason for his anger two days ago, which was the actual reason for his anger, but if he had been there at that time, his secret would have been exposed, then he would have asked you and you would have caught him many times.  Isn't it friend, there was no such thing as anger, this happens with you friend, why is the wife shouting on such a thing, man, men do n't even understand sir, they probably were not sent to any school, you are like this.  If you are my subscriber, then you are in the school, here there is a Guruji who teaches PhD people, right in front of you, if you get a PhD in all these things, then I am the mentor to get that PhD, so if you are connected, then you will know all this, no one will help you.  You are getting angry in front of someone, address his/her fears, tell him/her, or do people sometimes not acknowledge what are the fears? Everyone keeps getting angry. Loss of control is another big fear of yours. Do something like this to someone if you lose control over you.  If you give the impression of being angry then you will get angry and those who get angry at you basically want to control you or you are also the one at whom you sometimes shout, like a rickshaw puller.  Normally, you do n't shout at your neighbor because neither will he let you control him nor you are controlling him. When you tell people that you cannot be controlled, then people will stop getting angry at you. That feeling you give them.  You are vulnerable and you can be controlled and blackmailed. Some times it happens that the person A wants to control you and you are not able to control him but you are under the control of person B and then the person goes crazy.  A. The person can be a mother and a wife depending on the situation. Many wives see that he doesn't listen to me and keeps giving his mother his tail. Wives like it very much that the husband who doesn't listen to his mother probably doesn't even listen to her or to anyone.  Does n't listen and is a bully, hood, bully, bully, bully, then it's okay, wife, he doesn't listen to me either, does n't listen to her either, not even under my control, not under anyone's control either  No, it's okay then elder brother is a man, I am not telling you to become such a man that you should become ill-mannered, I am telling everyone that you should give another word to you that brother, I understand everything, I know everything that  You are shouting, you are shouting, this is coming from fear and this fear is this and this fear is your wrong, you will not be able to control me, tell me that I should hit her with the dialogue that I am a ship of the sea, sorry, I am a ship  Of  I am a bird, a ship is sailing in the sea, there is a bird beyond that, no matter how much I have to fly to come there, then say darling, you are my ship, I will eat, I will fly a little and come back to you, so why should I be controlled?  As for water, I will drink only this water. You cannot drink sea water. There are no islands far away, so start giving the feeling to your boss, mother, wife, children that where am I going, why are you controlling them.  tell me brother you are here  You have gone to the beach in the desert for a walk in Rajasthan. Pick up the sand and put it in your fist. It is said that when you close your fists tightly then this beach starts coming out of them. Go anytime, pick up the sand and close it tight here.  It will start coming out from here, wherever it is, and if you open that fist, not even a drop will fall down. Tell me, don't tighten your fist, I am the one whom you open.  It will remain, tell me you will tighten it, I will disappear, why are you controlling me? Will you talk like this? People will not get angry with you, they will be surprised. Embarrassment increases. You know, no one can get angry with me and someone else is getting angry. Tell me, why are you doing this brother, what benefit will you get, tell me, I am yours, I am your slave, what work do you want to get done, this is not in my control, it is in my control, get it done, talk like this.  Why don't you say, I am not in the mood for this, I do n't have the expertise, if anyone gets angry at you then it is because you did not do the work or did it poorly or did not do it on time or did not do it well, so be very care about it.  Tell me, nothing will be done by shouting. Tell me, I will pay your children's school fees. Tell me, what idea is he giving? What extreme example am I giving? Tell that person, this is how I can be off.  Use to you do n't shout at me because shouting at me is not going to give you any results I am not going to come under control I am smoke Don picture's na I am smoke Where can I control the smoke How will you control the smoke then it will go anywhere ok  If it is, then become smoke, whoever makes you and people angry directly, do not remain silent, address it there, if it is public, if it is happening publicly, then keep quiet.  Leave it, but go and meet him alone and tell him, brother, why are you so angry? Well, you were scaring others, what are many people under your control? You are vulnerable, you are decent, you should shout so that everyone else comes in line, as if they are not.  There are robbers, Gabbar comes, one half does so much, the rest all fall in line, there are many such Gabbars roaming around, we have to call out that brother, I am Veeru, it is okay, I am not.  I will leave you, okay, you have chosen the wrong man, whatever you want to create your kingdom of anger and all these things, you create it somewhere else, okay, don't kill me, tell your wife like this, tell your parents like this too, brother.  Sisters, never tolerate anyone's anger, but you should know the reason behind it, if there is fear, then the one who is angry is a cowardly person and does not get angry with a cowardly person. Understand my point, he gets angry with the one who is afraid.  He remains like this, he is completely relaxed, he was the villain of old movies, haven't you seen Ajit and he had ever seen him getting angry, he has spoken, he is the real fear, you should feel not only emotions, he is relaxed, that means bring his mother, okay.  He is still becoming a hero, should he bring his wife? Should he bring his girlfriend? When the girlfriend comes, she says that he is not even scared of his girlfriend, no problem. Then the second Robert should bring his mother.  When mother and son come, the guns of all the heroes fall, they have to be intimidated by them, they have to be intimidated by the people of Chillam Chilli, they are afraid of Chillam Chilli because in that movie, why were those villains so powerful, they had no fear. If he was not afraid, he would not have shouted. Do you understand that I have to come up with an example from yes? I hope the audience is getting a little entertained and also learning a little. What should I say? I want that where there is fear, there is chillum chilli. If in your house your mother-in-law and sister-in-law are chillum chilli, both of them have fear. Address that fear. The wife is afraid that she doesn't know whether the husband will remain mine or will leave her. The mother doesn't know the fear. Our service.  He will not do it and the more resources the son has, the greater the fight beyond that. Till date, I have never seen a daughter-in-law and a mother-in-law fighting over an unemployed, unemployed son who drinks liquor. There, both of them are united and crying over their fate. Hey daughter, you are teaching in the school, how will I survive by sewing my clothes? Now that they have grandchildren, they have only this income, there is a big fight going on there, where there are resources, where there is fear, because there is no fear there.  How can there be any fight now, what is there to fear, he neither earns nor does any work nor does anything, so there is no fear of losing anything, he himself is useless, he is so big, where the IET has become a good package, the good one has arrived there, look, everyone needs trouble. What patterns are you seeing in it, will you yourself reduce your anger now or have I given a shield to those who get angry? Brothers and sisters, at the end of this video, you can now write in the comment section. Yes, just like the old ad used to come at 11:00. Before this, I was quite upset, then I watched Amit Sangwan's video in which he told about anger. Since then, my life has changed a lot. Now I have become a different person. If you keep writing like this, my moral will increase. Do it. Write down if you got something to know, to know something different, to know something better. Next Time Anybody Shouts At You Don't Be Afraid Because That Guy Is Afraid A dog is cornered. When a dog is cornered, he is scaring you or he is scared. Imagine if you have ever been reared by a lion, a lion runs like a dog and will eat you straight away, okay, you understand what I am saying, next time one is even bigger, I am not cowing, there is no cowing.  The angry on you you can be. The more someone is shouting at you, the colder you become, the quieter he will become and he will become more afraid and then console him. We have to help him find out what the fear is about, address that fear, then only he will become a Friend friend for life and next time one sees you and she sees you, he will not get angry and let me tell you one thing, when your life becomes like this, no one gets angry at you.  In fact, wherever you go, people welcome you with such a smile. There is a huge increase in productivity in life. This is a very personal experience. I am telling you that it is okay that no one gets angry. It is okay and yet there is a person who has no control.  There is one half like this, you will get it, you can shut it off from your life, it is easy, now you will say no, it is a very close person, yes, it can be done even to the closest person, I will also tell you the methods for the same, how did you like telling this video, is it okay for you?  Share it, send it on family groups and forward it to whoever is angry, your mother-in-law, your mother, your boss, speak with hatred, don't know what nonsense he is talking, sometimes something like this is fine, forward it anyhow.  Get it done indirectly, reach them somehow, those who are angry and those who are angry among you, I have told you the way to reduce your fears, please go and address your fears.  Why are you doing this, friend, what are you afraid of, address that person, you are getting harassed by the person who collided with you, that is Sintmobile."

    "title": "How Diwali Boycott Geopolitics Has Changed Now ？ [9khxRVQMUhQ].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, this Diwali, we always link geo-political situation and Diwali. Forwards started coming to us on Diwali, a few days before Diwali, that we should not buy Chinese girls this Diwali, that thing is missing, so what has changed, so the channel will give you a little information.  You know politics remains geo-political, the first observation is mine, is it yours or is it not, then today I would like to tell on this, according to me, it is the most cunning one.  Which country is it and which country's products should we avoid and which country should we boycott? As a citizen of our country, this is my own theory and opinion. It has not been leaked in the market yet and it may happen now.  Talking about things, I will also tell you the name of that country and you have to watch this video carefully and if you agree with it, then you will write A, if you disagree, then write Disagree, the name and logic of that cunning country and  I will tell you region wise, the name of the country which has made the whole world crazy is United States of America. I have been researching for a long time for a video which I have promised earlier also that Indians will be encouraged to go out and in that  Many things keep coming and that video is yet to be made because there is no simple answer to it whether one should leave the country or not go out, then who should go where should one go and for how long one should go, many questions, one video.  I answer me  It will take time to do but I have discovered that the United States of America is a cunning country but even in our country people will not call out because it has done so not only in India, not only today, across the world, across the last 50, 60, 80 years. They had thrown these atomic bombs and they had emerged the power. They have bought many people, we have to ask one thing as Indians, the bureaucrats who have all their power.  Live and from politicians whose children work, study, are citizens or are living in the US. One thing will help you because I know this video can give chill to many people because the lobby is very You are China, look at the kind of friendship you have maintained with China, even if the leader goes and talks to you, he gets declared anti-national. Who is this lobby? I say that if someone lives in our house then he is my neighbor.  Brother, I want to live with him, it is useless, it is good, very good, it is very useless, he will come with me in happiness and sorrow, but at a distance, some uncle is sitting, Sam uncle ji, he is telling the world that he has made the world crazy, America is instigating wars everywhere. He wants a problem everywhere, the solution is not there and where two people are fighting, he comes, hey, why are you fighting with your hands, take this braid, take the money, give the money, it is a very good braid, so he will buy one braid, then that is fine. hey he will say  You take the gun, you take the pistol, it is better to kill than the pistol, he took the pistol and you take the cannon, you take the cannon, you take the ship, you take the ship, you take the drone, you are taking drones worth Rs 500 crores, still you are misbehaving.  Hey, if we understand geo-politics even in a childish way, then we all have trouble with China, we all play children, India is a child, China is a child, and for whatever reason, it is theirs.  Now China's hut is America 's hut, that is, if China and America's hut is there, if it is like what happens inside the class of children and India and China's hut is there, then India should be America's abba abba, okay then India and their  Abba Abba is not there, I am telling this by taking the example of children, America shows its eyes to us there also, this Nijjar case has happened, that Pannu case has happened there, Utcha has its own amazing thing and we are here because  What is the matter, why am I doing this, because our dispense session is that BJP does what the public wants, it is smart politics, now the public has kept the public like this, the people of India do not see anything anti-America, they feel it.  Is America our friend or is it okay? Will Trump win? Harris, if anyone from our side wins, what benefit do these people take from India? There are Indians there, so what should we do with them, he is not theirs, he is an NRI and not theirs, so he should go there.  NRI  What about going there and photos and all that will come, I wanted to meet Modi ji, I just touched Modi ji, saw that something like this is going on, I also came to know that maybe they had taken it from here, even the people there don't do this, fact.  Brother, we have no benefit from SA country, if America moves towards de-dollarization, then it is better for Putin Mr. Jinping and our Modi ji. We will do our own program here. What is America growing vegetables, what else is it growing? We just have to buy weapon systems of weapons and why do we have to buy them because we have to help each other, one poor country which is India is poor even today, one poor country does not become rich in thousand dollars, the other very poor country which is Pakistan is very poor right.  This is our stupid understanding, but the public cannot say anything because their people have been set, here we don't know who all have been set and keep playing the shoes but he has done this, he has done that.  did it do it  Keep terrorizing everyone everywhere, Israel will continue to do Humsa and that one, its left goon does it there, we cannot say anything against Israel, we cannot speak against it, because by gathering these rest of the M world, a separate system was created.  Hey, the whole stupid world should sit down once and say, let's do one thing for four years, let's boycott America and don't use dollars, let's use our own silver and gold.  Let's use it and then see if there is some peace, if it doesn't happen, then we will fight. Give a break for two to four years. Tell him, brother, what happens like you, what happens in homes, I am explaining it very simply, some aunt or the other.  Yes, uncle, uncle, must be some relative of someone, he always comes and sets fire to the family, and then keep fighting, keep fighting and everyone will keep giving him respect because he might be a rich man or a knowledgeable man or a powerful man or a person with resources.  the one  Everyone will want something from him and he has set everyone individually but it is also a fact that brother, if she comes, there will be discord inside the house but this Diwali, let's boycott American products, let's boycott America for a change, let's have this sentiment that this What is this misbehavior with us, this Trump will come, Trump is my friend, what system has been created that everyone is engaged in sycophancy of America, why does it mean Xi Jing?  Talking to Bing is like kneeling, this opposition also speaks like this, in all the politics, whoever is in power or in the opposition, America keeps setting the narrative so that it does not change, you are understanding that friendship does not go wrong. By mistake, he will create such a situation in the country that the leader of the country will not be able to do it even if he wants to because these people have that sentiment everywhere, they control everything through social media, brother, you people have to see and understand that what is mine, you have to understand it completely.  Now!  Realization came that where is this channel of mine, it will be like this but never mind, I got the realization that if you are saying so much, what will happen to it, so brother, okay, see, you see, within the US, you yourself are very independent.  There, a man's freedom is considered very strong, but this is what you need to do, what progress has the country made, on what basis has it done so, was intelligence born there, was intelligence not born?  They have increased the intelligence by attracting India. Whatever our country India is, it is because of the Indians. No American came here and made this country better, no Chinese made it better, no Russian made it better, wherever we have reached it is ours.  People are there, we are on our own as we are, we will progress further, we will still progress, but America has attracted the cream of the world and they have created their own system and they keep it running, I am saying this. What America has done, can we somehow stop our cream here or will we take pride in this? Only Nadella is our son, the beautiful back is ours, no, he is not ours, brother, he is not ours, he is also a citizen here. No, she earned all the money here by force, wherever anyone goes, Sunita Williams is our name, no matter what happens, Kalpana Chawla was ours, we will make everything ours, we will make everything ours, if she becomes Kamala Harris here now.  If you accept the President then Kamala Kamala means Kamal Kamala means BJP BJP Kamal Kamal Kamala We will narrate any story, we are so crazy asking everywhere such sycophants are engaged or not we should go to them and fold their hands like this, keep some attitude brother.  They will also need us, this has not been shown yet, I will not say that the Government of India is not doing this but we as citizens are not supporting that thing as much as the government may need it, this sentiment is telling. If slogans like these go out like this, do it like this, do it like this, then that too will be shaken more. Whenever we took oil from Ukraine, I am saying to Ukraine, sorry, we took oil from Russia, it felt very bad, but we must stand.  So we will take your friendship so strong, you are sitting somewhere in America and you will need us more than anyone else, but we have shown this convincingly. If you have to fight, then I am saying that keep brotherhood with Nepal and Bhutan. Keep brotherhood with Bangladesh, keep brotherhood with Myanmar, keep brotherhood with Sri Lanka, try with Pakistan and China too, I told them not to try because it is with us, these individuals are spreading the chaos of not knowing America.  Here, America had to port something to Bangladesh, but Sheikh Hasina ji did not do that. You came to know about the theory that there was a need to contain China. Hey brother, listen.  They used to say that we have to play with the shoes of such huge Himalayas, India is in the middle of China, nothing has happened historically culturally, brother, culture is in China, culture is in India, there are anti civilizations, we are Asians, our thought process is of a kind for children.  The heart beats for the family The heart beats for the family What is different about America What is common with us And we are busy sycophating about America The Great American  ng US is great yes US is great but it is great for it's not for other world then it will be great for itself, it will be Chaudhary in its place, we have no use of it, sell weapons, spend money, blackmail and remain bossy  What are you talking about bossy brother, if you print so many dollars dollar after dollar then what is the point in printing dollars, keep printing dollars, if India prints unlimited rupees then its value will fall.  In Venezuela, you saw that if you print currency notes then the value of the currency does not remain, but in America, because of every big deals, till date I have not understood that if India has to trade with China, Russia or even Bhutan, it has to do with Australia. Brother, if you want to buy oil then why do you have to do it in dollars? Brother, no you dollar means neither you America nor I America, do it among yourselves, no currency fluctuations and this is difficult brother, thousands of years ago when spice used to go here to Kerala.  I used to go from the side and from my Western Ghats, only gold was available everywhere, take gold, take silver, trade in something else, do services, do water, make any system, friend, take Bitcoin, crypto from me.  Do it, trade in anything, make something else. Why has the dollar been made so expensive? Because when Iraq thought that I will use oil like this in the dollar, then it reached there with Weapons of Mass Destruction. Ask someone.  America will also catch him in danger Only one thing remains that whatever my dollar is, it should keep running because the dollar is Uncle Sam because the dollar is ours, when it is said that your brother's coin runs fine, then that brother 's coin runs and brother, if he is the biggest then he is the least.  Stop doing this puja, cast doubt on your America and America, don't do America. My friend who came from America, those politicians are also doing it. Our Modi ji is also doing it, but politics depends on what is the sentiment in the country. The sentiment in the country.  back Been very much against China for last year, Modi ji did not meet him, now there is a need to meet Xi Jinping, we made some friendship because we had to do it in diplomacy, America is showing its eyes, it is showing more eyes, Lal is becoming a hero, so it was a very good thing.  Whatever is good should be celebrated and this time we have seen that by selling goods worth Rs. 2 crores, neither you nor they were teaching us the same lessons as China, all these things are made by us. Whatever comes in the way of manufacturing is fine, but it is not telling you that brother, buy from there or buy from there, then give a little to India, as they say, wake up customers, wake up Indians, wake up Indians, our government has brains, but the government is openly corrupt.  An independent citizen cannot say anything, I have said anything, you can say it, you can say it all, we can move, we don't have a government, we can speak, we can influence.  If we can, then if we do it like this then the government's hands will be strong because the government wants to do it but the government can't speak. You understand that the government also wants to do it. Big people want to call out. So friend, say this brother, listen. If you give respect, you will get it.  And this useless hero panti of yours will not work, if it works then we are not afraid of you and whatever you want to do, uproot it, keep this attitude then you can call the bluff otherwise forcefully.  Like it did not happen in the old times, someone became a landlord and the rest were bonded laborers, give us a little, they live like this, stop living like this, man, what great shakes they are, nothing is being done there, even there there and there.  They have set up the economy, stock market, everything of their own, and other wise, no country has taken as much debt as America has taken, but they are not afraid because they have printing machines, knock knock knock knock.  Knock, knock, knock, that is what Rahul Gandhi ji says, here, knock, knock, America does the knock, knock, prints notes by pressing them, and the value does not fall, because a gun has been placed on the world's radar to run it, so you all have to understand this.  Like us, we will make one or two things and leave them because this is a sensitive issue. It is too big for me not to become a propagator here, but if it is a small thing,  It is said that no law should be lit, do n't even say a spark, you have to light a small lamp that I have lit it, you spread this lamp and have doubts, don't have visceral trade for China, China is not like this, no, they did this there, they did that, they did this, they did everything  Yes, just keep doing 2000 years throughout your life and America will keep supplying you and then everything will be fine. Even if you don't make friends, Vajpayee ji used to call his neighbors S.A.  Country we can't choose and neighbors, we have to live with them, even if it is useless, we have to persuade, but here you friends are trying to spoil his name because if America has to set China, then it thinks that India  But India has always been independent, what is there in India, no matter how much a person tries to become Chaudhary, it is such a big country, some views come in it, then they see that yes whom can we take.  The biggest thing I am telling you is, check the children of the bureaucrats, you all will meet in America, India, whoever is of age, even 2 years old, has not gone. Look at the big businessmen, they are the grandchildren of even the top businessmen.  They want to be born there so that they can get their citizenship, that country has controlled it so much, I will never advise any Indian to move to America, this thing is very clear to me, stop applying for America's visa. Stop going to America, those so called dreams of America are not there, the education there is very good, their education has gone to hell, that education is not good, they have created the ecosystem there like a rich boys club that you will take it here, no, what, what, what?  The great thing is that he is a Stanford student, after studying at Harvard in youtube4, he works in India and spends his time somewhere in Gurgaon, Bangalore, then what is his benefit to us, what is the benefit to us and if he  The knowledge of two paise in me is actual and hard work. All the slides are beneficial for you. If you are benefited then practical knowledge like me teaches you different things, be it finance, relationships or life. If it is any thing then don't get it first. Let us also make the world an opinion.  We have to become a leader and we have to do it slowly, we have to become subtle, here we can do it by making a lot of noise but we have to do it quietly, don't buy America's products, don't buy anything, America, boycott America.  Tell me, you will buy from us, you don't have a choice, but we will not buy anything from you, we will not come to you, we will not spend dollars, this is 700 billion dollars, it is okay that you have collected it and stop performing the aarti of dollars, it is simple.  Increase your gold reserves. Okay, own gold, own silver, see where silver is going. Follow Russia. Russian bank is now buying silver in large quantity. See where silver is going.  4 Dal is probably touching, has crossed lakhs of rupees, I think it can also date, no advice, but I feel that silver is going after silver, a separate video will be made for silver, how do you guys like it? Tell me in the comment section whether you have understood this thing or not. I like America very much. America has created a world in the last 70 years wherever it has gone and Raita.  Ca n't wrap up, in 2002, America brother went to Afghanistan to remove Taliban, stayed there for 21 years and when he left, he brought down Taliban, why did he go there? If someone asks, because he wanted to taste his own, wanted to try his weapon system. Attack people openly, do live test on people, brother, how will you check the effectiveness of your so ferocious bombs, how many stones break, houses collapse, people die, how does he do all the work?  This is more fun, does anyone have the courage to open his mouth in the world and take up a bigger cause that he is a bad person and by doing that, America has fooled everywhere, America has fooled every country and keeps on fooling. But brother, if the next one has shown his attraction like this then you have to understand and see what you have to make an opinion of America. I say this, don't have a  Positive opinion, this is my recommendation and see their parents, see where they have gone and what they have done. They went to paytam there, that was to me, first they were holding the back of Russia, then you calm down, you are a program of Russia. Gaya went from 8 to how much it was in 89, now it has been 35 years but it is not going to last, then if Russia is there, then it was rubbish, then it found China, then something of China.  If it happens then they will find someone else and by making some bad boy in the world, now China has invested so much, US cannot mess with China anyway, China has bought so much of their debt and if it does then it will become a class of economics in its own.  That's how they like this and they are fooling the world Sara that you do something, it is dirty, it is dirty, I am not asking China to perform Aarti here but I am saying that  You are like this, are n't you? Someone has taught you that this relative is bad and this relative is good and there is no benefit from the good relative and the bad one is not that bad and maybe if you get some benefit from him, then save yourself a little.  Also, as if all these things become of a big level then they will do whatever is shown to them. They attacked us in 62. Yes, they did, so I don't know the whole story of it. Why did you do it, what did you do?  What was happening before that was ahead  No one will come and tell because many skeletons come out of it. So yes, our war happened in 62. How many years have passed? No, then in Galwan, yes, Galwan happened, then what to do next, how to move ahead and America fought with us. Yes.  I will give you the documentation as to what harm he is doing. You all write to me from here if you have any doubt that my friend is sitting one country away and has no borders with anyone, it is like a stick.  There is no spoon in the shikanji, he rotates it like this and they all keep rotating like this and then as soon as there is some peace, he rotates it again, it has nothing to do with it and suppose someone lives there, then he is just rotating.  It is like this, it rotates everywhere everywhere, nothing is known as to why this is happening, meaning India and Pakistan go to talk about peace, our Prime Minister goes to Nawaz Sharif and within five days it happens in Pathankot, so who said, meaning that. Nawaz Sharif ordered in Pakistan  After four days, go to Pathankot and think that the Prime Minister has come, I don't know if they become friends, they went to Nawaz Sharif's house so that the opposition also gets a chance, you had gone there and made friends, then that is prime. What should a minister do? That's the power, many things are not in one's hands. Brother, things are not in the hands of the country because things are done like this, because now who is the power, who is the Illuminati, who is the power that never wants peace because if it happens then it will happen.  Who will ask him, who will ask Fupa ji, America has become the uncle of the world, its uncle should be exposed a little, that is I think is the message and it will come out in such a way that when the citizens will become vocal about the things and you can share this video.  Will do this with people and an opinion will be created, a doubt will be created that if you apply your mind even a little and study, how many examples can be given 150  Examples can be given: 1960, 1970, 1980, when it was being settled here, then where was it coming? Who supported Russia in 1971 or which Seventh Fleet did they send? Look at their track record, what did Henry say to whom and what did they do?  They have been extremely smart for their interest and America works for their interest and it is good and Indians  Should find their interest and work accordingly and be smart. Friendship and enmity should be seen very thoughtfully that who has been fooling you for how many years and whether it is working or not but I am angry about this thing. Buying a drone worth 50000 crores. Even after ordering it, he did not keep quiet, so the man thought that there is a limit, isn't it okay, you have done it, you have become so fond of all the things and whatever, so this is it.  Something like people have to understand that friend, what does this mean, what are you trying to do, you are also ordering from you, if a man is keeping you in good humor with lets, then will you bow down, rub your nose, this Diwali, this is a thing that we are in the country lets. Now call out the bluff of Mr. Sam and just because some of our brothers have gone there to work, have interest or are the children of bureaucrats because there are many people praising them like  Only America will cast some will come, many will come to whip, many will come to whip because there is direct interest, what is mine, my interest is mine, this is what I am saying, on whom I am speaking, where is the company, brother, I too earn dollars, my  So the dollars come from there, but now you are understanding, I am also daring, otherwise you cannot do it, you have sent your children to study, you have got the degree, now you should come or are you still singing its praises, they are not in India. So what is the use of that degree?  If my child is working there then I will sing the praises of America. America will keep everyone's children and everyone is sitting like this that now no one can say anything to America because they kept Korea's children and Korea did not open its mouth.  It is true that someone has taken care of Australia, they have taken care of Pakistan, they have taken care of India, Sri Lanka has taken care of Bangladesh, so whoever is an influential person, who is sending his children to America on the donkey route.  It is sending people to Ivy Colleges to Harvard, Stanford etc. It has some value in India as well. The section here keeps creating a narrative that I have hope in everything. Whoever takes this pledge will take a vow that We have to keep our interests ahead of India and our interests keep wearing. There are no permanent enemies, no friends here and neither should there be any. We have to make the country our own and it's time to do so. We will continue to do so in our local politics now.  After Diwali, we have to concentrate on Maharashtra also, there is danger there too, some of the same stories are coming up and others don't know the syllabus but there will be interesting elections, we will talk about there also after Diwali, but I thought it is important to tell this today.  This Diwali, perhaps it was necessary for us to awaken this insight, so please like the channel, subscribe, share it and do write your opinion in the comment section. Thank you very much."

    "title": "How Does Indo-Canada Geo Politics Affect Us ？ [Y21609jnWpQ].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today we will discuss what is happening in India and Canada, okay, they dismissed one of our diplomats there, okay, we also got retaliatory action done, you must have already heard a lot on this, you also know its background, I don't think much about it.  I will go because what I care about is what is the direct impact of these things on our lives and what will happen and what is happening and will we analyze it properly. My IM is so that the practical audience can understand it.  He should not go only after taking GK, if you are not preparing for UPSC and you are not preparing for UPSC then it is a matter of current event and something is happening, what is making us fit 3 4 10 days later  Then something will happen but it is very effective in the long term. I am trying to tell you that and you listen to it carefully. Some of these relationships are accidental. I want to tell some information without making personal attacks.  There is something wrong with Ludo ji, there he is made to fast, he is also called nepotism type, his father was also the Prime Minister, he is the child of the Prime Minister, has he recently got divorced or the proceedings are correct?  He is married to his wife and has three children. With their love, why am I talking about personalities? Because sometimes even in the bigger picture of a personality, one should know about the brave person who is coming. Now, his mother was also diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I don't like to tell about any medical condition of any woman, but I have to tell about something which is not being shown on other channels and is not being shown on other channels, so that is different for her.  You know that he is giving it by painting, but I am also discussing something else, what are the things, what is power, what is indifference, what is power, why is he doing vote bank politics like this, votes are needed, there is something there. this is qatar element  There is a link with India and Indians, our government has been giving hints for many years, not this one, but it is not an improvement, if you see that this event has taken place and the fundamentalists there are at the event.  That event had happened many years ago and it was some other party, that party has given priority to that party, now there is some other party here, okay and this party had nothing to do with time, time has some power politics and agenda of its own and it's her kind of [ __ ]  Well, it is not normal, it means your fight was in this house, there was a neighborhood inside this house, you were here, you had a fight with him, he vacated the house and went away, now if someone else comes to the house, will you fight with him because now he is in the house.  There was a fight with him, no bitterness or whatever bitterness there was, and you also have the power to be friends with him. You understand, I am telling you like an example, Trudeau ji's mother was also divorced, Trudeau ji is also divorced.  Mother got married to Divorso for the second time too. She got divorced in the second marriage too. I will repeatedly say, 'Hey, why am I linking like this to someone, I am not doing that to anyone, but tell me a background, I have been to this when father was the Prime Minister.  Then mother is the Prime Minister, the same is going on with the wife too, so when personal issues are going on, then the world is not so conscious, wisdom and discretion, there is pressure, you understand, personal matters are more important than that.  Because there is a fast there too, Canada has nothing to do with it, respect it even if it is not next to it, it did not even ask Canada, in a way the satellite is the same country, it has nothing in itself, anyway, it does not have any brother.  It doesn't seem that he has any story of geography because at the bottom it is him, so he is Munna Bhai and he is of circuit type, so as he is Munna Bhai, his circuit is fine, so what effect does it have on us?  What effect does it have and what should the rest of us do?  Those who are doing wrong and what I am trying to tell is to make this thing inferior, many people are showing it as Tiger 3 Pathan type, it has been done, they will enter there and do like this, oh brother, no one has claimed it.  They are saying that it has been done like this, they are saying that there are allegations that the Indian State has done this by taking the names of all its elements, now who knows to whom this has been done, if you look at their articles also then you will find criminal events and  If there are activities, then it is such an allegation, we have come with this, there is credible evidence, there is no credible allegation, the Prime Minister is standing in the Parliament and saying this, if there is evidence, then it would be a big thing that you have evidence, if there is evidence, then show it, then evidence is nothing.  You don't have anything credible to speak against anyone. Till date, there were programs like Mossad and theirs, so if Indian is that, then look at it in a way, then Tata.  Tina is ours but there is no need to jump on it, there is a silent relief by doing such and such on the news on YouTube channel, any country does something, it is a silent relief, there is a silent relief because we have many children there, that's why I tell.  Since I have been there for six years, it is affecting us, not only from Punjab, but now from Haryana, they are directly affecting me, so I am worried, that is why I am telling because I do not think that relations with this country are ahead of us right now.  are going to get well soon Because that vote bank politics will continue, whether it is the next one or the next one, okay, our children are there in the journey because if at the country level, if something like this happens at the country level, then the people there have gone.  Why won't he travel and the one who is a so called citizen of Canada or is going further to Canada also you see yourself because the one who is intelligent is the one who also has the table, sometimes what happens isn't it sometimes we have to write.  on d  Wall is not known. 1947 Partition happened on 15th August and the country became independent, so it is not that it was a airplane plane, it was a concept plane and earlier it was not known what was going to happen but people just react and start sitting in the train when  The mutiny has started, those who were taken out before the war, I am giving this hint to myself and my people, please calm down friend, do not harm our children, if your child is your own there then you  They will create ruckus, the state is doing something of yours, your leadership is doing something of yours, absolutely right, we are with them, whatever is happening, but we are among the intelligent Indians, we are not these foolish people, no one knows anything, credible allegation was said there, no evidence 3  It's been 4 months since the incident, how did I know anything further, nothing was told to me, she felt like chilly, the car and ship broke down at a human's place, no one asked, I stayed here for 2 3 4 days.  As soon as we go there, we adopt it as if we say, I will teach you a lesson, how should I teach you a lesson, I will teach you this lesson, do less of this, it is such a big country of ours where everyone is saying Namaste to India, because if you want to ask many people from India, then do this.  Canada does n't have much to do with it, that's why it is doing like this and unfortunately I will make it big. We don't have anything to do with these terms of import and export. Our children are settled for the sake of education and their GDP.  They contribute, pay taxes there and reduce taxes there and now let's see if they have any feeling for the passport there or for India, if they have any feelings about sending the child there, see, there were six.  This is the way you do us, maybe you are doing the same there, do that and go to some other European country, whatever story you want, whatever story you want, which is my personal opinion, we also have a famous actor in Canada, isn't he?  He was also roaming around with a passport and had become a Canadian citizen for many years. You would know that there is a question of GK. Write in the comment field. Who is that actor? Famous actor, now he has come back to his home again. He will return home to India. Now he will become a citizen of India.  They went there with this very good thought but they also stayed there with great taste, I feel that I have become an outsider, I will get something good, this will happen, that will happen brother, how can you keep it in the country when your relatives are from your country.  Spoiled means how happy  You can live in this way and there is a moral obligation from within, that country has to have this feeling for you, now you go there and want to eat their bread and serve them and give them fun, that is yours.  They are paying taxes to them and those taxis are getting rich, so this is a call, it affects our citizens directly, which had created a Canadian dream of ours, I probably don't think so and it is not like any next government will come.  Next Prime Minister Bhai  This will always be an issue because when vote bank politics has started and it is visible, sir, our External Affairs Minister has also said that it is off and it is also visible, so if the votes will reduce, then Canada will go.  If the population there is not increasing, then the percentage which is increasing here due to which this political and appeasement is being done will definitely increase, so as much as they have control today, it is bound to increase tomorrow, it is not an incident, you understand.  It is a matter of 10 years, if you look at the horizon, then the answer is no, don't cry, if that too by staying in touch, I am staying in India the same way. I am saying that real estate bomb is happening in India, economic bomb is happening in India. Everything is happening in India because we don't know our geo-political situation, how will the world be after 15 years, so here too, keep on something, so much luxury is being lost and two breads of respect, yes.  It is better to live there instead of meeting there and then crying that now this is happening with us, all that will happen, they do all that and all those issues will come to face you, so it is always the baking of our country, never mother. Calling a child, even if the child forgets the mother, then look at how the next 10 years are going to be for you and those who are living there, who are thinking of sending, brother, 2004 is a country, in the world I thought of a figure, go up and down, caste is a country. become  We go to the ghats but there are more than 200 countries out of which we are not able to find the same country, which means there are many more countries, for the love of my life I am telling you, I have to go, sometimes what happens brother, I have to go, I am not enjoying it. So in Canada also, when the people will pink them, then they will know that the education system here is capable of doing this course, they are driving our trucks, so let them continue their story and those who are there, they are making noise.  can create chaos  Those who want scaffolding, those who do flowers because vote bank politics is there, so what is it that that one same party is sitting right, the rest of the people are not sitting, I am telling which de bachcha party brother this is this no way, you are at the level where the movie is right, your  In the country we keep saying that here it is like this, it is very good brother, say whatever you want, the story is very big, relatively, there is nothing outside and this is happening to you and you can see it in the video.  If you understand this thing  Please be aware of this, those children who are currently applying for these visas, discuss it once with mom and dad, discuss it with relatives, make it a topic of debate in your family group from the middle of this video because tomorrow when you will travel to Toronto, Ottawa and whatever.  They have big cities like Vancouver, there you have bought some houses, you have taken a loan, you have taken a loan, you will leave quickly, take a call, take a call, visa is valid from Canada.  Something less is going on with you, from Canada, I too, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Norway, Finland, Australia, okay, sometimes what happens to a man too, I have gone out, once it happens to me that we expel someone from the village, our village is very bad.  I love the village, I came to Gurgaon from 70-80 kilometers away, it's okay, it's okay, mother doesn't want to go and live in the village, it's okay, I love the village, there are kinships in the fields, I have to come and go, I'm very good, but mother doesn't do it, it's okay  Understandable, but you can change the city, if there is any difference, I am telling this on the basis of example, so my request and advice is that this is fine for me, look at this, I do not see the story happening further because it has been many years. Kanishk Bombing is going on, Shikhar ji had explained it in a very good way, okay, if you look at Kanishk Bombing, then you will get roasted from inside, how can a man offer so much like this?  He became casual and if justice was not done then that is the intention of the country which has been visible for some 40 years. It was just that the government has lost its dabang in de sense. Right now the leader does make a difference, ok so road dabang.  If yes, then now there is no nonsense, now the ability from India, you take nonsense from the world, it is getting reduced because as soon as the power of the country has to increase, this is what happens to the previous ones too.  There will be no sigh that brother, one has to speak as per his status, as per his status, now his status has been flooded, it is very good, now now we will get shore on the shore, it is okay, now it is not that you will come out from here, but now see, this is mine.  The message is fresh opinion which has a lot of room for life and by making it a topic of discussion in your group, you will understand the situation better, but what happens sometimes is that where today is the day, the person does not have this.  I would have known that I should be thrown out, the outsider does n't know anything here, but the one inside feels that wherever he gets it, it will be fine, no, how should I go, how should I go, how should I go, decision making happens but many people are not able to reject because of micro.  They get the time of a second, they think that it will not be recovered, where it will go back, it will not happen because they are projecting from the place, they are projecting the word, I will do it, it is not very easy but date decision making is you.  Happen to here reaction time note 1 second witch and half second witch is there in fat offline but it is decision you have to be made in b 2 months 3 months six months c wahan pe kya ho raha hai kuch party hai kya politics hai kya  Vote bank politics is P very-very clear. I have not made the video yet which I was speaking about now, I was always speaking, if you watch my previous episodes because this is a Netflix.  Is the series a long one or Buniyaad serial is Hum Log serial, I have started it, okay and with this, whenever you keep watching the episodes, whenever you get great pleasure in time, you get clarity, I told you, still we will be here. How crooked is our country, but I mean, there was an ad that was running, it's okay, so it's mine, okay, so this is a big thing, whatever will happen here, at how many levels, in such an open parliament, it's like it's speaking openly from inside.  It is said that India fell  No one should speak like this, my friend, as if till date no Prime Minister has told the story, so I say to my countrymen, to my subscribers, Rocky Bhaiya, please do okay from within, don't do chillam chilli, because when he used to do chillam chilli, our children would be very upset. Well then take action, this is the biggest problem in our country because of Hindi movies, they will understand the movies well and will circulate this thing that do whatever you have to do, but as long as our children are there,  Just your child is not there but many Indian Indians have children of your fellow citizens, so there is so much noise, they do this to you, they do this, they do this to their chests like this, they do this, it is very irresponsible, not to hug, but to speak.  Do n't ask to forgive anyone, but this wisdom should be kept well, this is geo-politics, this is very complex, take your action quietly at your level, when the action is completed, there is peace, then you can say what to do.  This is the message that I am saying so loudly that it gets repeated a couple of times. I am saying that this message has been delivered to you all. Please share this thing. Thank you very much."

    "title": "How Politics of Othering Worked Earlier But Is Following Law Of Diminishing Returns Now ？ [w5PlhRtsTWE].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today we will understand some politics, Politics of Adritha, played it and now it is not working, whatever is analyzed by me, it is not there, it is genuine, it is bad, there is nothing of good, we know how power comes and  Politics is politics, they say that it is not politics, you must have heard it a lot from the mouth of politician, don't do politics in this matter, there is politics in everything and there is politics in our families also, it will be better if we understand politics so that our  Don't be fooled, it is the job of the politician to fool you, to fool you, so today we will try to understand the concept of how this concept of 'other' works and what is the psychology behind it, so in this I will try to talk about three states.  I will include four states in the beginning, one is Uttar Pradesh and one is yours and in this I will also talk about the psychology of the people, who are caste specific, who belong to the community, Haryana and Maharashtra, elections are coming in Haryana and Maharashtra.  And you know that Uttar Pradesh is always political, so what is left of Adrang, that if you enter any state and find someone dominant there, separate them and consolidate the rest. For example, you will do to the Muslims in Uttar Pradesh.  These two are also from Muslims and these are Yadavs, they belong to Akhilesh, we will concentrate on everything else and if you can manage this more than 50 days, TMC also does the same.  Mamta Banerjee also says that Muslims are at 30. Out of 100 in Bengal, 30 are Muslims and the remaining 70 are Hindus. Whatever communities are there, you take vote bank at 48 and you swipe them because the rest is CPI (M), Congress and main BJP.  If there is, then the votes will increase in three or four places, but if I am 46 or 47, then Mamata ji will be among the four Hindus. If even one Hindu votes, she can keep one.  Whatever the party does, it gets the job done because 18 out of 70 i.e. one by four, 18 and 30, all of them are almost consolidated with you, they do other politics there, BJP did this in Haryana. When I studied Haryana and BJP was nothing, nothing happened in Haryana. When Modi ji was here in the 90s, he used to roam around on a motorcycle with Khattar Saheb. No seat was available for him. It was fine, no one knew him.  In fact, even after 10 years of BJP's existence, there is a joke in Haryana that the way this honorable sir will take cognizance, the narrative or the words are not understood by the people of Haryana that why are you speaking so much Hindi, why don't you talk straight for 10 years?  After this, if this is the situation then what did they do here? Jats are the most dominant community caste, so by separating the Jats from everyone else, they become Adrithas. They do this and look at the rest, they did that.  Picked up, separated the potatoes, separated the cheese, separated the chickpeas, no one can do this, they are undercurrents, everyone's identity is already defined differently and I will tell it in the best possible way because I teach higher order things, I am from here and you will speak.  You are against BJP, I like BJP very much, I don't like BJP's leaders, that is a different matter, well, the party and the leader, yes, the party leader can also be different because some leaders are imported from outside.  The thought process of the original people changes, I like the party, I also like the Congress very much, I like the whole party, the only problem is the leader, what is the problem in the party, the party does its intelligent work and what are the people like that?  This is also an example of being straight, I troll everyone here to do the same to me, I can do the same to the community, I can show the hypocrisy of people, how many classics are there now?  The poet is a lion slayer, not an actual lion, that one is fine, there are two people in Haryana, Jat and Yadav, okay remember, Jat and Yadav, okay understand the matter carefully, I will tell you a very deep thing, there are Jats in Uttar Pradesh too and Yadavs, Congress is the Jat of Haryana.  I am telling you openly that there is more inclination towards the matter, everyone knows it is true that Bhupendra Singh Hooda is the leader but the inclination of Congress is that elections will come now, there is no such thing as a secret in saying this.  I told you that the Yadav brothers of Haryana are on the side of BJP, Hirwal people, you can look at it, that is also a fact, but brother, what is this, they went to the other side of Yamuna, went a little 50 kilometers there and in Uttar Pradesh, there are Jats in Uttar Pradesh.  He belongs to BJP and Yadav belongs to Akhilesh. There is a friend of BJP in opposition. He is saying the right thing. Yadav of Uttar Pradesh is against BJP because power is needed. Wherever power is found, it will go there and there.  Jain ji, son of Ajit Singh, see how there is no problem there, no community belongs to anyone, don't do that among yourselves, no party belongs to anyone, everyone wants power, everyone wants Chowdhary Hut, brothers and sisters and this is someone.  This is not a bad thing, this is what I want to say and politics is done by separating this thing, the same BJP which is very dependent on Jats, Muzaffarnagar, Meerut BJP and here and Chau Saheb Jain Choudhary.  By doing this they will give Bharat Ratna, they will handle many seats there, but still some have managed and have made him a minister, he comes here and does other politics, this is what Maratha politics is, to offer Devendra Fadnavis, who is not a Maratha face.  There is always one who is non-majority so that they say that you will do your eyes, it is good politics but now it is not working. Saini Saheb is the Chief Minister of Haryana, Haryana belongs to his community.  I am a small group of people, what should I not become, should not I become the rest of the people, who are we, yes, this is democracy, anyone can become, when I say that % can become, then the population of 18 and 20 is 177.  There is a population of another religion in India, make them of another religion too. When you make so much, you have not given one MP there, you have not given one minister, you have not given anything anywhere, brother, no at all, but in other places we  Okay, so we will make Yadav the Chief Minister there in Madhya Pradesh and we will rotate him in UP. Look, we have made Saini ji also rotated. When elections were held in UP, look, we made OBC, you understand and the rest.  By doing this, this strange thing has now become an irritation in the society. It has seemed to the society that something too much is happening in it, now people are not feeling good about it. People are saying that jobs are also due to inflation and  There should be more talk about the middle class and taxes and inflation and all this, now this Adriya because I told you that people also have to become less cool, these politicians have to be like this, they come from Switzerland, they come from the public here, now the public has seen all this.  It is ripe because there is one more thing which is a dominant caste, it is a dominant community, if it reduces a little selfishness then Jats in Haryana become less selfish and Marathas in Maharashtra become less.  If one becomes selfish then leadership can come in a default setting and if these communities have understood this, Jats have understood this in Haryana and Marathas have understood this in Maharashtra, that brother, we have to become leaders, then we have to become everyone's, not that I am my own.  If I do anything for the community, it benefits the state and it also benefits the culture and people get connected because historically, if you look inside Maharashtra, look in Haryana, whatever was the equation. Caste is not today, even 2300-400 years ago, there were some tasks like fighting, dying, eating sun, mud, putting in effort, sweating, earning, shedding sweat. These people used to cast a particular caste and used to tell them to go or you can do it, however in Haryana no one is doing this.  Kind of Raj lesson and he was not Raja Waja, he was Peshwas in Maharashtra and he was Maratha and Maratha was a lot of umpire and there is a lot of history, he is a rich history, he is from Haryana as much as he is.  No, but this common thing that used to happen inside the village was accepted that brother, you can do it, relief was given in many things, there was profit and loss, people took advantage of it, communities also committed atrocities, all those stories too. But there is a default duty thing that brother, this merchant will do whatever the merchant does, this man will do whatever his work is, there was a balance in the society many years ago, I am not talking about today, I am fine, now everything is mixed.  anything happened I can do astrology. I am not. Sharma ji. Okay, anyone can do something because of technology. It is okay, technology can do things, it can do anything, it can do everything, but still it is established in the rural belt.  Now BJP will not understand in the times to come that if these people go towards Adriya and Bhaichara Better, they think that the leader should be of this caste, what is he doing, is he helping me in doing my work?  If I am in business  If I am a community, is my business growing? I don't care which caste one comes from, which community one comes from, who comes brother, if you let me work, then we come, I think we are moving there.  Think BJP should know this is happening and they should now think of a new narrative because this is not working anymore. This ad ring will not work. People are ripe because how many times have you heard the same thing.  You will do it in the same syllabus because brother, it has been 10 years since it has worked, now if the juice is not coming out of the sugarcane, then you will have to bring some fresh sugarcane or something else, now if you want pomegranate juice, then you will not have to add sugarcane, so the story will have to be different.  Because now they are saying that enough is enough, we have seen the results of religious places wherever they have come and the 10 seats that are happening in UP now, do the same there.  Yogi ji is following the same syllabus, brother, you cannot do anything with that syllabus, you will have to do something else, I am saying that it is like the same formula will not work anymore and the opposition is the same, how they have figured.  It's out and I am not able to understand that who will come to advise BJP, brother, who will tell you brother, Khattar Saheb, the middle class leader, was made here and had to be removed in 10 and a half years. Had to be removed after a year and a half and now their elections are coming somewhere, let's see how much campaigning they will do, yes, how many villages will they go to, then this is the thing because if you are a Maratha community, a Jat community, you cannot join a dominant community just because of it. Because the population is there, that much representation should ideally be given to everyone, I am saying make the 3rd person the Chief Minister, no problem. Brother, make the one on 1st level, but those who are on 28th or 30th, at least give some value, listen to them, there is no work left for the Sarpanches to go to the village, how many talks have been done with the female Sarpanch, there are videos of them, how are they now?  When the elections are over and the results are out then the post mortem will be conducted to find out whether you did politics. If you still speak now then I will be told that you are trite influence the vote which.  This is never my aim. I always want to remain as an analyst that when the result comes then do the same, I will not do it, I still want BJP to give close fight in Haryana and close fight in Maharashtra, only then it will be fun but whatever you do first.  So change all of them. What is the name of the candidates? Don't keep one candidate the same. I am telling BJP only to change all of them 100%. Secondly, communicate this from somewhere that there will be no politics of difference. Politics of difference is still visible and if I am saying that if Congress gives 10 to 11 seats to Rao Inderjit, Rao Inderjit is in BJP then it is okay and give him in Ahirwal and say bring Aarti ji, Deputy CM.  If this is done then the situation is clear, BJP will not get even 10 seats. If this happens then BJP will not get even 1015 seats. So you have brought it there too, Hirwal people.  Ko Yadav Yadav took them but did not consolidate there due to their different politics, either say that you are their top leader, Rao Saheb of Arwal belt, you are the best, you have this ticket, you respect them too, we, me, pen this day. Because I am a voter of Gurugram, our MP sir has been an MP for 20 years, I do n't know, he is an MP for the sixth or seventh time and even now he is the Minister for State and Khattar ji went straight to the cabinet, the rest are in the cabinet.  I gave it to everyone, you did not give them cabinet rank, what about the rest of them from Gurgaon, don't the Yadav brothers have any problem with this? What if Rao Inderjit ji forms his own separate party, will he not get eight or nine seats out of the 14 seats in the Ahirwal belt?  If he ca n't become a king maker, then I am telling here that all these possibilities can be there. Discussion with experts on Haryana elections, if you guys are interested.  I don't know how much is the audience of Haryana and how much is that of Maharashtra. This election is on 1st date, so there is still one and a half month, so if you people are interested in it, then let me know so that I can share with you the ideas that I have in politics.  Look at the change, you will say, he is doing amazing, he doesn't have 50,000 subscribers, what he says is seen happening, so what an idea, he doesn't have subscribers because he doesn't talk one sided. If I become a Congressman, they will come. If I become a BJP person, they will come. If I do n't know whose video it is after watching 50 videos, then whose name is it and not me? Brother, I belong to the country and I want to belong to the people of the country and I say that the people will help the people.  I want the politicians to have fun, or the politicians have so brainwashed the public that we cannot enjoy them, we have to have fun, nothing can happen, brothers and sisters, anything can happen in life, new Chief of Haryana  Who will become the minister according to you, write in the comment section, then they will start a discussion campaign, they will enjoy Haryana's elections and Maharashtra's elections, they will spoil the show and this is how the politicians' fun is enjoyed, how it is enjoyed and enjoyed.  How to take this please, this channel is for fun, for enjoyment, there is no need to take stress here, you are not of any party, you are a supporter of any party, faces.  But there should be a smile at the end of your video that yes, Guru ji, you are having fun, you should take it like this, everyone will enjoy cutting the glasses, we will take the pleasure of BJP, Congress, leaders and everyone, so you guys should enjoy everything.  I hope I explained it very well that the politics of this ring will no longer work and this syllabus is not working anymore, some more stories will have to be told, something else will have to be said, it was, it was too easy, it is done. They used to do whatsapp-web, neither can they make a difference in one thing. Now something has to be changed. Brothers and sisters, if you have run out of ideas, then I will tell the general public through myself.  I will give you an idea as to how a politician can be fooled, now not all the people watch my channel, that is why I am saying that if the public wants to be saved, then brother, increase the subscribers, there are only so many viewers, not many, so only you.  If you don't want to be fooled then I will give them ideas too. Now tell me that I am in this team and I will fool them too. The public gets fooled like this. Feed them round and round. It is okay. The public has to be very aware. They are always fooled. Every time you are made to cry, it does n't work, you can pretend to be intelligent, you do n't know why people are so helpless, these politicians don't belong to anyone, whose are you, whose are you, you are your parents.  Wife, brother, sister, mother-in-law, father-in-law, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, are you everyone's, are you theirs, everyone in the family has a brother, who belongs to whom, everyone becomes a fool, no one can fool the politician, stop crying, my aim is to ultimately make the public happy so that the public can taste it.  And please write in the comment section that there is demand from Haryana and Maharashtra, then we will discuss. Brothers and sisters, please write in the comment section. Thank you very much."

    "title": "How The Common Man Can Earn From Politics？ ｜ A Practical Perspective Presented [7ATFr4I8bUw].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, I want to give two good ideas to the youth. If you understand, then it is okay for you to tell. Be very politically aware, it has become very very important and don't stop at that, wherever you like, any party, any party's ideology or anything.  Also, start becoming political now it is high time and you are needed, I am telling you how those who are listening to me will start becoming political from technical areas, which are very smart, that kind of things.  Youngsters look like run-of-the-mill good guys who are in office. Such people have joined politics in the back end. I am here in the back end of politics. How is he our leader? Jai ho and he is there to spread the rally to get the shock. Brother, if we vote as workers then it is not that and there is much more that I want to tell and this will have to happen and many people are taking advantage of it and there is a lot of money in it, there is no shortage of money with political parties. No  I am telling this about employment and in a way, if you are politically aware, you can understand the issues and explain them, like suppose I am doing a lot of other work but my political awareness is very good, I can support any political party.  I can join comfortably at any level, I can bat for them, I can do it for anyone, I will praise him, the other one is bad, that is a different matter, I have chosen to you, no pick and choose my this. Sometimes I did this thing, sometimes I did it for him, I taught him, I am also earning money in my zone by doing independent work, okay but I am saying that if you have opened a political channel, then brother, there is scope and unlimited opportunity, this is the end. You are coming here just for the views. Do n't think that you are dirty like this, we are the ones who have to fix the politics. You must be watching so many videos here almost daily. Why am I making it so that India can progress at the level of thinking, that is why if you join any political party, if you are a youth or not a youth, brother, you are also a 45-50 person, you can also be a retired person, please.  Come and have an opinion and get into it Don't get into this hate weight thing that I'm that bad This bad which by the way is not you Pragmatic  After this, they have to tighten that to the political party, don't do this misbehavior, don't do this, it is getting bad, this is getting better, so you can also do a good moral work, it is not necessary that all the dirty work is done in politics, brother, they have to do it.  You also have to listen, no political leader wants fools below him, now when fools join, they do n't stay away from him that man, this is also a vote bank, how come but they are looking for young men and women.  Intelligent who can articulate their thoughts well who can be of help to them and can write to them means such a situation has become such that recently there was a tweet by the Prime Minister and he was writing something for Virat Kohli or someone.  It was found out that he was picked up by AI, now that is, look at the lack of talent of the person who is helping at that level, so here I am not speaking for the top leader but I am saying that look at the talent.  There is no and there talent should be ultimate then if you have talent then apply for it, this vacancy will not appear, this is a hidden job market, you will have to enter and search for it and it has genuine earnings, good earnings, it is fun, actually you will feel that  You are bringing some difference in the country and I am speaking positively, I am encouraging you to do good work here, I am coming here to make sixty knots.  For and that one did not say for politics, that politics is already going on and perhaps you will not even be included in it because it is based on caste, religion and who you are, whose and so on. There is no vacancy there but these people are in this space because  Now all the work is like ours, if it is okay then come here and we will tell you everything, then now that old idiot will not be able to come, they need genuine people who are also tax heavy, who understand the youth, who understand the people of today.  And understand today's issues because there is no political party, what will they do with that worker who does not have what is called good manners, cannot communicate in any language and can only say 'Jai Ho', but he is not the same in appearance.  It seems that this fact can bring 50 votes, there are many such workers and there are such cronies of the leaders that the leaders themselves know that after seeing their face, our voters will run away and even more chiptechs have been installed, this is also a breaking news so I am telling you.  This is a high time, there is a chance for all of you and it is a blue ocean opportunity, brother, there are many vacancies here, party as per your wish, I am not influencing the party here, now see which party is richer, you will get more money there, okay  If not then ideology is also something. What is there in idol ji that if you want to do good work then no political party does any wrong work on your face or anything like that, hence you can join any party and do good work there.  But I am also telling you that it is not necessary that it does not mean that I will get good work here, good work anywhere. Good people are needed in every party and the party people also know that we need good genuine people, so any party is there for your father and mother.  If you have a bonfire or if you feel like it or if you get an opportunity, you can join. I have seen many people working for one party and voting for another. I used to ask, how come Guruji says this, profession is important.  Just think that if you work in an AC company, then you will buy AC from that company or TV. If the company you work for sells TV, then you will buy TV from that company. Mobile phone. You can always work in you know one mobile phone.  And this thing and many, I have seen many people who work in a SIM card company and also have a SIM from another company, their private one is government, the official one has to be kept with that one, so it is ok. this check test  I went and counted how many cars are there in the raffle, which means I could not complete it even in such a short time, but that is not to taste the rice or to see once that all these things are there, I know many chefs, I am a foodie, I am fine, I am fine.  -If you are friends with a big chef, then you come home and eat the food prepared by your wife. I said, \"Dude, you cook it sometime.\" He said, \" Dude, come there and eat it at home, if you do n't feel like eating it at home, then don't eat.\" I said, \"You eat there.\"  If  I feel that if I were a chef, I am a foodie, then I would eat only what I had at home, but brother, many people, when they become real, then they do it like this, so datchi politics should be away.  Of course, this is work. Only when you are politically aware, general knowledge will increase. I want to make this channel a medium of money for you people. Don't do it like this here. Every channel of mine, my five channels, gives life to the audience in every channel.  I want to be taken up, not that I came and did something here, why are you, I am telling you these things, Idol ji, here and there, think of a way to tell good and bad, good of the country, good of the people, talk logic, absorb it and join.  I have an offer but it doesn't go away. I will lose my independence and I have to do 50 more tasks. Then what is the problem, brother, if I join someone and take money from him, then there is a problem that it is only him.  You will have to sing praises, otherwise you will face problems, then you will have to tell the person what to do, then it becomes a big stress issue for a person at my stage. Okay, so I want that I am like this but you people.  It can be told to brothers and sisters, please join and tell them that by joining, you are joining BJP as an example, you are electoral bonds, you have money, you will also give it to them.  Cell, I feel that there are a lot of vacancies, now I mean BJP people are losing the narrative like anything, so I feel that they should open vacancies, so if you go there, you will tell me that now they don't talk like this.  We will talk like this, we don't do this old thing, what has got us here will not take us here, this is a simple thing, so I am also telling the BJP people to tell the children, call the disciples of our channel, Guruji.  Apply from Gurugram, brother, come, because you must have seen me in every video or you will see me in the subtle way, I will give advice to BJP, I will give it to Congress too, I will also praise it, anyone bad can be made good, this is the truth of life.  There is no absolute truth, don't think that if BJP and these few top leaders and all these things are going wrong, then son, they are definitely sitting with a plate and here it is no no no, it is not like that, the absolute truth is nothing, absolute.  It's just like people have to be very very intelligent in asking questions. Wherever the leader's focus is and he will run away wherever the vote bank is visible, then the ruling party has to tighten it, but it is not that the opposition is not in power in any state.  They are also in power in many states and there too, they have spread so many evils that it has become such that they are nothing bad, black and white, so you can afford to join anyone. Anybody, I am giving free training here and you can enjoy the party for them. How many people do I know who work in Aam Aadmi Party, in Congress, in BJP too, how many leaders are there themselves, how many are Prashant.  If you look at Kishore ji, it is a politics and a profession, like those people of Godi media, this Rahul Gandhi, politics, hey, Rahul Gandhi ji will do politics and what else will he play cricket, meaning now if you call him like this then it is fun and if you accept it.  These Congress people and this one should take it okay. And let them know that this way of talking is also done. The simple truth is that Rahul Gandhi ji will do politics in everything because just like a doctor will do doctor in everything, chat account will do charter account in everything, it will happen like this and  What will happen is that every person will talk as per his own and will do his own work, this is the work and good politicians are being made. If someone is becoming a good politician, then say, you will do politics, then what to do? They used to roam around, then you did not leave them.  And  If the top leaders roam around, then it means this roaming around, right, what is that ghu, what is the meaning of that, it is like burning a little and it is also fun. The results of these things came out on June 4. Before that, on June 2, they were saying that they were Rahul Gandhi.  If you want, you will go to Italy, then you can see, you will go to Italy, Rahul ji, if you haven't gone to Italy, tell him about it in the comment section, now you can talk like this, okay, so just enjoy whatever you can, it is a different matter that nowadays.  means BJP's time  Poor guy, something is going on that they are having more fun but that time is limited, sometimes it will go for them and sometimes for them, so I am saying that you can always be in this domain, you can make money there is serious. Opportunity work will be taught to you and you can work with your ethics, there is no need to compromise, you say friend, I will talk like this, I will do only like this and if I do something else to me then So I will not get angry. I said yes, it's okay, but do n't answer this thing, but that's all right, no, unemployment, that's all okay, that's what happened at that time, I said, sin happened at that time, now tell me 2024, tell me, not unemployment but 1975.  Yes, a lot has gone wrong with the Kashmiri Pandits. Now let's talk about unemployment. I don't know what about unemployment. That guy runs away from everything, but like this.  Let it not happen, it has happened now, how 1947 partition, how to change the partition, now how should we go, Kashmiri Pandits were a big thing of the failure of government of India, today the government should not have failed, today the government should have been crossed, let's talk about government.  Why should we just say that whatever picture of Kashmiri Pandit has been made, how have they done it?  If ever anything wrong happens to anyone in this country, then the control of law and order lies with the state and central government only. Whose government was there at that time is the one to blame because if law and order is not maintained then you  If you demolish it then anyone will do anything. Now will you go and keep blaming him or not? Brother, he did it. Where was the law and order in the country? Where was the constitution, where was the constitution, wrap that up too. Whose party was it?  What was it, who was there, who supported whom, what were the times, who was the Home Minister, who was who, how and in what manner, then they will not discuss it completely because it does not suit to discuss it completely, it suits only to say that these people did it like this. Yes, he did it wrong, he did it wrong, then what do you want to do now, now we too are like this, this is how they will entrap you, it is justified to make a separate video beyond this, how they will entrap you, always get trapped in the talk, ask anything, Rahul.  Yes, I have gone there but why didn't Rahul ji go to West Bengal? Hey, he will go there too. West Bengal is why Rahul ji did not go because there is a Trimal Congress government there. If anything goes wrong there, Modi ji will not be amorous and Rahul ji's work will go to Moti ji. Have to do, that's why he did not go, is it true? Yes, then who said that nothing wrong happens in Bengal but he did not go? Yes, I am this. Yes, then you just say this question. Have you got the true answer? That is the work of that Rahul ji Modi.  embarrass ji They can do it, now who is stopping you, you also do the same thing, you used to do it too, now you have gone on leave, you are a BJP person, you also do it, find out, there is something wrong, you have come on back foot, you are looting all the bastards, helmets and helmets.  So here comes the politically aware man who is from my channel. Today Guruji's work is the same. Like I had seen an old story in our Chitra Katha that a Guruji was going like this, he was speaking to his disciple and some third child heard it.  I took it that the one who has the brain can become a tycoon from this dead rat, then the whole story was about that rat, he picks it up and goes away, then he gives it to the cat owner, then he gets money from it, then it was a story by doing it like this.  To Hama Hum To Bhi Jyotish Hain Astrologer Hain Hamara To Jyot Jagana Hai Ishwar Ki Ki Bhaiya Bahut Yehan Pe Hai You Can Be A Very Ethical Nice Person And Be A Consultant And Yet Control The Narrative In Favor  Off us ever you are working today I don't work for anyone as a disclaimer but there is money in it I can work, there are many offers but I have to enjoy both sides, then when you take the money of one then there is a problem. Secondly, you cannot call him anything, you can call him more privately, but you cannot say it publicly, but then there are a lot of people who do not come publicly, my brother, they are working in the back end and they are appreciated.  There are more people with brains in the political parties, they are valued more, otherwise brother, this is a good party with 12 crore workers, this party has 1415 crore workers, it is also sitting with 5 crore seven crores, what do you think, everyone's value is value.  It belongs to those who can think and I am saying this today because of what I have seen them now and I have realized that they do not have such great thinking which can become heavy on themselves.  They remain here, they do n't have that much knowledge, because now as powerful as they have become, they are no longer leaders connected to the ground, they don't even know what is happening in the college these days, what struggle the youngster is facing.  That youngster may know more, the professor may also know because he comes every day, the lecturer may know but an officer who is sitting on a position in the electricity department and he does not know what happens in colleges.  If you are not aware then you are a datchi, friend, it is not easy to influence the elders, yes, we are a cultured party, no, we cannot influence the elders, you people who have reached a very high level have influence on youngsters and youngsters on youngsters.  Can do more because he knows it, so learn things from here, I am talking about a job opportunity. How did you like it? Tell me. Share, subscribe to the channel.  Take membership also. Thank you very much."

    "title": "How To See The Full Picture ？ ｜ Don't Be Like The Man Who Thought Elephant's Tail Was A Rope [BDXSmxb8px8].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, I did an experiment, you can also do it, it will take a little effort, what I did is promoted and if you start watching one content and do not watch the other, then you will just get dragged here, this is what I want to tell my subscribers.  I believe that it is a fact that if we do not listen to the counter balance, our picture will never be completed, we will become like that story, it was an elephant story, not an elephant, so someone was holding the trunk.  Someone was holding the leg, someone was holding the tail, someone was holding the teeth, so you were not able to know, were they not able to see all of them, were they tied or bandaged, is it an elephant, to know the whole picture, you will have to have an open mind, infact that  If you want to progress in life, then I always watch counterview videos or content, to which I say that you have created your own belief system, okay, that belief system is either right or wrong, only two things can happen.  Too  It is your thought process, if it is right then let no matter come, your tree is strong, people will come and shake it, it will not break, and brother, if it was weak and someone breaks it, then get yours broken, why does it hurt so much, what is this special thing like?  It is true that whoever comes will change your view points and will change your thought processes. I myself many times people say to me, hey, you talk about it like this, why ca n't you change, if in the last few days. Some things have been seen, if we had to see the Chandigarh model, we said no, there is one AO, then the Chief Minister went to the sitting, everything was justified, then you saw what happened to the Surat elections, what happened to the Indore elections, then you also saw the electoral bonds, then you  Now you are looking at it from one side, so now you will speak, otherwise after seeing the pattern, you will have to say something or the other, I am not saying to him that even yes, someone is different from someone else.  There were 10000 runs, 100 10000 runs were scored, but if in the last 10 innings, brother 0 and 0 one lbw caught out, hit wicket, then hit wicket, then run out, then loose shot, then bad shot, then either this commentator would come or someone would say,  Man, what is happening to this batsman or don't you want him? Go and see that day in Sharja he had scored so many runs, hey, that was in 98.  Tendulkar had made it, after that there should never be any criticism, if something does not play that well or someone else twists the story, then it is for you to see that what you see, many times you get the same algorithm, so much content is put in you.  This is the same thought process, if you are consuming only one type of content, I have experimented and seen that brother, counterview does not come, if you go for deliberation from your side, then go for deliberation, if you are a devotee here.  They are blind devotees or whatever they are, if you go to Deliberation and don't click on Dhruv Rathi's video or Ravish's video, then they will never be shown to you. You should tell them directly, I too have tried to do this many times. Make a little mistake, I know all the process and how and I am a user, so I have youtube0 view point, it is okay if you change it, otherwise I got stressed that brother, a very high level man came and he said big-  words of great wisdom  Curry And Tried To Change My View Point Pert Despina Will Stick To My Original Stand That's Very Fine And You Should Say Thank You To That Person For Shaking You Every Way You Got Shaken But You're Still Standing That's It  Is it okay and someone here, it is not a bad thing to fell your tree because in reality there is no tree, it could be one, you have been shackled externally if  The environment is changing. You have to see that life is like the weather. You cannot say that if it was winter then it will always be winter. Summers come. Brother, the quilt has to be put inside, all the warm clothes should be put inside properly.  One has to clean it and keep it inside after applying sunlight and then in summer people's coolers and ACs start running, so this is a process, after that one has to prepare for the rains, that is a different thing because it means many things.  There are places where nothing happens, it gets flooded every time, but anyway, some preparation has to be done, then after that winter comes again, then when the festival comes, then one has to prepare for it and it is not like that that you will get stuck on Diwali itself.  No no, I will not burst crackers even on Holi, Holi is coming, now you have to play with colors on the time of Holi, then your June is coming, you have to do June's work in June, so life is also like this, something is changing outside, which man? of  Performance can always be at its peak. Do you know how big 10 years are in life? The President of the US said that we cannot live after 8 years. Why can't we bring this thing to India? Do you like an idol ji? There is a party like you there.  If the Republican is a Democrat party then people get divided I am a Republican I am a Democrat I believe in this then it is okay You may believe in anything but then the person who is driving that car in which you are sitting is okay Change the driver  So we have to do it or else we want the same thing. Hey brother, rest is also needed. Age also happens, time also happens, because every time, some times you run out of ideas, some times you just run out of. Ideas about what to do, then you keep performing, managing and then keep talking about old things. I have done this, I have done that. Nobody is interested. What you have done is so good that we will always remember you.  When  Till now dear, will we honor you or will we do it but that is done, but what is the next thing, will Ganga ji be cleaned, will the technologies which were there, will smart cities be made, will there be Skill India, will we have to talk about all those things, is n't it?  What not, what have you done, what has happened is good, now dil maange more, every man now it is something like this, there is someone in the house who cooks very good Chinese food, someone cooks chowmin every day, not every day, yaar dosa will also have to be eaten some day  Have to eat chana bhature too. Change is needed. Brothers and sisters, you are so good and the women will appreciate it more. No matter how good your saree is or any particular thing is, they get bored of wearing it. Change is needed just for the heck of it.  This is also a fact, so if that person changes or the saree itself changes, its color changes or any other thing changes, then you will feel that yes, I should continue this. Other wise you will get board friend, so how long will humans keep telling the same stories and sometimes even tell me many times, Hey or are you the first one, change your story, I have to listen to the same story, but earlier you used to speak.  Yes, earlier I used to speak like this, now I speak like this, if you will speak like this in future then it means that you have returned without drinking. No, you cannot return without drinking because you have a reference point if  The reference point is yours, you have kept one of your own that as gradually I will start talking according to my ideology, you people should also have it, your reference point in life should be that I have to be happy, where is my happiness, the second reference.  The point should be, what is good for my country and I am not going to decide what is good for my country, I am going to do all this and the country is not the river, mountain, forest and flower leaves, the country is the people of this country and  If this people of this country decide this then I declare to myself so clearly I will have to accept it and adjust with it and try to find the maximum happiness peace and returns of investment and everything out of that I come here and make no noise  Can it be created again and again or not? If I say this is good, then you also say this, it is not good, it is not like that, everyone has their right.  Is there something like in share market? We have to understand this equity market. It is the best life learning platform. In share market, we say yes, share, you have bought the share. Every person wants to share the share you have bought, but what can you do?  Now Asian Paint can take HDFC's bank a little higher. They play in small towns and they get caught too. I am not talking about them in SEBI, I am talking about big lions if the company is good. Management is good, product is good, demand is good, sentiment is good, if you buy then it will do well and if all these things are not there then sooner or later investors will pull out. You can't stop them from pulling out of that stock. Stock will go down you can continue holding it for a life time and it will become yours like if it was old Yes Bank or Dewan Housing Finance or any other  IL IL FNS was the one who kept sitting with all the Kolappan people, so it was as if if you wanted then it will happen, then that is the performance, what do all the people think in the share market, the sum total of this share market, if people thought today.  Oh brother, there is a fear that something will go wrong, there will be a war, this or that, crude oil, such and such, threatening, federated by doing this and that, the market will correct by 3%, if some other event happens in the market, then the market will be affected.  What is happening at the total thought process level? Brothers and sisters, the result of the market comes out. Sometimes we say that the market itself is stupid, it is crazy butch. According to me, the stock is there. Brother, the market can be irrational for a longer time than you can stay. Solvent, you understand what I am saying, you invested money on a stock, the company is very good, you think it is very good, this is also true, but there are many babbled butches in the market, okay, they don't understand.  Now they have made the condition of that stock such that or the condition of the market has become such that you have a time limit, if you believe that you have to play a future option with lets, you have to square off, those who do all this, they know where the decision will be taken.  If you want to take it in intraday or when the expiry date is last Thursday, like it should not be rolled over, if you have to settle something then you have to settle that deal, then you have to do it, brother, market in that and that thing.  It was a mistake that he was and it is possible that when you don't have money, someone else from that company can learn from you and do better than you. For example, if in real life we ​​say that this political party is useless and this is good.  Whether it is good or bad, whatever is ours, let us know after 10 years that if that thing was right then where will we get it from, then later history will judge who did what good and what bad, now if you are speaking today.  yes or no no You are feeling scared, first of all, if your party is about to cross 400 and someone so great is someone's leader and he is just about to win, then why are you worried if someone else comes and says no, no.  He will lose, it is useless, you should be happy, why are you not worried, because you do not want your share to fall down, I am telling you that in this democracy, in a share market where these things cannot be controlled, you can do these things.  can't control Many people are roaming around with this misconception that we can't do it or not, we can do it, I will tell everyone how good this couplet is, now like Saurabh Mukherjee ji, he runs his PMS, he also has a lot of brains, he speaks well logically, he runs PMS. Brother, there are new returns, go and check, he is doing Marshall S. He is fine, his thought process is correct, I also understand him properly, I also know how to do such and such stock research reports, bullying etc.  I also agree, but brother, there is no return, this is also a fact, in many shares where he used to say that this story will become like this, as if I am telling it by taking an example, I am not criticizing anyone of him, but  Now why do I want to take all these examples, why do I want to intellectualize it a little, that brother, listen, you do not understand all these things, do not come to my channel, please, long live Congress, BJP.  Do n't go away by writing 'Zindabad' or 'Murdabad'. I do n't need this comment section. I do n't need subscribers like you, brother. I want those people who understand a little deeper and who are at a little higher level. I say it openly, I say it with my mouth. If you are rich then you can stay on my channel only if you are rich in money or rich in mind. If you are in either of the two then it will be fine. If you want to become then it will also be fine, but it will not work for people who are neither rich in mind or money.  from and not  Do you want to become please because many a times it is said that it is enough, friend, that algorithm will run in vain, you will write here, I have done this, I have done this, I do not make any of these videos either to keep Congress alive or to destroy it.  I am making it to ensure long live or long life of BJP. It's okay, they are like all the pieces of the same bag, this is their work, I do n't have much to do with them but we have These are our choices, these are our tools, we have to work with them, some of them will win, some of them will win more, some will win less, but we have to do some higher order thinking of our own which I am telling, that is why I am giving an example like Saurabh Mukherjee. Was Brilliant Guy Good Pics Coffee Can Investing Good Knowledge Good This Thing But Then He Has Also Left Certain Things I Think He Left HDFC MC If I'm Not Rang The Stock Went Up When He Went Out He Lost Patience So His Pick Was Good He Rational Was Good Okay Thought Process Was Good But He Just Run Out Of Patience And Many Many Many Many Many Many Many Many Examples Hai  I am not that otherwise it will be property based that you are promoting stocks, nowadays what is the problem, no one can talk about anyone, there is a reason behind every thing. Agenda comes, okay, this is also a fact, so I stopped with just one example, if you do research wise, then you can tell the other shares also, so what I am saying is that many times the right thing is being told but at that time it is not understood. Maybe they don't understand what I am telling you, they also change their opinion and then another thing gets played out, so it is a very complicated world which we are living in. We are black.  You can't do N white, this is good, this is bad, this will always be good brother, whatever was good for you in your youth is not good for you in old age, you cannot eat rajma rice, if you become old then you will get gas, you will become bad.  And issues will arise for you. If Rajma rice was good for you too, then that is the thing which is good for you. If you are changing, India is changing, India is changing, the leader thing is changing, everything is changing, then how can something always be good?  can stay Otherwise, don't defend so many leaders on him, attack everyone, find holes in everyone's theory, if you find yourself clapping for political parties, your living is impossible. On record, brother, Ram temple has been built, I am very happy with this thing, but who built it?  He is the one who is feeling shy while eating bread. Why brother, why are you feeling shy and all the useless talk is happening left and right? Tell me, you have built a grand temple, you have done a very good job, it has been settled for 500 years.  But I myself feel that no, no, or it will not feel good to speak, so we say something else, friend, what is this, friend, eat the bread of the right thing that has been done, and whatever the other person did not do or made bad or he did it.  He got the result, talk about what you did right, you are going to do right in the future, don't talk about it, at one place he is saying, I will get you justice as soon as possible, okay, this is a government job, your government job is already becoming a curse and  go ahead and become a curse This is my prediction about who will go and who will do government job. You people who have been associated with me for four-five years know that all my predictions have come true. You have seen that these days people are crazy about podcasts that yes, all these things are happening.  Today I am telling you that after 3 years, the boy who will be a government servant will not get married. What nonsense are you talking? Not today, after 3 years, he will not get married to the person he wants to marry. If you lower your level, then you will definitely get married, brother, which human being?  whose marriage is  Whoever wants to do it, everyone gets married in India, so with one eye, if you are a government servant today and you will get married and your level was this and you got a girl of this level or this level, then after 3 years, brothers.  There is no prediction, your level will be the same as that of a government servant, everyone's grade pay scale, well, the pay scale is fixed, in the government, the same person will not get the same here, he will get the one here. This is the message and then you will say.  That my elder brother had got it here or that cousin had got it or a friend had got it. Why won't the one here set me here? So this is a special section of the people who are being deprived of reservation due to reservation. My repeated message is to take jobs, this is a matter of cumin in the mouth of a camel, unemployment will not be solved by these, it seems very high in numbers but your numbers are 144 crores brother, you are 5 10  If you give 20 lakh jobs, it will not increase anyone's satisfaction and from 5 to 75, only then the remaining 99.2 are still sitting, so if not this story then who will solve it, this is not in their control, I will see heaven myself.  To work on your own, if you are hungry, a man will work. There is a lot of work in India. While I am making this video, I have been pleading with my electrician for a day. There is a small work to do in my house, he is not coming and  Friend, it's okay and you do n't even entertain every single person, there is so much work, I know that he is angry with me, that's why, no, I know that he knows that the work is small, so if he has got more work than that. So I know that I will have to wait, go to the hospitals, there is no number there, I have to get major operations done, there is a number line there, brothers and sisters, in India, even without the guidance of any government, very good work is going on. Come let's feel like it  This is what we are doing, this is an elephant, this is moving, this rider may come, this may come, that may not matter, it does n't matter much, the elephant is cool, he is going on his way, he will walk at six, he will walk at seven, he will walk at eight, he will run away at eight, then  You will have to sit on the 6th row, it will run one class too far, then you will have to bring the people behind you and never sit in a Hari Roadways bus, you get the feeling that if you sit in the front, it feels as if you are sitting at the back, then it seems that the bus in front is going ahead.  we left behind  Gone means moving like this, meaning you are sitting like this, then it is always walking, it is gathered, remember you are a country, understand carefully, you, I am telling you with a very good and deep example, you are in a train, first AC in that train.  The compartment is of Second AC, Third AC, Sleeper and General. That train has left from Delhi and will reach Mumbai Central. Okay brother, it will reach at the same time. Yes, in that journey, First AC passengers will spend more time, Second AC passengers will have less fares. This general of the third  There will be a lot of trouble in the train, but you are a part of that train, you are not entering the tunnel of Elon Musk, which will take you in such a way that if you were sitting in first AC, we reached two hours earlier, na na na country.  You cannot go beyond that limit, just like in astrology we show that you cannot go beyond the promise of the horoscope or what is the total promise. You will say that it will do well, it will do well, it will do very well, then the reference point is that What did father do? If top businessman Mukesh Ambani's son is like top businessman Mukesh Ambani, it will not do as well in his son's horoscope, then it does not mean that he will become absolutely middle class. Relatively, from what he saw, there is a slight difference.  There has to be a reference point all of you who are living and lives you have to judge in last 10 years and 15 and 20 and last five  And the last two years and the last six months How has your life improved And gone down with the fixed reference Fixed reference Grab a fixed reference Then you'll know what's going on Then you'll stop singing this useless praise Because somewhere  These people do not have such a direct contribution, they definitely tell the story of making things better or making them worse, and those who are doing good, then brother.  Let those who have to vote do it, you are sitting with a vote, discuss it, question it and you are feeling like I have to vote for the person you are going to vote for, listen to more negative things about him, listen to more negative things, do more research about him.  Leave the one to whom you are not going to vote, why are you not going to vote to him, you don't have to give because to whomever you have to give, you should be shy brother, listen to me carefully when you wear trousers, you go to buy jeans.  Whatever trouser you like, you want to buy, you only take the trial of the one whose color you don't like or the shape of which you don't like, you go and try it on for a while, then you have rejected it, haven't you? If you don't like something of a particular color.  If you don't like buying it then you will either try it on like this or if you try it on then you will see the same one, brother, if you like it, then that and his, if both of them come like me, then I am conducting a trial for them.  If it is helping then why not how logical I am speaking, even those who watch the videos get real relaxation, they get real fun. Please subscribe the channel if you have not done so yet. Want to be a part of Tegra Group? Yes, you can be a part of it in the comment section and can take membership of the channel. Membership is available by discussing over tea. Right now I have not promoted much, so people have not accepted it, but I will only talk about good journalism.  Because I have got much more popular channels, you people know that I am making videos here at their cost, you people know that there, I know that my mother-in-law is a hit, I know that my corporate job is a hit, my  You all know that my youth topics are hits, you guys know that real estate topics are hits, but coming here I am insisting, brother, till June 4, a little donation is okay, membership is like they say, right Shekhar. Gupta ji says, Have to support is fine, you will have to support and the cost of membership here is very low, beyond that what benefits will you get, I have still not decided, first if the members come, beyond that also we will discuss over good tea.  We will learn that how can we improve our lives by observing politics and what is happening around us. Something means that it is always mine. If I do webinars then this theme will remain, we are not in control. Like I told you, brother, we cannot control the stock market. What is happening to us? If the stock market is going down, I will play shorts. I have to take a call, I have to take a put, it will depend on what is the direction, how much to take, option future. Whatever it is in English, you have seen whatever they do in share marketing. I don't want to impress you by talking about it. What I want to tell you is that people earn money even in a falling market. Money in a rising market too.  We earn on the side, we earn money in the market. Those who know how to earn money, they just keep looking at it, oh market is going up, oh is it going down, oh don't fall, this one, that one, they don't reach anywhere in life, same politics, same politics, not much of you, only you.  You can do it, it may not happen according to your wishes, your favorite party may not be that good, it may be someone's wish, dear, yes, I am not taking names, your favorite party may not be as good, so you do not have to be sad about it. is yours  Keep it as it is, keep questioning it, if any external thing changes, then change this party, when so many leaders are changing from this party, some of this, some of this, this one are leaving and you are voting for them only, you are one man.  You are voting for him, he changed his party and then you liked him very much, so do n't jump to conclusions so quickly, talk here and there, talk about both sides, then please share this video and like, thank you again much."

    "content": "Hello friends, you must have seen the topic, our work is to give water, what will be found inside, people did not know from this thumbnail of the video, but it will be fun, it will be fun, after watching today's video, I will tell you a lot in a very great way.  There will be learning and you will get to learn a lot in your life. You know what to do in life without crying too much because you cannot control what is happening outside, but how do you respond to it? I am using deliberately the word respond and not react because everyone is reacting. If you are not responding then this is a great example. Look carefully, you are going from one place to another in a car. From the middle of the story, I want to understand you as a human being.  Let's take it, okay Rohit is my favorite character. Story: I was going in a car with my family from one place to another. It was day time. Okay, on the way I came across a deserted road and  Story Car Story On the way, when the road is getting low then they show it by hitting it like this that you have to go from here. Those who have to reduce it in patches on the way, then they go from where the market was kept like this.  It seemed okay, now that I knew, there was a marshy road and an active road and a bit like a mattress from here and was going through a path, when I went ahead I found water and it is slash type, I saw a little bit and the car was good, it was my own car. He took it out and the car got stuck there. Sister, there was a lot of noise and then two or four people came from the story and said, brother, you will have to bring a tractor to pull it out, you will have to pour some water and spend a little money, yes, absolutely, absolutely good, what do you reduce, we say, we are doing water, we do water, we do water. Here we water the water and don't let it dry. Movies would be good. Visualize it in English. Character visualization has to be done. You will have to work a little hard with me. I am not bringing animation here. Now Rohit has a family and thousands of rupees.  Have taken it, he says thanks brother, leaves after doing so, now you tell me what choice does Rohit have, take him out and complain about someone's sombody, this mystifying this way, in fact, more money is being made by doing this and there are too many vehicles here.  There is no caste, should he report to the police, should he stand there and tell the rest of the people who are coming from behind, no brother, don't go here, but did he tell his closest relatives and friends that he is going from date? Place you date place this is what I encounter this is my personal experience be careful maybe they take the place of whole society of the world many people are like this in many situations they are not even letting the water dry up in many places such traps have been spread and  Every time those things are being scratched and I would like to understand this even after the middle of the video, but I can explain this thing by taking another example also, okay.  I will take two-three examples and tell you so that this point can be driven home. Someone should put it in the story from behind a house today and when you are going from the front, then send a fire brigade vehicle. Brother, many years ago, Chhota Put a condom or put a village, anything, there was a geography kingdom, the king next door wanted that thing, now his intelligent advisor told him that if you will direct on this, there were many such people who pierced the people there.  To Started harassing them, typing extortion money, got jealous of their sports welfare, started harassing the powerful people. By doing this, they became victims and became very upset. Then this king sent his letter again and scolded those people like he did not see in the movies.  Earlier it has been shown in the movies that the hero used to have to go to Patna, the girl used to send goons to climb on him, he used to beat them, the girl used to say that examples do not end, so when this king did this, then he came into our lives.  Who is including Raita seems to be throwing the garbage and who is throwing it is not known, but who is picking it up is not known to you, whatever issues are being raised, Jhavi comes which are very manufactured and are meant to instigate attention.  Shiny is intellectual, good is to reduce them, nothing is good or bad, all religions are performing their own karma and religion as per their own, be it politicians, be it rulers, be it a party, be it a person, be it your own.  They are reducing it, is it the caste that has gained power like this, is it a new or maintenance caste or has the system been running like this for thousands of years, there is nothing bad or wrong in it, the middle class is one which is very moralistic, it is like life is going on.  We accept him, he is a middle class person, he should not be the best because you force him to operate on the moral ground, you should know which way to go, which way not to go next time and said brother, if like I  would have been in place of the one he had come to Brother, you are stronger than an entrepreneur instead of getting a tractor, and I will say, why are you asking for a thousand rupees, take this thousand more, tell me, you are stuck with the family and I am saying, next time, do a little better care of the mattress and Make arrangements for some food and drinks here and if the car has broken down to some extent, they are also the people who give concentration and there is someone in it. Now you have to see that this is not a test to fall and  On the contrary, tell me to concentrate less, take food here, take cold drinks also, it is okay and if someone spits in the car, then hire a mechanic to fix that too, sir, set the program, that is also happening.  You are getting all the services, the car will break down, something will get stuck in the car, there is money to take it out, oh brother, we did not know that this can also be reduced, so anything can be done, it is happening everywhere, it is happening everywhere.  this every  It is happening at the level and it is increasing continuously. Earlier only water was poured. Have you ever seen this happening? People use this at many places to prevent tire puncture. Now the car's tire gets punctured, now it is at high speed.  The car was going and it went upside down. There are such foolish people also who make their own 100, 200, 500 punctures. This happens to unfortunate people, but this means it is like this. Now what should I tell you, this happens everywhere in life. People are losing money, they are ready to cause loss of ₹ 100 to others for the benefit of their own money, that is why this is what is happening in politics, in which something bad happens to the country, the future gets spoiled and people's health gets spoiled when the opportunity to earn money does not go away. Jain and so much is being wasted in setting the opportunity Jain narrative just to stay in power. I had made that video earlier also, in my previous episode of 'Power Ke Bade', you can see what I had explained in 'What is Power'.  The one who has to come to power and the one who has to stay, is the one who has the biggest shortcoming. You ca n't blame anyone for doing his own work. The one who has to cut can't tell the butcher, you are not doing it right, he is his name, his name is right.  If I am [ __ ], then all of them are also [ __ ] for themselves. You have to see that the one in front of the butcher is not yours, you are the one who cannot say his [ __ ], shouting, people are moral, I have all the certificates, I have a retirement demand.  is it be  What are people doing now, if this whole thing happens in the supposed legality that the road is being made like this with the public's consent, then now I have given the example very clearly in black and white, but in real life, the thing has to be done great, it is very important to understand. We will have to ask, that is, where is this happening, why is it happening, why are the laws made so complicated that we cannot even know their address, you look at this simple thing, there is one owner of the house, one is the tenant, it is very easy to understand, it is right.  There is talent, speak in English, there is one, they will put such language that brother, the common man cannot register by making his own, there is tax power, someone can become an up, how will the money be made, then who will earn like this, if the income tax return is increasing, then it is increasing.  Disclosures are increasing, everything is going to increase, without a chartered accountant, how can I fill my link, who am I, who is not letting the water dry, who is going to pour the water again and again, there are many who pour water, never  Sukhna wala in your life time and it will remain like this whatever you are listening to, how much our country will progress, we will go into nectar tomorrow, we will have a lot of wealth when there will be a lot and God will do a lot of good but this tribulation will last for many years.  So I want that they can't do this, they can't even say that it's bad, they can't even do that, they have you learn to deal with hair and people like me, come and have fun, first of all I also told that it is very difficult to become a politician. a lot of ground has to be laid  I have done acting and show you guys by subscribing please do it how difficult it is, it takes a lot of effort, so do n't test the politicians, don't hate the politicians but don't sycophant them and don't do that to them, this politician  I do n't know what you have written and under this Chunnu Munnu Pannu Pannu Pannu, whatever actions they are doing, you forgive them all, so it could be anyone of them. It can be anyone, so it is not possible that you will love the top leadership and you will not do anything to those who are misbehaving below at their municipal level because you love their top, it cannot be like this if someone  If your child misbehaves and you like his father, then the child's misbehavior is high, you also pick up the call just because you like his father, then it's okay, you will go and tell his father, right?  Are your children misbehaving or is it, control them a little and if you are not, then do you scold them and dot on them. If you talk about anything, then it does not mean that you are talking about it. I will also tell you about agriculture if you have.  Have you heard that joke? Tell me, do n't we know which one is that Sarkar? It's okay. If you have ever told that joke on YouTube then tell it. If not, if you find it fresh then I will tell you. Otherwise why did you rest for 2 minutes in it?  Okay, so many people are sitting with water, some are sitting with tankers, some have set up pipelines from the river, some are sitting with buckets, all of them are sitting with their own and they all keep their settings and do not let it dry, so now you will see.  Which way do you have to go, which trap do you not get trapped in mental traps? You will have to understand this further as elections come, there will be some element of tribulation which is called entropy or randomness in D. System and those entropy levels will increase. If you remember a little bit of science. If you remember this term, I was in 9th and 10th class. Probably this entropy level will increase after six-seven months. Discussion call level will increase. This is not right, that is not right, what did you do like this? What time did it happen, what did it happen, how did it happen, there will be a discussion on this, we should not even participate or listen to this debate and keep our agenda and remain engaged in it.  D middle class on the message, there is no direct benefit to you, you have to vote, keep watching this, at least once in a while, if something comes, let's fast forward and try it, try it 2x, 3x, let's know a little about that generality, yes, okay.  This is done, that is done, it's okay, there is time to vote, we have to vote and we vote for whomever we want, I do not have any influence on him, in my view I tell you, there is not much difference that anyone can know, I have also voted for power. Made a video of that too, you can link it up and watch it. If you have not seen the episode then please go and watch the episode number. I will put things according to the episode numbers. Further, I will also make a play list so that there can be some grouping of them like this one.  I have told my mother to leave the issue, if ever you follow her in real life from the middle of Twitter, you will do political science very well and you cannot escape from this debate, which is why I created this channel. WhatsApp Group Family Group Job Friends Circle  This is very  There has to be discussion and the date is what I give credit to you politician, if there was no need for me to create a channel, my content is very good and is running on other channels, that too if you do not subscribe, you can subscribe to those channels, but this is why I created it.  Because it is like fast food, children will eat it. When mom comes to know that brother is eating fast food, children have to eat it. They don't have to eat it at all, but they have to eat it, then they start doing things as per their wish, even flour.  Don't let him get the burger, he will come, so that I have created a channel for him, this is my purpose to save you from all this so that you can get very good clarity on every topic and then you will stop wasting your time. Thought process will become butter, your personal life will become butter and you will get full clarity because we are educated people, everything has to be understood, we should understand what is happening and why it is happening and once it is understood then there will be a smile on the face.  So This is a good game, it will come, because there are many games that we play out in our country, after 20 years, 30 years, 40 years, we come to know that this was actually done like this, I will tell you here a little quickly what happened.  Why is this happening and we don't have to get angry at all, there is no need to shout, I have already told in a video that who are the people shouting and what is wrong with them, now I am here in such a teacher.  I will also take a revision test of the first episode so that I can know the engagement level, who is watching the old videos, which program is bad due to which there is frustration and chillum chilli, tell me in the comment area and then those who have not heard it before, then comment.  Whether it is a story or a story in the area, they will get the answer, then they will know that it is okay, this program is bad, okay, next time, do something like this, do it like this, keep smiling, why is he smiling, then forward him the video.  Please watch this one, it's okay, my videos are a response to the devotees, they say, how much is this in response, listen to this, see, this is also a perspective, enjoy, I want first of all, as soon as the video is ending, everyone will make the video longer like this.  Breath is as long as the breath, people forget it only then, there is a lot of stress, take a long breath, watch my video like this, then I will definitely tell you twice to take a long breath, the stress comes out completely, whatever is happening, all this ends.  how is it Share the video and share by subscribing in your personal space those who are your friends and who you think will understand, appreciate and enjoy."

    "title": "IAS Pooja Khedkar Certificate Issue And Systemic Failure [BHWuMK2peWo].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, Pooja Khedkar case is a very important issue. It has spread very fast on social media. Many people have discussed it in different ways. My intention will be to discuss through this video some such things which should be discussed more loudly. People had seen my video Pune Paush Kesh Normally I tell after a few days, my peacock does not remain according to the current news when things have become more clear because in the beginning I did not come and make anything, pee, pee, bad, dirty, like this.  After doing it, it is over and it is 72 hours news. I want to ask brothers and sisters, what is this case, how did it happen, why are questions not being asked from UPSC, Pooja Khedkar ji has done what has been done, what has been done.  So there will be investigation, all that will happen, there are two types of things, suppose somewhere in the bank or somewhere in the system, a person commits fraud. Suppose it is okay, then beyond that, there will be a discussion as to who did it by investigating.  But there will be some checks and balances so that this does not happen again and it should also be checked as to how much has been done, so my first demand is that those who have come to IAS on the basis of disability in the last 20 years, there are not many crores of such people.  It is possible because only 180 ISs are made in a year, so in the last 20 years only 3600 ISs have been made, out of which the people with disability quota will be very less, the percentage will be counted, whatever you calculate, it will be counted.  What is this removal of all these related to or what is this related to because there is one Abhishek who left the job and was doing dance dance, he has also taken it, he has become a YouTuber, he too has taken it, then gradually Pandora became very popular. I want to ask this and share it with all the public through subscribers that if Pooja ji had not demanded the office vehicle and everything that happened in Pune because Pune  Whatever happened to the DC Saheb and she lodged a complaint with the Chief Secretary, there has been a snowball effect from it. If she had kept her finger on her lips and done her normal work quietly, she would never have come out because every day some new revelations are being made about visual impairment. He was also from the locomotives, this hospital gave him, he gave it, I met him there before that, he is showing the rot of the system, he is showing the rot of the system, that's why he is like us.  So in the same way they say that whoever has enough money, don't put him in these cycles of UPSC. And by the way, now even this UPSC, which is called the number one exam by most, will be considered to have the highest status. If question marks are coming in it too, then we don't know which certificates have been given and the person has gone through reservation. So the people who are not getting it are the same as those who are getting it and the condition of those who are getting it. Watch this, that's why people say that those who are against reservation, although a very good video of mine has been made which will reduce the pain of reservation, it will be released, you guys should watch it, it will be very beneficial, this is a practical video, people imposing reservation are saying.  That the good has not been accomplished yet, those who do not get it say brother, your good has not been done in 80 years, it has not been done in 70 years, how will it be done as good as in 40 years, when if these people like this take away those who have 40 crores, then father they  They are showing their assets, they are showing their assets and then hair is being pulled out in the law and father has written somewhere in the newspaper that there should be an income of 8 lakhs, the asset can be of any amount, so brother asset.  Also put it, friend, they are saying that if a farmer has land and his rates have increased and he is not selling it, then the income is not his, brother, this is a strange thing because we people look at it a lot, the law will work as per the law.  matter  There will be subjudice, this inquiry is also about me coming here to paint someone, I am not doing anything wrong because for me Pooja ji is a human being who happened it is like Pune Porsche case but it should not happen again why did that happen ever some society  I am wrong. If we accept that this is wrong and let us assume that the jury has not been out yet and the result will be known, then is it the fault of only one person that he wanted that I was trying to fulfill all the duties?  was or  Systematic system has failed. AIIMS people have repeatedly told me to come for medical checkup to find out if you have got disability then who all are in the system who were sleeping. This blame can fall on many people. It seems that the media has now become a little aware. After the results of the elections, it has become clear to the media that our soil is going to be destroyed. We do not do any good work in front of the public, so it is okay.  Very  Anchors and different things, see, like now I am discussing this through this channel, but no one here is turning on this issue by pretending to be a moral science that I am fighting this, I am not fighting at all.  As for me, I am discussing over tea, sitting comfortably, the audience of my channel has a different thought process, but the media, Hindi news channel, English news channel anchors, all of them will show that it is we who are fighting, this is their side only.  it will happen but  The system's will be to tire him out and some more news will come, as soon as some more news comes, by then he will be a stick, then something will have to be done by dismissing him or something like this will be done. Matter, I am saying that we should only worship him.  But if something wrong is found out then one should not be satisfied with the action taken, whatever action will be taken, technically we cannot blame anyone right now because things have come to light, there will be an inquiry, we can even go to the court, if there is any investigation then we will not.  You can tell but prima facie this has become an issue or there is no doubt about it, so what I am saying is that can one person be at fault in this issue, just like the paper gets leaked or if there are so many issues then the paper  The one who is giving money by leaking is the one who is at fault. The one who is doing it is the one who is at fault or someone wrote it in the beginning, there is a chain that emerges, no one person, nothing ever happens, there is a chain everywhere, the system is being disrupted. just adjusted this  Talks are also coming up that a scribe was also used, the one who writes that if you have visual impairment then you write my answer, I always used to think about the scribe, I still think that why should I write any other answer?  There is no system with Braille script. No, I am not so much impaired that if I need Braille script, I can hire a good boy who can read five or seven times.  I was trying and I may not have been able to get it and if his marks come and I also get the quota, then with those marks I will pass, this is an idea and about disability also I am saying that there is a need for a certificate in disability. What is such a disability, according to me, someone should give it, which is visible, for which there is no need to ask anyone because someone from somewhere inside here has given the certificate of nerves and he is dancing like Abhishek wala.  You see the case, he is dancing, he is appearing in the pictures, he is doing modeling with all the models, he is absolutely fit, many people have talked about this disability, it is 20 years old, I must have told you, there will not be many cases, check.  These are the people who are connected to the system, these are the ones who will come out the most, check it and look at the disability he brought in the next years, a good thing has happened because of this, look at the young IAS officers especially, we cannot paint everyone, such a big IAS.  It is so difficult to become an officer and so many countries have been running this way for so many years. We do not discuss how we are running them or not. We do and have done many good things. We cannot paint everyone like this but brother, these days, in the last two years  This is what has been happening for the past four years in the coaching academy, this profile of the father and mother has started getting removed. This has had a good effect because now people have started looking at people as if scrutiny is coming and whether there are jobs or not, all the people say that this is because of the certificate.  how did it go Now many people have started getting these complaints and after getting compiled, this Pandora's box can burst anywhere, that is why even the Congress people are not opening their mouths, otherwise this is such a good thing about the opposition, I am trying to humiliate the opposition. See this case has happened in Maharashtra, why are the Congress soldiers not opening up to the opposition? Why are they not opening up in opposition at the national level? They are open in everything, no matter what happens. Supriya ji is so wonderful, is n't she the Congress spokesperson? This is the advantage for people like us when we do n't eat anyone's bread and can insult anyone. Brother, the government is not saying anything for what ever reasons. It is okay even a people's government is there, DOPT center is this but these are many things.  It has happened earlier too, different from Chhattisgarh, Rahata is coming out, the previous CM is not of this one, but of the previous one, it is coming out that this was the anger among the people, there is a lot of anger among the people about the jobs.  By doing things like this and these, we are failing in government jobs, hey, there are leaks in the job of a leather worker, there is a leak in the job of a constable, and now you have not left anything, then there is no merit in this country, there are people from outside.  You are watching, now you tell me whether the aura of every IAS officer will fall or not after knowing this, it will feel like this. Well friend, you people also get selected like this, otherwise the status used to be very high in the society.  That friend of UPSC exam, preparing for UPSC is considered an employment in itself. What is the boy doing, what is the girl doing? Preparing for UPSC means it becomes respect. Brother is preparing for UPSC because brother can be arrested at any time, Collector sir.  If you can, then talk to them with some civility, if a thing with such status has been reduced to this condition, then it is the duty of the government and DOPT to come and tell the public in full about it.  That it should be solved quickly, that is not enough, you should first get the investigation done which AIIMS was requesting for so long that if we have to do the investigation, then please do the investigation, please take it out and tell us and look at these certificates, all the political castes and  The condition of the country has come on reservation, now the condition has become like this, I should not go out of my country, I should not go, those videos will also come on many channels, many takes, I am also changing because if the environment in the society changes, things will change.  If there is a change, then my take on this is that I request all the subscribers with folded hands, don't make it about that individual only yes individual, if the individual has done something then that is what is under the law and rules.  Under regulation, that will definitely happen, but in a larger systemic situation, a single person can pull off anything, there are a lot of checks and balances in between.  So, I have all failed, it's been two years now brother, which one is 2022? It's 24th July, when is this selection process and before that too, please tell me, he is a lawyer by the name of Jai Deepak ji, it's enough, he is a well-known name.  They are also associated, they also have to come and give an explanation that I had fought their case but not this one, I had fought the one with Omar Sheet, I had fought this one, so I have to give like this.  What I am trying to say is that those who can afford them are very famous lawyers, brother, they are such people who are fighting the case for you, so you mean, they are very resourceful and they will still fight the case in my opinion. Many people are coming and the law also means that loopholes are being taken advantage of everywhere that if there is an income of Rs 8 lakh then there are assets, there is no income, we have assets worth Rs 40 crore, if we have assets worth Rs 40 crore then we will also give return on Rs 1. If the cash flow becomes 40 lakhs, if you give % then it also becomes 20 lakhs. If you give it at 25% then it becomes 10 lakhs. And if father was also a government officer, then brother, he would also be getting pension. How did he take advantage of the technology somewhere?  It is not that pension was coming. Yes, Rs 98000 is less than 8 lakhs. How did it happen to me? We have to discuss on this that how they have been able to do it who all have. How are the checks done in the contributed and system? How is the reason to come and tell at what level the certificates are checked? Can any government hospital give it to anyone or they will check it themselves at the time of recruitment and if you do not check it yourself then you will continue your training. Why did you send me there to Pune for training? You should have said that brother, listen, if you have not come here and taken the test, then you are not sure and you are bound to come here.  End test is not that today I have passed the test and my training has also started, so here we have to raise questions on this one and through this video I want to raise questions on that here only by doing these  There will be no benefit in quitting, bigger issues will have to be raised, I have all failed, because if you are failing like this, then brother, you will distribute 10 lakh children among 180 seats like this.  They are idiots who prepare for the exam from morning till evening, bring the certificate by any means, you are just looking at the reservation, what are the issues, it is not just that I am getting it and I am not getting it, the one who is getting it is also not getting it.  Being able to get it because it is not someone else's right but if you did not deserve it, you submitted the wrong certificate of disability, then the one who was submitting the actual certificate was the one whose actual one was.  He had a disability and his marks were two less than yours. If he remained then please share this video, like it and subscribe the channel. Thank you very much."

    "content": "Hello friends, If you can't have it, Hate It Mindset of the Middle Class Disc, you will enjoy it a lot, why I put it on this channel because it is a social cause, I have put it on this channel, trigger why it is made real at in Gurgaon, if you guys follow.  If we follow Real Eight in Gurugram, there is a bull run going on and luxury projects are coming up there, four CR, five CR, six and seven types are coming up and things are in the hands of the middle class.  A lot of people who follow me on social media are surprised and it is coming out, who is buying it, who will take it, it will fall down, it is useless, it is like this, it has triggered this video, but I am very big.  I will calmly tell you about the historical phenomenon of today, not that we have reached here, today we are talking about these things, but we, I will go 3035 years ago, I will go 3035 years ago, let's say, let's go to.  90's, early 90's and even before that, late 80's, when Ramayana and Mahabharata used to come, okay, color TV was new at that time, but only rich people could buy color TV, so there was a narrative of the middle class that those who watch color TV. Glasses get stuck in their eyes and if the child of a color TV owner had glasses covered, then the poster would be like, look, we have said that I have analyzed the mindset very well at the thought process level.  I am doing this and it gives a lot of relief in my videos that learning is about opening your barriers because you have to progress in life, you have to go towards peace, you have to go towards happiness, you have to go towards all these, you have to go towards this. You will have to understand the thought processes. No one is creating this kind of content. Happiness course is my first class intro class. First class is on Sunday, December 1. So, those who want to enroll in my happiness course, h2 me. WhatsApp2 class itself is a super hit but now the actual class is on the first one, you will get the recordings, so definitely do them, then let's start, it used to be like a TV, it was said about AC that if you stay in AC, your immunity will get spoiled.  It will happen and one should stay outside, one should stay in the cooler and the body gets spoiled even today if there are some elderly people and AC has now come in all the houses in the middle class but if AC is used more then they say no more is better.  No, this is not oxygen. No, there is always some story, there is always some story, so this is one thing that is the phenomenon of if you can't have it, hate it, like there will be many eye hitters these days, i 15 has come, okay, come hate it. For what ever reasons, what ever Sara, I am not saying that there is a reason because we can't buy it, we hit only then, but like everything has one hitters, like, personally speaking, I am also a hitter.  I am not a fan of i because I do n't understand its functionality. That style looks very strong but if you do that work then you would not understand many things. Same thing happens behind the car too. Sometimes what happens is that you can't buy a car, so it's okay.  Then how many videos are there beyond that, this is the waste of financial influencers, don't do it like this, do SIP, do mutual fund, it will become Rs 100 crore, that car will take you like this, not reliving people.  Not reassuring that the car they are buying worth Rs 1.5 crore is not middle class, they will have Rs 100,150,200,500 thousand crores. The things that are being taken from their nobody's even calculations are their percentage of total wealth, net worth or income.  What a formula, no one is following it. The middle class is getting irritated by those things which the middle class cannot buy. You have to understand this hate.  Why does this hate come? Because I will tell you, the middle class will never hate Golgappa made from dirty water which is being sold somewhere because they can buy it and they don't even have any hobby like this, nor do they have a lot of love for it.  The middle class will not hate the food and drink. The middle class will not hate. Now that winter is coming, we have started getting clothes which have the names of entire brands written on them, which are normally available.  7 8 10 12 These come for Rs 15000 but you will get them for Rs 1200 1500 800 900 on ready pay somewhere, they know these are from Ludhiana Hosiery, it is Jugaad from somewhere and they say then it is the mother's ass, it is good, take a photo even if it is the same. Now the person who is going to clean your car is also wearing these clothes, but the middle class here will not say that because it is on  A thing worth 6 crores is coming, a thing worth 5 crores is coming, this is useless, not good, hey, beware of wrong things, never get a Louis Vuitton bag worth one and a half lakh rupees, then someone says, be aware of this Louis Vuitton bag.  This is coming to the tune of ₹ lakh, why don't you take it brother because you probably don't want to take it. The middle class probably doesn't have that much hatred but the households are such that everyone has aspirations and those who are going to take it may mostly be like the people of Delhi.  Let me give you the example of Gurgaon. Have they got something in inheritance? Which one did they go and earn? There was a floor in Delhi which was sold. It was shared by two brothers. Whatever came in the share of one can buy it in Gurgaon. In Delhi, by selling the property of Delhi, the one whose two brothers got the share can buy it in Gurgaon. Or if it is divided into three parts, then nothing is going to come to Delhi, so those people are taking it, now those who are not able to take it are crying and those who are not able to take it, look, I am not just talking about real estate, I  I am talking about mindset because if you want to see things specific to real estate, then I have a very separate channel, Exclusive Sango Real Estate, I will also give its link, subscribe to that too, there is only real estate awareness and all that stuff.  But coming back to this, there is a mindset, why the washing machine came in the beginning, the washing machine made the clothes like this, any thing comes which is out of the budget, not everyone can buy it or if rich people live then they are middle class.  She creates a level of hate towards him and those people connect, earlier when this used to happen in the 90s, it was done through word of mouth, there were no platforms to connect, what are the platforms now to connect, WhatsApp's has come, so it uses more oil and This is global warming, this is a bad thing, they are not segregating their own waste, they probably don't even have a system to segregate, this is wet, this is dry, this is  What should be done is this organic with recycling power, green and blue and the boxes that come in it are nothing, I do n't know how much dirt they spread, but yes, these cheap Chinese goods are bought again and again and the waste is generated.  Whether it is an electronic item, e-waste or any other plastic waste, it has nothing to do with it, there will never be any hate raid towards it, there will never be any spread towards it that why should we take this, but we will not be able to take any thing, it will be very harsh towards us.  big hat red it This phenomenon seems to be emerging. I will explain this phenomenon in a very good way in my happiness course, how you should come out of it and what will be the benefits after coming out and that is the biggest hidden secret which the middle class has learned wrongly from the rich class.  Have you learned it wrong? Well, the rich class does not teach itself, but sometimes what happens is that after seeing something, we interpret what is the thing that will make the middle class poor, that which will not remain in the middle class.  They have learned wrong from the rich class. What is wrong learned from the rich class is very important but if you suppose through this video, how much do you agree that yes middle class suffers from this, I take some high moral ground or some moral science.  I am not saying this as a teacher, but this is not taking us anywhere, this thing is not progressing because hate comes only where there is desire, like I said, where there is no desire, which is easily accessible.  There is no hate, be it clothes, you are getting them at cheap prices, be it Golgappas or food, whatever things you are getting in life, if something is happening somewhere, then it is there, there is nothing, hate is only in those places where  I am not able to find things like for example, if you or I, I will not target the middle class alone but the butt like men and men, today girls are beautiful girls, polite girls, working girls. Girls who play with their mothers, girls with dimples on left cheek, boys are not getting it and the desire is very high, there too you will see a phenomenon of hate going on, gender hate which is called section 498, girls are worthless, everyone is greedy. All of them are like this, they don't know what they want, they keep making boyfriends, keep breaking hearts, keep doing this, all this is also a big misconception and more than that This is the planet where boys and youngsters are not progressing. I am opening these one of the classes in Happiness Course. All the recordings. You will get it is the iconic course A2. You will get to learn a lot and you can also become a consultant. Please spread this awareness and how angry we are that this mindset has come into the middle class of forcibly hating things and they are not getting any benefit from it.  But the hatred is forced that friend, he is doing something good, he is coming home, I ca n't buy, he is spoiling, this is happening, that is happening, so do you also travel a little with this mindset, you are the identification keeper.  We do not belong to the society, no, the middle class is very settled, educated and settled, not at all bitter, not even the slightest bit frustrated and does not have any desire for aspirations, absolutely moving towards salvation and very  Great, if you feel like this, then write like this and if you feel like what I am saying, then tell me, Guruji, you are absolutely right. You say this, we also travel like this or identify or my  I see such phenomena playing out around me so that this issue seems to me that it is not only me who is having dreams or the people who take consultation along with me, where my getting up, sitting, my observation, my going and coming, I am the one who is watching and the others.  So  It is possible that no one is watching, so please do give feedback on this channel. If you please complete the feedback, it will be very good. This is a unique channel, no one is raising such social issues, everyone raises different types of issues, people of moral science.  That 's not mine, that's what we have to do to impact life. The one who talks about the middle class, youtube4, who used the middle class throughout his life, Sutra Clarity for Youth, the rest of me, two and a half of youtube1.  There are 30 million subscribers, they have also copied the content but what is the problem, now they have copied it, now they do not talk again because what is happening here, I am writing a big book, I am taking the middle class to a destination, one of my  If the destination of the journey and the entire path is clear, then if they come in between, they will pick up my content but then they will become silent because they do not know anything further, I will repeat 500 Hajj again and again.  I will make videos and want to wake up the middle class. I want to wake up the Indian middle class because no one is talking about the middle class because everything is taken for granted. It is either about the poor or about the rich.  It is seen or talked about the poor and the middle class is the one who is itself consuming this content which is for poor people and they are not poor.  If she is hating the middle class or the rich or is hitting on their things, then there is very limited content for those who are in between. This is my audience's core audience and you are liking my content like this.  So please tell me, subscribe the channel, share it on groups, like the comment section and those who want to enroll in Happiness Course 2 can h2 me."

    "content": "Hello friends, D. Importance of Story Teller, many times we would say this, he is telling such a story but I bill it as just Importance of Story Teller. In today's system, we see that the current time is going on like elections are about to come, you know.  There are two people among us, between whom this election will be imposed. One of the two has to oppose the other, but you tell me which one is going to be the story of that time, we will do this, we want to do this, we have done this in the future.  It may not happen like that, it may not happen, do this, do that, now it is a different thing that when you listen to 100 stories, then all the stories do not come out true, there is no saree, there is no fun in everything, but at the list, the story is giving your other side. Please tell me, so when I am making this video here, my aim here is not to promote any one side, mine is for the other side, Jagan, listen brother, your story is not good, yours is not this, yours is not that good. Not only yours, it is not good there, it is not good like this, it is also yours, tell me something, which is the programme, which further program are you planning to do, what are you planning to do, is it there and how will you be able to do it, you have the meaning, it will remain like that.  K numbers, if you don't message this thing then it is tight, it is fun to watch such matches and give D best day tomorrow D best ideology D best think whatever is the order of public Janardan will happen but this is the meaning from one side only this meaning  level of debate  This means that as you say to him, if you are not a batsman and this bowler is a bowler, then this bowler is not challenging him, give him sixes, he is hitting sixes, he is hitting sixes, story on whose  He is also hitting sixes but the quality of his bowling is also nothing, so whatever stories you tell, only that will show in your life and hope is what has made you less, hope is what sells, hopelessness never sells you.  Kant Kap Leo This is bad, this is bad, there are 10,000 things but they will get better in the future, then there is hope inside, and only that happens but it gets played, the whole life is like this, whatever you want, that husband, that father, that man.  That person is the head of the house, the one who is ahead in the family, keep the hope that yes, the car will come, we will buy the big one, we will go to the new movie, no, we will go around, we will go around, we will play like this, sometimes you are not able to do it, sometimes you say, I will go abroad but you will go to Goa.  hard to go  It is fine but you travel less than Udaipur but we fear the story, even the story is afraid of any person, Neeraj, if someone is living such a life that brother, no one can go to the story, no one can wear good clothes, what do they say? Na, that song is also one, Mera time aayega to mera time aayega, I am giving myself that hope, so in this way, when there is a leader, he has to give hope, he cannot go without hope and there is a particular one which is from that time.  something in the name of hope  They do n't even have a syllabus, they say, if someone else says, \"Come on brother, it's okay, I am late, listen to you also, I am late for 5-10 minutes, what do you have to do, Shivaay, I mean, that brother-in-law of a very childish level is distributing this nothing for free.\"  You are also distributing it for free, Naripatta is going at this level only, so when you listen to the story, you do not have to take it lightly, you have to see that the story that is being told to you is being sung, then it is a story.  But that story is the hope of many people's life and the voting bill should happen on and that off course, the dreams that are shown and explained are told, those who take their dreams in their personal life also, I have brought this bill, achieve this, are all those fulfilled?  You find yourself that life was yours, it was in your hands, it was your hard work, it was your aspirations, your goals were yours, the streets were yours, but are you able to achieve them completely, whether you are a student or not? You  Whether you are an investor or you are in a relationship, we think that it will happen like this here in Haryana too, there is a saying that marriage songs are not all songs during the wedding, do not turn off, you are but date and mean date, wedding is happening and  Devar bill b no songs just because de bill don't turn off tu b true it's wedding it's wedding season to songs bill b song kasme waad a bill b  Donation is fine, I will do it like this, I will live with you like this, I will not go to my parents' house, those crows who lie, all the things that are happening in their lives will happen now, observe during the election time, the brother who is not even promising the story, what will he do?  Then why don't you listen, why do n't you tell exactly what you will do to make it happen, so now from my old video, I am telling here some things and history, I have given some things which are low hanging fruit.  With whom this can be done, can you see those things from the medium of Twitter, from the medium of WhatsApp, from the medium of social media, can we be successful in putting them in those manufactured? Then it will fly like dust, then no one will listen to anyone, then everyone will be on the side of poor people only because they have to do vote bank, now is the time for the middle class to listen, September October November, after Diwali, then  that last last  It will seem that in the last life, the setting here should be the setting there, this is the time when people are also thinking about them, both are thinking about the fairies, both are ready to listen to the fairies, the fierce war has not started yet and that conflict is about to happen.  Before telling us, tell us like this, brother, we are so many middle class people, we also have some desires, please look into it, please, what will you guys do, what will we send from the middle of this video, what are the different histories that I have just given in my video? will do  please share this thing thank you"

    "title": "Importance Of Narrative In Present Times [FpBa2tMpjz8].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, The One Who Controls the Narrative will do very well in today's time. It can also be seen by linking it to politics, but in general life, one thing you will get to learn is the narrative i.e. which is a long story if you translate it in Hindi. Narrative is there even inside homes, it is also there in families, it is also there in your work place, it is there in your politics, it is there in the country, it is there in business, in advertising, in sales, in marketing, it is there everywhere that brother, the story you heard. How much power is there in his story and how many people are ready to believe that story that brother, by applying this cream, you will become fair, if you are ready to believe then he has created a narrative or inside the house, mother creates a narrative, I have come, there is a lot of torture.  What happened to me and what happens in that narrative, whenever a narrative is made, you have to understand that it is not that if it is made on lies then there is truth in it, it is true and because if it is made only on lies then those lies are  so quickly You can break that narrative by holding on to it. The problem lies in those stories which are mostly true but at some points something convenient is added to them, they are dangerous and the ones who make the narrative real are the ones who are experts in anything. And those focusing logic will take you to things that ca n't be found in easily verifiable language. That kind of is okay, so what is narrative? Narrative is a big  The thing is that this story from here is the stories of many stories, small stories in between, now there are some stories in it, you have added verifiability in between, you have never concentrated on the tadka, you have added dates, timings and facts which can be checked by melting them, check.  Do it, check it, they do it, they do it on YouTube too, these fools do it on YouTube too, they do it on YouTube even while sitting outside, they are inside the country too, it is done by the opposition or the ruling party, everyone does it.  The one who does it in a better way, the one who is not caught, the one whose innocence is too much, it becomes a matter of him, only this many people will be telling that this is a lie, this is a lie, this is not right, this is wrong, they are the same people.  Is it wrong that India got independence in this year No? Is it wrong that this happened at this time Otherwise this happened So if 100 things have been said in this thing and we have told 50 then it is right.  The remaining 50 will also be correct. Because who has the time to sit and explain each and every thing, write the context, narrate its stories, debate, who has the time, all on one stage, like us, those who understand things can only smile, yes, it's okay, I am getting to know that  What is happening, who is doing what, doing things selectively, in mental models this is called focusing illusion or some confirmation bias things are done or depending on what you want to perceive for  For example, if you get the benefit of reservation and you get a job in the government, then you would like to listen to the narrative that suits you that yes, a lot of atrocities have happened, it has happened for the last 5000-100 thousand years and this will continue till this atrocities does not end.  Will be an athlete for 50 years, it won't happen anymore, that means if I get it, the one who is not getting it, he will want to hear a different narrative that my parents had got me done, I do n't know who did what to me. I have made a mistake and you all will make a mistake and it is a meritorious thing, I am not saying that it is wrong or bad, it will happen like this because it is natural, but when we have to make decisions in life, we have to consider all these things.  To see through, to do or not to do, brothers and sisters, do you tell me, is whatever is happening in your life the same truth? Is it the complete truth that the things which you see with your eyes, because nowadays it is the era of AI, what is seen by the eyes is seen by the ears.  You can't even believe what you heard, you have to understand and see it at the brain level. And time of story is tellers who tell great stories and there is no need to give any pity to the one who is not able to tell the story. If your  There is no false story, there is no alternate story, there is no comparison story and if a person has it, then people will go to the person who has a comparing story. This is the truth of life when it is a party or a gossip in the locality. so which is the best  To whom is he narrating the story? People go there and sit more. The one who has more meaning is imparting his knowledge in a different way. If others are not getting interested then no one will come there.  People will go only where they feel that something exciting is about to happen and whether it is true or false, listen to the story, three or four out of 10 become true, two or four, you can make it true even by working hard, two, four.  won't happen, after that you can  Yes brother, I mean it was done like this for example, I am telling you, it is okay to say like this, 400 par is fine, just a few years ago someone said in Haryana elections, 75 par is fine, then 75 is fine, CTI is 40, then someone went and asked, is it fine and so on.  What I like about this politician, I am really not a stickler but a big Vinam, I am speaking to him and said, 'Man, we had given this target to our workers, we had given it to the workers that  Yes, bring so many, if you tell your child 90 par means 90 but 95 par, this time in Hindi, 95 par in Math, 95 par, you are giving a target, it will not mean that you are giving a target, but what narrative does that create?  How does the morale of the rest of the people go down after hearing from him that he is not asking about 400 seats, which party will contest maybe on 406 or 420 seats?  Crossing 400 means but many people are like this, see in reality in life, even if a second voter falls on the narrative and comes to vote thinking that man, I can't vote for him and now crossing 400.  And that happened in Haryana, 2-4 per vote bank did not go even thinking that people are going beyond 75 and go and vote in that number, then this is very intelligent politics which is at the narrative country level. America will do a lot of work by telling good stories even at the world level. Climate war will be like this. The world will become like this. That too was just a narrative, that Saddam Hussein had to do something like this, George.  Bush said yes, we have weapons of mass destruction, we did it, then it was done, if we did not get it, then it will be seen, it will be seen, it will be seen, this work is very effective, don't do it once, tell any story, let them respect us. Russia has to attack Ukraine by insulting it badly. Put any narrative to counter it. If you put a counter to it, there are too many narratives going on. We cannot escape from the narrative. We have to enter the narrative and see the narrative of every person. What is my agenda? Like, my only narrative is this. Can I have many agendas? Am I a supporter of any party or an anti-party? This will be my first thinking and second thought. Maybe I really want to awaken the intelligence and conscience of our innocent people. Maybe this is second order thinking. Third fear is thinking that nothing is like that. I have my own emotions and feelings. I come and share them with you all. I do it, that's all, I share it through video, the video also goes viral, you people like it, it's better than watching IPL, to have toxic fights in the park, to have idol jiggle war with him.  This is also a good thing, maybe if there is a reason, then every person will have a reason behind making some narrative, including mother who makes the narrative in the house, uncle ji has to come or not has to come, there will be respect, there will be respect, mother-in-law starts making it already.  If you are talking to your sister-in-law a little lovingly, it means that a relative of your mother-in-law is coming so that she can behave in front of them or you have to create a narrative for your sister-in-law or the narrative is created for that boy, see, this is how it happened.  Well, it happened that your mother did it like this, she did it like that, she has to go somewhere, she has to go, everyone has their own story, these days small children have learned to make narratives, nowadays small means two, two, three, three year olds say Bhoomika, I don't know Bhoomika, I don't know Bhoomika. The Correct Translation Anybody Who Got Better Hindi Can Tell Atlee Narrative Ka Kya Woh Karenge Okay To Every Buddy Does It You Also Do It You're Part Of It Some Times You Face It  Sometimes in this narrative you are the audience, sometimes you do the narrative. Even in the office you must have seen a person saying that I do the most work, I worry the most, I mention that concern about work.  It's okay whether I work or not, I don't care and the thing I mention the most is the narrative that I am very ambitious, I do n't know how to do anything, but the narrative has been created well that I want promotion.  I am ambitious, I am hardworking, I am also a greedy person and I am everything like this, but on the basis of narration, many people achieve a lot of things, sometimes what happens is the narrative is such that a lot of people can see through it and  People do see through it and then what happens is you feel that oh it will flop but then that smart person can be anybody.  The audience finds a new one, now it will take time again, the old one has come to know what the game is, only then you can watch it, there are big YouTubers, there are very big YouTubers, there are many leaders, there are many people, they have an expiry date.  That after that R is not added again, he starts to realize that love is totally under the agenda and as they say in our language in Haryana, he lags behind very badly. Pendant Thinker I Will Never Ever Say Sound Neutral People That Know You Should Be Know You Cannot Be Neutral In These Times It Has To Be Either This And That In Those Times But You Can Be Independent That Whatever The Thought Process Is Is My Own Thought Process And That From My Logical Thoughts I Feel So And With Times That Thought Process Can Change With New Developments You  Kant, see, people say this in thought process and narrative that friend, tell me one thing, if you love someone then there should never be a divorce, there will be marriage, there will always be love, but divorce also happens, why does it happen, earlier there was love, now there is love. No, but in political idol ji, people expect supporters in political parties, who are blind devotees of anyone. What do they say that once you are here, you are now my friend, this is the feeling wife and  Keep the work of seven births for the husband, don't keep it for the politician, this is the narrative, they all tell such stories, give you sweet pills, eat their sweet pills, it is okay, but you should know that you are being fed pills and what is happening to you.  There is no need to be so enamored with each other, there is no need to do so much clapping, that is the message again and again that our country is like a pressure cooker city, whenever I work to bring something out.  In my videos, I repeatedly say that you have to vote for whomever you want, our job is not to influence your vote, our job is that you must vote, you must vote for whomever you want, the voting percentage should be very high in the country.  You should go within the 90s, but don't become so sentimental about it, it won't make much difference if you go deep inside, you will be worried. You know, as the country becomes intelligent, this will happen. Politicians will have to change the narrative, first they used to tell about the 8 major poverty in Bihar and that this is the caste which eats rats and make them talk like this, all this will stop happening now because the level of poverty has reduced, I am not saying this.  Poverty in India has decreased, it has increased a lot, but the level of extreme poverty has ended, so there is no talk of that level, it is of a different level, that is, the narrative will keep changing, so it is our job.  Be it government officials, be it state government, be it politicians, be it our favorite leaders or even those who are not our favorite leaders, it is okay to get them to set the narrative for your work like education, health, mental health, sexual health, mental and sexual health, see both, health is. Related with sexual health Mental health is even more Related with sexual health No one is making the narrative of mental health and sexual health No one is talking Sharma shy  I am not doing it or more than half of the leaders who are in dominant positions are probably beyond this thing, so maybe they would be ashamed of the word I will not say but I may not give identification is fine but we will have to put an agenda which is ours.  Women are leaders, okay athlete, hold on to that because you are a woman, sensitive about women's welfare and all this because sexual health is irrelevant of gender, it's not about  It is only males, it is male and female and it affects the family, it affects the emotions, so we will set the narrative. Which narrative do you want to create through my videos, beyond which we can talk in a relevant manner and together we  Let us also create our own narrative. In independent India, why do n't we, the common public, have the right to have our own narrative or will we just keep voting in their narrative?  Brothers and sisters, let this one happen, let this one happen, whether this is done right or not, this is done right, these 24 hours, you have to take votes in the elections, take one in the assembly, take one in the Lok Sabha, take one half brother while roaming around the village, take each one.  It is okay to take votes on something and you are not even taking it. You are not even telling who is giving and who is getting. Just like this, this is right, this is good, this did not happen earlier, this did not happen like this, this did not happen like this.  No, look at it, you can do a rock feller.  There was a person who was the richest man in the world. 1930 is fine. Check it. It was less than 100 years ago and he who was the richest man in the world. Most of us are in the middle class. Even some people in the lower class are staying if they become progress. By the way.  The human society will also be the same; we are living better than the one who was the richest man in the world less than 100 years ago because of the generality of the world. Now you are listening to me sitting at home through this video. Yes, what was the scope earlier? Earlier, you had to be an actor in TV or you were a big person, only then you could send a message to someone. Nowadays, you can open a small channel of your own and talk about your work, that is how the world progressed.  Now you will tell him in actual that look, the progress will be so much, I should claim it all, no, that claim cannot happen, that narrative will be wrong, according to me, we will have to see through it, so be a little intellectual. This is a level channel, for those who know how to give feedback, it comes in the comment section, please request brother, stay on the same channel, it is not necessary that if you feel pain in something, then it is necessary to come to the same party where the food is being served.  You don't like it, sometimes people enjoy the way it happens, it is okay that paint is being painted somewhere, there is a smell in the paint, some are fine, some do n't like it, some like it, and many say that  doesn't look good but Even if you have to go and smell it again and again, if you do n't like it, then why are you coming here again and again? I am telling you as an example. It is my habit to tell you as a practical example so that you can understand, brother, don't comment on things that you don't understand.  Do it okay, don't come and enjoy more, then please write in the comment section that you enjoy and like and share. Thank you very much."

    "title": "Importance Of Parivar In Life ｜ Why Rampant  Misuse Of This Word By Politicians Should Stop ？ [R_R1-sd-F48].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today we will discuss about family and politics. Normally, whenever family is discussed in the context of Indian politics, the word family is used more than family, today I will talk more about familyism than familyism, on family, on family and I will try to show this.  That we are headed in the right direction, as far as this word is concerned, family is being used very loosely, you are my family, I am your family, we all are family, it should not be said that family is only family. In which there are blood relations, forcibly making people a family is a part of identity politics. You cannot say that you did not get married, if you did not get married, then you did not have children, then you moved on to some other place in life and then you remembered the family.  Then people become your family, no one becomes anyone's family, the challenge today is that the family remains a family, that is a very big thing. I am a social observer or an observer who talks like this in the 21st century.  There are no people to speak because either the thing becomes a very political issue or people go to their own tune, so this channel is for intellectuals, try to understand what the poet is trying to say, if you are in America.  If you see, whenever there are elections there, the family is shown, whatever is the family of the President, such a family is gathered, the first lady, two children are put forward, after taking the name, see what is the status of the President from the beginning, whenever your votes  He is also the President because for him family has great value. The Same Thing I Can Say Just as the British are concerned with their monarchy or their Prime Ministers, the importance of family has been understood by those societies where the value of family is very high.  It is more because if there is no family living then its value is very high. In India, after so many years of independence, living alone is considered good in political discourse and in public office because we accept it.  That it does not belong to anyone otherwise he will not eat the money, will not do corruption, while corruption can be of many different types, it is always believed that if a single person does not have a family, then he will be engaged with his body, mind and wealth.  There will be plenty of time, this is a first order thinking, he will always do the right thing. Look, there may be some advantages of not having a family in public space that your time and energy can be divided more but no one ever talked about its disadvantages because we in our society  Look left in the country, look right, in the recent times, I will not make high office suits for everyone because family is not only from wife, family can be from mother to sister, brother to brother's children to sister's children too. It is okay to be so disinterested and have a Yogi type feeling.  Giving that I have become a Yogi can impress in life but a lot of understandings of life are missing. Family teaches us a lot. Family has its own pain because when you have your own family, you become immediate family.  If this happens, then do you understand that this work-related habit which has come into the society, what effect is it having on the families in our country, because if a person is alone, his brother will not be able to pass the time, he will have to use uniforms, that's it.  Will keep people engaged in work, will keep people engaged in work. If a big politician is working at 10-11 o'clock in any big business and has gathered the world, then at present he is working silently, that is a different thing but he is not alone.  Work Then how will there be fun in doing it, where will the world tell me till what time I was doing it, if you do it till 12 1 2 o'clock, then the system below will wake up, then many of them wake up and this example was taken, okay, do it like this, it should be like this. This has become so much, now if it has happened then don't see so much sycophancy, so much sycophancy, make it a part of the family too, otherwise life will be successful for people who do this, they don't get anything else, we just saw. Lok Sabha tickets are being distributed, how are they cut? People mean that if the tick is okay, then it belongs to someone, no, yes, it is a selfless work. If you want to see, then this new one had come out in the family, a little bit, but it has died down, which is very bad.  It is good when the political party started saying that we are your family, all this, oh no brother, you can be a team, family does not belong to anyone, everyone's family is their own and the one who has chosen not to take the family on the higher path.  If you go then you will get the roof  I have full respect but you can't eat even my cards or my money. You are right that there was no family now, it was empty, now it has become a family, now it is my family, now this is this pain, this is the pain that families keep on creating or which are created by someone else.  Family members become like this, take care of your family, I agree again and again, Irrespective of Political Parties India has 35 crore small families and count the big family which includes siblings, parents and some joint family type.  It is close to 10 crore joint families, if the head of every family takes care of his family, this country will be greatly benefited. We do not need to be dependent on any politician, on anyone else, we hurt each other more within the family.  We give, cut, harass, our relationships are not managed by us and we do not know which deep nostrils are ready for him to enter our family or ready to let him enter our family.  Have you voted with your family that we all should become his family or should we include him in the family? Have you ever done this? This complex of relationships is very difficult to understand in life. Towards this on 30th March.  But if you want to do more with a boy, girl, husband, wife and love-night then you will see the number given in the comment section, you can do that then you can join for that. If you can, then you will get to understand the deep meaning of relationships, but in politics, family should never be a handicap. If you want to join, because people from more families will come into politics, then they will do good because it is established in other democracies and the citizens there.  It is also well established that he neither has a wife nor children, how will he understand that this thing sounds very bad to say because it is a work of food and drink.  The corrupt work is that Lalu ji has nine children, 10 10 children, maybe 10 children are ok and that one, we give an example, okay, we give the example of Mulayam Singh and move towards family war, we do not see this. That now I am not protecting them, nor am I protecting them, but in having a family, I understand many things, I understand the pain and suffering of the people, I get to know what are the genuine issues of women, it is not that  You were roaming around in isolation carrying a bag all your life, now you will have insights into all the things because the things that your family teaches you, the things that you learn in life by becoming a mother or a father, cannot be learned so easily in life, no matter how much you try to do. Keep sounding intelligent. Keep showing how much. I don't have such experiences. It is visible in the suffering of our country. The suffering in our country is that people are unhappy at the family level because so much.  It has been superficially said that there is no time to think about yourself because the day you start thinking about yourself, you will be away from the top leaders, then how can they manipulate you for anything, brothers and sisters, how are these stories?  If you tell then constant engagement is constant like now I am a user, I am a content creator, I also have to keep engagement, like, subscribe to the channel, comment, this is an engagement but if my  In the engagement, some good is happening to you too, you are also getting some messaging, you are getting peace, so that is our relationship of give and take, but if you look at the side of the politician, then what are they giving except an airy feeling?  It was just fun, I narrated it today, I narrated it there, it happened like this, it happened like this, the respect has increased, this is the respect of Badag, this is ours, it is giving us a lot of trouble in our families, this is this respect.  Deficiency of Vitamin B12 in India along with Vitamin D deficiency is the genuine deficiency which we should correct, both of these things. If you are my subscriber, then if you have not tested yourself in the last six months by getting a blood test done then on my advice.  I am neither typing it from any path lab nor taking anyone's name. I am fine, but still you can get the test done wherever you want. You will get the test done, both will be less but Indians want to fill these two with respect, Vitamin D.  The deficiency of vitamin B12 cannot be filled with respect but these politicians come and fill it with the words that we have given you respect, we will make you like this, this will happen there, this society will become like this, this may not happen, this may not happen, these things may not happen. You should remain detached from it. Your life is your family. If your kids are not doing well then all these political parties are in trouble. It is okay if your child is not able to do well, it is of no benefit to him. You do not need to become the leader of any political party because they are engaged, I don't know which one is their vote bank, I am addressing my audience which is middle class, upper middle class, upper.  Middle class children are no longer able to do that well. Business is not done in their families. There are no more jobs like that. If you look at the per capita income of middle class families, it is decreasing, not increasing. Especially if the children are 22  23 24 26 year olds are not earning money. Dreamy eyes are roaming around. Rich people have their own mind, they will make it fit with their own tricks. The poor person has no problem because he can do anything, his child will do whatever.  If it is not done before or if it is better than before then there is no problem in that too, the problem is of this middle class which is either busy in IPL or political in it and is dependent on the family.  If you don't have focus then you have to focus more on family than politics. Sometimes do politics but for the sake of what is called, there is no need to be centi. If you have to be centi in life then it should be for the family and not force someone into the family.  Don't share that you are my family and don't become anyone's family. You are like my son, you are like my father, you are my daughter, no one is like anyone else, son is son, father is father, daughter is daughter, wife is wife.  and parents are parents  Okay, no one can take anyone's place and there is no need to give place to anyone, these are relationships, understand them and keep them, saying these things again and again does not suit anyone because the day the family will become empowered, many things are going on in Kolappan.  Today it is okay to divide the family by gender i.e. by separating husband and wife. By separating children and parents, it is costing the bread and butter of many people in the society because without them, you see this, even the elders.  He is a businessman and a politician. Now look at that family in Haryana. It is a political family. What is the condition of it? The whole family is fighting from Hisar seat. I think no one else will win. This is also a noise because that election is between two big parties.  Inside, they are engaged in useless things, they have got their mud washed, so this is the situation of politics and family, political parties make this status from here, you can see what they do inside Maharashtra.  Again, the political family is that of father and daughter and then their cousin and what is the calculation they have made. Everywhere you see that if you give importance to the family, even while being in politics, then your life can turn out to be much better because it  Those political parties who have defamed Chanakya, Chanakya, Chanakya, Chanakya, Chanakya, have gone far ahead, I do n't know who has gone ahead and I am the one who is leaving people.  I will tell the Indians that brother, remember that every man who is alone is not necessarily a hero, because in Indian movies, I have seen that even Mu Kambo did not have a family, it is okay that Mr. India's villain was in fact the hero. He always had a family, yes, that family definitely looked like a baggage because in Ajit's end it was said, bring his mother, okay, so the man used to think, why is it only his mother, why didn't he leave her or his wife?  Or bring your girlfriend and you are like, this is nothing to Ajit, Ajit's Mona Darling used to be one, okay, the other wise was nothing to Ajit, okay, who is that Anupam in the picture Doctor Dying Karma? Well, he also did not have any family. Okay, Mukho also has no family, so villains never had any family. Look at this picture. Normally, villains never have any family. It is always the hero's job. You have to become a hero in life.  Do you want to become a villain? No, what are you trying to say? You are trying to say that it means that the people who are working alone are not villains. No, no, yes, I am saying this, every person working alone is not a hero, I am saying this.  I am not saying that he is a villain, I am saying that villains were shown alone, don't take everything the wrong way, understand, understand, just because man is alone, a dozen means that everything is great about him.  because he is alone  Yes, he has started on some path, no, he has started on the path, okay, what is so great about it, everyone is walking on some path, the biggest path is that people are getting married and not having children.  Then make that France, they do not marry, then the demography will be different there, then it will be a different program, what will be left there and you see, if you do not give birth to children, then you have made the infrastructure very good, okay?  did not create a family  So families from outside, people from different communities and religions will come and say thank you very much, you have created such a lovely infrastructure, you have worked so hard, but children are not born from you, families are not raised by you, so we will come and enjoy. This is what is happening in Europe, brothers.  Sisters, you have done it very well, they have created a good environment, now it feels like chilly that if we have made this then the population will definitely come, now like you throw an ant, say sorry ant.  If you throw sugar, ants will come somewhere, if you do not use that system, if the resources of our country, the good weather here, the infrastructure here, whatever blessings of nature are there on our country, if  If we don't use it, someone else will come. Brother, it's simple, no matter how he comes, he will come with any pretext to work by applying for a visa, investing money, you see this, I am from Gurgaon, Gurugram only.  Let me take the example that 20 years ago, the population here was less and there used to be a section of people who used to sweep, wash and do utensils, people used to come from one area, all of them graduated, all the schools built here have sisters who Look at the children, that one, the ladies from UP, Bihar, who used to work there, must have graduated, that is, she has gone a little higher than the lower tank and that one is a little higher.  The professional work is done, women and children come sitting in school buses and you must have seen that in the last seven years, a different section of the system, from different provinces, different communities, is coming and doing survey on them. Someone called.  No, it just happens automatically, as soon as someone empties, someone goes to the vacuum, someone comes there and does the vacuum, there should be a requirement in the same way, brothers and sisters, when there is no family, then in the next family, if you do not pay attention and In this world, if we are not able to have children, then this is bound to happen. He is the only one and feels that Prashant Acharya ji is the one, we have 4 crore subscribers. Now his 1 crore to 4 crore should happen so soon that it can happen.  At the rate at which it is increasing, it should also come in the Prime Minister's line, because if we talk about followers, no political party has that many and to say the least, it is a matter of shame for the one with Rs 4 crore, but he said.  You see this is a different thing that they don't know from where the subscribers have increased, the views are only one and a half to two lakhs, brothers and sisters, my channel has 25,26000 viewers, but brother, I also get 253 thousand views after going and watching the video.  That means I get more views than my subscribers, he is sitting with 4 crores, if he has 1 lakh 2 lakhs then brother, where did he collect this from?  Out of your four crores, 4 lakh i.e. 1 in people don't even see the views but look at their views, recently again in the middle of my videos, pour cold water on their hot pan, they stop saying no, I am against marriage.  Or have I been there for the last three- four days? Look at their family, the happiness of the same person will start again. The same frustration is coming out. Two days ago, a woman asked me a question. I feel like I am alone, I should get married, a man should come.  hey what  She has already turned 35, now what next friend? Why are you trying to de-motivate people? If someone wants to get married, she will do more. Is there any need to tell her that don't do it? People will feel uncomfortable in saying it.  It seems that no no do n't say so since when did this cutter point become okay that no no don't do something great do us in the society who are not getting married this is not a norm this is not a norm Normality as if yes, the country is free, everyone has their own choices, we are asking no one to force us, but this is not a subject for clapping, I want to say this just because no leader has married, dozen means many, it is a great thing and it is a  Very Average Thing, I am going to talk about one more thing and in the end I have told the video till the end, now I want to tell a few more things, why should I tell you in the end, I am also telling the reason for it because till the end, your video is very good.  Subscriber is the one who understands your things, he does the same, if you speak in the beginning, he will whip you, our Prime Minister was late Rajiv Gandhiji, now you have become a Congressman, not a Congressman, friend, example, you ca n't even open your mouth, what is it, many can't even open their mouths. Sometimes it happens that by voting, show that I have done it, then I will speak openly, then you will let me speak, okay, so our late Rajiv Gandhi ji was that one in 1985.  Family picture we could see husband and wife, two children are fine, even after that we got to see some Prime Ministers, the one before this one is a little older but the family becomes bigger, he brought one thing to India for the first time and it is still going on till today.  And brothers and sisters, is it right to tell, isn't it, he was the person who brought this five day week that Saturday Sunday should be a holiday. If it is done in the government, then the government also perpetuates it in the private sector, now how can we  We are becoming like this, work all seven days, serve Mother India, leave China behind, keep working for 70 hours, 80 hours, Narayan Murthy style. Hey brother, what will you do, friend, what will I do if I am getting money by working, if I am getting money.  There is a vada pav shop and my vada pavs are being sold, so I do n't need to take permission from you that I work for seven days, five in the morning or evening, I will keep working like a donkey if I work alone in my video.  I do it, my videos are watched a lot, so how many wishes can I make, what does it matter to me, but I am talking about people who are in employment, who are in organized sector, who go to office somewhere, who are in government jobs, what is called Monday, Sunday, one.  It is okay, it is okay, Monday, Sunday, Tuesday, Saturday are all done together, this is not a good thing, a government function, I saw it was open, government functions are happening on Saturday.  Have you seen Mahashivratri coming and he too is being told that it is good and work should be done, this is a man who has nothing and has no motivation to sit at home, he has done grinding like this.  That it doesn't let it stand. Have you seen that when shikanji is made? Summer has just started, it is happening right now, okay, when shikanji is made, it is rotated like this, chinni, when it rotates, the water becomes like this.  It settles after some time and then you drink it. Brother, keep rotating it, keep rotating, keep rotating, keep rotating, rotate anything, rotate the curd, the butter will come out, then stop at some point. Friend, the butter is gone, leave it, keep rotating it, keep rotating it, oh brother, do it, friend, don't evolve everyone, a Prime Minister did it with difficulty in five days a week, because friend, no rocket can take more than 6 seconds. You can do it from the morning, it is like if you have the capability to get %, God has given you so much brain, then brother, only this much will come, be patient with him and do something else, no, I will get 98, I will keep studying, I will keep studying, you will tear the eyes of your life.  You will do something like this, that is the message, don't work so hard and that hard work is being done for glory, some leader, some senior, some officer, some Vice President, some CO of today.  These are the leaders of your political party for whom you will give your blood and give us freedom. Netaji had said, give your blood and you will get freedom. They do n't even give you freedom. Nowadays buses keep taking blood and go away. They will change the party themselves.  Your CEO will sell the company and go away. Your leader will change the party. It's okay, anything can happen to anyone anywhere. You are busy with him like a donkey. Today you see how the candidates are changing parties in the selection.  Are Yaar, these people have no shame, they don't even have yava. Yava is a Haryanvi word, please write what it is, I think it loosely means embarrassed. Okay, so Emerson is amazing, so please whatever happens, give importance to your family, that is the message channel.  Like, share and write in the comment section and internalize this message then you will release it. That the country will change us, how the country thinks, how the country thinks, how we have to change, we cannot change these leaders, we have to change ourselves, these leaders will forcefully keep us all trapped in their useless agenda and such videos will keep coming and no  It feels as if I am speaking for a particular person and a particular party, so now it seems that no one can do anything to anyone, yet it seems that what to do now, okay, I will have to tell because if the student  It is not possible to see a student passing, whose marks are not coming, then the rest will talk only about the agenda he is setting. If we do n't talk about him, then what should we do about those who have to come with 50 seats, 60 seats, 70 seats blocked? Anyway, what does the poor guy have to uproot? Well, then only those who can set the agenda will have to tell him that brother, let him breathe a little, let him relax a little, let him enjoy a little.  Giving work is yours to do, you do it, we will also do your clapping, we are fine but leave this 24 hour engagement, leave us, spare the middle class, stay engaged with the poor who will give you cylinders, will give ration, they will give us this.  Don't listen to stories. If there is anything of use to us then tell us. If not then leave us. This is what we are going ahead with. I have 10-12 things which I would like the parties to include in their manifesto agenda. If you do that  If you want videos then please write them in the comment section. Thank you very much."

    "title": "India  Vs Bharat Debate ｜ What Is Best Approach ？ [2effVXk4Cnk].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, there has been a discussion on Bharat and India, there has been a lot of discussion, many videos have been posted. First I thought I should post, then the world was posting, then so many videos were posted, then it seemed that if I had something to eat, then I had  is there still something to eat you I am sir you too must have your opinion on this thing so let's discuss it just like the world has discussed about India and Bharat, which one should be there, which one is more appropriate, so first this  India is a world, you can't call it British so soon. Yes, it is from outside, but India is not like the British who ruled over the 19th century, 18th century. You can go up to Megasthenes, when Alexander came, in his book, the word Indica and Indica starts.  had gone so this is an external word, I have said it but it is not that this is a new word, okay it is very old, very old, when Columbus went to Columbia, sorry, but we mean Columbus went to find India, he went to America  So he was coming to India, Vasco da Gama also came to India, okay, so let's understand this one thing, okay  The second thing is India is even older than that, India is even older than that, okay, while saying Bharat, you may have a little more feeling, but we will understand India and Bharat in the same way as if in our country, if we say India and also say Bharat, then we don't have two names for the child.  There is a pet name, father and mother call him. When he grows up and becomes mature, then he gets a name. Some people know him by some name, then some friends also give him a name, it is okay to have a nickname.  It goes your way, it becomes Sagwan Singh and should someone say something to someone with love, love should be reflected, basis should be reflected, it should be fun, is this debate good, I will not say useless debate, once you have yours, now you will know a little more in a different way  Let me tell you, I think you can see it like this that in India, there is a spiritual element of India which we stand for spirituality and all these things, spirituality is something which cannot be understood so easily, power cannot be understood at all, that element is old.  Yes, India, even this peacock has pea lipstick, we do not want India to disappear. We don't have to make India disappear. We don't have to say that this is Bharat. Both of these can be made interchangeable. Both the names are in the constitution. There is no need to pass any amendment, nothing. It is like it can be called by that name also.  You have to see that as it is said many times you have to reclaim things and many times it happens that there is a difference between change and reclaim like I have recently heard this thing from the story so I am telling you this thing  Let me give you an example, like many things changed, our Madras became Chennai, Kolkata became Kolkata, before that it was yours, so first of all if you look at our India, like Prayagraj, before that Allahabad was changed, so Prayagraj is not changed, it is Reclaiming of something, there is no need to do such a big thing in it and even now it is interchangeable and sometimes it changes anyway like Gurgaon and Gurugram are in the channel's name, you also have Gurugram brother Gurgaon so Gurgaon is like that  It was there only, now it has been changed to Gurugram, so the village is also a gram, right?  It is there and that good by the way in short form Guru is also done many times but even today people say Gurgaon only, people want to say whatever in simple language whatever they understand, many times you have made it Varanasi before that Banaras Before that there was Kashi, so even now the old people who understand, they call it Kashi, okay, there are people who call it Varanasi, there are also those who call it Banaras, so there is nothing wrong in it, just that there should be a fight over it, otherwise India is its  There will be a registry and no one from India is there in it, so this is a little different from what happened, otherwise someone would have asked why such programs were not conducted 40 years ago because now that narrative has to be given because you should think about this debate that is going on right now.  Yes it is more of a marketing debate that is also going on like Pepsi art or there are some two brands of this kind which are marketing with each other, so we have to do clipping, whoever has united India, he has to do clipping further.  n audience further away then this one from India and this also has to be clipped, there is fighting and quarreling like this in it  It is not in the name of the country, these debates that are happening and this set that is happening, this journey is turning, whenever churning is happening, the butter has to be extracted, then a little force is applied, that centrifuge force, center force and  That tightness and that separation, they are going through date changing today in the country, you should enjoy this turning because in no story, something or the other will change, something new will come and that form will change, you have to see, the same milk will be visible  It is the same that curd is formed from milk, from the same curd you are extracting butter, that butter exists, in that also curd is made from milk, butter is made from curd, so this is a process, this is good, this is a process, it is a dynamic situation, thing ahead.  It will work, there is no need to take stress in this, no need to take it, no need to give it, this is very good because now people are saying it again and again that I have to say one thing again and again and this is probably for the first time on this channel  Tell me, to be good something does not have to be big, if these people  If you understand this then many relationships will also get better. If you are a son and you are married and now you are a husband, then to be a good husband, do not become a bad son. This is the thing that is important today for the mother who is the sister and the wife who is the daughter-in-law.  Please understand son that this is not the registry of a plot which is being transferred in our name, this is our independence, this human being is capable of giving love and respect and protection and he will give it to his mother also and if he does not give to his mother then how can he give it to his wife  If he gives it to me then this day it will go into the mind of the husband and this insecurity will end which is better than a 25 year old because in that he gets relief from stress, he has to prove it to his son, now if I go for marriage council then that is why there are examples  These ones will come out of me, it's fine, but these are not practical examples, the citizen also has to see, if I have to say India again and again, then what does it mean, I am a guest of India, if I want to say India at some time or in some situation, then it does not mean that I am India World  Bill see yes in different way I see it like this India is inside us and  India is a third name too which is people lookable and respectable from outside and I will tell you one more interesting thing about India in this, now India is feeling like this that hey India has become like this because these opposition people have named it and made it India  You people are feeling shy, let me tell you, when India and Bharat became independent, then India was D premium number is like that, that is the number of the vehicle, when Maruti came, it was in red and white colour, when it was new, it was in red colour  - When it was new, the premium was of 5000 here, the white one came for 65-67000 and that one came for 72000, I am telling you the rate of 1985-86, you guys, Lal had a premium, so in this way there was a premium on India because Jinnah ji who  He is the founder of Pakistan because there was a lot of debate in India about the Indus Civilization Industries. At that time when the debate was going on about the name, our forefathers were the ones who were the constitution that is being made, it is one of the two.  You could have kept them because India was a continuity, the name of the new baby that was delivered is different, this is the mother country, you can understand it this way also, that time was free, you are from Pakistan For India Bharat, we should become India or if we make a mistake in its name then India was at its best in freedom, only then both these things have been written and there is nothing wrong in it, why would we eat rasgulla or kheer in it, we are saying both  Took the Rasgulla, you things, yes you can use it interchangeably, if you look at the names today in English and Hindi, then we do not say President House, we say Rashtrapati Bhavan in English also, if there is Defense Minister, then Republic of Bharat, if someone writes it, then it is fine now that  In our passport, Republic of India is written because this is an old season, Republic of India is written on it, but if ever you feel like giving an invitation to someone, then Republic is written as Bharat, so it does not have Bharat in it, I like the India I Bill thing.  Why brother, wear two colored shirts, sometimes wear a blue pen, sometimes wear a white one, it won't be enough now  You see, we do all this, we also take another name and I don't understand that the kind of environment that is going on these days and it is going on like that or whatever was going on, there is another name and that name was originally given by us.  It did not happen, it has been given by someone else, now what is its origin, no one knows about it, Hindustan Ritu Hindustan, I mean, nowadays, you should be Hindustan, no one is saying that, Hindustan also means Hindustan to it and they are very perfectly  Ok with Hindustan, it is also ours, when we say Bharat Mata ki Jai, then along with Bharat we add Mata, Bharat with Mata and one more is ours, but we also have another one which is very well pronounced Jai Hind ki si, Hind ki si  Jai Hind: Whenever we say Jai Hind, then Jai Hind is also a salutation used in the armed forces, used by people who are in uniform and it is also commonly used among normal civil population, also it's a very strong word, Jai Hind  So Jai Hind is also a relief, the victory of our Mother India is a relief and when the match happens then  India, India is also said in this way, India is also said in this way and in every place where the majority religion, which has the basic sense that everything is included, worship someone, consider someone as God, worship nature,  You can do it for any element, sun, fire, earth, water, okay, do it for any tree, every animal or bird, do anything, if there is so much inclusiveness in it, then what is this name in it, I  I am saying, the name of Hindustan should also be given a little more importance, it should be called India, Bharat, Hindustan, okay, before that, other names can also be used to become original, if they are not on the tongue that much, then it's okay, otherwise these three are  It can be done very easily and India and Bharat are written in the constitution, it is written officially, so as if it has become the official name, anyone can do it, it should not be done like this that what is written on your Aadhar card, what is written on your pen, our big  okay so both things are written in the constitution both things  has its own element, different in both, that has come, Bharat Ratna means a thing that is ongoing, okay, so it tells about the continuous dynamic system, which is the continuity of civilization, it is a big thing, it is a deep thing, but India is also its own thing, it is also an old thing, you can understand it very clearly  Just say it like this that no, you are not tight about this like something, you are doing it on WhatsApp group, you are doing it on Telegram, there is continuity, tell me how did you like this video, there is no need to get into trouble for everything because when we go on choice like this  that this is the good, I always repeat this dialogue, one line, take away from this, for something to be good do not make another thing bad, if people are interested in everything, people are interested in their religion that if your religion is good, very good, Priya then  No other religion has to be spoiled, for your religion to be good, your country is very good, national nationalism, patriotism is very good, so for your country to be good and progress, no other country has to be spoiled, these are the elements which are present right now  Vasudev family was inside G-20 ok family type okay so when this essence is there then it is the sense that I should also progress and others should also progress this is not such a thing it is not a zero sum game of light brother this is here but one arc one day after tomorrow meaning  If you are trading then it is not like you lose money but somehow you get money, life means that yes everything can exist, everything is good, okay, India is very good, India is also very good, someone has given it some name.  It does not make any difference, I liked the marketing strategy but if you still take my opinion, then there are many things that you do not equate with date, I mean I am being smart because this was the opposition party  He did n't do any smartness just like that, all his smartness was happening here, he was going on the internet, but he went into such a field that it did not matter forcefully, when whatever is the name of your country, you are giving it an acronym. Now if someone applies a little bit of brain then Bharat vs Start B will start from then  Just spend a couple of hours to get something out of the ARAT, there is a program from B, you know what it is, okay, it will be done, then make it versus dog, what foolishness are you doing?  According to me, it was a little bit according to that calculation but if there is a marriage, and these aliens are formed like this, they change 10 times, change their name 50 times, first they used to say Up, then Up 1 Up 2, then their NDA, then  This is India, then these people are arrogant and all this is your creativity, think about it, its ad is running and it is just a fight between Axel and Ariel, or it is between Pepsi and that, this is just happening, we will fight a little on this,  Sometimes I do n't understand till date that sometimes we fight that Bhartiya Mittal ji is very good or Mukesh Ambani ji is not so good, why fight like this that I don't have any other business, Jio and Airtel are the service providers Jio provides a service, Airtel provides a service, keep the number of the one you like, number portability  If you want to do portability, do it brother, do what you like, I keep saying this again and again that all politicians, every party is a service provider, that brothers and sisters, if we will give you something, then who fights on the service provider, service provider, whose service  If you like it then change the button for the next 5 years, if you don't like it then change it and you get so many opportunities in between also, elections are bound to happen in your state also, those are yours and again and again no, no  Sir, write about it daily, if it is Airtel's service, Airtel's service is bad or Jio's service is bad, if it is becoming useless then change it, yes we have one day, two days, five days time to change many things, there is a notice, we can do it  There are many things which we can change in five years as per the constitution, this is a difference because the government cannot change every day, power cannot be changed, elections cannot be held every day, so just do it, you have made a mistake, you can rectify it next time, it is okay, have patience  Keep it, you can improve it in the assembly, if it does not happen in the assembly then I can improve it, not in the municipality  If it happens, you can do it in the Sarpanch, do it in the ward, how many opportunities do we have and give it to each one separately, every friend is definitely a brother, you are an enemy, you should be careful about this, this question, this society can be done like this also, you can do all the things  So the purpose of this channel is that I want to make you and our countrymen relax a bit, there are so many hypermarts, it is not that much, you will live here for 70-80 years, out of which only 40 years are less.  The last 10 years are like a gift to me, the first 15-20 years of life are not in your control, you have 40-6 years in which you have a lot to do in your life, if you have that much time and energy in it then you can invest in these things  I am a channel which provides coolness and calm, this is to me again and again that you belong to this AAP party, now if I just mention the name then you belong to this party, you belong to BJP, you belong to Congress, if you come together then Left East Communist  Tell me brother I am not Shikha, I am not a member of any political party Disclaimer I am not a registered member of anyone. Which one do you like? I like one thing of some, I like something else of some and I like something else of some, if it were up to me I would say that brother, his party's  He should become the prime minister, but this party's finance minister should become this one, if this one goes, then okay, then if my mother leaves, my heart demands this, they come in a package, they make us unfortunate, it is possible that our country may become like this in the next 20-30 years  There should be some system such that I am not like this, if this is a party then there are faults in this party, there are three categories or taxes, rest of the people are collected after asking the Bawdi and reaching home, no one likes it, okay, nothing.  If I were to ask you today for names of your ministry, whether it is your state government or this central government, then in the government there are less PMs and two government names, you would not even know the names, this has become the situation because  I don't know that name or not, I do n't understand that his visibility seems to be doing something, nor is there any feedback.  So you have to take it, I did this, now like we know the name of Gadkari ji, today on the road to N minister, how many other cabinet ministers are there, which one is looking after which one, do you know if I go to take the test here, then it means I too  I don't know which I am saying that I know how, I mean I don't have to give any exam, I need to go and gain knowledge, so brother, whatever you do, you will see understanding, you will see Sharan, now like Jaishankar ji, everyone knows the name.  Those who are visible, brother, all of them are present, so the pressure of 34 ministers is visible, rest down here, no one knows whether he is doing anything or not and it is the same in the state government as well, everyone knows the name of the minister, the rest of the matter  If it is like that then I hope you will understand this discussion in this way, subscribe to the channel, many people are giving good comments that they have stopped watching news channels and by watching this channel of mine, they get a lot of peace and clarity in life.  She is going out, I am telling her what to do in the internal space, what do we have to change  We have to enjoy, we are water, we are the public, we are the subjects, okay, we have to enjoy comfortably, we have to see, have fun and relax, we do not fight, we have to observe deeply because here from where to say India and versus Bharat, hey brother, both are our countries yes no one is different and we don't fight among ourselves like this okay please subscribe and like thank you very match"

    "title": "India - Canada Relations ｜ What Common Man Needs To Understand ？ [Hx5hBYEHKpg].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, something like the scene of politics and geo politics of international politics is happening in the last few days, so I did not understand whether to make a video or not, what position to take because many things are getting salted and many a times I wait a little while making a video.  Because initial reactions come, this is a video, I will try to explain two or three things and you guys, the first thing to tell is this, the issue of relations with Canada has come up again, so in this, our government should Ask questions like are we Indians or should we support the government or is the Canadian government talking nonsense or is there something going on with Justin Trudeau and what is America saying, then all this is a bit mix and match to explain to the common man.  For this, I will work to provide clarity here only because I have seen that Modi ji makes videos against him to wake him up or he is also going on this issue, so here it happens that the creator is known.  It is okay that brother, you know that sister-in-law will speak only against mother-in-law, mother-in-law will speak only against daughter-in-law, it is a fact, but when it comes to family, brother, you are the women of that house, the respect of the house is in the hands of both of you. So that is the thing which is understood in all the families, those families flirt with it, fights between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law happen in every family, you all know that it is a natural thing, but where this distinction does not come.  So my take on this distinction is that we as age citizens should do two things, first of all, we should not create a lot of noise that we don't know what we have done by going there because they are claiming it, because every person has to redeem it as per his own.  The government wants to move forward in life by mixing a silent finger on all of you. The devotee types here are doing their own narrative and these trolls are from others because I am I am a person who oscillates between the two, okay this is also a fact, these people are separating us, I think we should keep quiet because what is Justice Trudeau ji, who is our Justin Trudeau, if he had something, he would have had one year.  If he is speaking from India then he would have given the proof, isn't it right? He has not given the proof, he has his own political compulsion. The second mistake that many of our countrymen are making is that every Sardar Bhai living in Canada, calling everyone Khalistani is very wrong.  There yes this trait is there but then it is very very minuscule there it is almost it is zero in India there it may be at 1% so doing that is also very wrong, through this video I want to tell that just Because this is something because this is what someone is trying to do, now who is that person, we don't know, say something from here, say something from there, America's language is also not good, America said Canada.  It is said that Canada is my friend, it should have great concerns, India, answer me, you are a shameless person, I have just bought those drones worth so many billions of dollars from you, your tongue is not silent, now it is visible, what kind of thing?  That is America, no one is anyone's friend, no one is anyone's friend, if father of the house, your sons have come, there is a scuffle with someone or something outside, then there is a scuffle in your house 50 times, but right now only father is with you. had to give  This is a natural thing, it is a different thing that some day you will also take a call with Papa ji sitting there saying, Papa ji, you are fighting with everyone so you know you also need to do but that is another day when today  If there is a fight or something, then the people at home have to say the same thing to us, what nonsense, why is Canada able to do all this, Canada has no more trade than us, no, it does not give us anything.  He does n't take much from us, health doesn't matter, the only thing is that our children go and study in his universities etc. Now I see this as the biggest problem for our children, although the data is that the number of citizens is not going to reduce.  To Canada, if you look at the last three-four days when Indians go to study and there is a slight decline in it now and it seems that there will be a lot of people in the coming time, then I think it is not a bad thing.  Appropriating to Canada, all do. How do the Indians in Canada feel? Please write in the comment section so that other people can know, but in the fight between two countries, the citizens of that country suffer because the citizens of Canada have come to India.  Those Canadian citizens who are not looking for a job or come here to stay, they are persons of Indian origin, so they are most welcome, no one will bother them anyway as they are Indians. We don't do anything like that to someone who is coming to India as a Canadian citizen. Well, that Canadian is not coming like the one who was born there, so these things will become a big parameter when it is decided that the children from here.  We are deciding that we have to settle somewhere in a foreign country because this geo politics will be version only in coming times because everyone has problems with all the countries, some are fighting the battle of Chaudhary in the world.  And to top it all, there is one more thing, it helps both the countries in diverting the attention of their local public towards a larger cause and to unite them. Justin Trudeau must be running his 50 teams in Canada. They must be asking him too. Brother, inflation is very high there, what about unemployment there, there is issue of housing prices there, there is issue of housing there, there are many issues there, just this.  Understand that it is in danger, because if it is in danger, then the narrative of danger goes on a lot. India will also be able to suit the government a little in a few days, if they do it like this, there was a momentum going on for other issues, that was Haryana.  After the elections, it has definitely reduced and as a social observer and political observer, I observe that it has happened, it has happened, now was the chance to do something to the opposition, even if we are not able to do anything.  The momentum will shift, now there are elections in Maharashtra, there will be videos on Maharashtra too, yes on Maharashtra elections, the second point I want to put from Maharashtra is that Lawrence Bishnoi is beyond comprehension as to how to work from home, he does not struggle with people.  What is happening in jail, what is happening, how is it happening, why is it happening, meaning, it is like very mysterious, beyond this, talking further also seems like what to do, how one person can  Do this because what is it, how will we catch the person who is caught in the jail again? He has been caught, so nothing can be done to him. This is such an Illuminati system of the gang world that there is no cure for it, so I came.  Don't know, at what level should this be discussed in the society, what effect is it having on us, how wrong is it? The off-course that happened in Mumbai in Maharashtra is very condemnable, but beyond that, what is happening next? Is there any anger from the public?  does not come  I don't see what I mean, somewhere inside I feel that as per the community or other wise, if you understand what I am trying to say, it is okay, that is, if the same thing had happened then the name of the person who changed it would have been reversed.  And if what happened to him would have been different, then it would have been the issue within the civilized society that would have aroused the anger of standing up for the wrong, saying that it should not be like this, law and order should not be bad, it should not be selective by the citizens, the brightest politicians, this.  We will do it selectively as per the state politics, it will be done soon but we as age citizens should raise our voice, what nonsense is this, how come, friend, I mean, if it is like this with them, then what about the rest of the people, then you people should understand both these things. What is your take? Please do write in the comment section. Videos on the channel will come regularly, but I want to bring beyond what is genuinely on the issue and what is on the mind of Maharashtra.  When the elections will come, the results of the Haryana elections were definitely shocking. Beyond that, now when the cabinet formation etc. will be done in Haryana, there will be further discussion on that. We as citizens want anything of ours, they want us personally, because of that, now I am  What benefits have to be taken further, what issues have to be raised, how to live life, there is a very large section of people in Haryana from whom I get such messages that those who say too much are not so.  I went into cold depression after the defeat and if a politician leaves then it is a normal thing because the general public sees my messages because they felt that after watching my old videos that I was supporting a section and a party.  And I am doing a narrative against a party, which I know within myself or not, I know what I am doing, why I am doing it, what I am doing is right and I have made ideology videos many times. By the way  If you go and watch my 100 episodes, I have explained my ideology to you guys in a video that brother, what am I doing, I am doing this, so they are coming as if I want to put some pressure whereas the fact is that brother, we are going to move on Haryana.  Have been elected and have become CM. Business is as usual. Now tell me what do you want from your government and tell them how it will work for 5 years. After that if there is a change then it will happen or it will not happen. So it will not happen, although I had told in an analysis that now I do not think that it is easy to expel BJP from Haryana, my prediction is that in the coming time, BJP will make Haryana like Gujarat, in Gujarat they have made Citadel, they have made Fortress, in Madhya Pradesh their second  It is a province, this is not the case with them in other provinces, in Rajasthan the bread is turning, in Himachal it is turning, in Punjab it has not been in power for a long time, Akali was with it earlier, it has been a long time, now it is Uttarakhand.  Even if Uttar Pradesh is considered a small state, it does not seem that it has become a fortress in any way because the opposition there is quite vocal, it is strong, in Bihar no one has come to power, even in Maharashtra, if you will not call it a fortress.  Haryana is one such third party, it keeps changing even in Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh. You know, these people have come to Orissa for the first time. There is no chance in Bengal, but now it seems that Haryana will remain with BJP for a long time. Will tell how the prediction is correct now because now BJP had the best chance, Congress had the best chance, that best chance window has been lost, now they will dig their heels, till now they were at the upper level, now they will go to the lower level, if there is delimitation then these three or four.  The topics were: How should you people from now on mix and match the politics which we read in the newspaper? We are not able to understand what is most important. The purpose of my channel is to show you how to consume politics and how to react. I bring support for that, we cannot do similar things in everything, just because we like BJP a lot, so we cannot support it completely on everything and accept that we do not like BJP and anyone else.  If we do, it does not mean that when it comes to larger issues, because I have found the opposition to be okay in this, the reaction of Canada has been okay to me, so far I have felt okay on the other issues, I am saying no on this. don't do it but this  What is YouTube, what does it mean once it becomes an unguided missile, it is a YouTuber, it is Godi, it is also a YouTuber which is technically spoken towards them, there are some anti-people too, take your name, he is Ajit Bharti, he is from BJP, Ravish is the same to you. Ajit Anjum will also be seen claiming like this. The people of Godi do not even claim that we are neutral. It is okay that they show it like this, but in such a space, people have caught a very clean narrative because  What doesn't the audience enjoy about that? These people have done it as if the non-veg people are thinking that those who are non- veg should go here, that means, those with non-veg should go here or they have done it in such a way that only those who are genuine should go here.  It is such a thing, isn't it, that we have to do it that way, I don't feel that it is any channel, I feel that it is my channel, but then I also need subscribers, I also need traction because of my time too.  I think I  I am also a capital person and I too do not have to recover the value of my time, so for that I would request you all to write in the comment section, first of all give feedback and secondly, make people around you subscribers of the channel because our people too. I also need such 40000 subscribers. This is also a good number. People with thinking, wisdom and consciousness will start thinking at intellectual level and will become independent. People may be thinking that they confuse neutral. What does neutral mean? I am neither of BJP nor of Congress, so I am neutral. It is impossible to be neutral. I have to be of BJP in some cases. If I have to be of Congress in some cases, then I am a neutral. I am an independent person on independent issues, if whatever happens, I am supporting Congress or if whatever happens, I am supporting BJP, then I am absolutely open-minded and this is this, then I am a worker.  It has already happened that if I am not a worker and I am a normal citizen then I cannot be neutral, there is no time to be neutral, you will have to be on one side of the issue that this work was done on Article 370, very good Agniveer did it brother, not very.  Good but now the people of Haryana have told you like this, on top of that Amit Shah ji has said that if any boy from Haryana comes from Agniveer, he will be given a job with Haryana Government or Central Government pension, now the number two leader has said.  Publicly said just yesterday when he had told Naib ji that he will become the Chief Minister, this is his statement, now my opinion has changed, it has changed again, now such a big leader is saying that pension will be acceptable, separate video on this.  I will make it, ok, then what to do now, now that it is done, it will be found, now the one who is dedicated will do it, the army will also be used, the meter will be reset, there was an uproar, we also felt that there was an uproar, but let's take advantage of that uproar.  If there was pressure somewhere or the other, did it benefit someone, was it wrong to raise the issue at that time? No, was n't it wrong, did so much issue be raised, if there was all this noise, it was beneficial, it was beneficial, now if some things happen like this, then what issue was raised? Look, we are living our lives like an angry uncle. We all have an uncle and we should not be happy. If we give him any problem, we can give him anything. If he has to remain angry, then we can't live.  Our Lives Like This We Have To Raise Issues Ask For What Ever We Want When We Get Something We Have To Move On Also We Can't Get That We Here We Ca n't Behave Like A Heartbroken Lover That It Was That Na Kisi Note P Some name of the girl was written in dash, she is unfaithful, what was the name, it became very viral, I don't want to take the name, darling, ask me, there was some name like this, but you were like, she is unfaithful.  So we should not write like this, BJP is unfaithful, Congress is like this, if a leader sees that something is wrong and makes corrections then he is a good leader, brother, so if you like the leader, you like him very much.  You are crazy and I am raising my voice and creating ruckus and if that leader listens to you and takes some action on what we are raising, then we are not your enemies but we are good citizens but your eyes were closed.  Infact that leader we  We should say thank you because we gave a feedback and they took the feedback like I say that my words are listened to at the highest level, I know in all the parties but I clearly see that BJP takes some action, Congress is like an elephant. BJP is as sharp as a chi, fox and leopard are like a leopard, Congress is just like an elephant, keep talking, it will move, it will move a little, then when it moves a little, it will keep moving, then say brother, no, no, no, if it does this a little.  Then it will take time to do this, there will be a lag, there is a knock, knock, knock, knock in BJP's house, so our MS citizen is not whether BJP wins or Congress wins, our M citizen should be that what we want is equal rights, law and order harmony in the country.  Love, opportunity, peace, increase in money, all these five or six things are needed by the country, stability is needed in every country, we should get this, BJP should give it, Congress should give it, someone should give it, someone should come to the state, we should not be more worried than this, no, this is not it.  Rule for 100 years, no, it is not necessary because if there is more rule, then arrogance will come. Whenever arrogance comes, we, our citizen journalist type, have to come and expose it. It can come from anyone at any time, from whomever it is.  Remove it, this is the message, what is going to happen in Maharashtra, you guys tell me, explain to the people of Maharashtra, what is happening, beyond that, I am also taking feedback from the people, Maharashtra elections are going to be very interesting, they have made Haryana elections so interesting.  If you make it interesting then brother, Maharashtra is going to be very interesting and it will affect us, it will affect us all of us, it is okay just because you do not live in Maharashtra, then do not think that the election of Maharashtra is not affecting us, it will affect us.  All of us so let's equally participate now run up to Maharashtra elections ok only a month is left there too and where what is happening in which direction is the wind blowing? What a very interesting fight is taking place in Maharashtra.

    "title": "India - China Relations Breakthrough ｜ Good News On Diplomatic Front  After Long Time [9eG95QM62AQ].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, good news is coming after a long time. As an Indian, I feel good because Modi ji has also been told like this in many months and it has gone like this and Jaishankar ji has also been like this, I am talking about myself too in general.  It is okay on social media, it is an advantage of an independent thinking person that when something like this happens, people like us can make videos, those who have already checked the side cannot make them, so what am I talking about? Looks like China  A little bit of headlines have been made about the border with India. If we can't believe it at all, then we will analyze this thing. You must have seen that in the Nijjar case, what happened between Canada and the US came and made such friendship. This is my friend and we are friends.  There are eyes and it seemed like Vishva Guru India and we were like feeling and I had made a video in it saying that man, all these are speaking, beyond this we do not have to say much like this, Lawrence Bishnoi Gang Canada, we are as an Indian.  We have to remain silent and mostly we have remained like this, it is a good thing that our opposition has also been there to some extent, this YouTube is not there and this is my complaint brother, our Modi ji is our Amit Shah ji, whatever is happening in our India, we will say it 150 times.  We should know that our Prime Minister, our respected Home Minister, should not remain silent when the matter is big, this is the sign of a mature individual, mature country and mature citizen, so now China is doing such a thing with China.  What happened and the photo that has come, Putin, Mr. Jinping and Modi ji, will now raise the antennas of the US. The US is not mine, it is historical. I always used to see that China is an old civilization and India is even older and both the civilizations are worth Rs. 150 crores. If the population of the world is 800 crores then 3rd is India and China means every fifth person is Indian or Chinese, it is okay.  Meaning, you do the math, I may be completely wrong, it is okay in the fracture, but if it is 300 crores, then it means that the fifth person is an Indian, the fifth person is so na ba fa, na ba fa, ba fa, it is almost ok, so if we come together, we will be able to fight.  What is our need? The truth is that we have to import and export. On top of that, our thought process level is the same. Indians' heart beats for their children as a civilization. Our heart beats for the Americans.  If not of, then they say Peter, my get out, take your student loan, get lost, Chinese heart also beats for the children, so we are at the basic level, if he is there, then we may not be so many friends, for what ever 150 crore region, there can be more.  But this enmity should be ended in between. Anyway, our Himalayas are so big, that means they cannot do it even if they want so much. China is doing it in the airfield, the plane does not fly there with bombs anyway.  Have you ever heard that China attacked India? I am not talking about 1962, it means 700 years ago, everyone used to come from here, from the other left side, some did not come from there, so we are like that.  There is no need to fight, so I think this thing that has happened is very good and America also needs to be taught a lesson, America has become a big lot, no matter how many dollar prints America and  America, there is a limit to everything, arrogance should not be tolerated anywhere, be it in Haryana's politics, Maharashtra's, India's, BJP's, Congress's, Beijing's or America's, because arrogance is something that is normal public.  And people do not tolerate any arrogance, so in our SA country it seemed as if efforts were being made not to rub it, efforts were being made to do so.  It is not so easy, India is a country of 140-150 crores, so I feel it is a good diplomatic victory, which we as Indians need to feel a little bit relaxed, but this is a request to fellow citizens, don't be macho, I come from a community in Haryana.  Who is a Macho? It is said that the original Macho community and other communities do not know anyone who is a Machh.  If someone comes and sets a system, it is a big problem, then look at it a lot, I praised Modi ji very well, Jaishankar ji's government, it's like eating a Golgappa, I liked the water, it was good, it was a lot of fun, now scold him. What is the biggest mess of Godi media? We will expose it so many times, now this has come, now it will come to its senses, then again you will provoke someone else, so we do the most stupid things in Pakistan, which is our neighbor.  Whatever happens to provoke them, let something happen to them, now their highest pollution in Lahore has reached 305, Gurgaon 's is running at 289, it is only 16 more, yours is the highest, Delhi 's stubble will still run, it will cross the limit but today.  Yours is that Pakistan is an emotional country, as if we are more emotional than us and the person who is a little poor, is even more emotional, so we should not do this. We achieved what we did with China. If we break even with Pakistan for some reason and Kashmir becomes a little peaceful, then a lot of prosperity can come because everywhere else there will be fire everywhere and it seems that you have seen Ukraine, Russia.  Well, this is what Israel has done, if Israel enters somewhere then America enters on its own, the Western world is happy, this is the time for Indians and for India. Finger on your lips, don't kiss this.  Don't go beyond Chaudhary, Modi ji showed this image once to win the election or I do n't know, megalo mania, call it some such trait or this is this, this is this, this is not right, this is more for the world, no one is such a Vishwa Guru. Will Tolerate Silently It's Better That You Be Actually More Strong Than What The World Perceives You Rather Than Being Vice Versa That You 're Actually Not That Strong And You  You are showing perception, then whenever something happened, such a situation was created that when it is known that how much strength is there and then it is not that much, then there is a tie fish and then the country is insulted, then I feel that it is a right thing.  There is a course correction, I want India's relations to be from Nepal to China to Bengali, that Vajpayee ji said a very good old thing - We cannot choose our neighbors, we can choose our friends.  You can and this is also for your personal life, he is your friend, he can be anywhere, but for the neighbor, you have come as a neighbor and the neighbor is very important. If you check at the personal level, if something happens at night, then the neighbor is there. 000 km away, 2000 km away, 500 km away, your son or daughter can't help, only your neighbor will help. If something goes wrong at night, maintain good relations with your neighbor.  To fulfill it properly, Diwali is coming, it is happening like other wise, it is not a matter of compulsion, it is like this, everyone should fulfill it, China's roar is also there, it is not that India's roar is there, that is why it is feeling a little, I really hope it is sustainable.  It should not be that this is being done just for show, China is also seeing what America is and as it happened with America, I always used to think earlier also that what is the gain we have from America. That we are from China because China is growing and America wanted to crack down on China and even today it wants to, so it used to do a little like this to India, now India is I don't know diplomacy, we can't be so intelligent that India. What is happening at the government level and what is the country getting and what is not getting, but now you see that we bought drones from the US, even then it did not calm down, even after giving so many billions of dollars, it is in vain.  You should be a little shy to speak in the Canadian team, friend, don't buy things worth so much money or have you become friends, now you have to ask, in my opinion it is easy to isolate America because it is the same America, where did you see the geographical location?  Yes, he is forcefully entering Bangladesh by pretending to be a Chaudhary. He needs some port somewhere below, somewhere there, then if Bangladesh realizes that its border is also surrounded by India, that is, from here.  Come on, if you draw the tala line from Kolkata, then you are thinking that Bangladesh and India had done it, so if all the relations are fine, then it is good. If the relations between India and China are fine, then automatically everything will be fine with Maya.  It will be fine because what choice does Nepal have? What choice does Nepal have, that is, if India, China, Mr. Jing Ping and Modi ji are eating and drinking, friendship is happening comfortably, suppose India and China are having friendship, then now Nepal.  What will it do? What choice does it have? What choice does Bangladesh have? What choice does Mayan Paar have? So if this thing is also formed as a new government, this thing should be woven a little more somehow and some dense building measures and  Let's do it right now, this is a good start and this good signal is the word towards America that it is okay, you will have elections now, we will see and it will be like this, you will see, now we will do independent train trade with the Middle East and oil from Russia too. Russia has all the resources that can be taken. Why can Russia show so much fire to the world? Because the population is 10,122 crores, it is sitting with all the resources. Next, it is such a big land mass. Its oil is its own energy requirement. People make the food they want as their own.  All the work is done by the left, there is not so much dependence that the population is only 150-200 crores, I don't know what to do, so Russia is doing its job well.  As it is, China and India will automatically become a cross center through BRICS, if you keep doing the world's intelligence, yes you keep doing all the intelligence, here we will openly make friends, although it is not so easy to say.  It is easy but in practice, America is America, brother, it is okay, go and see their defense budget, they will keep doing something else, that is okay, especially now they are like Pakistan, Pakistan can also make friends with America and Russia.  You can also do this if you have friendship with China, India should also be a little flexible, learn from Pakistanis, your younger brother is the elder, when he can be so flexible that he can make friendship with anyone, then we should also make friendship and this India and Pakistan should make friendship. What do they say about Pakistan Army? Will the value of Pakistan Army reduce? At some point of time you have to give up on the nation, give the nation, not give up on the  Nation means Pakistani Army, it is said that Pakistani Army is the only army which has got a nation to itself according to others, every nation has an army, every country has an army but the only army which has got a country is Pakistan, so there is a little  Relax a bit, friend, even the General of Pakistani Army has to see whether he can live comfortably after retiring, because for one thing, there is a restriction on the other wise.  The problem is that the relationship between India and Pakistan for the last 70 years is being woven only to make the Pakistan Army its own. Other wise, the relations can be fine. If citizen to citizen contact is done then it can be fine, but many times.  What happens is that when there are so many issues within our own country, then these things are done to divert Pakistan's work, that is why India India India India will do this, India has done this, India India will do this, India will also do this.  He does it like this, but now look, the time has come when the issue of studying the region from outside and that kind of thing comes up. On one issue, how big a thing did you take, where did you take it, that means India needs development and Pakistan also needs development.  We need development, that too is a running joke, ok so Indians should be smart, I have a request that brother, don't change sides so quickly when we change sides at the country level, do n't be open so quickly, apart from supporting your country, we are  no choice  No, we will do it fearlessly, we will do it to our leaders, when it comes to international local, then it is ours, if something happens in local, we will definitely say it is ok, that is our right in democracy, only then, that is the biggest achievement of India, otherwise this is Here in the Hunger Index, here in that Index, here in the Happiness Index, here and there, all that Tantalus thing was positive because we were seen as a social observer as a political Observer commentator, we also look forward or something, please come and tell us that we have picked up a little contract here, no one has anything to say bad, it seemed as if it used to be so, we used to say that now Maharashtra election is becoming very interesting. And it is going to be a lot of fun and I feel like making a video on Maharashtra elections and beyond that, it will be fun, there is a little bit of comedy, there is also a little bit of learning to be had, there is a little bit of relaxation, my aim is that  You should not consume these politics in a relaxed manner, happily, do not do it with tension, do not do it in a very open manner. Look, even as a country, we change it, so when something is happening to the party at the individual level, then do it because even the leaders change the party.  Let's say yes I know Rahul Gandhi ji will not change the party Modi ji will also not change but everyone else below him can change ok no Amit Shah will also not change but apart from him many people can change ok so we have this much  Don't want to remain open, I hope you are enjoying the channel. There are a lot of videos. Recently, two-three videos of mine have come. It is very good that you people have shown love. What should be done for the children of the middle class? Before that, a small world.  Do very good, such videos will also keep coming from time to time, there will be mix and match as it happens, there will be political and current affairs according to a balanced diet and there will also be a signaling and messaging to the society, so the channel will Subscribe and there is one more request. Give subscribers as you go. Everyone who is listening to me please add now, then you will get things to learn from your family, you will get things to relax because this smoke has to be consumed, where there is more of it.  There is chilli in it and your stomach will get upset, instead of consuming it from there, I will make you consume it in my spicy style, then your stomach will not get upset and it will also be fun, you have to consume it.  We Can't Run Away Current Events is a situation that is seen everywhere."

    "title": "Indian Armed Forces , Public and Bollywood ｜ Misconceptions Cleared [I9YCsLQn9vY].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, very interesting topic Indian Arm Forces Public and the Movies, you will get to learn a lot even if you are in the Arm Forces, you will get to learn even if there is someone in your family, even if you are a general public, you will get to learn and some issues.  I will raise more issues depending upon who you are, how did you like the content, did you understand this thing, did it increase some awareness, did you get some joy, if people got clarity in life then do tell because there is a lot of confusion on these three things. Indian Arm Forces, we know about all three things, Army, Air Force, Navy are about the public, so we know what is the public and movies, recently I had done a review in it, there were issues with the sound and sound, the fighter picture is coming, now it is about the movie. I am fine, but I will review that movie on the basis of what is shown in the trailer of that movie. There is a huge misconception among the general public about the armed forces and because of the armed forces. Of their rules and regulations, they all come, it is not their job that you create misconceptions about our name and we clear the misconceptions, that is one, so I am a neutral party, all this is someone in the armed forces, okay, so I am from here too.  I know, I know about this place, I also know the pain here, I also know about the emotions of the public, there is some stupidity in it, I would like to address that too, and a lot about the people of the movie.  You know, if I tell you, whenever we talk about the armed forces, one word comes, patriotism, yes, it should definitely come, patriotism should come, yes, I am also not refusing, but is it only patriotism that should come, P for patriotism, only patriotism should come and  Nothing should be known. P for professionalism. Can't come. You ca n't approach with a professional type. You, I will tell them what is the region. You see any picture, if it has the person with armed forces in it.  It has been the case for centuries that he has to die, he has to become a martyr and those emotions have to be suppressed to come out. Look at any picture. Now look at this one. In that we have to kill someone and then we have to add more emotions. The biggest problem with this is that a large section of people  The public does not want to put its children in these forces because there is a fear inside that my child will go, the girl will go, will be martyred, whereas it is not so, whereas it is not so, what does not happen, yes, but what is the percentage, it is a  Very very good, nice and really safe profession, relatively than others. Professionalism is very important but no one would like to tell or explain this thing because in movies, if a normal movie is made, a person comes and gets recruited in the army, after serving for 30-35 years, he goes away.  He went and earned a normal pension and is living a happy life and has worked well, then what is the excitement? Dying is necessary because there is emotion in dying.  Meaning, this country does not have a beautiful love, the Tricolor does not have that shroud every time, friend, it's a Moroz thing, the listener is liking it, but tell him that yes, you apply for your son, now look at Bhagat Singh, everyone likes him.  But the neighbor's child, you understand in what sense I am, oh, then everyone will become like this, then no one is sending, yes, no one is sending because you all have become extreme, then the system is going according to that, if you like this.  Let it be known that if you feel that the heart of the armed forces beats then only one thing should be asked in the public domain that why do these people in the armed forces pay their own insurance money? Yes, if he gets martyred.  So he is paying for his insurance himself and he has made his own because he does not get any life insurance because when he goes for his health insurance, there is a clause written in it that arm  They should not be in the forces, no one gives them insurance, they have to pay their own money, don't tell me again, no, yes, there are many insurance policies, these people cannot take and health insurance, what is the need for health insurance, they have to deal with each other.  Some medical system of ours works and hey, some man is going, he got bitten by a snake, now there is no hospital there for him, he is going on leave, going to the forest or travelling, he meets with an accident somewhere.  So why can't he have health insurance? He is now facing a little bit of operational risk, he is also a normal person and there is a fight going on all the time, so I am telling this as an example. I am telling you an example that if you look at the US, watch US movies, watch their recent Top Gun, then it is not happening like this in the US. When your strength comes, you shout. No, first of all you become calm, the one who is strong does not shout, the one who is coward is the one who is feeling scared, now people have seen this fighter picture as if the fighter is coming Jai Hind, the fighter is an artist, the fighter pilot is an artist like  An art is made in the same way a plane flies smoothly, precision is desired, calculation technology is a pleasure, long breath is because it comes from above through the air, it is time itself, time does not need motivation.  There is no fear of anyone, those who are sitting below, those who are going to be hit, they should be afraid, but they are coming on this motivation and the public also likes it, do you know what this thing is like this, you must have seen it, right?  Those gladiators used to come to Rome and they used to sit in the dome and enjoy fighting that this is the instinct to kill this one, this is not the instinct of the civilized society of 2024. Why does our general public not feel this from within anywhere?  Those who do not have any relatives in the army, those who do not have any children in the army, those who do not have any father in the army, that when I shout like this, don't fight, kill him, destroy this country, this Pakistani enemy, then when will it hit him? He will feel and that person is something to us, so if we need him, we will go, he is professional, but this animal instinct is coming out from inside, which is like saying, I am making a video to embarrass the public, like two [ __ ] fighting.  Are  Two goats fight or I told them like gladiators fight inside Rome and they all sit in public and operate with the feeling of kill and kill and have used it as a mask of patriotism. People have blown it, this is not patriotism. Yes, this is not patriotism.  You wake up and tear someone to shreds like this, they said we will do it like this, this is a cheap thing, this is a low level thinking and this is shown in the movies by suppressing it. It is shown in the picture, it is being shown in Fighter also, it is being shown in everything and even after beating it, it is such a sugarcane that the juice does not stop coming out of it for Bollywood because our public is so crazy that sometimes it never happens.  Do n't say that if I tell you one good movie about the Armed Forces, which one you have seen or not, or if I show you a movie based on the Air Force, then the winning picture was if you saw it. Shashi Kapoor's Shashi Kapoor's son was also in the role in it, Amrish Puri ji's role was very good, Raja Bundela ji was there, if you have n't seen it then you can't show the forces like that again, like now they have created a multiverse, this is iron.  Man and all these people, you know this is a cartoon and all this is like this and all this is happening, this vulgarity that you are doing, won't you show the armed forces the gadgets that are behind it?  We will use the ships that are there as props when you start because your VFX is so poor that the ships do this, those ships are real standing on the ground, so they look different because they are real. As soon as that area election starts, they say  Who is this poor country cousin type? They have ships worth Rs. 500 crores, they are also worth Rs. 1500 crores, they are very beautiful, they are good, but as soon as they say that they are not in your power, they will do the faxing.  If not, then postpone it. Look, what has the US made now? These movies are definitely propaganda. They talk about the country's soft power, it should be made, but if it is about the country, then it should be made by private limited people. The government does not sponsor it. China has just done one to fly.  A movie has been made, their method has also been tested, now they can get it right in that movie, they also know about emotions etc., money has been invested in The Way Those Guys Americans, Mac and Picture  Brother, money is not being invested here, that means Rs 1400 crores have been invested in the picture. Now you cannot compete with Rs 1400 crores in Rs 250 crores. We understand this, but according to purchasing par, Rs 250 crores is also equal to Rs 750 crores.  If it can be equal to 600 crores, then at least reach level 50. I agree, you cannot reach the full level. Nobody can beat the dedication and the  Everything about what Tom Cruise stands for. Okay, that's your real one. You know it's real. Have you heard any such stories here? If you look at Mike's, it's like 'G Forces'. Pilots are training. There is no such story here.  Here, just by looking at him, he doesn't look like a pilot, he does n't even look like a pilot by his actions, it's okay and a lot of efforts have been made to copy and the armed forces have been stereotyped a lot, they were shown in the old 60's movies and this  No, it stereotypes the Sardars, Bollywood does this to its South Indians, it always shows them in comedy, now according to me, if I see a photo of a Sardar of any of my Sardar brothers, then I should look weller in it. That these 10 persons stand for power, Shakti is okay, now these people have given the same thing in comedy, they have done the same thing with the armed forces, look at any movie of 1960, there must be an old man, a retired colonel. Frustrated, he will stand with a double barrel, a hero will come to tease his daughter and suddenly he is like that, they did something like Care Kutcher and showed it like this. In between, some movies came like this, everyone is dying in them, everyone is getting martyred, the people of my country are in tears.  Pour tears now, it's okay, people of the country, pour tears, it was a true need, we lost to China in 62, the atmosphere was like this, we had to tell, that's why we got slapped like that.  When we woke up, 65 was fine, 71 became better because what is the expense and water, so at one time India thought that when it got independence, the work would be done with the police, then why do we need armed forces, but the fact is that even today you Even in India 204, the people of our country are as far away from understanding the armed forces as they were 50 years ago. This is unfortunately understandable.  Cantonments Arm Forces are created physically away and the reason behind this is that they should not interact with the general public because these Arm Forces operate beyond caste, religion and all these things and if any calamity or something happens tomorrow, then they have nothing to do with each other.  If it should not happen then that logic is all understandable but here what is their challenge, what are the issues, what are the good things and what are the difficult things, someone is needed to give the understanding to the public because if you  If we glamorize it to everyone like this and add so much excitement, then there are times when a man is pensionable for 5 years, 10 years, 20 years, does a job for 25 years, 30 years and there is nothing to show, it is something like that.  You tell me that the armed forces are the sentinels of this country, so if there is no war with the neighbors then it means that the armed forces are very good because if you are weak then there will be a war.  It would have happened in 62 and even in 65, Pakistan had a misunderstanding, that is why there was no fight. Fight always happens only when I think that I will kill the next one, I will beat the next one, I will win, then no one goes with such a raised face, one gets insulted to get beaten. So whenever there is a conference, a big fight or something happens, the thing to be seen in it is that the next man also gets a chance and the next man also gets a chance when you look so vulnerable, if you become so strong.  If we have become America, then who is going to go and kill America in America, then we are telling that our armed forces are now progressing to a better situation than they were ever in the history. Our history is fine, so that within that.  Even now if I fall down, I will die, I will be saved, I am using this poverty type word, I am not talking about poverty type poor, I am saying that you are behaving like a country with poverty of Rs 1500 crores.  You are sitting with a plane worth Rs. 500 crores and still it is given like this by the extremist, it is not such a big thing, it is a fly, the extremists do like this, they are the real type of your generals, the real type are those of the armed forces, look at some of theirs.  That the way they treat them and the importance they give them They do n't give them that much importance They say it's okay Someone I saw is just an average life And we will get them if not  Today then tomorrow and then time there are three to six such practical things, but I am missing the butt of explaining and practical. Through this video, I want to appeal to the armed forces people to please come and educate the public that what you do. How much actually, how the work is done and how the operations are done and how the training is done. When your training is so strong that as soon as he sees a person being trained, he  A person doesn't even get into trouble by standing up, it means height is good, body is good, he is doing all this, take an example, you will not go and raise your head and will not mess with him, but all this awareness has to be done that our armed forces themselves have some issues which  The general public should also take up the issues. Now the general public takes up the issues of the farmers, then why can't it take up the issues of the jawans? I feel that the issues of the jawans are more important than those of the farmers because they are not directly related to you. Kisan Jai Jawan Jai.  Farmers and farmers are also equal, perhaps the farmers have become more pampered because the farmers vote bank is more, the soldiers are less, the soldiers are our own 11,12,14 lakhs and the farmers are more but we are the farmers only, or we are the soldiers only, what have we done to the farmers too?  It has been shown that it is okay that a young man is committing suicide and the youth is becoming a martyr. This means that brother, don't become these two, the message being sent subconsciously is that farmers are also poverty and suicide is farmer, meaning you.  You can't grow flowers, you can't grow vegetables, you don't know the meaning, you ca n't earn much money in different mushroom farming, so don't do this and brother, this is an act of martyrdom, if you want to get respect then it is the common public arm of the whole country.  They become happy by giving such respect to the forces people. But in practice, when a soldier catches a train from Kashmir at Jammu station and he does not know it, there is a mistake in his reservation because he had a reservation but it has gone back and forth. At the last moment and he was not found again, he was sitting in front of the bathroom and going late, so till date in my knowledge and observation, I have not found him looking at the seat that brother, he is young so you come and sit, I will sleep at night.  But you can sit with me till Ambala or you can get a set seat in Delhi. That brother doesn't know where to go down. Practically no one will do anything. Everyone will do it, that is, even within the monetization.  There is a lot to take an exam anywhere, so two people were saying like this, friend, go ahead, go behind, friend, what is this, do you have to stand in the queue, then come from behind, uncle, don't you feel ashamed?  I am not able to stand in the queue here and do you know that there are soldiers standing in Siya Chan and he says, Uncle, I am the same soldier, I have come on leave, relax, relax, that soldier can also come and stand in the queue, so tell me a joke type thing. This is what is happening, I do n't know what work they keep doing by holding the tail of patriotism and army and their direct ones are not understanding anything, not understanding the sorrow, not understanding the pain, not understanding the challenge, till date no one has understood that a martyr has become a martyr.  It's done, everyone has clicked the photo, okay media, go and put it in everyone's mouth, your husband has been martyred, how are you feeling, your father has been martyred, your son has been born, how are you feeling and he is seeing this.  I mean you tell me how you will feel and I mean he.  One day or two days he came, a minister came or an MLA came, these days they also earn a lot, a DC VC came to the state and put up a photo, put up a street in his name and then everyone forgot about him.  What is happening to the family and what is happening to the children? What is their life story going on? Then nothing. Once they say it, I am using the word 'unfortunately', there is no similar function like a marriage.  It 's okay, everyone has come, after that no one asks anything, Dhula Dhun lives his life, he is the same as the martyr, he came and asked, yes, it's done, it's done, after that, don't ask anything to anyone, what is the biggest problem in that too, is our 28  There are 30 states, from Jammu and Kashmir to Kanyakumari and even here, everyone has different rules and regulations. If there is a martyr in Haryana, he will get so much money. If he is in UP, there will be so much money. Look, human life has no value.  It is priceless and a soldier's life is even higher than that because he is not sacrificing for himself, he is sacrificing for the country, so it can never be weighed with money, this is a fact, but if there is despair, then how can he be a martyr of Haryana? B. Lesser and more than that in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Kerala, depending on their vote bank politics, where they go more, they give a little more, where they go less, they give less, now they give less.  If we go less then  And the less you go, you understand, then no one will go, then a stage will come when no one will go, who will come from the armed forces or someone will tell that the respect of the platoon along with the country, those of the regiment and the people you work are the biggest driving force.  Force When You Walk Into a Flying Bullets in Your Face That system was created many times What's now So we talked about what's now So it's like you're doing this, doing that now We are moving towards professionalism because now we do not have that much martyr system which is Agniveer system. Earlier what was the system was that regiments were based on the caste and region and after all, what was its region, its region was this, I am telling you historically.  It is important to come and explain to them all these things that earlier there were brothers, that people from the same village, from the same area, from the same place used to go and a regiment was made of them, a platoon was made.  Someone used to say Jat Regiment, Punjab Regiment, Mahar Regiment, Kumaon Regiment, Sikh Regiment, Sikhlai Regiment, many of them have been formed by doing like this, so his reason was that the food will be the same among themselves, it is practical, isn't it, if people are of the same type, then the food and drink will be the same.  The language will be the same, okay, after that there was one more region which was very big which was probably understood but was not told that if any one person will show cards in the face of enemy. Even if you are a human being, it will be reported in his village that your son was saved by his father-in-law, because the rest of the people also belong to him, now he is a boy from Rohtak Jind, so the people of Rohtak Jind are already there, they are not the same, he has not come from there.  Yours is not from Orissa because he will not go and tell because when he takes the body or something or someone else gets martyred in his affair, he used to have a fear that my name and my family will be defamed.  Well, that person there, these things are very psychological things, now people only talk about Mother India, it is there, but apart from that, what emotions go there, what emotions go there, you know that a person does not stop for an abstract thing.  If I get hit, I will die, that is what people have towards each other, but the same thing does not work in the Air Force because in the Air Force you do not go like a crowd, there is technical work there, there is a different attitude.  He is different and a human being is different, the one who sits in a plane worth Rs. 500 crores, his thought process is different, this thought process, this thought process is different, they put so much brain into showing them different and explaining how the software current is the same, the current of patriotism is the same, it operates on the same.  We are doing it, but brother, the operating system is different, the emotions that come out are different, the system is different, but who can go into such depth, but quickly take off your shirt, show me, show me such an attitude.  You just have to cut the scene, are n't you? Brother Tom Cruise, you are not Tom Cruise. The one who dies in his picture was his friend. He died of cancer. He died in such a way that he does not eat bread. We also have the courage to be martyred.  Unfortunately people want to eat bread by all means and this is unfortunately I cannot die for the country but ultimately you have to kill the enemy for the country to save the  Country You Can't Keep Dying All The Time And That Dying Dying Dying Dying Dying Dying Meaning You It's Something Like The Way It's A Portrait That If Someone Kills Four Men Of The Enemy, Then A Better Cry Will Come Out From Him When He Gets Martyred, That's That  It is better that you understand that this is very layered, I am not saying here that we have to do a lot for the martyrs but we focus only here, with that focus many mothers and many others  Fathers get scared of sending their children, this is what I am trying to tell and the point of saying is that, as long as you have this clarity and this strength, like I tell you, now whether you like it or feel bad, but I  I am telling you one more secret. The Chinese Army is relatively afraid of the Indian Army. I am telling you relatively. I am afraid and there is fear in the country. I will tell you what is the reason for it. A person has 10 children, five children, two children, all are equal.  Everyone likes it well, no one can say that one is good, the other is good, if one goes, my work will be fine, and if I have two, I have five, five, I have 10, one is gone, nine, it is someone like this.  It is not said but the fact of life is that all the soldiers of Chinese Army are single children because they are born in single child policy, there is no second one, neither sister nor brother, still work is normal in Indian Army Forces, there must be single children too. There will be some single male children also, I agree but then there will also be sisters and this will also be a matter of another secret, why am I telling this now because this is also understanding what I am saying, how much can you do patriotism but it is practical.  We have to come in life also, here our people will still send us back there, we are more afraid in Galwan, we were martyred, we did not hide them, we had to hide them so that the public does not get scared, we are still martyred, it feels bad but the fear is that  It doesn't go to the level but when you do that thing too much, then keep your hand on your heart. When about that thing, I have to tell you in a simple way that if you do n't want to hide it, then don't go and teach him glory, it's like if you  The vehicle should be detected and daily reporting should be done. An accident happened here today. It happened here today. It happened here today. It happened here today. You will never go out. Only you will not drive. You and I are not talking about mass reporting as much as they are happening. If India  Every year there are 2 lakh accidents on the road, but if you start showing this data in the main stream media in such a way that you start eating too much of it, then somehow suddenly people will say that it is very dangerous to go on the road whereas you  Will miss out on a beautiful life Arm forces are one of the best profession in this world and have a very good life even the way it is shown in general media and the perception in the movies and the general public about them  It seems like this, my friend, this is how the enemy is afraid of the armed forces and the borders are protected by the forces. These are professional people. There is no such thing that has to happen. Brother, it can happen to anyone on the road, it can also happen to an electrician, it can also happen to sewerage.  It can also happen to a worker, whatever is happening on duty, there is risk everywhere, but making everything in the name of that risk is not right. You should tell what to make and not how much.  Why is the most basic training in training? Because there is a saying that the more you sweat during training, the less you will bleed in war. To save blood in war, the bigger the training, the better the training. Some movies should be made on that thing too. My  According to this, one movie that I remember very well is a good movie in which all this was shown, training was shown, how he is becoming what he wants, how he is becoming Lo Loha, how he is becoming a winner, it is very much in the picture.  It has been shown very beautifully, so this is what every time you get whenever you are watching this video on youtube1 I have made bank people, what issues remain, okay, we have to put things realistically, we have to do it, that is, one of the latest movies which are in the recent times.  Same time Naksha movie came, we need directors and story tellers like Meghna Gulzar, we need authentic authentic research and Vicky Kaushal's acting was great, we will find actors like Vicky Kaushal in acting.  Tell me, we have that actor, if you tell him you want a match, then the match guy is taking off his shirt and is showing all this like this is fine and you will bring the acting person as if he is showing his to Vicky. His body is also good, but he has shown his acting like that, so whatever script you give, tell the story, they will be found, but you have to arouse patriotism in the same movie, you also have to do the tilt and tit in English.  The word is probably the same or is it something else, the pronunciation may be the color, I am okay, you have to do something like this, you have to show this also, you have to show the Pathan type also, you have to show the bikini also, you have to show emotions in the whole movie, you are speaking like this.  If I make a buffet, it will become a hit. Someone will like it, someone will like it, you will give a taste to the mouth, it is something like that, they put all this on the buffet, there are also noodles included here. There are pasta too and there are curd vadas too and how will you eat this, you are not like this, you will have to add consistency, you have to make this movie, you have to make this imaginary type, you have to make Pathan type, young type, jump into it, then you go.  Suppose you are covering a real topic, like recently I am talking about fighter only because you are covering a real event and behind that you are playing out your fantasy.  Yes, he is jumping on the plane like this, who is punching the fighter pilot, the government has not taken a fighter pilot to kill him, brother, it takes 10,12,14 crores to make one, it is okay, it takes eight, seven, eight years. By the time he is really fully matured and you are making him work, enter so that if he falls and his jaw gets broken, then medically he will not be able to board the plane again. Well beyond that you have spent Rs. 12-14 crores.  Please don't force him to do this work brother, but who will tell these bad guys and he is public, he doesn't even want to listen or understand, yes it was fun for him, he was flying the plane, before that his shirt was off, then this pushup.  I was planting here again, this is better than love for the country, love for the country is not better, oh my, goose bumps have become goose bombs, these goose bombs are of no use, the country is not protected from goose bombs, oh I saw.  Goose bomb in someone else's name, he has done something, hey, you also do something like this, don't do it in someone else's name, don't make it happen, brother, we will do it like this, brother, we will also serve you.  It's okay, you die, you go, you become a martyr, do something, we are with you, we will tear apart, we will do it, if it means propose a war, let's talk about technology, oh technology, CCTV cameras have been installed in your house, it's okay, an uncle is coming.  And  He is entering, you are looking at him, then what will you do, you have taken his photo, then to physically stop him, you will need a man's child or there will have to be some technology so that firing will start automatically, you require some buddy, some ship.  The enemy is coming, it's okay, you have installed technology in your country, you have radar fed, you have come to know that to stop it physically, something is needed, either a ship should go and destroy it or hit it with a missile from below or just give it commentary.  You will keep entering now it is 50 kilometers, by doing this like this means you will do it like this, just like you were laughing in that movie too, we are entering Pok, now we are doing this, that means for Taj Mahal, like they don't do aerials, do that.  This is Yamuna, this is Taj Mahal, look left, look right, it is like this, what is the meaning of what you are doing to tell the public what you are doing? Top  If they are maintaining silence and not talking to each other, then the one below is giving commentary to his boss who is in public, the boss standing behind him, the senior army officer, the boy or the girl, whoever is sitting. They have a scope, what they see from the radar is telling, so the public is getting to know that yes, they have entered this diamond formation, which formation was their this is this is this is entering okay they are pulling up you there.  You are sitting and getting her to do it, that lady Tejas was made in the picture of Kangana Ranaut, she was that bay, see, to tell them to show the women, it means they are trying to show something that our girls do well, so they should do this, how much overdo.  And it gets unpacked meaning that Kangana Ranaut is running the show in the Air Force. I know one more thing that these armed forces people do not watch this picture before they think that I am  There is also a request to the armed forces people that just because you are not being painted in a bad light, that means you should not put any objection on the movies because many times your name has been defamed which is not practical, it gives a wrong message to the youth.  And then those people will come to you, after seeing the picture, they will say, man, this is like this, nothing is happening to us, at some point of time, everything needs to come. Brother, it is not like this that out and tell is shown here that only one person is running it, that is, a private limited company is being run, only one person is running it. It is okay by putting them in one line that this is all an imagination and  Or is it based on him or is it not based on him, he will have to tell a little more because he cannot even read you that quickly, he is flashed like this for a second, it is nothing if anyone reads such a mutual fund subject mark, at least he  he is saying something  Listen, even that is not being said here, we will show something like this and then if we do it like this then I hope the Indian public will be a little aware and will ask questions. I have seen a lot of forums where aviation is enthusiastic or forces are enthusiastic and brother, what are you talking about?  Let's do something and then we will have to say why we don't have the public to go and become so aware that they should not say that we can take this or do it with the armed forces. Well, talk about Mother India. We are proud of you, we have a lot of respect for you, that's the end of the matter, why don't you say, what is this thing, man, did it come to them, does that person have it, why doesn't ours have it?  Brother, why doesn't our country have a system? Why doesn't the public speak? Why would the public speak? Politicians listen to the public. People from the armed forces will also come and say, 'Give us, give us.'  The public is so aware that they are saying that if this is to be taken, then brothers and sisters, the public wants this to be taken for you, then we you, then there is no problem, what is there here, take some kind of thing, we will remove the scam from it, okay.  Public is afraid of that because every person is afraid of it because there is scam in everything. I am not saying that it is okay but manufacture it yourself, why are you not able to do it? Why are you not able to do it? If the public becomes aware, then your DRDO will do well.  Whatever you have made will work, how good is it, where is it, why doesn't it work in everything? Say, our arm forces are good, ours, these are all good, these are good, hey, the whole system is there, isn't that person who is standing there a weapon? Agreed, he is good on the system, so he has no right to open his mouth that he is not good, he has put in everything, but the frills he has, you can know about them, what is that thing, is it good? What is sustainable and what is better than that?  It has come in the market, why don't we have it, when will it come to us, then why doesn't the country open its mouth, brother, your budget is being spent, so much of tax payer's money is being spent, so ask questions, don't tell us, now all the operational things cannot be told at the level. Who all are there but there are a lot of them available in the public domain because we make all the weapon systems ourselves. Now should I buy a TV from Korea and hide it so that I will not tell? Hey Samsung-ro, I want to make you aware through this medium.  I am staying If the athletes who are also the intellectual class and the two-three level people who start talking about what I am talking about, start understanding it, it will make a lot of difference. Every time you raise your voice, the first thing which should strike in your mind is  This is professionalism, this is a disciplined person, this is professional, patriotism is the default setting, patriotism alone does not work, now I have done what is happening in his life, what is happening in his life?  What are the issues, how is he living his life, what are his emotions, what are his challenges, how does he feel, ask him to talk to him once, it is completely fine, instead of doing only one thing, as soon as he came, we salute him, we salute him like this, it will not work, even beyond that.  We will have to go, this is called Rhetoric Rhetoric Cliché, so the reaction is all cliche that yes, it is like this, it is like this, learn something from other countries, learn from America how they also respect their arms.  Forces they know, America is America, America can go anywhere and kill like this, this is okay in the world, they know that when America kills, it is America 's armed forces, if it is not public then it has a lot of value to the public, something useless in America  If their soldier gets martyred, if something happens, the public gets worried about how it happened, tell me what was it worth, where was it, how was it, they ask questions and there is pressure on everyone that when you deploy all that.  Now I will not do much, a little bit will go into that zone which cannot be discussed publicly these days, Age of Now is fine but you guys understand what I am saying, please spread it around and do write in the comment section. This video may be big for you, but there is a need for awareness of reasoning, logic of conversation of this kind of discourse. Now if I tell people just by raising this issue of Vande Mataram which is going on in its entirety.  Do n't actually sing two lines and tell me what is its meaning, I don't know but brother, if you like something, then ask about the thing that you like, what is its meaning, okay, if he is not happy with that then only  This emotion will no longer work. This is the message. Some substance should be visible in movies too. There should be accountability in public discourse too. Everything is fine. Thank you very much."

    "title": "Indian Economy ： An Unheard Reference Point And Perspective Given [F1lT-o6zTHE].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, we will talk about the Indian economy which is not a heard or not discussed thing normally because what is the Indian economy, many people who live with the government are talking about 1 trillion, when will 1 trillion become 10, when will it become 20, so look at the numbers. Put in perspective, there are big numbers, sometimes this perspective has not been put in. There are three things which we Indians use a lot in our life, especially the middle class, it is noisy.  Does it use shot or do you know all three of them? Firstly, you are watching this video, you must be watching me from YouTube4 and you work or have studied in school. You are also middle class and lower middle class. Do you know that the third company is Microsoft, of which we have basic knowledge.  Everyone uses software. We know these three things. Brothers and sisters, I am talking only about the company. It is a US company. If you add the market cap of these three companies, then it is two and a half times the GDP of India. How many employees are they sitting with?  Look, the employees of these three will be less than the two sectors of your Dwarka. Grab the sectors of some of them. Sector 7 has to be caught. 19 have to be caught. You can catch all the world over employees of these three. Otherwise, what are you trying to say, friend, by persuasion.  I wish that all of you become happy with what is the GDP per capita. We are still at number 140 out of 142. No one is rich, no one is more great to be happy.  It's not a matter, yes, then who is saying to be sad or unhappy but I am unnecessarily refusing to march, four will become nine, five will become five. How much is your share in this? Brothers and sisters, if you understand this thing, please propose.  We are 10 people, we catch 10 random Indians, none of them earn Rs. 1,000,000 per month and one of our brother earns Rs. 91,000, so if we add, what will be the total income?  If we divide one lakh by 10 then it comes but how much is the capita 00, how much is it a miss leading, to estimate everyone above 10000 from one person's 91 whereas the truth is that only 000 are sitting there. Brothers and sisters, it is more important to say the median income and other things. In India, how many people earn less than Rs. 000 per month in actual? Don't talk about average. Average is very dangerous. I will tell you how it happens in this matter.  People can drown, can also drown. Yes, tell someone that friend, this is not a rivulet or a stream or whatever it is called, it is some fast moving water source, okay, the river becomes big, I tell him that it is small.  And it is so long and its average depth is 3 feet. After getting this information, you went to cross it. You did not know swimming and you drowned because from where you were crossing it was 7 feet.  The person told me the average was 3 feet  If the average is 3 feet, then at some places it may be one and a half feet, at some places it may be two, at some places it may be two and a half, or even three, and a half and a half, and in a very small place, perhaps it may be 7 feet or even 8 feet. You understand the average of the drowned man. So, these averages and statistics are used a lot, the government has stopped releasing the GST figures, do the math and check, you are not telling now, you are saying that we should have told earlier, we should have said something like this in a press conference. Brother, why brother, this is amazing, we will neither do census nor do population, we will not do anything, we will not tell anything, this means that it is fine, China does not disclose its data, it must be calculated somewhere and China too. We have gone through that too, what if GST means, isn't it like this? Too much is being collected. We don't want to show it to the public that it is too much. Two times the effort, three times the effort, more effort than the British.  It has not happened that too much has been taken from the poor, because sometimes what happens is that even on GST collection, the government cannot relax much, why the public does not know when the public gets angry, what is the reason, any data is disappearing. What is wrong with unemployment in this country, nothing is found out, you swallow it, nothing is found out, neither look bad nor tell bad, in 10 years everything was the same as before, whatever was done by the government, was it good?  It was bad as it was, the public gave them that many marks, okay, but brother, tell me all that, their papers were checked, yes, what have you done, how many marks are there, there is no question of checking here, brother, no one said anything.  Well, if you can say so, nowadays the devotees are decreasing, the eyes are opening slowly and very quickly. Brothers and sisters, it is not like that in our videos, we are just telling observational things. Whatever I have told is observational, it is not that Just no one is talking, I told you if you add three American companies, their GDP is two and a half times more than ours, two of their companies are two and a half times more than ours and one company is almost sitting on our GDP, googleapis.com, it will come out to be 3.67, whatever.  Niklega L Market Cap Microsoft Market Cap Kude jaa raha hai, aa hum paach tra tere tere re kneate hain tu kitne le ke baata hai No, when it increases, everyone's will increase, how much is yours increasing.  If India's GDP growth is happening at 6-7, although you know the matter of statistics and inflation is 6-7 and nominal GDP growth is happening at 14, then are your brothers and sisters network growing close to 14? Check or you are not lagging behind somewhere because the one with lower base will take it. It is easier for the one whose net worth is Rs 1 lakh to get Rs 2 lakh, but what about the one who is sitting on Rs 1 crore?  The one who is sitting on Rs. 60 lakhs has got Rs. 2 crores. What is happening to you, the middle class? You tell me, don't let the crazy people roam around in a stranger's marriage, what is this through videos, am I not in the opposition team, am I in the government?  I want to stop the opposition by doing devotion, no one does that, but if you are going in that direction then do not worship them too. Tell the opposition to check this and whoever tells the ruling party, tell this.  Tell me, check this. Tell me, check this. Stop doing devotion and chair leading. Now the budget is coming. Earlier also I have put a video of mine on the budget. Now there is time in the budget. Many people wrote that I am middle class in that budget video. You can understand it, okay, you are so confident that the middle class will not get anything, then why do you keep jumping, why do you keep jumping, when you are not getting anything, why don't you show displeasure or  displeasure  If you do n't know how to show, then in every middle class home the wife is angry, the parents are angry, the children are angry and if the boss of the husband who earns money is angry, then it is not that the phenomenon of being angry plays in the middle class.  Not playing out, playing out but equality, they do n't know how to show their displeasure, the only way to show displeasure is through social media feedback comment section and if the opposition has bought so many people, if so many people are speaking then  Too  Then the ruling party has to see what is happening, after all the accounts are frozen, from where are they getting the money to buy the people and after the arrival of electoral bonds, after so many, because look at the electoral bonds that BJP has taken so many.  It is being shown that BJP needs support the most in India. There is no money for Agniveer, they will spend money on advertisements. The accounts of other political parties have been frozen, yet they got 200 40 seats. Everyone protested against Milu, she came with so much money, you came with so much money, so it remains to be seen, brother, we have to talk about money, who needs what, what are you able to do, then BJP, which has so much money in the electoral bank,  If it has come, then why is the IT cell not able to perform? Now you have to see carefully why you are not able to buy. People are trolling people in the comment section like it used to be earlier because your model is traveling due to WhatsApp2 syndrome. I am here  When I say Guruji, then I am Guruji Tattva, while leaving, I will tell them also, I will also leave by telling the BJP people, if you want to avoid it, but this will also create an uproar, Broadcasting Bill is the only way, you will have to stop the voice of YouTube, BJP people. Otherwise, it will be very difficult, you will tell me, what kind of person are you with a self-destructive streak, this is what Guruji says, you do the same for both of them and you do this because if it doesn't happen now, then  The matter is messed up or the game has been shaken, people go, what does this mean? Someone says that we have 40 kg of rice in our house, it has become 500 kg, so many kg, oh brother, what are our expenses, is rice included in the fees, water system is working.  As for fees, you will have to pay in notes, clothes will come with notes, you will get electricity, you will get all the brooms, mops and utensils, the rest of the expenses are limited to one aspect, what is the meaning of 4 trillion dollars, do you have any meaning for Agniveer?  There is no money, okay, okay, for defense, are you looking at, what are the accounts, it is so spread in the unpolluted country, okay, inflation is rampant, tell me one thing, I want to ask, many times people say this to the public.  Or is there no negativity, something good must be happening, look, even a stopped clock keeps the correct time twice a day, it does not mean that you should start clapping it, something good must be happening, as if something bad happens, something good happens.  butt question  This is whether it is doing well because of the government. The question is this question is the performance of the government has to be checked. If out of these 10, eight things are not going well and two are going well then the performance is bad. We want us.  Whichever party is in power should fix things up to 6-7-8 out of 10 because it was you who made those promises, not like this, but now 30 days have passed. Government formation is fine, no road map is visible, it was said that there is a teaser and the main course is about to come, where is that main course and how much is it to check, tell me what is the great happening.  What were those plans of CAV? What does it mean? What difference is it making to our livelihood? Triple talaq was done to the public and they were very happy. Triple talaq, it means it will be someone else's eye. Okay, you are happy, it's great, be happy.  Yes, it is a good thing, I am not refusing, come to UCC, hey brother, money is coming in your pocket but Article 370B is there, so yes, it is a good thing, Adani ji has bought land there, Lithium has arrived, now Adani's electrical vehicles will come.  The couplets will probably be read, maybe it is a good thing, I am not saying it sarcastically, it is genuine, it is good that it has been removed, where am I saying that I am refusing, but what happened in your life by removing it, this is the new judicial literature that has come.  The good thing is that IPC is now applicable in Kashmir also. Yes very nice, it is very good. However, you should also read the section 172 in it. You should also read the sector 16, section 69. What is it about? Videos beyond that.  We will come, okay, it is a good thing, so who is refusing, it is a good thing and it would have been better if there was a discussion, just like that, all the MPs were passed by suspending them in the Parliament, but it was not.  Discuss a right thing now. The question is not that what has happened has not been done, but the question is that our life is not getting affected right now. It is like something Papa ji is saying that she roamed there after seeing it.  Will go on a tour, then it will be like this in future, see like this, hey, don't do it, tell me something right now, if people use that in many videos, that of Arvind Kejriwal ji, then do it for one second, you must have heard that, now I am my editor.  This is not done by editor but they create many good content like this in everything, people use it like this, then why is nothing happening here, why is the budget not being spent, the middle class is watching very well.  I will also analyze it very well because the numbers will be given, this was done for the poor to increase the rural income, this was done, hey, in this country, apart from the poor, there are some other people who are taking this country forward.  and paying taxes See something about them too and understand because they will all run away from the country and then there will be poverty and then there will be no tax to help the poor. Also, it is okay and these poor people are in the middle. Look, my audience is clearly defined for me.  There is support for the poor, it is okay and there is a lot of love, we all are Indians, we are brothers and sisters, but brothers can talk about one person, otherwise the whole content goes up and down, okay, so brother, poor, poor, now. Middle class also shows displeasure. You people don't know how to show displeasure. People only get angry with you. Those who get displeasure after seeing my content, they get angry at me too. When you write, trolls come at me once.  It's okay if you get fired, but you can fire it on someone else, do n't you have the courage or have you used magic, only one of two things can happen, bye because the ground situation is bad, we are only telling the ground situation, just check the GDP per capita.  Look, how much are you now and what were you? Check how many years have you been there and what have you been there. And let us not even talk about the happiness index. If we do n't like the index then they say that this is wrong, this is wrong, this is that, and so on.  If it suits you, sometimes you jump on the Ease of Doing Business, we are wow, wow, and then if you don't jump, if you are stuck, then yours has become spoiled. You people can't do it selectively like this, so there is a way of becoming a slogan, that's a little.  like you somewhere else too  Show your displeasure. All the displeasure has come after voting. Now the votes are visible, it has not been erased yet. Okay, so after voting, I am not saying that there may be a little change. I voted for 5 years but now.  Check, whoever voted for you, check even more that he voted for you, perform, brother, player, or will you cheer leading for him, I have selected him, no one will say anything to him, he is my brother, he is like this.  Do you want to live with the feeling or will you say that yes sir, government, please answer, what answer do you want to give, what will you say, tell me, what do you people say, these are the figures in your face, they are real, they are false, they can be checked by doing the analysis. What is the market cap, no need to jump so much, we Indians have a very long journey, we still have to feed 80 crore people, they do not provide carbohydrates, they do not even provide proteins, they do not provide pulses, we are fine, we are giving only rice and this is what we are giving. carbohydrates are just  Okay, and they are giving 80 crores to the people and are celebrating that too, I have given 80 crores, I don't have to pay for putting my photo, the farmer grew it, the tax payer gave the money, with that money the government bought this wheat which the farmer worked hard for.  He grew it, took it and distributed it among the poor people, he has put only his photo, there is nothing else and if you give it without the photo, then maybe the cost of that bag gets reduced, because even with the photo, there must be some cost on the bag, isn't it?  bag by the way  Just give it as it is made and put a photo on it and write something on it, there must be some difference in the cost, so this is it and add Rs 22000 crore for that and then even if you go to vote, sing the same thing next time.  They will also say like this, gave it to 80 crores, gave it to 100 crores, okay then please, you will not get such good marks, this is a very normal thing, please share, like and if you get pinching pain in these things, then those who  If someone writes pain, instead of trolling me, he is angry about me, what is his anger about me, he never says anything to the messenger, many people get angry, like it happens many times, oh king, he has become a prince, so he should take it out like this and give something.  Okay, why are you killing the messenger, I mean, some news should be given by mistake that he had gone there to fight, now that has happened, now people kill some messenger, this is the problem, I am just a messenger only. No messenger of no, no big messenger, no small messenger, who is watching and reading that brother, GST has stopped, forget to give the number, why are you doing this, there is no reasoning, we will not tell you the GST number, GST is collected from us.  And how much is collected from which state, how was it done and to tell it to everyone so that there is competition and everyone knows how much Haryana is giving, how much UP is giving, Noida vs Gurgaon, do anything, it is okay Mumbai vs.  Do Delhi or whatever Maharashtra vs Tamil, don't tell me, don't tell me, how much is happening, it is important for the states also because when GST is collected, it also goes to the state, is n't it right? How much is IGST and SGST? How much is CGST, what is the problem in telling openly, but why would we ask questions because most of the audience pay GST when they buy goods but some of them are vouchers, we don't know and we are What should we do? What should we ask? What do we know? The public has to be aware that is the message. It should be known. What is happening? What are you doing? Otherwise, what is there again after a year, did that, did this, did that there, did that now.  I am not even getting to listen to those stories, I am just saying tell a few statements, do a few statements, do some good work but even that is not something, if you don't see anything happening then what do you people have to do in the comment section.  pour thanks  you very much"

    "title": "Indians Have Not Taken Birth To Achieve This [cAmWednUq3w].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today's topic is very interesting, you all must have seen that it will liberate you from within and you have to spread awareness about this thing and write in the comment section that Indians have not taken birth for doing this, what is this, that is the answer is China.  Do n't know from where the narrative is created. Don't know what to do. Have to program anything. Take the name of China. To push China back.  If so, then we are not born like this, this is the typical approach that there is a similar middle class that you have to beat your neighbour's child, you have to compete with your uncle, you have to compete with your brother-in-law, our birth is very reasonable.  Yes, there is some China, there is someone whom we have to lag behind, then in what we have to lag behind, in the economy and in other things, China has again wavered in its rich doing.  Something is right, yes, we are also the population like this, they are happy, do you really want to stay in China, do you really want India to become China, yes, we will do it for 60 years, we will do it for 70 years, now I am going to demotivate them to lower their moral.  I am not doing it, no no, child, you can never be a topper and I am just putting it into perspective, the amount of China's GDP grew in the last year. India's total is that much, okay, so it is not necessary that you are enjoying in one of your cars, life is a journey, you have a car, you drive it well, if you drive it, you will reach somewhere but you are on the road.  But if someone sees another vehicle and thinks of reversing it, then the stress is completely built up. Does our India's philosophy regarding wealth and life match that of Communist China? We have had sustainability here for many lives.  I have faith in myself, there is no space left, so what is happening in such a hurry, no, I will be happy to vote for him. Is this just a reason to divert attention from our actual issues which impact our lives by taking the name of China?  Talk about anything, ask anyone, do anything, don't back China, is that Narayan Murthy ji said now, I had made a 70-hour long video, you people have appreciated it a lot, it was very well made and very good arguments were given. One more thing remains for us, if India wants to beat China, what is this brother, why can't you beat China in Olympics, why do you have to count it in GDP, you bring medals in other things, count the medals, then gold comes to New Zealand which is visible in Dwarka.  New Zealand is sitting with the population of Garh and Rohini, it is 70 lakhs, it is okay, it comes with seven Gods, why are you making China lag behind, do it for New Zealand, these are the figures, right?  And this has to be done backwards and all this is a lot of misconceptions, a lot of pain has to be given in life, a common man has to tell you that whatever is your life, which is your father's life, make your life better, now on this.  I will try to tell you some things that we can do that and we have to do it out of the box. Now you tell us this idea that with this we will become better. Now China is lagging behind, it is not there, beyond that we have nothing to do with it. how many years  Whether you are a city, Delhi city or Rohtak, take Fatehabad, take Kota, take any district of India, we have around 750 districts, so why can't we do things within 50-100 kilometers of them, we can create businesses. Why are we selling so much from one place to another? There is a lot of focus on export as well. We have so much opportunity here. People from foreign countries want to set up business here and want to invest.  We want that India is an opportunity and we do n't know, we want to go somewhere outside, the local Kanjampatti is our focus, why should something be made in a small place like Rajasthan or Fatehabad or Bihar and then it goes food which is environment. It is understandable because it grows there, but if it is a suit, boot, tie, glasses, then it can be made anywhere, then this work can be done anywhere, wood work can be done anywhere.  If the work of clothes can be done somewhere then why is this thing not local there because its cost will be less, why are we not able to beat China in things because what about China, we will not buy Chinese goods, every time Diwali comes I said.  We will not use this, we will not take that, we will not take that, they say, still we buy everything because brother makes that thing cheap and gives it away, why can't we make it cheaper, is our labor very expensive, is our land even better than China? We have become expensive, what is it that China can do and we cannot do that out of the box and we will have to think that brother, you are investing a lot of money in your logistics, you are losing a lot of money, there are a lot of opportunities if you want t-shirts.  For some people, why are T-shirts being made there from Coimbatore, they are made there and not in Delhi, they are made there, they are very good, they will be made from there, they will come there like this, they are made in Tamil Nadu manufacturing, then you all these people.  GST, PST and all these calculations, then why don't they become the same and why not anywhere else? Where even GST is not levied, why so many SME players are not being encouraged for production up to Rs. 1 lakh, where five to 10 people together make 10 lakh rupees?  As soon as they do it, all the policies are added to it. Deduct labor loss PF, deduct their insurance, then do it like this, then do it that way. People tell you to do it, so those who are big are getting bigger, now they are making their monopoly. Ultimately, what are you doing now? Who are these ear-plugs, those who shoot boats, who come picking up Chinese goods and selling their stamps? So brother, how will you get rich? Now you are saying increase productivity.  Take it to China, are n't they doing some mischief, you are selling that kind of goods by taking their goods, as long as you take the goods from them, you are not going to get rich, they are making money, they are taking that money from you.  are you  Here you do it by branding and brooding and then whoever is the politician here, whatever is the thing, if you want to feed any unpolluted bitter pill, any thing is okay - respectful of party, respectful of government, state center, threatening so and so, anything that is not understood. Meaning, if you don't like it, face it, don't push China back, yes brother, you have to do it, yes yes, China has to do yes in everything, and China has to push back, and Pakistan has to.  So, I have kept it behind and let him attract me like this, this is the typical Indian mindset, isn't it, the neighbor who has taken that car of mine, now his Diwali is becoming Diwali, okay when this video is being made at the time of Diwali.  He fought so much, I will put such a one, mine should be better than that, why should this neighbor have to be beaten by this? The question is this and why do you have to take stress about it and if you have to do it properly then do something in actual, but you are not doing it.  You are living by suppressing imports. Check the trade deficit with China. How much does India give to them and how much does they give? India suppresses them and gives them raw material. We take the raw material of our country and we convert it into raw material.  They become very happy by doing so and then there will be a trade deficit. We took raw material worth Rs. 00, prepared it and gave it for Rs. 00 and it is not available from us here in Rs. 00, meaning we can buy that raw material from here.  First we will send the material there, then it will go there, then Bhai Saheb China will do something there and then send it again, it may have been taken here and there twice, but what is it in our system that where the material is, the same thing is next to it.  And Bhai Saheb is making it there, why can't he make it next door, his work is not happening and if you sell it there, the product will be cheap there, which means for this you will have to study Harvard Economics and some other thing.  Is there a need to be more of a business man or an IM or is it the brother who is giving raw material to China, goes so far, goes in the ship, does not know from where and reaches from where, it has a cost and then he buys it.  Then he sells, how many Indian businessmen follow the same model and go to China and deal in goods and come back and it has become very easy for them to do this. In India, we are not able to sort out each other.  We have to defeat China and then say anything, we have to push China back, we have already pushed China back in population, okay, we have pushed it back in population, yes yes, population is not a bad thing, but the graph is in our favor.  The fact is that in China there are no such people who are happy that Aarti is performed for them, there are no relatives of theirs, no maternal uncles, no paternal aunts, no aunts, no uncles.  Is there Tai or Tau? Why is there no Tai? Why is there no Tau? Why is there no Tau? Because father is the only child. One Child Policy came in 1980, so now it is not just relationships, that system started there also, boys were given priority there too.  There is love like in India too, especially in North India, there is love for boys, boys are very good for gender, if there is a girl then it used to be like this there too, now the reverse system has started that if the girl comes then there should be a house there.  For a boy and without a boy, if the family members give a separate house to the boy, then the marriage is not going to happen, you should accept this and the same thing will happen in India too, then China is not okay, we can just leave them. Suppose we don't do that much manufacturing, still try to get ahead in services, try to do something else, to beat them in everything, to beat them can't be the narrative of the country because if I have to beat them, then I have to beat them.  Tell me something, brother, it is a simple thing, they have a trillion dollar economy, check it, the math question is very easy, they have a trillion dollar economy, you have a trillion dollar economy, you are growing at one rate, they are also growing at the same rate. So, that math formula is not there, it is the formula of velocity which will be overtaken. A single vehicle is moving at 60 km on R and your distance is from the late.  If you are 10 kilometers behind, then how much speed do you have to increase to cover that distance, apply the formula and see and tell how many years there are, then you will know what a stupidity this is, within four years it would have grown. I told you that in the last four years the economy has grown as much as China and there has been no such fire, they also had Covid for two years, okay so it has been Covid for two years for four years and their Covid is the same. How was the situation, if it has originated then India's total is that much, now you tell me a figure, guess whether China will grow at 2 per cent or 3 per cent, India will grow at 10 per cent, whereas you also know that India will not grow at 10 per cent. And China is also not such a party of two or three, but even then we have overtaken by 6 or 7 percent, but even if the year is fine, brother, tell me how many years will it take, I am thinking.  This is a channel, I am not giving the answers by doing that, I want you all to work hard and write the answers and then in as many years, I don't know, the political situation will change one and a half thousand times, whose game will be played, what will happen in the world. Sustainable growth has to be seen, Diwali time is coming, auspicious profit has to be seen, profit is not profit, whenever you go, you see, auspicious is written on the left, then there is profit, auspicious profit has to be seen, that is sustainable.  This is our golden bird which our country was made of. Don't go in the pursuit of profit. China's faction is defeated. They have no goodwill in front of the whole world. They know that this is how Indian businesses are, India is a country again.  It is also seen that they will not loot, the thing about Indians is that yes, that means their quality is not known, they will make good, they will make bad and the timelines are not firm, China's timeline is firm, discipline is firm, if there is any order there.  Will put it, but then China wants to go there and capture them the way Indians don't do it, then people are still looking, the whole world is sitting like this, Africa is sitting like this, brother India, you do something, your nature is good, your nature is good.  Yes brother, but if you work like this then we have to explore those things, we have everything but we will do that China China China China by bringing those Chinese goods to India and you to Africa.  Will you do such a smart act from there, that is not going to happen to our India, we will have to do it in our own goodwill, we will have to do it and this is what has happened to us, there is a debate in the mind of 24 hours, oh, China has to be pushed back.  Stop holding back, tell me you are not worthy of being held back, we are elephants at our own pace, India elephant is moving at its own pace, elephant's pace cannot be increased too much and it cannot be stopped, elephant is cool but this Our country is forgetting the fun of an elephant. We don't know where to make a Ferrari here. Hey brother, you are going in your desire, enjoy it first. If you pick it up, then the engine will fly and the whole country will be like this.  Sitting is chronic fatigue. There is chronic fatigue in our country. Meet an average person who has a job or is not engaged. He is tired of waiting for a job, whether he will get high or low and the one who is doing a job is tired after coming inside someone. As for productivity, P for productivity has nothing to do with it. Yes, the company is very productive. Now whatever Narayan Murthy ji said is not productive, I want to open a poll to him, the data that has come out is that it is very productive, there is increase in employee revenue.  So the productivity has increased, right? And you are saying that productivity is yes, there is no benefit for him. He gave his whole body, mind and wealth, he did not get the money, you took away his juice, he did not get anything if he spent one hour.  I was earning ₹ 1, now he is earning ₹ 80 an hour and his hours have increased. You tell me, the starting salary of IT people, 10 years ago, the annual package was 2.5 to 3 lakhs and now theirs is ₹ 35.  It is Rs 4 lakh after 10 years and he was the CEO, his average salary was Rs 80 lakh 1 crore 10 years ago and now it is Rs 100 crore, check the list.  These are the firms and I am telling you by name that they come here because they come and sell this knowledge and go away. Like us, they are not saying that we have to do China or work very hard. Here, the whole program is broken.  It cannot go faster than this, the car is full, the accelerator is pressed and they are saying that it is not fun, and if you do it, your engine will explode and they are not enjoying, they are saying that China has to be pushed back and faster. and faster  Faster and faster and faster Hey brother, first you will have to increase the horse power of your engine, if you are trying to reverse, then first you will have to sit quietly, first you will have to stop, if you keep running on the tread mill, then you will reach somewhere. Na, it feels like a lot.  If you are running fast then look at theirs, all their CEOs are earning Rs 100 crores, they are listed companies, you just have to go and read their annual report, it is written that the salary of CO management is this. Salary of management and CEO increased 100 times and employee's salary not even doubled. Starting salary not even doubled in last 10-12 years. Means inflation is less than 5. If it is more than this then who is sucking whose blood and again and again?  -We have to come again and again, we have to tell the youth and we have to answer by throwing back, we were not born to leave China behind, let us live, we are not going to leave behind.  You have taken the contract, what were you doing behind for 75 years, we were behind and till 1980, China was behind, check India's GDP and all the data and it is not that India was running very fast, it is that India has a lot of race.  India too was going on like this, there was nothing great about India even till that time, after that it was not ours, it was hers, otherwise now we have to leave it behind, so yes, this generation will leave it behind, son, who is not your father.  I could do this to you now  Why do you have to do it brother, in a 50 over match you scored 150 runs in 35 overs, okay now you are saying that 15 overs are left, son, you score 150 overs and score 300 and leave China behind, although China does not play cricket but plays cricket.  The season is going on so I am giving an analogy of cricket. You got six outs in 35 overs and scored 150 runs. Okay, how much is the run rate? 4.2. Okay, now you are saying that  There are 15 overs left, you sold 150 for 10, neither is it Vikat, nor do you have that much potential, and if you double the run rate, then what will happen to Vikat Girgi? I am saying this, forget 300, forget this competition, keep your batting quietly 300. Don't go for the target, don't lose wickets, your individual life is a game and if you never get out here then maybe you will reach 240 in 50 overs.  Even if you haven't reached 300, you will reach 240. You can destroy such a total in the course of 300, you can get 175 and get all out too. You see this was in 35 overs and then you will say no, there is still a difference in the net run rate.  It seems that the teams who played against Shana Panti become the fourth finalist and semi-finalist, even if they were losing, what happened if they made up their mind that if they do not lose badly then they will be able to do something in future.  You will leave, there will be some benefit in the future, if something else happens, then this was the message, please you guys share this thing, I hope this is the essence that remains behind, you understand that a little pause and relaxation is okay, all the elders sitting in the park doing China.  Put it back son, put it back son, what were you doing? We couldn't do it for the last 40 years son, now it's your time son, oh that son will do it, daughter will do it, the new generation will do it, let them live, they have many things like that.  I am busy doing what they are doing, they are trying to figure out their own, they are not able to understand, children, don't do a job, don't do this, do that, do n't do that and you bring another list of demands to China, son, to China.  Want to push China back? On top of that, even the politicians will catch the slogan. If you want to push China back, brothers and sisters, then vote for this one. If I say this, they will then say you, this, that, like this, now where can I make the flowers and leaves, is it okay by hand?  Meaning, it does not depend on which one you like more. Okay, so I like these flowers and leaves. I like some other ones. Okay, so that one has nothing to do with that. If it has nothing to do with that, then please share, like. Thank you very much."

    "title": "Inflation And Unemployment [lC4Wry5EjmM].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, One Think Which Nobody Bill Tells You About Inflation and Employment, We will discuss this, I am getting very good response on this channel, a lot of people have come to this channel from Bill Note, Love Affection is not what I want as much as I am getting, for which I am very thankful.  I am six, read this message friend, no one is discussing everything like this, inflation and unemployment or employment is fine, this is a big issue, this is news these days.  This is explained on the channel and everywhere else, let us make it clear once because even the government cannot tell, neither can the opposition tell, nor can any politician tell the thing, because if it is told what I am going to tell, then their further  Will fall further, those people will say that Hindus are only one, then they are making people crazy, politics, politicians, government notes, control employment and inflation, just leave it, some people can do this and go and some people who want to understand new things can join.  To get some fear, ask yourself a question, if it is in their hands and they can generate employment easily, making a promise is a different thing, but making a promise to someone which is not in their hands, then it is the same thing.  These are the clocks of C. If it strikes 12:00, you will get votes. 6. Inflation is a matter of timing. You tell me when Ukraine can control it. Will the dollar printed here in our country print so much and export its inflation?  Is it in the rest of the world and the whole world imports, can we back it? Can we control the prices of crude oil? Everything is linked with the date. How much fear will the society go from here to there? Can we control the rain and weather that will happen? Oh no, the government.  Do something Shakti, listen then right government, like if someone has fever of 104 then look for paracetamol, he has power to do 1021 but can't cure his disease Shakti, why did this fever come, then it became 9900, then what is the start up?  There was an uproar, this child then started to bandage him, then gave him some injection of cold water and then he came down a little. There is an English saying that give is power, you give money, this poor man, I will reduce the inflation or the government will give petrol and diesel and him. But there are other duties which are sometimes said that if the elections were not coming then this is the market link then if the elections are flooded then reduce them now means no one is in it now if they reduce the taxes then if the taxes are reduced there then there.  If you get a little release then brother story and some more floods.  It's something like date, you have water in one area, you poured water there, like there are two buckets of water in this bucket, now the water of this party is getting too much in this bucket, so you picked it up and poured it here that this party  If the water of this big bucket is a little less now, then it means that if this bucket gets flooded then you can reduce this inflation from a temporary story, you tell me, if the government fixes the minimum selling price and increasing the minimum selling price is a relief, then brother, that food will never be less.  It is possible because they have to pay that much which is not according to the market. Now they say that we will pay for onion and tomato also. When onion and tomato are priced at ₹ 200, then no one talks about SP. It is okay because now.  So I got it because of this, but when it falls to ₹ 24, then for some reason people get very sad, this is not the case, so now for the sake of the farmer, we have to see the condition of the farmer, what is the farmer's choice?  bye uselessness  Is it or can he do something else? Hey, if you want to open your mouth in the matter of which of them, then it was like that young picture was like that of a farmer, how did you show it, how much is discussed in the matter of farmer's suicide, but this, my brothers, if 60 crores  If there are people then suicide happens from many regions, film stars are also committing suicide, TV stars are also committing suicide, government employees are also committing suicide, private sector is also committing suicide, daughter-in-law is also committing suicide and son-in-law is also committing suicide. OK  Men are also doing it, women are also doing it, okay everyone is doing it, even students are doing it, those who are unemployed are also doing it, those who are engaged are also doing it, those who are married are also doing it, those who have Rakhi are also doing it.  She is not married and she is also doing it and a farmer is also doing it, then you will say that there are so many accidents, it will be like walking on the road that there will be lakhs and two lakhs of accident dead in India, no matter what the figure is, you will get more, you took anything and did it for her.  take that narrative there  Then if you make money there, then this inflation cannot be controlled and this is flooding this, this is causing losses. Think about how to create this system of employment. So, when we create this system, we say something to a businessman that let's go.  You do it, you open it, you get employment, in this way some hidden devotional reporter is a caste, this one is taking advantage of someone else, someone is doing this, someone is doing that, then he becomes silent and that.  They were buying companies, they were expanding, they were doing that, they become silent, then the opposition would speak, then they would say something, then nothing would have happened, if this was the old system, 500 thousand 2010 years old, here the king could decide anything. If I could, the economy would have been running very well. Yes, I have a business, you are a businessman, I will give this to you and you do this like this and the public will be benefited. No one will say, why did you do this to this businessman? I am a king and I too am.  Should I give a condom to a businessman? What is the big deal in democracy itself? It is a shoe, but I am not saying that leave democracy, but I am in it. Nothing is in their hands, it is not employment, it is flood power. Employment will increase as much as it increases in these terms of opportunities and  There are many types of jobs that no one wants to do, that is, if you beg in Gurgaon, the electrician does not come to your house.  So that means electrician is in great demand but one does not want to become an electrician, if one begs then the plumber does not come, it is less than ₹ 200, promise 500, even then he does not come, you need a good cook, you are ready to pay ₹ 20000, you are not able to find a good cook.  I do n't know of any kind, I don't know, I have n't taken any hotel, I am telling him here that you don't have any kind of employment but everyone has WhatsApp as something. And if employment is to be made then the dynamic of employment is something that no one can do. Right now Amitabh Kant is the only scenery government official. He himself said in the interview that he was behind the government job. He was very big in NITI Aayog. He was also Sherpa of G-20. Meaning, he is a very spoken or powerful or inflation or whatever bureaucrat but he is still associated with the government, he himself is speaking in the government capacity but now he is the government.  Which type of employment should I give to my peons? Give me a raise that brother, we are doing peon recruitment, what to do, where to increase it, but at least he will not accept it, not ours, because when he was in opposition, he also used to say this.  The opposition has also come and is saying this and the public also feels that no government can control employment and inflation, will power be achieved by a thousand jobs in 4 months, will anything be achieved by lakh jobs, 10 lakh children policy  The Commission's figure is that 10 lakh children are coming to the market in India every month, 1 crore 20 are coming in a year, no one can do employment for 1 crore 20, they will have to stop doing small business on their own, they will have to have a full-fledged plant and if that is on the face  Once someone comes to speak, what do you want to do, then tell me, then why did you catch him? Once the Prime Minister even tried to say, 'My friend, my chai is not a tea stall, it is a pakoda stall', it is good.  Will put oil on pakoras, now this quality will remain, it is better to sell pakodas than doing nothing, it is better to do nothing, I am not of the opinion that this should be your first choice, you did not even say in your first choice, why am I? I am here, you open a restaurant, you make a movie, you launch a broom, but I am here, it is better to sell pakodas than to do nothing because whatever you do in India will sell you dead crores.  You will do anything in the population, what is the history of what to do, this is a practical history, I give the last time I made a video, it went on for so long, I had to stop it, so I have an idea, I don't have a sexy history, but you can work for good money and I What happened to Pappu's affair intentionally? Why did I become sad? I got such a good idea from this video, everyone got hooked on me. Hey, tell me how to do it, then tell me. This is the problem of the middle class, this is the problem.  Give me that, you will catch it completely, you do it, I had also said in the video that friend, give me the bank account, I will give the money, then why do you have to do anything, keep preparing for UPSC, keep preparing for the exams or else you  If you tell me, I will give you a practical history where you have to do it only, I will not tell you about multi-level marketing and will only give you the idea, do not think that I will execute it completely, you will have to work hard to execute it.  If you are told that A plus B is a whole square, then put 8 plus 5 square of 13 plus B square and you will get the answer. No, you are not going to do it by doing mine, no one has that much time and energy, so spread this thing. This message is very important and if you have not subscribed to the channel yet, Sir, if you are watching ahead, then definitely subscribe it and if you press the bell icon, the benefit of it is that as soon as the video is released, you will receive a bell.  When you see the icon, you will get a message because sometimes it happens that a video becomes such that I don't want too many people to see it, I have to say this many times, friend, don't forward this one, keep this one, that's it.  People take care of me in that too because sometimes, whatever we believe, people definitely have to do less, this is also psychology, so sometimes they ask you to stop the video or not, if everyone gets to know about that message then it will hurt. Soil  But in India, the population is so high and things are so dynamic that once you tell one thing to one person, if it gets back to him then everyone will understand, everyone will start doing it and then it is as tight as counting, good money is good, all the people will understand it.  Mandal G Gayi, have you become so much, are you sitting idle, then this is the problem, the advice given today will not reduce it after 3 months or 6 months, this can also happen, thank you"

    "title": "Kangana Ranaut Slapgate Incident Raises These Issues [gY6PffbI9zI].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today we will discuss Kangana ji 's slap gate. We will discuss the slap incident that happened. Beyond that, I will try to give clarity to you people. There will be two aspects of it, one is this aspect and the other is the first aspect which is important for any woman.  Slapping, be it a woman or anyone, is condemnable and justifying it is absolutely wrong or not, these people are being very sadistic, I know but it is wrong but it is a matter of utmost concern.  Any person inside the uniform, whether it is a man or a woman, did it because if the word uniform is used, they will see you as uniform, that is, everyone is equal, the moment you wear the uniform, then your caste and religion becomes secondary, when you wear the uniform, you have to protest.  If you want to do such things, killing and doing violence like this is never justified, but if you want to protest then there are different ways to do it, you cannot do it in uniform.  This is absolutely wrong, so this is one aspect, now people are supporting what that girl has done, this show has come down to because of this, now the second aspect in this which I would like to say is that when Kangana ji says something to the people  And nothing happens to them i.e. there is no loss case and she has been saying for many days that Hrithik Roshan case and then Javed Akhtar case and even then many people were told Rs 100,100. Khalistani are sitting in the Congress, they speak words loosely and this is called freedom of speech, so this thing is also very condemnable, whereas this act is not being justified, but no one stands in their support, they created ruckus four-five times, Bollywood  If he is not saying anything, then everyone liked a tweet and shared it, that much is his support, but one thing which was not discussed because as soon as he came and made his video, then he posted it somewhere. Khalistani has also used such a word and now his picture is coming emergency, now every time like us it is not a speculative stunt, has anyone investigated this angle yet? This incident should definitely be investigated in detail.  And it should come in the public domain because if the public is wasting so much time in the public space, then it should come till the end. What exactly happens if I study psychology and human behavior and as a consultant?  I live, I am very evolved. Even if a person doesn't like someone and there is an issue, he doesn't slap anyone on sight. This is also a fact. Was there any more altercation there, was anything said again?  This is what is called when someone is already filled with someone's name and now after coming and pouring more water into it and it spills out, there should be a clear cut of what was said and how it was said to our Sikh brothers. This much  Using this word loosely is very unfortunate by the ruling party MP and it is unfortunate that there is no such thing as such on social media, now that they have got a constitutional post, it is very condemnable for them to do this and these are the sensitivities.  This shows that we are going in a very wrong direction and I request all our Sikh brothers and sisters here that if someone says something like this then you will definitely be angry at him.  But that is not a majority opinion, it is not even a minority opinion, they are like fingers on each hand, put as many or as many as they call, they are loose missiles, they are unguided missiles, this and this is so much embarrassment, according to me, for BJP also.  BJP also does not want such things that Modi ji's third inning is just starting, this is the end of this conflict in the first over, this is a mother-in-law and daughter-in-law drama type because  What happens with this is that neither ladies come anywhere nor comes with all this, so it seems that why do you give them Tiktok, this is also a fact, they go everywhere and bring these issues, now they will not say, what is their fault in this?  That thing that he has been slapped is also true, but brother, what will he say later, the person on whom he has been slapped will come again and act on the same thing. See the slap, I am telling you, Arvind Kejriwal is now busy with Kanhaiya. Such incidents have happened with big leaders like Bhupendra Singh Hooda, in which he never gave such a big blame to the killer that he is getting rings, his cases are being fought, he is getting job offers, if he does not do anything like this then  This shows the political immaturity of Kangana ji. This is not the first time that something has happened to a leader. The law could have taken its own course. Whatever happens immediately, shouldn't I make a video as soon as I land and tell everything, brother, you had told the law authorities that the issue was about to happen on its own, whatever has to happen has to happen, so no case is registered by making your video, it is okay but they have  I thought that I don't know whether I will get sympathy or campath, now I said to that thing that just as Indira Gandhi ji was attacked, in the same way, she made herself equal to Indira Gandhi ji because there is a misunderstanding.  Megla Loman, Megla, I will remember English next time. It's okay. Let me tell you exactly. What is the problem in considering yourself so big but you are not getting sympathy from anywhere? She has become MP, focus on the welfare of the people there.  Do this, ask proper questions, do proper work and do n't do these publicity stunts, don't do these four boat rides that I will get so much fame from MP and do that through sales marketing. I will not have to put the budget of the movie in it and hit here, don't work like this, both are different works, do them in different places, how will the timing get mixed that the picture is releasing in June, it is emergency and you are equating it.  Yes, and like that, you are making it an issue, there are other things in India, no, the woman got shocked, what could be higher than this, there is no end like this, the woman was also a female wrestler, she was there, what did she do at her time, so where is this?  getting slapped is a lot  It is condemnable especially from the uniform of personal and it shows that even inside the uniform we will have to put some checks and balances, we will have to put something or the other as to who is posted where according to how long and what is the account of whom but in this incident there is a must inquiry and that inquiry.  What should be made public? What happened? Is that Kulwinder ji his name? Did he slap Kangana ji on seeing him or just wait?  I was just wondering when she would come from there and I immediately told my mother this and I was waiting because it is a bit difficult for me to believe, maybe I am not denying it might not have happened or it might not happen but what?  Something has happened before that, whether checking of purse, checking of mobile, speaking of some words, something else, everything needs to be this thing and whose mistakes should be addressed to that extent.  There should be as much warning as is justified and as much punishment should be given as per the fault. If both the parties are at fault, then both the parties should get it. And there is also a social thing that you cannot open your mouth just like that, one does not go for the other just like that.  You can say, oh you are all like this, you are all like this, you are all like this, then you are like that, brother, we are all this and all this, this is the middle word that you all are like this because they are all not like this, not even a little, very like.  They say even with the whole finger You cannot blame anyone for such a thing, in this way and by force, I feel that these are incendiary acts and in this, they are exactly like they are in the society, if they do not get support, then they themselves have to introspect, then those people will say.  Why support you, you read something to you, you told the law, now what should we support by casting a vote, the police takes the decision brother, if a person does something illegal to another person, then the law will take its course. If every person is not supporting in that, then introspect why he is not doing it, why are you shaming him or not, he is not doing it, you yourself should release that Vishal Dalani ji who again does not support you when he goes against you. Why are you going opposite to the thing and saying that I will give her a job and after doing this, you have to just introspect why not because where did that Karina Sena go, who considered Kangana ji as his daughter, a Rajput person?  It was said that when Shiv Sena did there in Mumbai, that Karni Sena was standing like this, but the same Karni Sena also gave a statement that when their personal Vikramaditya ji, who again comes from the same community and his wife, said there, on the contrary, they made such a statement.  When given, he also removed his hand. He also removed his hand. He too, he too is not supporting. Your community is not supporting Kangana ji. Your fraternity is not supporting. Your party is not supporting.  I too did not make any statement, it is very big, if you saw it, you would say, what kind of footage is this, I mean, everything is happening here, everything is going on here, we are moving forward so much, this is our own separate footage, so when there is no support from anyone.  Found your own community, your own fraternity where you work and where your party is, you have to introspect that you should not create so much noise, you should not get so much weightage, it is wrong that if someone's car gets stalled, they call it an accident, then whatever the police will do about it.  There is an activity, there is an inquiry, it will be a departmental inquiry, the culprit should be punished, again I said, it is very wrong to do this to a uniformed personal, it is wrong even for a normal person, but doing that to a uniformed personal is very wrong.  This is me because sometimes people also become like what are you doing, there is no uniform personal support to this at all, if this protector itself becomes a predator then the society cannot run.  That is certainly condemnable, but beyond that, how much more can we talk about? It is condemnable, but Kangana Ranath ji will also have to introspect, what is your opinion on this whole matter of you guys who are my audience, please tell us that we cannot use abusive words, speak with her.  It was very good, it should have been like this, she deserved it, this is also a very wrong thinking, saying that nobody deserves this is a disappointment, that is wrong, so question that too within the law.  How can you come and say this and get away with this but some times what happens that someone gets away by saying anything to anybody and one feels like crying at one's time, this thing also has to be done by the society that one should be of law manner.  That if you say something to a farmer, he cannot defame him because the farmer is poor and you are telling him that you are sitting on Rs 10,000, then the poor farmer is deprived of his rights.  He is fighting for the same, yes he will go and defamate a person and if someone does the opposite, if someone tells them something is ok then it becomes defamatory, then a case can be made that by doing this they have defamed them, then it is ok.  So, it has become very laugh- sided, that is, if any person becomes powerful, he will say, 'My name is mine, you have defamed me, it is my name, and if you defame me, I will file a case, but you people are disrespectful'. What is your status? I label everyone. If the whole community gets together and files a case, then what answer will you give? And then a judge will sit in the court and say yes madam, tell me, what do you mean by all this? I know my Lord I want this to happen again just because they are not doing it but now I want to say through here that this is happening to some extent in our North India in Haryana Punjab.  This is based on emotions, but brother, listen, there is law in the country and you will get recourse in it when you give the woman who has done this, which according to me is a matter of condemnation because the uniform is personal, she should not have done it, but you are giving her a gold ring.  You are ready to give a case to defend him, you are celebrating him and doing this, then brother, when you were there, if you had been asked to do so, you could have filed a case at the same time, do you understand what I am saying? put it at that time so that  In future, if anyone wants to get involved in the cases then it could have been done like this. This is my independent opinion because I am working to pour cold water wherever there is such a hot pot in the society, but here to give clarity on this issue.  But it was very important that something wrong happened because what about people, whenever any issue comes up, they take sides, no, this is wrong, this is wrong, or this is right, or this is wrong, this is slapping.  There is definitely something wrong with the uniform, there is no denyer to him but there is a story behind it too, there is a back story, there is a story of that day and there are also actions after the incident and it is not that it will end and You will not see any episodes like this in the future, they will keep happening like this until someone is there to say that do introspection, it is necessary here. When I say brother, get married, do it, if you are a husband, if you are someone's husband 's wife, then someone will teach you firmly.  to teach  The rest is there, no one says anything, then who is the one to say it, this is the problem, no one can teach, whether it is a husband or a wife, it is very important for the society to know that brother, he will tell, friend, do a little because no one has the courage.  Had he not said, then who would give advice, he considers himself a man so much that the status of the new MP, brother, MP is not such a big thing, as it seems, if there are 543 members of Rajya Sabha, then it becomes 800.  be close So many people go and go like this in India, after multiplying by the meeting, I do n't know how many came and how many went, don't think that if you are a law- abiding citizen, if they tell you to get checked, get purse, get MP, something like this happens.  It is not written that your check is empty, it is written that those 20 people are the President of India, that your checking will not be done, it is written that if you are not his name, then brother, you will be checked, you will feel bad in that.  There is no need to accept this, this was a message, it was a balanced message, I liked it, got clarity, please write your opinion on this in the comment section, and my request is that there is no need to make a toxic opinion that it was very good, it was not good at all.  This incident is not good for anyone. This incident is not good for the society. We as a society have to learn a lot from this. So like and share the channel. Thank you again."

    "title": "Know This Secret BJP Winning Formula ｜ Haryana And Maharashtra Template Discussed [bDI6lP1zfy8].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, I feel like teaching a little politics through this video. The audience will enjoy if you can learn it. This is not learned anywhere in the study of political science etc. The real politics is that of a person from a different background.  If I can teach, then I have chosen two provinces, Haryana and Maharashtra, I have a good relation with both, okay, it is a very great relation, so what is the relation, let's leave it and start the discussion on politics, here a particular party supports and opposes me.  Don't do anything like that as if you have to give a disclaimer, many of my audience also get irritated. Did I understand or not? You tell me, hey brother, new people also have to be added. You are finding the food tasty, the food is looking fine but tell others.  So it will have to be a little more chilli in it or if it is like that, then listen to it for 15 seconds and then let's start. Yes, there is a dominant caste in Haryana and Maharashtra. There is a community in Haryana of 30 people.  Is there Maratha or Jat community there? It is okay in Haryana and this kind of politics was going on. BJP is a very intelligent party, it has intelligent leadership and there are many people with brains. BJP was nowhere in the 90s.  And there used to be a dominant caste politics, okay these things which have been applied in these two states in this formula, this has happened in other states also but it has happened with variety, so in those states I am not taking the example by asking because then he is a complex min caste, he gets matured due to which over a period of time the rest of the people start getting matured. 36 fraternity, by doing this and that, these pitchers have become famous, then if we will do politics of it.  And if we make it this dominant cast versus this, then the story will be, then whatever they did, they did, they achieved power by doing it, when they achieved it, then like here  But our Shri Khattar ji was made the Chief Minister of Haryana, who comes from the Punjabi community. When his turn came, Devendra Fadnavis, who again comes from the Brahmin community, was made the Chief Minister. And beyond that, I will not tell about the personal of both of them, what are the administrative skills, here I will only  I will talk about caste and caste and what is its difference. If I talk about only this, then when Devendra Furnace was the Chief Minister for 10 and a half years, then  You have done a lot of this politics, they call it social engineering, this and this is good, good politics, I will say, it is fine from the political point of view, very well done, now you tell me, now my people will also be there, now see Guruji, after doing it in feeling, you have to tell me to speak like this.  While I am with my caste, they say with him, don't ask about the caste of a sadhu, take the knowledge, do peacock, let it be about the sword, I have come, I have to tell, now here I am teaching a lesson to the BJP people also, I am Congress.  I am giving it to the people also, I am giving it to my community also, I am explaining it to the Marathas also, I am explaining it to the Jats also, I am explaining it to the Punjabis also, I am explaining it to everyone that brother, this is what is happening, this is what I have seen with my own eyes.  The situation is there, there is no need to believe bad in it, there is a need to learn. An intelligent person will learn that there is no win or loss in this and that thing is not like this, it will be like this, it will be like this, okay, so whenever the spun spring goes to one side.  if yes then rebound  The effect is that the pendulum goes to one side and then it has to come to the other side. That energy is filled, so when the leadership was Jat leadership, Devi Lal ji, earlier there were many leaders, it is fine, then only those Jat leaders had less feeling, they were like this.  There was a feeling that they are the leaders of the farmers, even before that it is okay that you go away and take the example of Chaudhary Charan Singh of many other people in leadership positions, now Chaudhary Charan Singh's son is in RLD.  Are you contesting the election of two MPs? What happened? I became the leader of only Jats, the same thing happened that if the leadership was there, if you are a leader, you have to be no one else looking other than your caste because you You just join the cast, you come to your community and then you become their leader, through that you can never become a great leader, you cannot remain sustainable and then again they say that  Aren't cracks exist? To take advantage of those cracks, a political party will come and take that ideal. Now, just like Naib Saini ji has been made the Chief Minister in Haryana, there is a vote bank of only 3 people, so what is there for 3 people?  It is not that the vote bank of 3 will greatly shake the politics of Haryana, but the message is that brother, everyone else will also be seen, our party takes everyone along with it till the elections are held.  If we put Jats versus others or make it like Maratha versus others, then it will work. This is the first time that Congress has either called Jats or it has told different communities, listen brother, you can fight the elections. Rao Saheb will contest from Bhiwani.  This is the first time this has happened in the politics of Haryana, I am telling you and I am very dear to you, I am a Guruji man for me, so many times people approach me for consultation. Give a discount to the community, I said no brother, everyone is equal, it is free, so it is free for everyone, if there is money, there is money for everyone, there is no discrimination in this or if you are of any choice, then it is mine from within and I have to say this for the first time.  It will happen that Jats will vote for Yadav and will also do canvassing. This is happening for the first time in the history of Haryana and I consider this thing as brotherhood and a very good thing and that is also an effect of Covid. Many people released in Covid also. Political party does not belong to anyone, they have separated us from each other, brotherhood is ours only, I know the Jat agitation that happened in 2016 and how much happened in it, it happened like this, it happened like this and it was in bad taste, I was the agitator, how did it happen?  What happened will be very political and someday we will create an environment for that too. I will explain it by making a video and a case study. I will try to bring more positivity in it because no politics was played in it. It is okay for the general public.  Misuse and use is fine and there was a very bad taste in it and you know how that happened and after that everyone turned to finger lips, then 19 came, 20 came and then this farmer agitation came and you know what this is with the farmers.  When the accounts were settled, this was what it was - this time the elections are not going to be this Jat versus rest. I tell you from Haryana that Maharashtra has become very complicated but the same politics has been played there too, that is, Maratha. Take Maratha here and set him against you, because what happens is that even the people from the dominant caste behave badly, period or time, and all this happens because power always corrupts.  Give it to someone for a long time It's not about cast It's not about gender It's not about party It's not about idol  Yes, you make someone Chaudhary for a long time and others will definitely like him, this is a fact, so this time for the first time, that feeling of brotherhood is coming, if you see that the Congress candidate from Bhiwani seat is called Jat.  They do this election against Jats, they have given ticket to Rao Saheb whereas BJP has given ticket to others. You are thinking that if you go to Sirsa then only non-Jats will get the ticket from Sirsa.  Ticket has been kept, you come to Gurgaon, Raj Babar Saheb is not a Jat in Gurgaon, okay, so the community you know is fine, after that we go here to Karnal, see who is fighting, see in Ambala.  Look, who is fighting on the basis of caste, I am opposite, it was a mistake in Sonipat also, last time Bhupendra Hooda ji should not have fought because he is like you, Bhupendra Hooda ji, he is like others.  Yaari keeps friendship very much on personal level. Many people of the community also get irritated with the fact that you are a smart leader. They do not want to give the perception that I am the leader of only Jats or I am the leader of Rohtak and Sonipat belt only. So it has been successful, I will not say that it is very successful but still personal genuine relationship has been maintained across it. Now the Brahmachari ji who is fighting from Sonipat also.  I think he is considered very close and it is he who has got the ticket done for him, it is okay that whatever he got done or whoever is the high command or whatever happens, he has got the ticket, it is okay, so this thing should change now.  If this is the case, then BJP also has to learn that it cannot tell the story of one thing for a long time. They thought this is the law of diminishing returns of any state because the dominant caste will be in the leadership position.  You never did anything there, you did this kind of politics, it went well for 10 years, your butt is not working now, so now there is a request to BJP also that you can't just leave the dominant cast like this or no, now polarization will be done only against it.  Caste says polarization is ok, that polarization of caste is no longer working, this social engineering which work earlier is no longer working going on because now what is the real problems, they are of caste.  It is beyond, if a Jat is not getting a job or he is not getting a job or people from other communities are not getting a job then that is a genuine problem for everyone, it is a problem for everyone, it is not for one caste, it is inflation, it is for everyone.  Inflation, marriage is not for everyone, there are issues of gender ratio, all these issues are for everyone, so this was a common thing in Maharashtra also, it happened like this that brother, you are dominant. If you look at this one and this is done in other places too, in the places where tribals live more, if you follow the second one especially in Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand or Chhattisgarh, you will see the trend there too, just like you are seeing it in Rajasthan also, but now it is working. Rajasthan's I am not predicting that there will be a change of Chief Minister after the elections because whatever you say to the BJP people, one thing is that they are smart, intelligent and intelligent and they see that here they are not like the Congress people.  see given  It is happening, it means that the child is failing, it will happen, it will be seen after the exam, whether they do the correction, if BJP people do the correction, then it is an appreciable thing about their politics that they will listen to the feedback even if they do not clap for you.  Do n't thank you, maybe even get angry at you that who are you to tell, but still somewhere their leaders understand that this is a very intelligent thing and what you see is that people live this kind of life at human level.  Fifth note of musical scale  Even at the individual level, if he progresses, he will complain because he makes mistakes, he learns, he does course correction, he does it now, like in Haryana, what did he do earlier, everyone used to change their candidates, BJP changed the Chief Minister, used to remove anti-incumbency.  But that is not working in Haryana. The people of Haryana are a little different. The people of Haryana vote for Congress, not to bring someone to vote, but that is a different thing.  I am still in many seats, I have still kept my stick out in a different way. Many people are giving one to Congress in Haryana. I am not giving one to Congress in Haryana. Even today I am saying this, if Haryana's  If you see, I can say the seats of Sirsa and Rohtak, rest of Bhiwani and Sonipat I had said tight finish, but even if you take them, then the matter is visible only on the side of four, six, nowhere, it is not visible that nine or one is BJP's.  A lot of voting is coming  Yes, there will be a difference in the percentage. The margin of victory in the election will be very close, but the party which is running with the cushion of 6-6 lakh votes, whether it wins the election with 500 votes or 5000 votes, the party is running with a cushion of 6-6 lakh votes, that victory is victory.  And if he is an MP, then there is no talk of him, the election will definitely be closed, but this is one thing going forward, when both of them have Legislative Assemblies and I will be evolved.  During the assembly phase will also happen after four months, but today I am telling you that this was common politics, BJP played it very well but now its time has come, now it cannot be played anymore, now you can play it whenever.  Their voters who will reach the level of workers or who I have seen as Lalan Top Pe Lalan Top Popular This can be anyone versus anything but it is not that this time I personally feel that the Jat community is fine.  These people have come to this realization and it is a good realization that if you want to take leadership and want to become a genuine leader of any province, then you will have to sacrifice, you cannot pretend to be Chaudhary everywhere, if you want to become a genuine Chaudhary, that is an actual Chaudhary or  Whoever you call an actual leader, an actual king, anyone, what words will they use in democracy now, they have to give a feeling to everyone.  That yes brother, we are all one and let's go, I have a lot of desire to do all this, I have a lot of energy or we are many, we will do it, but you will also get support, you will also get inclusion, you will also be listened to and all these things, whatever you get or like this  No, this is Batni, it takes time to give this feeling, it takes time to give this feeling and the rest of the people also come from the society, they also worked very hard but sometimes what happens is that you are 2 on 1.  be at 3  If yes, then you are not heard alone, because if one dominant cast keeps winning all the time, then someone else will do it and bring everyone together, on 2, on 3, on 5, on 4, on like this, it goes to 40, 45, then the game is done, it's fine.  If yes, then it has been done like this, but what now is that if politics will have to think a little differently now, BJP will have to do something in the state of Haryana, somewhere within the dominant caste, you will have to look at the leaders who are there.  What is the condition of the leader, you see, they are keeping it in name but those leaders are not even able to speak. Just like it was happening in some rallies, but let's go too far and it will become like I am influencing the votes, all this.  I will not talk after the elections because my genuine intention is not to benefit any particular party by doing vote bank politics. There is one issue very dear to me which I would like to tell my audience and it is very important for the country. I have decided on the issue of Agniveer, there is a lot of content in it for me, there is a lot of content in it for me, I have elections on 25th May, so I am not doing it according to the elections, otherwise it will not be imposed on me or no, you are here.  Their side is like I will do it after the elections, what is there to do now even after the elections, people will listen because it is up to the one who can change the government in Haryana to tell me, even if there is a change then it will be Agniveer.  Don't come because the state government doesn't decide. Central government doesn't want to decide. Rajasthan's Agniveer is separate and Haryana's is separate. The recruitment of the armed forces is done. He comes under the center and reports to the central government. Whatever the system of recruitment is, it is fine. So where it will make an impact, it is those people who have to tell it. I believe that if it is explained properly, all the people come together, all the political parties come together, then they tell once on Agniveer.  It is possible that this money saving system that you have implemented is neither saving much money nor is it benefiting the country and it can have an impact on defense and national preparedness and national security. That's why we have to tell because unfortunately the rest of the players in this are not opening their mouth for some reason or can't open or they have compulsions, so some public will have to do it and that public which is genuine faceless public in the terms that we are not from any party.  If you are not doing it with funding, otherwise what happens, the credibility gets reduced. Now if you raise any issue, within a minute someone comes out and says that they are wrestlers, so you are doing this with Congress, you are doing it with this, so it is not me.  I want to because otherwise he will remain political, this is a conspiracy, you, there is no conspiracy with them brother, there is no conspiracy, I myself want the credibility of the people who are fighting in Ladakh. They also did not get any credibility, Sonam Wangchuk also did not get any credibility, the movie on which the movie was made in Three Ditches, you would know what they said, they said brother, issues are happening here, come and see, understand that there is no one to them, just look at one thing, country.  I have become better, which I like. What used to happen at some time? After 2014, after 15, can someone say something? Go to Pakistan, go to Pakistan, now I am thankful to the athlete. I am saying these things, but no one knows me.  He doesn't say, go to Pakistan, it's okay, go to Pakistan, meaning earlier they used to say like this brother, why should I go, this is Pakistan, I like my country, why should I go, if you are in trouble then it's okay, then this athlete, this thing, at least go to Pakistan, stop saying this.  People have made it a list, we have reached this far, I will consider it an achievement that now if a person wants to talk a little sensibly, then the listeners, if earlier there were 100, have now become 500, this is a fact.  Other things: Those who used to talk about everything by going to Pakistan have disappeared, now they don't have the courage to speak like this or people do n't want to listen to them, whatever they say, go to Pakistan, there is an issue, they will cover that issue, this is politics.  Polarization of caste is not going to work any langar, we will have to do something else across everyone, we will have to do it genuinely. Bharatiya Janata Party is a very intelligent party, their feedback system is very amazing, even through RSS.  It also comes through workers, they also hire private agencies, they take feedback from three places, Bharatiya Janata Party is not from one place, so the reality is that the top leader is theirs, this is also a fact which is a good thing.  Now they come of course, because of what ever reason they can't tell what feedback we are getting, they change the Chief Minister just like that, elections are about to come. Change it friend, not like this brother, feedback goes, feedback goes and this party takes quarterly, monthly and half yearly feedback, I am giving one more feedback. I have a lot of relation with Rajasthan too, so I have a lot of relation with all the places, I have a lot of relation with Sri Ganganagar. I have a big relationship with Anupgarh. I have a big relationship with Hanumangarh. I have a big relationship with Suratgarh. I also have a big relationship with Jodhpur. I love Jaisalmer too. I love Sirohi a lot. Okay.  Sikar Jhunjhun, I love Rajasthan very much, I love Bikaner very much, I love Bikaner very much, Rajasthan is on foot, everywhere is fine, Phalodi is fine everywhere, Phalodi is fine, everywhere Udaipur Udaipur  I am very close, intimate means this is the kind of work, so I consider Rajasthan as my Haryana, similarly I consider Rajasthan too, relations are like this everywhere in Gujarat, one has to become a leader, one has to make relations everywhere.  It is like this that the channel does not work everywhere, every place, Sawai Mahadevpur, there is a big connection, okay, then the CM of Rajasthan will have to be changed, I think so, I think so, rest on June 4, we will know whether the change will have to be immediate or after two or four months.  You will have to change after a month, but brother, you will have to change, it is not like this, it is okay, make Vasundhara ji, if you cannot make Vasundhara ji, then who is Mastnath ji, then make someone, friend, look a little, leadership in the state should look like a leader just.  Because the top leadership does not need too many powerful people, that too is an insecurity, but then you cannot do it like this that there is only one batsman left. Now Yogi Nath ji, who is the Chief Minister of UP, has a brand and personality in himself, so BJP will be defeated by him.  No brand has gone down, no one should rebel like this, Congress had made a big mistake, it was Jagan who was the son of YSR.  If he had kept him a little, then this situation would not have happened in Andhra today. Congress had separated Andhra and Telangana, but who ate the bread, that KCR, now his government has been formed. After so many years, he made another wise, and he was the one who was in 2004. When the government was formed, it was limited to Andhra Pradesh only. Now he died in a crash. There were insecurities while giving it to his son. There was some bullying, so this.  In arrogance when you say your sat raps local sat raps setup is the English word I think ok or Hindi I don't know setup S A T R A P is ok then satrap say set raps whatever tell you tell me my English Hindi you  Please correct it too. Okay, so whatever they are, we will have to pay a price to them, brother, we will have to pay a price and this is the election they raise, this is the election they raise, you have given the price to DK Shivkumar. Karnataka will have to give in to that domineering leadership. If it is from any party, then these leaders will not run like leaders. There should be some discipline and a sense of respect and a little meaning, I will not use the word fear, but it means a discipline.  It should mean that you have such a leader, it is ok so that otherwise, how many provinces have been run by one leader from Delhi, friend, this is the time of such an emperor, even in the time of that emperor, it is local.  There used to be Mansabdars and there were Subedars and who used to say what, they all used to run, they used to run, there was a Nawab, whatever happened, the meaning of province is that according to me, politics will have to be changed a bit and the change will be for the better, I believe and  Our country will move towards a good democracy and if any wrong things happen, then I want the citizens to do so comfortably through social media, without getting themselves excited or doing it to anyone else. In this entire video, I In any video, I never try to provoke even a little, I don't cry, my tone remains tender, I tell things in a relaxed manner and now you people must have slowly started understanding what I am in terms of ideology.  If those who have liked it have enjoyed it, then add a subscriber, one, two, two, minimum, like, subscribe the channel and one more good thing, there will be a gram group of Guruji from Gurgaon, if you join it.  So on that I keep doing some polls so that I get feedback in creating my content and call it polling percentage or quantity, it gives you more opinions than these big news channels or something.  If you get it, I also get benefit. I had asked in the last video which city my audience is from, so write once again that I will always ask at the end because it helps me in that video.  It has also been proved that there is a pan India audience in this video also. I want to see that if you are listening to me then where are you listening from. Many of our NRI brothers are also listening which I am feeling very good because the NRIs who tell you this.  I am saying that from this channel you will get to know some reality, on the other hand, very different types of things are coming, whether it is good or bad, so this will give you peace that whether you are sitting in the country or sitting outside, you will get the genuine information about our country. Where are we not going to be taken and I want that we should quickly burn the country in such a way that even our NRIs should not stay outside full time, for some time, six months, five six months, five months, six months or more, then we will have to pay tax.  If you people start coming to stay here in India for five months, then if India becomes ours, please share, like and subscribe. Where are you joining from, which city are you joining from and write the name of the city and you participate in it.  thanks  you very much"

    "title": "Kolkata Case ｜ What No One Has Discussed Till Now ？ [Knb0sXCdRr4].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, let's talk a little about the Kolkata case, I keep a little aside, when a thing is going on, because of not telling much about it, some or the other details keep coming out, but now a time comes, till then there was a lot of demand for it.  I want to give a perspective on this, whenever something like this happens, the society gets shaken and the question that is always asked is that this should not happen again, why did this happen, I am to be blamed and this should not happen again. This is a very simplistic approach, first order thinking, which I call natural, beyond this there are certain things which no one is saying openly, I think someone has to come and tell this thing, because ultimately, what is the government to do, what if it doesn't happen.  It is one thing that the culprits should be punished, it is natural that it should happen, such a severe punishment should be given that even the Prime Minister said recently that this case went on as it is, now a news from Rajasthan. Now it is coming like today itself, in Uttarakhand it is being told inside the bus, it is coming everywhere everywhere, it means coming from somewhere to everywhere, now that case is going on separately because there is a doctor there.  If this has happened, then she lives at a higher level in the society. What is happening at the level of the poor? There is less noise there. Answer: If the nurse is from Uttarakhand, then there is less noise. 3 year old girl in Rajasthan. 16 year old girl here in Uttarakhand.  So  What is this, what is this showing, the police is not that, effective law and order is not effective, people do not have fear, there are mental issues. By doing this, we can put five-six things in the initial first order, but one common thing will come out to you.  Whatever no one is telling, here a common thing will come out and you have to check it and everyone is a little afraid to tell it but still it has to be told and here your support is needed. Increase subscribers, write comments.  Share the video, I dare to tell you, at the cost of sounding classist, I will not use the word other than that because I am not doing any community or that, brother, rich poor, great poor, here are some links, if you do profiling as many as Crimes are also happening here, the first thing is that mails are being sent, more people from the poor section will come out. There is no need to say here that the rich do not do this or this has not happened or the people with BMW are not rich or  He has never committed any rape and there has been no case in it, we will not talk about it. We see that if thousands of such incidents happen, then what is the pattern in it? A male who is not married or whose marriage has been broken or who does not have a family, is poor and  Drifter is a drifter in the society. He understands that there is no one for him, he has no incentive, no one is going to catch him, what are you doing, where are you going. Take an example from the recent cases also, before that, take a  Look at the common patterns, their identification comes out, many times, the same pattern is coming here too. Literally, you are like there is a forest in which some of you are girls, some are deer and some are wolves or some such animals come and do that.  Will you take it? You have to save yourself, you can't go there and say why this happened, this kind of work has been done, now blame the government, the government will be blamed, change has to be made, change the officers, change the officers, make noise.  Create a ruckus, take out a candle march, this candle march has become so irritating now, light the torch friend, then I get angry at the candles, do you have to go out at night, stop it in the day by showing the lamp in the candle, if you have to do it then one  I will tell five-six things for women and for this country, my talk is a bit extreme, I also know because I am here, this cry of public is like Mamata Banerjee calls, yes, it is a useless administration. Kolkata Police's handling of the case is very stupid and it adds to all the speckle fake narrative and all because people say that the details that are coming, this is not a person, they gave it to CBI like this. So there is an inner voice in the country that we cannot solve even a single case, we do n't even know that there are no CCTV cameras, no one comes to the hospital, one of my videos on doctors will be very good, that generally.  Doctors have got nothing to do with this case but doctors are there, anyone is coming, anyone is going, anything is happening in the medical colleges. The principal there is highly politicized and his principal, we have  Have you seen what is happening, there is not only an ecosystem of safety, when the ecosystem itself is not of safety then all the women who work or have to go out have to demand. If you cannot guarantee the safety of your organization then give us SOP and Norms. Do not keep you after 5:00 pm. Many people will say that yes, then women will not be able to work like this. You have to create ruckus, you have to work too and 5.  Do not do anything after 00:00, do not do any night duty, see what is there in this, keep one thing in mind, a general hate towards women, recently England has passed a law on this.  I have done this for Missoni that if you do it like this, this thing is going on in India too, I am telling this with great observation and personal whatever is my touch, I live in it and people also get a lot of comments on five channels. And the rest also I see, General Ted is towards females, it is about 498, they will do it like this, they will do it like that, so there is a different class there, they hate only from the mind and there is no physical crime happening there.  But ultimately there is a lot of poison in the ecosystem in the name of women. Today I want to ask the men who have created these lodges. Now understand why they are created. One things go with women. What is the extent. Put your hand on your heart. Who has made you  Like this, has this happened to any man till date, does it say that she makes false allegations, goes to jail, what to do, what to do, even after making the law so strict, this is the condition of women in 1980's and 90's.  They were burnt in the matter of dowry and the stove used to burst every day. Somewhere in India, there was a gas stove which was used and the woman used to get burnt if she did not come and nothing happened. I recently made a video of this on Rakshabandhan.  Whatever property should be there on the other channel, many people felt irritated, those brothers and men, why look, we cannot keep the deception, you cannot say that till this level it will be very bad but we do not have the right at the small level.  will give every  The place is Missoni and there is toxic petki Too much petki is not bad but toxic petki is bad petki It should be that I am father and everything is equal and I will protect I am a man I am a man Men have become less because there is no definition of a man  There are men who say that they are not the real real men. Yes, I have no shame in speaking. We are failing our daughters. We are failing as girls.  A country is not manhood Manhood is the real one The man to protect is the one who is the protector The father is the one who is the protector The protector It's a man's world Yes it's a man's world And man is supposed to take all the blame If things are  Not OK and that rush is visible among many people in Kolkata that how did this happen, that is why they are sitting there taking out their time, the same thing does not happen in Uttarakhand, they do not.  I feel that something has happened to Uttarakhand, I didn't know what happened just now, then something happened inside the bus, something happened in Rajasthan, this anger of the general public should come out, only then the big politician is very smart, once he comes to know, he votes.  Wherever the bank is to be found, all the work is done there, but saying this like a minor irritant should not make this case such that it should be closed. Last time when it happened, you had seen that the government was shaken in Nirbhaya case, it was the Central Government.  Now the atmosphere in the country seems to be repeating itself. The same central government has been going on for the past 10 years. Modi ji is becoming disillusioned with the BJP. If this happened in Kolkata, God forbid it would have happened here.  Something like this would have started in Delhi, that fearless one would have started here, but now it has happened there, so the government should be formed there too, West Bengal government should not be shaken, should not be shaken, in the sense that they should always. Brother, do not be pro-active so that this does not happen again in the future. They will make a separate video that it is a crime and never become a victim in a crime. It is very important for me to make that because I believe that this thought process of human minds is beyond this level of mine.  It is a little blessed that I have some understanding as to why and how, so I would like to make that separately, here I would like to keep it on politics only, on Kolkata politics, Mamata Banerjee herself should protest against her government.  They are taking out protest marches. Hippocritus suffers a lot. If you see the average girl of Delhi who goes to college or the woman who goes, she runs to bite in such terms that if anyone around does something wrong because she has given them a gun through so.  Much of this harassment, now when Anam Lee comes inside the girls, now some normal decent man is coming from outside, who does not know what Delhi is here and what is there in the bus, to whom she shouts, pick up.  And they have to be a little aggressive, then they can't even handle it with men. Aggressive females or those who are aggressive, what should I say, self-assertive, but I think there is no other option but women to now treat all men like this because brother, ultimately.  Which woman feels so scared after seeing her? Normally someone is going on the road but does anyone get the creepy feeling after seeing a man? So there will be a man on 99.9 and these drifters, no one is calling them out, these are poor drifters, not every poor person is like this, but in crime, it was also seen in Nirbhaya case, drifters were like this, they were just going somewhere, there was no such cleaner.  There is nothing to do in life, there is no incentive, that's why someone like me says, don't get married, do it late, check athlete, we keep creating drifters in the society. These have been and are important now that there are many people who are mentally such that they should not be married, hygiene wise, they do not do jobs, they do not earn money and have a criminal mindset, they have addiction, all these things are too much and now they are  There will be issues for the society, now I will call them identification, many cases are coming, because what is the matter, in India, if someone is poor then it is fashionable to speak about his rich, there is no fear because everyone gathers for the poor. Why are the poor not able to speak August? They are not educated, they are poor, they are drifters, they are addicts. I have given so many definitions. I have not made anyone poor by just making them poor because poverty in itself is a very big disease and there are all these things.  Mentally, in their society, it is a very common thing for women to be like this and to think like that, it is considered that the brother is beating the woman and is not doing anything, it is okay, some misbehavior is happening with the woman, molestation is happening, something.  If it is happening, then there is a section where there is not that much noise, so they feel that it is just like this and what percentage of them do we need? If there are 100 poor people in India and even one out of 100 turns out to be like this.  So you also see how poor people are in India, even if one of them comes out of Hajj, you see for the society because there is this pattern from there, if there is a pattern then there is a reason to call out and gradually those jobs.  Will get into these kind of jobs and also due to a class divide, a lot. No result of the Kolkata case is known yet. What exactly is this, but the accused who has been caught in Kolkata also exactly qualifies the definition of Drifter 10 12.  Haj job, there is no place, sometimes police volunteer, sometimes going to medical college in barracks, fitting jugaad there unnecessarily, doing this, rest of the details.  Will it come that there may be something else, maybe not, then first of all we have to do with society identification, this eco system is coming and if the middle class has got four paise, then it means that we cannot speak that much about one section of the society.  We can't lift it or we are only busy in doing Hindu-Muslim thing. Thank God, whoever has been arrested here, his religion is Hindu, so what will you say now, so much barbarity has happened, what will you say now, tell me, those who make Hindus Muslim are in trouble in everything.  the seekers  Yes, it would have been convenient if we had got something else, the masala, the criminal who has no religion, the dirty thinking has no religion, she exists everywhere, she exists everywhere, we as a society have to be very alert and that is what I will create next.  How can we save ourselves? We can't go and inject something like magic to fix someone's thinking but we can protect ourselves and that will be very important and its topic will be the script of crime if we can.  Break that script we can save our sales and that is I specialize in that in a way. I have a lot of research on that and a lot of clarity on that and how other countries have achieved that thing. Yes, government also has a role in that.  But we can create such a situation with our intelligence, prudence and consciousness that we do not fall victim to true things, things will not happen and we will continue to roam in the society if this jungle remains a jungle even at this time.  There are many wild animals roaming around in the world but we are not that scared of them because we are not in the jungle. It is a simple thing and we are never able to match. They are roaming around in the society and how do we manage.  This will be my next topic. If you people want then please write in the comment section. Please write because I definitely want to make that video. In the Kolkata case, we have failed as a society. Politics has definitely failed.  Mamta Banerjee, their system administration is 100%, there is no doubt about it, there is no second opinion, the way they handle the case, in the beginning it is suicide, then making them wait for three hours with the parents, then why does it mean that it has become a crime?  You have to take action in a proactive way, it doesn't happen, it means you wish that it's not a small thing, it's fine by taking this approach, then the main thing will be that if it doesn't happen, then you should think about that part.  The second part of this video is that I want that the athlete is there because I have a lot of clarity beyond that, otherwise now I am giving its hint again and again, whatever is going on on social media or in your mind.  It is that this thing has happened, it has happened very, very terrible, so who should be blamed in this and the rest outside, should it happen that this should not happen, this is being done but there is a helplessness in it, everyone knows, everyone wants to do it, now the government.  let it be like this  People 's thinking should become such that people who have the capability to do so should disappear from the world. This is a bit of wishful thinking. Whatever I say, I will say and tell you what you can do because whatever you can do is in your hands. For that you do not have to go and learn any permission from anyone who is in your hands to keep yourself protected and not to fall victim. If there is a case of women, if there is any other case then definitely write it in the comment section. Thank you.  you very much"

    "content": "Hello friends, this is my first video on D New Channel, why was there a need to make this new channel, why am I making it, what is its mission statement, I would like to tell you that you have subscribed on the media and are on many current events which are happening in our country. Where are you going, there are many view points but there is one look, everyone claims that I am neutral, neutral does not belong to anyone, it is not possible to be neutral, I would like to tell you that a point can never be neutral.  It is being reduced as per the agenda, you are seeing huge number of subscribers on YouTube, okay, so I am creating this channel for you to have an independent view point, it is according to that, it will never be neutral, it can never be neutral.  The thing is gum, it is cold, it is black, it is white, but there can be an independence point of view in this thing, this and this strange way, they can support anything which is on the opposite right, D D on individual and D on country. Secondly, focusing illusion is being created too much on social media and there is a lot of confirmation by speed because if your view point is here then you will see such content which is your confirmation message, this channel of meaning is this.  But these people are already aware because 30 to 40% of the people who have fixed history are sitting on the platform, there is no channel for them.  Because you have a fixed idea, be it winter, be it summer, be it rain, be it a storm, your V point is not going to change, I ca n't do anything, this channel is my new channel, it is for the seekers, it is for the curious. Yes, this is also possible, this is also happening, this is happening right, this is right, this is wrong, this may be wrong, this may be right, where it can happen and maybe and maybe these two things.  Of  There is more element who already knows everything on his own that it is absolutely written in stone so he is not for him, I always call him an Illuminati, I have other channels as well, there is some system on them which we will keep.  Nice cannot be done by some people or by a force, which sets a narrative, which sets the narrative, the story itself is caste, the one who has power, it sets the narrative, it is caste through truth, this is also a fact.  Negative set is a caste and the one who sets is successful. Here I am declaring it to my intelligent audience in this channel. I am talking about this the day after tomorrow. I am doing higher order thinking and intelligence, so these narrative sets are given to them.  How is it happening? How is caste set up? Is it good or bad? This narrative will be set. If we have to see through this and see the real picture, then there will be a very interesting channel.  Parody will also be there, political priority should also be there, power is there and I want to make my subscribers aware of the public Janardan here. If this is good, then there will be some more things in everything which we can do for the benefit of everyone for the benefit of the social society. Whatever is required, to create a consensus on it, to create brotherhood, to tell about the good things, we will do that but we will hope for your support, there will be some open batting, it is okay here and current events will be discussed. Dick letter will be given in a way that this thing is like this, explain it like this but this is actually like this and you see it in this way, a different perspective will be given that brother, this thing can also be seen like this, like there are many truths of any thing.  It may be the last thing that you will enjoy to see and experience, it will be trends, that train is very important to know about the society, be it of economy, be it of financial nature, be it of social nature or their emotional nature. Changes are taking place among the public, where are the trends going, where are the trends in Hindi, what is the trend there, is this trend right, is this trend coming on its own, many trends are being created, what is happening and this  But if things remain like this then what will happen next? We will not discuss here about right and wrong because mostly if I too will enter into this thing that what is right and wrong is too many, then there are many channels of right and wrong, every person is sitting with his own thing which is right.  And in that there is this kind of thing, here it is not like this Here we will have a little detector, okay, we will look at this thing from above, it is called a bird, we are coming to know how to understand things, what are the important things for our personal life, for the people of India, what are the important issues for the people of India, which  These are real issues. We are provoked by left and right by those issues or are not discussed. What are the compulsions? You will also see a positive. Coming here, you will not get bashed by anyone, it will be fun and this kind of content is very less in the market.  Because in most of them there is bashing where you get debates of politicians or bashing of one cup, it will not be right or wrong, it will be a different thing, this is my promise, I will keep trying, I will follow these guidelines, I have set these guidelines if  I have set my own guidelines and am very left and right in front of you. Look, it may be Creator 1920 a little bit, but if it is happening too much then you guys can check me in the comment area so that we can be together. Intellectual channels will remain at the intellectual level because intellectuals have not remained the same. It is said that intellectuals have been insulted so much in the past and they may be intellectuals too, they may have had their own agenda at some point in time that now their level has reached such a level.  Debate and Star has happened, which means you get to see and feel that big people are talking about big women. If you listen to their arguments, it is okay.  So you think, friend, what is this, what level has we reached, which level are we talking about, then we will discuss those things tomorrow and will fearlessly question, okay brother, why are you doing this in this civilized manner? Will be ok means they were bill maintain decorate i bill request people who are joining me that one decorate maintain another vice on other vice in the comment area it is not necessary to watch the content because sometimes if your emotions  I told you, don't you belong to this country? Out of 100, there are 40 of us who are clear about everything. Brother, I only know. You are definitely not like that, maybe I want to know. I want to learn everything, I want to understand this.  There are a lot of people in our country, this is the majority, only then the future of our country is very good, according to me, but we have to increase the number from 60, currently it is 468, so these 60 are my audience and this This audience of my baa has increased from 60 and the other one, the one with fixative history and the one who derives the possibilities, should reduce a lot. If he is the only one of mine, then it is not a journey. This is the new start of the channel. You guys definitely have a license.  It is definitely worth subscribing to the channel and because as soon as you see the increase in subscribers, that energy has come, it is the same and not a small baby, hand holding is required to make it walkable.  Then made it suitable for running, ok then it will remain for you guys, please share it in your friend circle and subscribe the channel and there will be great content. You guys can write in the comments what kind of issues you guys would like to raise and discuss. And ISP, I also want to give a platform to people to write their comments and discuss in a positive way. Thank you very much."

    "content": "Hello friends, why are there so many M's on M? It is a very important topic. I will try to work as a mirror for the society. If I do n't want to make it political then it is completely political but it is a test of the society. Who is this M? A sharp person, our female MP from West Bengal.  You will get to know in the video who is M and so on and M is for silence, she is silent, that and beyond that will be checked, you people will participate, a woman MP is being photographed very personally. And a campaign has been started, M for campaign has been started against them, there is a strong leader, there is no one standing in support even morally M for morally and it is looking like the downfall of the society, the political issue is that brother, take money and do something.  Ask questions, investigate them, there is no topic for discussion beyond that, they keep making allegations, these women MPs also make noises, that is par for the politics, okay.  But personal photograph, personal attack, shaming, this society seems to be enjoying it and all fingers are on your lips. Last time was when there was another Prime Minister of silence M. For you know he was also shown to be of this silent mind but now many people are M  For mind, there are many women MPs, many ministers, in fact, the biggest leader of their party, that too MMM For what, she is also watching what is happening, the politicians are watching, which side are the people on, which side will the public trend towards? Things will move forward only in that direction, that's why many people are not reacting and now this MP, who is a male MP, on whose M for MBA degree, he had faked the degree, after six months, someone else and this woman's M for  He brought friends who got some things done, who is a Supreme Court lawyer, coming to this level of personal politics, having such a low blow is a very bad thing, especially Navratri is going on where women power is worshiped, Goddess Shakti.  Is worshiped from within the society, now if we all remain silent in the society, then the last time M for Mahabharata was when Draupadi was disrobed and all the gurus were looking at us with fingers on lips as if we should do something now.  If not, then at that time Shri Krishna was ahead. Now in what form did Shri Krishna come? Who has to become? We are all the descendants of Shri Krishna. In a way, now in this modern 2023, we have to stand for this issue. This photograph business is not correct, rest of you do whatever you want to do in your politics, everyone knows about it, no one is doing that, if anyone does anything wrong then you do investigation, you do inquiry, you all have Tantra Mantra.  Do everything, do everything, but till now no one has tried to close or remove those photographs, which is very easy once someone comes from the side or the system comes to remove them, friend, all this is not right.  In fact, something else will be released, the pleasure of this is even greater, just imagine what that woman must be going through, she is a member of Parliament, she is not the type of thinking woman, she also keeps the form of a lioness, but this can happen to her. Which woman reservation bill has been done? This is empowerment of women. Which woman will come into politics when she will be shamed like this? Who would want to reveal anything personal about her or you?  All those kind of women want, by acting like this, I am telling all the servant women without a brain of their own whose mouth does not open, you are all such M'for women who do not open their mouths, who remain silent, take it, bring it.  You want to be in Parliament because you are doing this work with the one who is opening her mouth and you are posting photographs. That typical stereotype used to be shown in Bollywood is of a villain type who smokes cigars like this.  He drinks some alcohol, eats some, gets photographed around, how did he do it, it is clear from here that money has been taken for asking any question and by doing this, you put people in front of you and along with the photo, that means you get yourself judged.  They want that the public will judge India, India, India, but it will not judge the woman who is showing this photograph. This is the message and to you, the viewers, who are listening, the channel should be small and the message should be less.  The message should go that only a small needle is enough to take out the air from a big balloon. It seems that what will happen is that this is their army, this is troll army, this is paid army, this is IT cell, it is okay to threaten so and so, but they are running for paid, right?  Running for an agenda M for Morality Listen to the heart from within and do this as a country man as a country's brother This will not be tolerated This is a photo business This is a shamin' business Personal attacks  For a woman of this level, when there are sexual allegations of harassment from men, MPs and even ministers in many states, then everyone stands up to support them, unless there is something against someone.  It has not been proved, I too do not want to blame anyone, but when there you create an ecosystem of great support, there is no such thing here, there is no such sexual thing on personal life.  It is not an act of harassment, isn't it, he has made it a reality, the questions were asked last time, the questions were asked for money, that incident took place in 2005 6, 10 11 MPs, I think they were dismissed, one of them was from a big party.  Big party is B for big party, it had six five MPs, rest of the other parties also had two MPs, one by one, from all the parties. Okay, last time when this happened, if it is proved then do it.  If it was proved then it would not have been proved because if it was proved and there was actual proof there then there would have been no need to take out these photos because that would have done the job. If you were sitting with the proof then the work would have been done with that. This is an attempt to intimidate, it means. Women who are independent, bold and speak their minds will have to face this. In India, many women will have to face this. According to me, according to you, I will put it in the category of sexual harassment. Is it from or not at the work place, now that you have not done anything directly, get those photos out from somewhere, the very fact is that you are not keeping any check on it and people are not in support of your own party. She is coming because she is also seeing where the vote bank politics is going. The politician does not do anything on his own free will, he looks at the public. There are two reactions of the public, one reaction is of creating an uproar that why did you make it like this? Against and doing like this is wrong and we will not tolerate this, there can be one approach and there can be one approach, yes, this is a photo, it is with her, her men can take photos with someone, there is no issue in private space, she has  It is said that whatever is the nutritional element, it is described as such; a personal woman is sitting with someone and if you look at the photographs, she has been completely photoshopped, she looks like that, she is so big.  At a table where so many people are sitting, it is okay to selectively show photos of two people in a group, it is okay to not show them who were the other people, it is visible, it is visible, so what is the intention, a movie came out by Drishyam, there was something in that too.  It was like this, she took the photograph and the girl was being harassed, I will leak you, I will leak you and at that time it felt like, man, this is like this, what is this, what is this, so to speak like this means leaking. Degi will do it, what happened but now see in reality, when someone happens like this in reality, what kind of issue it becomes and the society is completely finger on lips in this, there is no opinion at all, do you have an opinion on this, please from any side. You write in the comment section, you will be judged, what is the public doing, the politicians are judging them, on which side your noise is being made, then it is on Twitter, it is in danger, it is in danger, so today in India, women are being judged.  Honor is in danger and will fellow Indians stand up for this? I don't want to make it political at all. What he said, what he said there, Draupadi said something to Duryodhana, it means chirharan aloud, that has become a religion, he said it laughingly.  They said this on your degree, they said something on your fake degree, you got someone's chilli or whatever got on the system, now you have found some ex-friend from somewhere, he is giving the photo and all this. Action is not being taken against it, it is clearly visible what is happening, there is one more M for even after knowing that those who talk about M are also M for mind, M for mind is one state and M for M is another state, why is there beyond that too?  Brother, why can't you say quiet, why can't you say shut up, what nonsense is happening, elections are coming, everyone understands that all these things will keep happening, wherever anyone opens his mouth, an attempt will be made to shut it somehow. Politics  i would be like this  Yes, but there is M for morality, will something be maintained in this country or everyone's conscience and all of them are asleep, no one will open their mouth like this, when Pakistan's cricket team comes to Ahmedabad, then the mouth opens big, doesn't it?  Courage comes because there are 11 people, you are 1.25 lakh people, the same courage comes, go there, take a gun, send them there and say, show me, I am showing the mirror to the country, it is important to show that when mom mentality is for mom.  Mentality today everything is going on MC M for Mob Mentality This is the mentality of the mob and the one who is rejoicing in it is enjoying, in pain he is opening his own karmic account for future I want to tell you that Navratri is going on.  This time is very good, it is the time of power, it is the time of Shakti, Durga is worshipped, other goddesses are worshiped, you all know what happens at this time, if this is happening and if no one has even a little mouth.  It is opening just because of your loyalty. If you have loyalty, then who refused to vote? They are not even talking about voting. There is little influence on voting here. Through this video or through this thing, Batamiji is being told that he has called out.  And why are the rest of the women MPs and MPs and ministers not opening their mouths? You ca n't say that whatever you want to do in the future, what is being done against women is very wrong and we condemn it.  Irrespective of party, it is being told that there is no empowerment of women, there is no power among women, if other women do not stand with other women, then with whom are you standing, then if you stand with your party, then that is that lame post.  He is right, lame posts were erected, he was picked up and thrown into the Parliament, neither did he open his mouth, nor did his conscience awaken, nor was he talked to because the ministerial post would be lost or the party would not give him the ticket next time, so how did you support him, hey support.  What  They are not supporting her, they are supporting all the women, there are many girls who are watching all this because this work is done even inside the corporate, wherever a woman is going for a job, where she says something or  It gives peace of mind, in this way there are mechanisms to silence, what message is being sent to the country that a woman and she and I are not able to understand in personal movement, what if in some old time  You  If you are in a foreign country, how did you wear some clothes, then what is wrong in that and today you are wearing those clothes as per your India, as they say, one in Rome does as the Romans do and dress up as what ever they do.  What happens is that you copy an old photo from somewhere and do some photoshop shoop on it and by doing this, what impression are you trying to show? What is the point of running a campaign by showing what is the point of M that we all need to discuss as  For the judgment of society and we must judge, they have come out that now the society will judge after this, the rest will be known after Lok Sabha elections, there can be two-three situations. According to me, these two MPs are developed, one is a woman MP and the other  Is that a male MP? Does the party give tickets to both because it is possible that the same party as the female MP may not give them due to some reason out of fear that this will reduce our votes because their leaders are 10 by 10 feet tall.  There are two sarees and slippers in the room and that image. Okay, so it could be this, it could be the other one, it could be that these men did not get the ticket, why were you doing too much, it could be like this or they could get it.  Whether you get praise or not, you have done a very good, great job, Ajit, then what the public decides will also be seen, it is possible that both of them may win, both of them may win, one may win, one may lose or both may lose, that will be seen in the judgement.  what is there but so much  It is true that if this woman does not get the ticket, neither the party has given it, then some other party will give it, and whoever this man is, I do not think that if he does not get it, then he has no future. I am also telling you one thing, India in India.  Assertive women who want to come and do something in public space are less in India. Don't suppress them like this. If they are doing something wrong and you feel it is wrong, then there is a law and procedure in the country. What is this method of suppressing that we?  Will post photo, look at this photo, look at this photo  If you look at it like this, right and below, all your women who are trolls are posting comments through them and with their hands off they are saying that we don't know that this is a normal and public posting.  So we are not doing anything, we are not doing anything, that is what happened when Draupadi was being disrobed, all those who were silent and sitting with their eyes closed were saying that it is Dushasan who is doing it, not us.  Hey, when something wrong is happening and you are watching that wrong and not doing anything, then you are also guilty, you are also guilty, I am a YouTuber, I can do only this much through this video, I have done this from my side.  Try, you people are listening and watching, you share it, 100 thousand crore things are shared, from good morning message to now, Happy Navratri, Happy Dussehra, when Happy Navratri, when you do, then Navratri.  Is it worship of women power or just superficially, to go to temples like this and worship only at other places, it is a ritual which should be done but this is the real test of real women, real women power, the whole country should sit and enjoy like this. Hey someone, please say something, please say that this thing is not going well, the rest is someone's fault, someone has done something in public space for cash for questions and all that, investigate her for that, so I think this woman MP should also speak.  Take care of him, who is speaking for him, if something wrong has been done in the public space, then do it to him, but what is this, what is this thing happening in 2023, this is the most disturbing issue for the conscience of the society.  And this is happening so quickly, you guys, don't let her go, catch hold of her, say that we have nothing to do with the party, this woman of politics, say, she could have been anything, she is an MP, she is a corporate employee, she is a government officer, she is normal.  She is an actress, whatever it may be, we have nothing to do with it, she is a woman and the women's society will stand up if you do something against her and you will do so much indecency and this indecency is being done and whoever is silent on this indecency, whatever the country wants.  Be it any wish, the biggest leader, the smallest leader, the middle leader or the general public, he is a participant in it, make your contribution, say this nonsense will not be tolerated, don't do this nonsense, the rest is up to you.  Normal, you have to play your game, play it and if nothing comes out of it, then you will take its own course. It is okay that you made the allegation, then let's prove it. If you make a false allegation, then the law tells on whose basis you made the allegation, then do that.  It is being said that this is corruption, this is that, this is how it is, this is what this has done, this is what this party has done, so if that party has to put something against them, then put it or not.  If you can, then keep quiet, but now this entry is wrong, this system itself is wrong, please do tell what are your thoughts beyond this and I am saying this with emphasis again and again, normally I do not watch videos like this one.  You definitely share it and write in the comment section how is it and I know that my subscribers and my listeners are intellectuals, I don't want sheepish trolls here, that's why I  I am posting this for my core audience so that you too can forward it to the wise because the rest of them have been collected that we will do it like this, we will do it like that, whoever is against us, then we can fall to some level.  There is a level, that level has been breached, the society has been breached, it is the responsibility of the intellectuals and intellectuals of the society, these are foolish people, of course they will not do this.  They just enjoy doing all the work, there is no expectation from them but if you are a thinking individual, a normal decent person who is living his daily routine comfortably, who comes and consumes normal content, then you have to spread this thing. twittersignin.com so please do and there are politicians who are very smart, they will give that pulse, this is how the pulse is caught, nowadays no one goes to anyone's house and asks what is generally trending.  It is trending that this woman's name has been written and before that the word Harami Harami has been used and further this woman's name has been taken and it is trending. Tell me, is this a good thing for the country?  You should not speak to anyone just because you don't like that reason or for whatever reason then directly take them on. Which entry is this, please share, thank you very much."

    "title": "Maharashtra ： A Gamechanging Politics Which Will Effect Middle Class [s-rQaxwrO9k].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, this is going to be a very awareness based video. There will be some futuristic predictions as well. A trend has also started to appear and you should understand it well. Elections are going to be held in Maharashtra in November. The wind is changing there and it is changing in BJP's favour. Yes that.  Is the breaking news and why and what is happening, there is a twist in the story, we will discuss it and see its broader picture, and yes it affects you, you are the listen, many people say that politics does not affect, does he talk about politics? Do something else, you will know how this is affecting you. I never leave any demoness behind. By doing something negative like this, I will always tell you how to take advantage of it, how to become rich, how to be happy, that too if you follow me.  If the audience is middle class or upper middle class, then you can watch it comfortably. What is happening in Maharashtra? In Maharashtra, women are being given 15% subsidy by the government in households whose annual income is less than Rs 1 lakh and judge it.  Become extremely super hit I am surprised that how are they implementing and that was the plan to do it for everyone by 31st August but that time could not be completed, opening and linking of their accounts are KYC norms and Aadhaar and along with that  If not PAN, then link it with Aadhaar and with bank account, hence elections have been postponed and this will give a twist to the story. Now the new model is that don't say Modiji, Modiji, Modiji will not even come, like Shivraj Singh  Chouhan had won Madhya Pradesh for the BJP through the Ladli Behna scheme, that thing is happening, Eknath Shande ji from BJP and Ajit Pawar 's NCP people are themselves becoming workers and politicians and only this work is being done, work is being done from morning to evening  The officers are not working or are not able to meet that many targets or whatever, I have heard somewhere, FIRs are also being filed, the entire administration has been told the DC SP, everything, Bhaiya, Maharashtra will do this, now what should happen to it and on what basis, so I am saying this  I want to tell you that whatever BJP wants to do, Rahul Gandhi  Or they say that if Rahul Gandhi is doing that thing then it is effective but Rahul Gandhi will give it back by leaking all his question papers the way he says okay you want to do this, we will do it, you want to do this  If it is there then we will do it because now they have realised that BJP is not working, now you can call it division or in a way you can say that to reach out to a particular section, then women are the best, 1.8 crore women who have been given 00 These people are going to give it per month and it will start from the beginning, a little before July, then a certain amount will be given and in that, Muslim women are also getting it, tribal women are also getting it, whichever you want, it can be less than or equal to ₹ lakh Your income is Rs 1.8 crore but I am surprised by one thing in this. We will discuss it completely. What is the benefit to you from this? Don't go away disinterested. I will make you earn money and give you more than 000 rupees who are listening to this. But I want to tell you also that you are not from Maharashtra. Even then he is  I will tell you a little later but before that I am surprised that ₹1000000 00 crore monthly pension to 8 crore women of Agniveer is a lot of fun to save because there is no vote bank politics there, there is no problem even if the security of the country is compromised.  Votes should definitely come, I am saying that those women who want to vote, keep giving it, brother, change the Agniveer scheme, do some programs there, not now, we need these young people, we need 18-19 year olds to climb the mountain, 18-19  25 year olds are a bit too young, we need 25 year olds as well, there are 26 year olds as well, a 24 year old is not an old man, a 25 year old is not old, here 72 year olds are saying that we will come in the fourth term, third one is still going on  The guarantee of the fourth term has started, he has already started telling about it and here he is doing Agniveer, so let's jump into the issue of Maharashtra, he wanted to show a little, 00 we are getting such change in the vote bank, now the India alliance is Uddhav  Thackeray to them  If we have to promise something more, then in these promises you will see that these middle classes are crazy about BJP, don't be so crazy, this is Congress only, BJP is the Congress of earlier times or the present time or it is the same thing, whatever Congress promises, it does this  They give it to me and then they say that okay you gave me so much, I will give you 3000, this is what will happen and if the woman from Maharashtra is Shayni and is intelligent, which I think she will be, then I will get her to give me 1500, that's done, very good, now I will make this promise, I will promise them this  If you give, they will give this but then the common middle class will cry because this is the tax payer's money going away, the Maharashtra government earns from Maharashtra, it will invest its money and whatever funds come from the center, then everyone's tax and GST money will be spent there, but  This is here to stand, what benefit can you get from this more than crying, let's discuss that beyond that because now this politics will remain the same and brothers and sisters, now the Direct Tax Code will come, there will be a big game in it, I feel so, beyond that if you  If you want the video then tell me and I will tell you in advance.  What is going to happen is the Direct Tax Code which will come in 2025, all the changes will happen directly, if you want then a video can be made, but you have to see how you can take advantage of it, whether you are sitting in Gurgaon, Delhi, Vishakhapatnam, Mumbai or somewhere You can listen to me, you are sitting in India, you are middle class and you think, oh I have to pay a taxi, this is happening, what is the benefit to me, what is the benefit to me, they have distributed this in Madhya Pradesh, now in Maharashtra  It has been divided, the population in Maharashtra is very high and there are 1.8 crore women, now 1.8 crore women will get 00 so what is the benefit to you, you have to do order thinking outside, see if you stop us then nothing will happen, you should refuse, you do not have that much votes there.  If 1.8 crore women are getting votes, then see how many votes of BJP and NDA can shift here and there. These three who are together were being quoted as having 8085 seats and those of IndiGo are going to be close to 190.  I think the assembly was of 288, now the survey  All these are private things, there is no stamp on them, what is being said is okay, they have got a jump of 30 seats, still the government is not being formed, BJP government is not being formed in Maharashtra even today, but elections have to be held today, elections  So it is in November, now the momentum has shifted towards them, now they are at 120-125, the majority figure is around 145, so now they are doing it at a very fast speed and they have realised it, they have realised it, so what do you think now? Brothers and sisters, it can be beneficial. If a woman gets Rs. 100 then that woman will immediately spend Rs. 100 every month on better hygiene for herself and her family which includes soap, bath soap, toothpaste, toothbrush, this is my thinking.  You can stay connected with me, it's ok, you can think of cooking oil, better anything that will improve the hygiene inside the house, shampoo, any such cleaning things, all these things normally  FMCG comes under FMCG. FMCG stands for Fast Moving Consumer Goods. So which are the companies that can benefit and what are their shares and where are they? I have a complete disclaimer here that I am not saying that whatever I say in the name of the lions,  And this theory that I am telling you, I am telling you to buy something, you have to do your due diligence, we two friends sitting in the drawing room are discussing what products Hindustan Unilever has and what are the current prices  What is the rate? Note it down. What is the rate of the dubbing today? Note it down. This video is releasing within September, in the middle of last September, so note down the dates so that you can watch it in the future as well. Note it down.  Take this and these things have started first in Madhya Pradesh, this will be a kicker but it will be more in Maharashtra because this is the first time it is being done like this. 00 Multiply it by 1.8 crores, it is 22700 crores, out of 2700 crores, around 1500 crores is in these things only.  have to go to Because women don't give much money to men, if it comes directly in their hands then out of 1500, 500 to 700 would be better, two-three soap bars, one and half shampoo, some better cooking oil for the family, rest something like this  There is a possibility of some branded stuff going into it. This is first order thinking, but what else can happen next? Whether it's copies, pencils, stationery for kids, what else can happen in education and where? Footwear can do something like this in footwear.  Are organized players coming into the market? Which are the niche companies operating in Maharashtra? What are their products? Do some hair order thinking and suggest stocks to put in the watch list. I am very intelligent to all of you who are my subscribers.  I agree because the one who is still stuck on the channel, brother, because they get distracted by my talks, if I ever speak against the BJP, then those devotees will run away, sometimes I say something against the Congress, sometimes I say something about that, sometimes about this, then they  Who  They tie me up in such a mask that I am not able to gain. My main agenda is that the person who wants to gain should stay connected in his life, the one who is so touchy that I once told him, now I am saying it myself with my eyes  I have seen the situation, I am telling you, BJP is coming back and this is the best thing for BJP, they keep hanging around till the last over, if they are scoring 17-188 runs in the last over, then it can be made like it is made in cricket, if you leave the first match  Now, if you score 55 runs in the last two overs then you cannot win but if you keep scoring 15, 16, 17 runs in each over then you have a chance because two-three big shots were hit, one man got a no ball, there was an overthrow  So you are home, okay and you have seen this in cricket and there is still a lot of time left, so Maharashtra elections, they could not do this work in Haryana because sometimes many things happen on their own and then it is discovered that it is success.  If this doesn't happen in much plan then they have  If this is discovered, a huge honor will be saved. Maharashtra was saved and Jharkhand won. Suppose Haryana was lost. There is no such chance in Jammu and Kashmir. There is no such large assembly. There is no such issue. If there is no two, the score will be broken where it is big.  The states which are financial capitals have won because losing Mumbai is the financial capital, losing hold on Mumbai is very important, Haryana is also important, but if Jharkhand and Maharashtra come, they can claim victory and then who will be the president of BJP, Modi ji.  It will be a big comeback for Amit Shah, his going to Maharashtra will weaken Modi ji, this is also a fact and if Modi ji is not seen in Maharashtra then leave aside Eknath Shinde, Devendra Farnve, these are your U.S. Surya Kumar Yadav and Virat Kohli.  And whoever it is, they will win this match somehow and that Ajit Pawar is also doing his bit because they have tested that friend, we have got the target of opening 1.8 crore accounts and giving money for linking them is a big task in itself brothers.  Sisters in their Bank Officers Ltd  Yes, banks are limited and doing so much work so quickly, I think they are working even on Saturdays and I have heard that work is going on in banks till 111 pm, so when you see how work is done during these elections in India, that is, if  If India wants to work then how much work can be done, you can see that these are the students who have not studied for the whole year, they are burning the midnight oil before the exams, all those kinds of things, so this is something which is you  No, to be monitored, to be monitored, I have told you earlier and if its direct result comes and we will see in November, it will definitely influence your direct tax code and we are now here for this politics in this, brother Congress and BJP are like this Earlier it was not shown like this, fiscal deficit, fiscal prudence, income tax, not like this and how much we had heard from the mouth of the Prime Minister that he distributes revdi, he distributes revdi, so what is this being distributed, mu phalia gajak is being distributed, if you distribute it then gajak is being distributed and he distributes it Rewadi is good for BJP people  yes it is good, it is very good, I am feeling good, politics is like this, nothing happens to anyone by becoming a moral science teacher, okay but here those who are devotees of force, enjoy it, you are also doing it, you are winning, we will win Something will happen, morality was not there in politics, is not there and will not remain there, hypocrisy was there, is there and will remain, so that's why never become their devotee, people say one thing somewhere, people say something else somewhere, they are all idiots and this is how It is but what can we see in this, we will see that if we are giving it to the women then thankfully they will not smoke beedi, will not smoke cigarette, will not eat tobacco, will not drink alcohol, that is why all the governments are discovering because I will tell you one by one that the women  I want to throw another figure, I want to tell you that the figure is one, 28 lakh crore rupees have been given to youngsters in Mudra loans in the last 10 years. But the youth has not come in favor of the government, the youth does not have any job.  If there is no business, then this means that this 28 lakh crore has gone down the drain, because what if this 28 lakh crore which is being told has been given in 10 years in Rs. 10 lakhs in the last 10 years and if the other loans which have been given  If there had been any benefit from these, then it would not have been visible in the country in terms of people being happy and that there is no distress for jobs and among the youth there is an attraction towards the government that if they gave us something, then we do n't know what was given and what benefit was derived from it.  Not only now but then we see in the government that if we give this money or a part of it to the women then votes will be cast as per their caste, religion or something as per their wish.  It will take it but you will see in homes that women will probably cast their votes separately and here, brothers and sisters, to win the election, one does not need to swing too many votes, you are trailing by four-five vote percentage, if you get four-five votes on your side then  The next one's broke four or five and that's yours For example, if the All India Alliance was getting 46 votes from the Lets and the BJP and NDA were getting 40 votes from the Lets, then if their vote bank decreased by 4 out of 6, then their vote bank went from 46 to 42.  His 40 increased to 44, so 44 means he went ahead by two. Now when you have to contest the MLA election, whether you win by 10,000 votes or 5,000 votes or 1,000 votes, on winning that MLA election, one ticket is one count. So this is what can change the game, otherwise the situation was bad, they were very tensed but now a shift has come, now let's see what stories the Indians tell and to what extent their stories are believed if the Indians come  They will say brother we will make it 3000, now they will make it 3000, then some people will become like this, so this is becoming a close finish, but in all this finish the money is of the taxpayers only.  It is the middle class that is going away, so you should not become a cheer leader here, neither be of the Congress nor of the BJP, you should call out what nonsense is happening, what nonsense is happening, what nonsense is happening  We have to say this but the feeling is that this is nonsense, we are not even being asked, so which vote bank of ours is so big because all the voters are less than this 2.5 lakh which is the maximum  Brother we will earn money by doing our hair order thinking but we twittersignin.com Congress has said up to 8500, BJP gradually by the time next election comes in BJP 00 everywhere ladli sister one and a half 2000 the matter has reached  It has happened like I told you, gradually they will take it to three, four or five Haj. The next state government will say I will give this much as old age pension because now the politicians have come to know that these freebies of electricity and water are also there.  I do n't understand how much it is  So brother, just give them the money, this is direct bribery of the voters and the voters will be bribed, the middle class will come and say, no, it should not happen like this, why should it not happen, 1500 is very necessary for that, his soap and oil will be available for him,  Hygiene will get better, he will get some money, it is a huge amount and with this some more things will grow with higher order thinking, I will tell you about that sometime in a different video or on a different real estate channel, in that even in real estate you will say from 00 to real  What difference does 1500 make in the estate? The labour which lives in that place migrates and does construction work in the houses and they are disincentivized to move out, that is why people from outside the state  They have to be brought here for work, which is very costly, whenever any work is being done here, then the local man who lives here will work because he has his own home, ecosystem, everything, so if he gives us Rs.  1 means example  I am saying this in the form of, whether you set up 100 units or it is at 100, then a person from outside will do only 110, 120, 130, why is he coming from outside, he has to live here on rent, there is no ecosystem for him, he has to come and go, if he has to leave, then he  If it will be costly then there will be migration in those things as well and it will be affected in such a way that the very poor people will probably not go to the big cities, the IT sector and all these things are coming, so all that will happen.  It is still happening but it will have an effect. I have thought of a few things, I still have some things to think about, but I want to change the way you consume things, the way you consume politics, through this video and this channel. I am, let out a bitterness and frustration in consuming politics because this has to happen, this is happening, don't cry that it should not happen, just because you are something, it is something like if you do not get reservation, then there should not be reservation, this is too much This is lower order thinking, we know that if you do n't get reservation then there should not be reservation and if you get reservation then there should be reservation, this is a very normal thing, what is beyond this that yes there will be reservation, then there will be videos on that too on caste  The counting of votes is also due, the videos are also coming very quickly, but the things that are happening, the development that is taking place and what is being seen, I am telling you about those things, so this analysis is very important, take a look at the stock market that money  In whose hands is it going, from his hand to whose hands will the money go because ultimately it is not the case that the money will remain in the pocket, even if it remains in the pocket, it will remain in the account, if it remains in the account, it will remain in the bank, according to the ratio of cash in the bank  The ratio which is there gets better because the money with the bank is now in the bank and the cost of funds of the bank gets reduced, money is coming from anywhere, the bank itself is giving the money, money is coming within the bank itself  The government is giving it, the net interest margin will increase, the cost of funds will increase, so what is that?  Yes, it is necessarily not a very bad thing, so I hope you guys will like this and share it and tell me how you liked the video and if you have not subscribed to the channel then subscribe, thank you very much."

    "title": "Mein Rang Sharbaton Ka ｜ Tu Meethe Ghat Ka Paani [xNU_x7XB_rw].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, it is a very amazing and interesting topic. Try to enjoy. We will talk about the ideology of the topper student. This will be my basic topic. In future, you will get more topics on ideology and whatever opposition there is and the ruling party and the opposition.  There will be detailed videos on the models of both, today there is an introduction and a comparison, I will separate what is happening in the introduction, what am I seeing as a commentator, what am I seeing?  I want to tell you that there was a song in some movie of Shahid Kapoor, ' Main Rang Sharbaton Ka Tu Meethe Ghat Ka Paani Mujh Mein Ghol De To Yaar Baat Ban Jaani', this is the song of the topper student's party, Bhaiya, you come, dissolve yourself in me.  Two, I am the color of sherbet, I will remain sherbet, your identity should dissolve, your identity should end, here I would like you guys like this, what an analogy.  Guruji, are you from Gurugram, do you come with an example? To make the original understand clearly, this is the problem of many people and those who have this problem are in a lot of trouble because brother, if they have to join here, they will have to lose their existence, then the fan base which is a devotee would say.  Those whose self-identity is not that big an issue in life because many people do not identify themselves, some do it by position, some do it by state, some do it by status.  It does this through religion, psychology is the identity of all of us. If you understand, even if we go to the Vedas, we will go to the old religion, we will go to all of them, in all those things, the identity of a human being is very very very big thing, but for many people, when they go to that political place,  If they come to India, they are very flexible, so the biggest problem here is that those people who do not have any identity of their own and if they have identity, they just come and mix, then as many opponents as they can.  There are also those who come here and leave them just like that, they don't leave them anywhere, in the same way, they get destroyed like the family members of a Chief Minister from Haryana who used to create a lot of noise in the other party, where they were originally from, Haryana, became the Chief Minister. Ok, now he has gone to their party, he doesn't open his mouth, he used to open his mouth a lot in that party, he did n't do this to me, he did n't do that here, he doesn't open his mouth here, he did n't give any MP ticket, he is from Hisar.  He is not opening his mouth, son, they were saying to him that they will make him a minister, if no one is made a minister then they will cut him to size and they will come and say, brother, come on, get to work, get to work, this is family, this is it, let's go, whatever.  Now it is working, this is a strength and it can also be a weakness when I will make a video on it in detail later but this was my teaser video that brother, this is a datum that here one footage of a movie will be consumed by only one person like  Earlier we used to see in the media that Akshay Kumar was unknown, he used to complain about cutting the roles and the footage of the fellow actors, many people used to get angry and we heard this and saw that brother, he took his roles for himself.  In doing this, if we cut out the roles of the rest, then what we call is who will consume the most footage in any movie, so here whatever is that of the topper student, there it is only this, that is, think of it, you can compare them, Kapil Dev.  that that  In the 175 innings against Zimbabwe, all the zero pay outs were made, by doing this one by one and the rest of the people also sat comfortably, I am saying that this is very wrong, it is okay to put so much load on one person, so you can give them the glory.  You can give it later also. It doesn't seem that you are working hard. It does n't seem that you are working hard. One person seems to be fully engaged. He is a topper student. He is the topper of the party. He is fully engaged but the rest of the people are brothers.  Some are not doing like this, it doesn't seem like this and the biggest problem is that I told you that they are doing colors of sherbets. Now star campaigners have been announced in UP and in other places, the name of the mother and son is not there, let alone the ticket of the son. Now tell me who am I talking about, all these GK tests will continue, mother has got the ticket but there was a rally just now where her son was there, so he did not go there because he cannot go, his name is not there.  These people who take their head Those who will bow down and show their identity will survive, like there was a leader, the woman leader Gadawar of Rajasthan, her name was cut off somewhere, it is not there anywhere, the names of the MPs whose names were also cut off, but they bowed their heads like this and were straight forward.  If we are moving then the water of Meethe Ghat which is ready to be created will work. Now it has to be seen who suits whom it suits to become the water of Meethe Ghat in life. Recently, a leader of Haryana attended his homecoming original party.  That's why perhaps they did not want to get into the colors of the sherbets or to become the water of the sweet ghat. I call such people a bottomless pot, okay, and I do n't have much respect for these people, okay, many. What happens every now and then is that people look at me in my community cast or beyond and say, 'Hey, you are here, we are all one', we should become like this, no, it is not like this, we should all become one, no, why should we become one, it means the country. Meaning, how can you mix more cast for parties, you will not be able to tell me till the election day, my viewer, where my vote is going, you will not be able to catch me on Idol ji, I will see my ko in the comment section now, you are this caste.  Those who belong to the caste are the same caste and that difference of J and J is ours. Okay, so why are we against them brother, why I am not a farmer brother, no you are not a farmer, they are not like that, I should gather and separate because look at whom.  Where there is a problem, he has a problem there. How will everyone become one by force? You see what is happening in UP, he is eating the bread and butter of an old Prime Minister from two seats, right, Pradhan, who was his grandfather, says this.  Familyism is real familyism or real familyism is not that your father was something, your grandfather was something then you too have not reached the real family or that when you have got nothing to offer other than their name and want to eat their bread only.  You want to hang on them, this is the real familism that brother, you want to eat bread by taking the name of Chaudhary Charan Singh, how long will you eat, how many years have passed, friend, your father has become mean by eating, now your number brother, it does not work like this, it does not work like this.  We will have to rise above the caste system, but the same thing is that if you rise above the caste system, then you become the water of the sweet ghat, then its identity is not that much, the color of the sherbet's identity is that I am this one, this one is of Khus.  I am sherbet, am I a Haja wala or am I an everyday person, it has its identity separately because the color is in it, it will dissolve, it will become that, so this is the paradox of many people that whether we can do it without losing our identity or not.  You can have an independent opinion while taking your own stand. Why should I be completely independent just because I come from a caste? I come from a province. Why should I forcefully be against someone?  Because you are against him, whatever problem you have with him may not be mine because the reason is that what I am trying to say is that there is a class difference also which I am trying to bring, I am more, my more loyalties are towards  My class and this will also come out like I want to tell you, let's talk about religion also, a little bit is okay, in a positive way let's talk about Hindu Muslim also. What I want to tell is positive, let me tell you, there is a Hindu vegetable seller who sells vegetables and there is also a Muslim vegetable seller and I take two actors, I am top Salman Khan and Akshay Kumar. Now I want to ask as a Guruji with lot.  Of affection and love and logic that this Hindu vegetable seller will identify more with Akshay Kumar and Salman Khan will identify more with that Muslim vegetable seller to tell the people that brother, these things will also happen now.  There will be a lot of discussion about all these things that they can no longer be done forcefully, there will be talk of class too, brother, the rich is the rich, the poor is the poor, or the middle class is confused, which is my core audience, this video is for you only.  I have talked about the above, did you understand that the color of the sherbets and the water of the sweet ghat are different, this ghat is below, that is of poverty, there everyone has their own system for the rich.  own  This is a different system, you have to understand this because any person who comes anywhere will tell you that you get into this one's sherbet, you get into this one's sherbet, you get into this one's sherbet, we are not the water of this ghat.  We are the water of this ghat, we all get immersed in this one. This is what I am trying to put in. How beautifully I am making identity politics and how beautifully I am making politics a base first. Beyond this, there will be more videos. Those who are enjoying will come, subscribe the channel, increase some subscribers, I want to bring positivity, there is a lot of negativity, some nonsense is happening on every channel, some nonsense is happening on social media and you know the rest of Godi media. How is the situation? Who will win and who will win? We know who will win and who will lose. First of all, let us be set in our mind that what do I want, brother, we will be united everywhere, we will be united here. I would also like to ask a question on whether we should be united or whether it is good to be united and being united is always against someone, how are we other wise, how are we other wise, you tell me, do you have a family, are you parents?  These are children, these are your family, but if someone from outside does something, who may be an aggressor, if you consider another country as your family, then you become one. Otherwise, how can you be united in everything? If father is doing something wrong, then we are one.  Mother, mother and father, there should never be a fight in life because your family is one, there should never be a fight between you and father, why are you one, why does n't it happen, no, no, even among the parents, there is a favorite child and Even among children, there is a favorite parent. I am talking about him so closely. If I talk about the family, where there are uncles and aunts, there are three or four brothers and sisters, their children are the grandfather, grandfather's favorite grandson is the grandfather.  If the favorite washes, then it will be a different system, this is how it is within the family, now how can everyone become one when we are a family due to blood relations, we are not able to unite, then why is someone else forcefully uniting us on something, why is this so?  We are doing one thing, we are living comfortably in our family, if ever something good happens in the country of India, then we countrymen are all one, we are all one, then all the water of the sweet ghat of colors and sherbets has come and we will make the same for it and we should do it.  but the rest of the time  Why are you sitting like this brother, the rest of the time then why can't we live in the country the way we live in the family? Today Papa is looking good, Papa has done this, today Papa is looking bad and then he is looking good, same with the child.  It happens that today I have misbehaved with you, today I am undoing you, I am happy with you, where is my child, it doesn't matter where he will go, it is natural that he lives in me, or have we become fools that only brothers will listen to mother, now mother has the vote, father has the vote. Never have a vote, it belongs to someone else, take it out, give all the money to the father, then put it in your name and do other work, this is not how life is lived, there is conflict between each other, there is conflict between husband and wife, mother-in-law is between father-in-law. It means that the sister-in-law goes along with the mother-in-law, it's okay, it happens everywhere, brother also, something happens, you know, when everyone accepts it and the color of the sherbets and one thing, they do n't even enter into the sherbets, even into an identity. No  Entering, everyone's name is the same, cast is the same, surname is the same, Leene is the same, even then we can agree to disagree, then write this English line, we should all agree to disagree, that I say bha, it is okay, you say, it is okay, I  Today I say it's okay, tomorrow I say it's okay because it 's a democracy, the country is free, opinion can change, so why is there a need to be so sad about it? It's okay without panta. Someone will say Lotte, I too will say Ko B, okay, so much, whatever this is from inside, because no matter how little I talk, you have been sold, hey, to how many people will one person be sold, I will be sold out to everyone, did the topper student say?  He also bought me because today in the video I said something against him, when I said something against him, he bought me and I mean, I am a lion in the lion market, every day I am getting options trading, today you are sold here, today you are here. A man has been sold, meaning he belongs to one side, he is sold, he is ready to be sold every day, in his break, in his breakfast, in his lunch, in his dinner, today I released his video like this, Oh brother, just because you don't think like this, just because there are no independent thinkers around you.  They are taken somewhere like sheep and goats. We are not animals, we are human children, we have got human body. I will make very good videos on identity politics and will also talk about caste and creed.  I will do it in a positive way and no one will get hurt because from inside, when you don't have the intention to hurt, even words cannot hurt, in the same way I am not saying that no one will get hurt even by mistake. This is coming because there is positivity at the thought process level. My aim is to change the way Indians and we Indians think because these politicians do not give us a chance to think, they always keep saying something or the other.  Go, brothers and sisters, do this, we will give this, we will give that, this will happen, that will happen, we do not allow the general public to talk to each other, that through this video and this my channel, it will give solace to many people.  It is happening because it is the time of politics, do not consume it without discussing it, not because it is in your face. When you are going out in the car, you can see the photo of the leader standing there, posters are visible everywhere, you are going on social media.  Are you politicized?  Democracy is happening brother, there is a lot of it in our country, I mean it is everywhere, discussions are happening everywhere in small cities and it is getting bigger in big cities, still let's go on, people might be busy in the hustle and bustle of money.  It may be decreasing but this is the dance of democracy, we have to participate in it every day, as long as it is about elections, we will participate in a positive way. How did you guys like the video? Please share. Thank you very much. Do subscribe to Much Channel, in this I will explain what was the meaning of this video. The meaning of this video was to tell that identity is important and only by dissolving your identity, I can somehow control you, if you are full of identity in yourself.  If you live in me, then I don't need you. If I live this idol of this topper student's party, brother, when you come, you leave, you dissolve, you dissolve, nothing is yours.  Then don't cry, I told you in advance that he will come and he came and sat in such a yava because I was watching it, if you look at it like this, they take out positivity from it, many people call them corrupt people, they have taken away, look at everything.  Batting can be done in a different way every day, like chess can be played from this side also. On one side, these topper students are taking corrupt people into their party. I am thinking that they  By taking the corrupt, they are destroying their identity and not leaving them anywhere. Now they are corrupt and they will suffer more if they take these corrupt people and give them power and make them ministers and then people like us will come and speak in our name because right now.  Because I can also give you the benefit of doubt, I do n't know, maybe some great man is playing a great game, we don't know, that's why when I come on video every day and speak, I say that my vote is not decided yet.  What has happened is that you have done it so quickly, then it is your choice, we are analyzing every day, seeing what is happening every day, because it is a possibility, because I have just seen, I have seen in ticket distribution and other things, but they have brought something special like this. Now that man is not able to understand. The old CM has been caught by the other party and has given him nothing like this. No, it is not seen that he is giving anything in the future. His mouth is also such that he is in pain.  then go back  If he is going back, then what is the credibility of those politicians? Sometimes here today, sometimes here again, this and this famous came Ram Gaya Ram, it started from Haryana, it was started by the people of Haryana or Ram Gaya Ram, nowadays we know this very much.  It is called this but it was originally here in 1960. Okay, those who sometimes used to sit here and sometimes used to sit there, so we also have to keep an eye on the politicians who are going from here to there, from here to there, irrespective of party.  If you feel that he wants to keep his power at any cost, then we do not vote for this person. Now brother, if you belong to this party, then you have become just too bad. My ideology is against my ideology. Show a lot of principle, a little, then see, if you are in power, I am an independent observer and commentator, then my commentary can change depending on this, but if you are in a public, then how will your ideas live?  There can be a change on daily basis, we can see the situation with our own eyes, those who see it can say that this batsman hit a very good six, brother, he bowled well, brother, he took a good catch, brother, his fielding was useless, brother, he made a good run out.  I am telling you, but how come the players are not allowing me to bat in the team every day, I am going to this team, I am going to this, then you will not have credibility, that is, you can be bought and sold so easily, that is the Message I hope you enjoyed this video, you may find these things a little abstract but it will greatly improve your understanding of politics by opening your notes, what is happening, please share, like, thank you very much."

    "title": "Menstruation Period Paid Leave Issue ｜ Full  Clariry Given [UQD0XI41jCs].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, recently in a Parliament, a lot of things are happening in the Parliament, but I spend some five-six days and a topic was raised, there was a lot of noise and discussion, after that I make videos so that  Mostly everyone has said what they had to say, after that I want to give clarity. This topic will be about women's issue of paid leave at the time of menstruation. Manoj ji in Parliament. Parliament in Parliament.  He had raised it, Shashi Tharoor ji had also raised it, Smriti ji is our minister in it, her statement also came due to which that ruckus and all that happened, she basically said in English that as I would also like to quote that as a menstruating woman menstruation and  Menstrual cycle is not a handicap, it is a natural part of woman's life journey and there is no need for all this holiday butti, so we should not forget this thing.  We will analyze the statement, this reaction is said, should there be a holiday, should it not happen, what should happen, will give clarity beyond this. Normally, from what I observed, all the reactions that are coming are coming from a feminist point of view, one point or the other.  They are coming from the off view that friend, you will take everything, you have taken it everywhere because this is Section 498, there are so many boys from Section 498 whose marriages  No, it seems like the girl got something somewhere. If the woman asked for something, then brother, we have been robbed. Sara will take our jobs, she will take away all the parents' money. Girls are all robbers, robbers, robbers, robber girls, there are many people with that approach.  People with this mentality are fine, even if they are 5 out of 10, there are many of them out there even if they are 5 out of 10. Well, they are those people, we will not mention them. If you too have this kind of thinking, then please do not watch the video. That is one view point, what happens many times is quite grey, the discussion is quite complex, there will be thinking that brother, if you give leave to women, then from where will we give it from our pocket, how will we give it and this will be a loss for them, there are many who  Ladies are girls who have gone a little ahead in business. Which maternal uncle is she or is she someone? She wrote that after so many days, women have got equality. If we ask for such things, then there will be no equality. Today I am very  I am going to tell one thing of high level to women as well as men because women do not exist in isolation, every woman is the daughter of some man, can be a wife, can be a mother and can also be a sister.  If these are relationships, then the first thing is that I am not giving any verdict that I am for the motion. This is not a school debate. Dhruv Rathi ji took something from Wikipedia and started a school debate.  M for the motion and  If this should happen, then Guruji, tell me quickly, should it happen or should it not happen, listen, it should happen, it should not happen, it is not even being discussed, right now this discussion is layered, what can happen, where is it coming from, what is the problem.  The topic is being discussed beyond that, so it will be fun only if you understand the thing carefully. If you are a woman then you have to watch it completely and if you are a man then you have to watch it 100% because I would like to explain this thing to you.  what i want to explain And some strong words will also be spoken which are not normally politically correct but what votes do we have to take and I don't need more likes here nor do I need more subscribers to add here, for that I have many other channels only.  This channel was created so that anyone who has time, money and intelligence can easily enjoy the membership on this channel because if any of the three things are missing then you will not be able to relate.  And yes money is also one of them because if you listen from the point of view of lack then your reaction will be different. Let's discuss further here that I am going to make a statement like this one made by Minister Sahiba, okay.  Because what is their logic in saying that as a menstruating woman, it means that they have said that friend, we are menstruating cycle people, who are you to tell us something, make us understand or make you do it? Who are you, what will you tell us, okay, we are women, this statement has done a lot of damage to women Pan India, this is what I want to say, the second thing I want to say is this, you have won three elections, the match is clear cut, India vs Sri Lanka type is going to happen next.  Why are you hitting your own foot with an ax? Why are you talking so arrogantly by talking like this? Hey, keep calm, you could have said just one line - Government of India. The proposal is not under.  Consideration how ever if there is something then we may consider it, it should not be so much and I Menstruation Hey you tell me, a few days ago there was a scheme in Haryana when this open defecation free drive was going on in India for many years.  First, the house where toilet will not go, Lado will not get married, Lado will not get married, Lado is considered the daughter, the girl, child, girl means woman.  Will Not Get Married Jahan Toilet Nahi Nahi became a super hit at that time Aake Bolte As a woman who goes into the gate I am telling it should not be there because it is a fall dose Hey brother, you being a woman, I am making the same statement for us This statement has been heard in the country and we agree with it anyway but no one speaks like this. In our country, women are the biggest enemy of women. They are special, no women and no one is conscious.  I am saying that I do not take drugs, do not even drink tea. No woman should reach a position or become more powerful because after going there, she gets pressured to think from a man's point of view to become a man.  What has happened is that only men have done it, so women get the power which a mother-in-law gets inside the house and see what the mother-in-law does to the daughter-in-law, because the mother-in-law was also a daughter-in-law, some are getting relations because the mother-in-law is also there.  Kabhi bahu thi hai serial ek aata  There was a woman in that too, because the mother-in-law was also the daughter-in-law, there was a woman, the practice of Sati, Raja Ram Mohan Roy, he was not a man, at that time the minister said, I am the lady, I am willing to die, what is your custom, what do you men like, man? Brother, woman does it, then I told that widow remarriage is the enemy. Vidyasagar ji, now I am not going to give knowledge by doing Wikipedia here, you have given one or two examples in mind which is as much as my GK. Come, I told you because in proving the point here, there is no point in taking out the side of something written like this, rice is cooked, there are raw, after eating a little, you can know all the good things, Lalu Prasad Yadav ji, you know what you can see and hear.  How is the calculation, brothers and sisters, in Bihar, in 90, they have given two days leave, if you are a woman in Bihar Government, then you get two days leave, not from today, it should be clapped from 30 years ago. Now they would say that if the leaders speak in the Parliament, then it is like a Church or Parliament. The elders of this country are the elders. If this country is a family then just like in a family, what the head of the family or the elders say makes a difference in the family in the same way.  What the leaders of this country say makes a lot of difference. Another dialogue was shot senselessly many years ago by a male politician from Uttar Pradesh. Now test who hit whom and whom. They are boys and boys make mistakes.  There was an uproar, right, there was an uproar at that time also that what nonsense he is saying, because you are a boy and you are excusing them, then how many men will become so bossy with this dialogue. Empowered to [ __ ] with you.  Minister Minister Hai Bola Sh Lady There Is No Handicap Because You Have To Understand The Menstrual Cycle Is Different For All  For some, it is a handicap. For some, it is not. For some, it is something. Look, for the women who come from the middle class, at least a little bit, and I will go to the very end by analyzing why this was done, how it was done and you  The pain inside will reach through my words and when it reaches you will know the truth because I have defined the audience very well - middle class with thought process, people with little money. Intellectual audience, she will get pain, that discussion is taking place, women have just won the election, women power, women empowerment are such nice words, then when Ujjwala scheme goes, you give cylinders, then women are getting benefited, only women are getting benefited, then women are getting benefited. You feel good by doing it because by directly putting 1250 votes in Lali Bahana Scheme, you can win the election because only the poor woman will be entertained by the politician and the middle class woman.  No one will do this, this is a pain because there is no vote bank. After 15 years from now, as poor as these people will be in the lower middle class and when these women ask, these same parties will be ready to give this thing also because vote bank is all the votes.  You are understanding that this is the politics of the bank and there is no discussion beyond this completely. Now don't be so hasty that you should meet, you should not meet, it will be in five days, it will be in three days, someone will say this, he will do this, it will not happen, how will it happen? Don't do it like this, the question is that just as you have denied who men are, it is the men who raise any issue of women who have said that it is men who are running the world. Is there any misunderstanding about women that they are running the world?  Can you tell me, there is no handicap between men and women. When there is a competition in sports in the Olympics, it is one and the other, isn't it? In Dialogue Dangal, our girl is girl, I am not less.  I would say, it is not less, not more, it is different, why don't girls fight with boys in wrestling, why is it different, even among men, women also have different categories, right 57 kg, this weight, that weight, heavy weight, 69 kg. Everyone has different categories so that there is level playing and competition. Inside the job, it is the same arena. Is it a job for girls or for boys? Everything is the same there and it is not the same, you know here this is a very deep video on a different channel or after this if you want the explanation of it and want it to be bigger then that too can become there are many men who enjoy a lot come let's fight yes  Yes, be equal, those women who take their rights, sit peacefully and do the job properly, they take care of all the rest, women have won in 12th, this time again breaking news comes every time. that may june  Board results are declared in 10th and 12th, where do these girls of 10th and 12th disappear in 10 years? The winners are not seen anywhere in the workforce. There is a workforce of 19-20 in which the lower class labor class is made class. This class has more jobs in it.  She is a woman and is not even middle class, even at 8-10. Where has that woman gone who was an intelligent woman, used to get higher marks in competitions and was further ahead in studies?  Where did she go because somewhere she was taught that it is okay to be a man among men, still it is okay here, many interviews of men have been taken, many channels have taken many, I have heard and seen, men are asked, a man says, or I know.  No, maybe there is some problem, you should get it, someone says that man, I don't know a man, a man is not the enemy as much as a woman, the boss is the worst boss for a female, because the one who has reached there is like a mother-in-law, like a mother-in-law, sometimes a mother-in-law  Woman  Ko yay, a new daughter-in-law will not sensitize her husband or her son or her sons after coming of age, that these are the problems, don't be harsh, honor, don't be so demanding on me, you had done such and such things to me so many years ago.  Now this will not happen with my daughter-in-law in our house. She says that I had committed an offense and also justifies it by saying that it was a sacrifice, it was a sanskar, she will tell any story.  The same happens to a woman who reaches a position of power. We too did it after having children. Yes, we have to leave like this. No, we have to do it like this. No, I have to come during periods also. No, we have to suffer like this.  I had also done this, you will also do it. In fact, she becomes a more spoken person and those who are clever people in the organization too, I will tell you a secret, this smart man is not the organization.  They are making it not bad, they put women in front in such a way that women are speaking against women, why are we trapped by speaking like this because it is a man who will speak this dialogue, if a man had said this then oh ho ho.  Yes, you know what was supposed to happen, but if the woman spoke, many people would ask about it. The woman said this, now the men will ask, nothing happens, you do drama, who knows, now they say that she is a mother-in-law.  who is elderly and does not have periods and  There is a lot going on right now, there is some fight, there is a quarrel, there is some irritation, hey Munna, this is us, we are ours, had we ever seen you lying like this, had we ever seen you lying like this, now he remembers Munna, he did not know because he never discussed periods. Ask your mother what is PMS but she does not remember that her mother used to be irritable. He cannot relate with periods. He feels that his grandmother used to bother him or his father used to bother him or  Aunt used to trouble mom, she was poor, mom used to do all the work, but mom was like this and look at mom's condition, what is happening now, the video you are listening to in your family 55 Look at any woman aged above 60 years, look at the condition of her body, what is happening to her, if she used to do it, then look at her condition, what is happening to her, what diseases she is suffering from, people say.  It is said that at least something happens during periods, some medicines can help, hey, if the work can be done by rest, then what is the need to take medicines, that is, bring so much passion, bring medicines, I will also talk about some solutions, first of all I will  I am talking about emotions, as the country rises above poverty, such issues come up, it is very important to discuss these issues, it is showing that India is progressing brother, you are in trillion dollars.  If you are going towards economy, then you will have to discuss whether it is trillion or trillion, not half a billion, there is poverty to be discussed, only when you get some money will you talk about comfort, not yes, you could have discussed something at home.  Let us talk about women. I have to ask that women are capable of doing everything. I agree that women are also flying fighter planes in our country, so capability wise it is a very good thing.  If a woman can fly a fighter plane, then what does it mean, there is no issue in physicality, but does she fly a fighter plane during her periods? My question is, as far as I know, you do not fly a fighter plane during your periods. There seems to be no need to fly and two.  So what if you don't waste four-five days, you can do training on that time, you can attend lectures, you can study, you can do some paper work, you can do anything else, then you can do the same.  Like women, when their period comes, the time comes, the first day and the second day are a unknown fact. No matter how many women say that nothing happens to me, they also have irritation on the first day, they feel a little strange. And for many, it stays for all five days, for many it stays for all four days, for many it is for various degrees, first of all, the women in the survey are lady security guards and maids from the lower class.  She does jobs like cleaning, broom etc. She was asked whether she had any high pretensions or not, whether she was of middle class or not, we are no less than anyone, we will do everything, we will defeat even men everywhere. It is practical, yes, it is a problem, yes, if you get some leave, then it is good, now many jobs are work from home, yes, they are running on the budget model, so if you are in that kind of job.  And in many companies it is like this, so what about if at that time, if you work from your home, I have not even talked about leave, now let's not talk about paid leave and that is the first option, so first of all this should be recognized because many women.  So there is shame in this thing that if we take paid leave, it means we are telling the office that I am on my period. There is shame in that. Where does this shame come from within women? Women of one generation, I have heard it in the ears of other women. In my consultation, I have heard everywhere in my experience that I am a social observer, a social scientist and the observations I bring are not discussed anywhere on social media and are not made anywhere because they are written in big terms in English. Who tells by giving an example? Who tells that what a mother-in-law says to a daughter-in-law or a mother to a daughter, that these underwear and vests are drying, they should not be visible, there is nothing on them.  And put the cloth and dry it. Have you heard that? Are you that woman? Why are we so careless in drying our bra and panty? What are we thinking that what will happen if the bra sees the panty? Will he steal something?  And some thoughts will come in his mind, why is he so shy about these things, because even the old ladies can say, hey, why do you wear these pads, use only cloth, why are you wasting money, these pads are made by man.  someone has This woman did not make left to woman woman, it is also like this, call it an Indian woman, she poor woman does not even open her mouth, for her, a man has to stand up every time, be it a son, a husband, a father or even a wrestler in a dance.  It was the father who made it, but the mother didn't make it so that if I come and wrestle, all the work is being done by men, that is why men are discussing this today and only men have to discuss it, women will come and mother-in-law will say anything.  Like, the behavior is like mother-in-law, because once mother-in-law was also daughter-in-law, what is the need, so we put clothes, a generation of women put clothes, now they say, Minister Sahiba says that it is a natural process, Madam Sahiba, Minister Sahiba, it is a natural process.  Pregnancy and delivery are also natural, that too is unnatural, then why do you give six months leave, then only the government gives it, earlier it used to give three months leave, then the government gives it.  He said, no, the work is not done in three, we will have to do six, but there are so many women, women are officers, there are women in the government too, wherever they are, they come with one month old child and do their duty, the woman who does not see her child.  She is not worthy of anything, she is not worthy of any other work, but this is the way it has been created in the society. A woman can become the Prime Minister whether she wants to or what post above that is right or she becomes something else. She will be afraid of doing something for women. This Something Like If the Minister of Minority Affairs is made by a person from minority, he also feels that he doesn't know what will people say to me if he does something. If a person from minority is made the minister from majority, then perhaps he might do more. This is something wrong with psychology, if a woman is the boss and  She has shown sensitivity towards women by saying that if someone fixes the bathroom or if someone shows some leniency or adjustment for them from time to time then it will be shown that she is  Less she is like less of a boss, less she has to become a man, everyone is roaming around with manly energy, do n't know, people want to roam around in the society with this muscular energy, women too, this femininity has made this world worth living in. If left to  Main na to sab ud jaaye, she is the balancing force of the world, woman is Venus, women should not feel ashamed in saying what they want because what is productivity anyway, you want their body. In those times, you can check with anyone, no matter how much you say, to what extent you have to be equal, no matter who is in your company, no matter where you go in this corporate, all those men are women according to the sensitivity of their body. You must have seen women not according to husband and wife, you, he, she is doing 24, she is saying do 26, there are fights in the house, but at home, you have more rights, why do women have to fall, see in the offices. What  A woman who is having periods, she has issues of temperature, she has issues of all these things, it is okay, but what is this sensitivity in men? Still there is doubt in men that I do n't know, if I tell you, my love will be scattered or I don't know, maybe.  It happens that someone asks his wife if something happens, you guys, yes, there is pain, some say it is less, some say it is more, but if a woman comes into it, she says.  Give, as I have already told you by taking an example, mother, now you tell me, in pregnancy, many people have a very smooth pregnancy and many have already given it in a trimmer, vomiting is not digesting the food, it is like this, someone's placenta has become low.  I have as much knowledge about all these things as I have. Will you say, are you just me? I am one of the top marital consultants of India. I have as much actual pain and all these things.  I know, very few normal men would know that if someone himself is a doctor then it is a different thing but I am bringing a 360 degree perspective. Look at the family of any two women, no two pregnancies are the same, even one woman who is listening to me.  And if you are a man and have two children, ask your wife. No two pregnancies of a woman are the same. In the first one, I felt like eating something. In the first one, nausea used to come in the morning and in the other, in the evening. Some people have problems in the second trimaker, some people have the same problem, now some mother-in-law should tell her son, son, nothing is happening, I have given six traffic jams, nothing has happened to us, so in doing this, see who is throwing tantrums.  And the son will also feel that mother is saying the right thing or our five-six were like this or theirs were like this, so what do these people say, she is throwing tantrums, hey, times have changed, bodies have changed, everything is old.  I don't know what kind of work men used to do after climbing the kitchen table, what happens to the men of today, when men are not able to do the work which earlier men used to do, then women have become that much, there is a difference in the food habits, which is in the mind. Everyone knows that energy is wasted in brain work. Earlier people did not eat so much, it used to be like this, I had the strength to eat, I ate the dough, I ate this, I ate ghee, I ate this, nowadays I don't eat, I don't even regret it.  Or that is not a trend, then it is too much to be touchy, whatever you have to say, do it, then the government in the society is the mother father, the government is the mother father, when the government says something then everyone listens. How many years ago has any Prime Minister ever said this?  It was said that now we don't want to eat this food, there is a fight going on in the country, in 65, the country followed, someone had just said that if you bang the plate then the public will follow everything and should do it, I am never making fun, you are our leader.  You will say, bang the plate, you will bang the plate, you will say, close the doors, bang, whatever you say, you will do it, but look at what you are saying, you will be made a judge of it later, but the country has given you a lot of power that what you say in the Parliament, that every person.  One hears when it is said in Parliament, when a law is made that if a cab driver in Bangalore has ever done something wrong to a woman, which can be a very wrong thing, then the rules for women are changed. For security, the last drop will not be a woman, there has to be some other man and something else, the government has changed the rules. This happened with a journalist inside Delhi, so she was packing up at 3:00 and was leaving at night.  And then rules came out that women should not do it before they become blind, not do it here, do not do it there, this causes irritation, those who are running the administration, but gradually they  Processes become systems, people become used to it and that productivity comes out. There are many such things where like if you have a creative field or journalism, then in journalism you have to create something but your periods are going on. It is happening in your mind and in the body, just like I am, if I were coughing for the last one week, now I feel like making a video, but if I am coughing, what should I do, I am not able to make sense.  I will cough once or twice. Videos are made for 25-30 minutes. I cough the whole time. Only the special audience will say, Guruji, take some rest. There is no need to make it daily. It is just humanity, nothing else. Now that is a natural process for the lady. We all know that on the first day of every month, ask your mother, ask your sister, ask her, ask your wife or ask a friend, whatever these days everyone talks about and you should ask.  Boys have to ask, if you are a man, you have to ask a woman and talk about periods, is it difficult, is there irritability, is there any problem, are there cramps, how does the mind feel, those who are married,  Do you know that PMS is also a thing, brother, from the day this period starts, the irritability factor is going on a lot, this too, now what about giving leave for this too? I have not yet said, give paid leaves everywhere, I have not said, I am saying that first acknowledge the leave due on this day, whether in government or private, it has become difficult to get one's rights. Have to tell that mother will be ill, this has happened, this has happened, if you don't get the same, then I am saying that let's talk about paid leave later, we will see from company to company, but at least for unpaid leave.  There should not be any question that brother does not give you that annual leave of yours, there may be some adjustment process in it, the procedure may be that there were 20 days, 30 days, 40 days in a year, some were eggs, some were not, then adjustment in it has to be done for the woman.  Leave it above that there is no cut in it, there is no cut in it, at least give provision to the one who doesn't want to take it, the one who doesn't have it will not take it, the one who has it will take it, don't do the tree now, don't do the tree now  But at least discuss this thing. Right now there was a woman journalist. I was watching her. She was saying that I have so many periods, it is so difficult. She was saying that I have to take injections, so I get admitted. Two days are over, this is a big issue and these women are talented, you tell me who needs this support and the one who is a top heroine, take any one, she is a top heroine, now she has to do some good energetic dance and that dance will cost Rs 50 crores. 30 crores to shoot, so will the shooting happen only when her periods are going on or can it be later because during your periods you are low on energy, in old times it was always told in our place that when they come  So there is no need for a woman to go to the kitchen, there is no need to go to the temple, people took it to do with hygiene that you are not allowing her to enter, oh brother, it was to do with the fact that your energy levels are low.  It was to tell that you will not slow down because the temple is God's work. God has also said to you, God has also said to you, child, right now, you can rest at this time, I also have my devotion.  There is no need to do this, it has to be interpreted in this way, it has to be interpreted in this way that the energy levels at this time are true that you are vulnerable for so many things, now I will make a separate video for that sometime.  I will give the one from the temple if you want because I am also an astrologer and have the old knowledge as to why it was forbidden in the temple and one should not fight every time or not. It has got nothing to do with menstrual hygiene blood and all that and all that.  That is the small thinking of the people, that people have thought in their mind, let's do something else, I will tell that if you people want, in the form of a separate video, but earlier it was said to the women, 'Hey, you rest'.  Do it, some other woman will do the work in the house, the man will do the work, we will do something else in those days, they are two-three days, although maybe the biological process lasts for four-five days, but whatever has been talked about through experience is through word of mouth.  Which is my experience or you can also increase your experience, after this video you have to talk openly with four-five women in your life that friend, talk on this video, post it in the comment section, this is my request.  Those who are women, you can post in the comment section, what is Sharma shy? Yes, tell me, first day is more or first is two days or is it third day, two days is one day, many countries have given two days leave, many people have  There is a provision in this, Bihar, our state, Kerala also has some holidays, Bihar has given rest of two days, Spain has four days in a year, Japan has been saying this since 1947, they do not give trees, they say.  Unpaid Lelo, many women do not take it since 1947, they are saying that the taker is on 1 for 1, but the provision is there, it is not yours, do not take the trouble, take what is due to him, at least he will not be asked, otherwise what will be done to you, the biggest. What is the problem when the periods are going on? There is a problem. There is some irritation in the body. Now you do the normal reception work and work as a receptionist. You have a normal job.  You don't have much problem. You went to the office that day and you let your guard down. When someone spoke to me, I signaled to him that I understood, but there was a high performance meeting, there was a presentation, there was a high stress job because inside the office.  When someone is going to work, it will not be according to someone's period because you are not a top heroine, it is normal for a top heroine to decide when to shoot, dance or do it because her  The whole world will adjust but she is a normal woman, she has a corporate presentation, a big client is coming, there is a very stressful situation and now her period has also come, now she has another period, weakness, stress and after that she fell ill.  It's bound to happen and many women fall ill, then their jobs don't work like this, then it's the husband who leaves the family in the house, this is what's happening when this country doesn't have to worry about our  These are the girls who do well in 12th, score good marks, why are they not in the work force, why will they disappear, because because of these activities they will disappear, ours is aa full and none na se five or full time full all in or home. But sit in the middle, we are not ready to give concessions to anyone and in this matter, now the thing is that a female can avoid marriage for her career, that is, I will not marry for my career, she can also avoid having children.  is that  I don't have a child. To have a child, there is pregnancy, then it is small, then I have to raise it, then my job will be traveling, but no woman can avoid periods because those who do not have periods, they also have a disease or those who have regular periods, then there is no period.  If a woman cannot avoid it, then when the level playing field and if the country thinks a little, then that man has always been providing something for the woman, then you should have a feeling from within that yes man, it is like this, I am a little bit of a thing.  I want to tell you that the women who work as sweepers, come to your house and do the utensils and also when they go through this period, what sensitivity is there or should there be because it is okay to put hands in cold places during these periods in winters?  During the time you give a leave of one or two days, the woman gives leave and the maid also gives her two holidays of the month, as she is authorized, the deal is that brother, we will do it in 30 days.  Will work and also adjusts with the same time, so when everyone wants this, then my request is that first of all this subject should be discussed and it should be said that what the minister madam has said is just because you are a woman, madam.  You cannot stand for all the women. No man can come and stand for all the men. Representatives are in the opposition just because they are men, so if you try to spoil them like this then it is men.  There will be shaming, isn't it? It is man shaming, man cannot speak for woman, meaning for woman, you want to say this, women know everything about women and if woman has not raised the issue and women do not have any problem then you  Who are they to say, women are going everywhere, women are flying fighter planes, women are conquering Mount Everest, women are doing everything, then we are no less than anyone, madam. There must be some trouble in three, four, five days. No  It happens every month, someone is giving you something and you are getting something from him. Has this become a sex week? Who is this strong? Who is this week? How long will you keep doing this? If this was the biggest competition then it would be considered Olympics.  There is a separate race of 100 meters for men and a separate race for women, but this is real work, it is also a competition, there is no separate race here, whenever we play golf, there is a handicap in it.  It is said that brother, this much of this is yours, if you think so, then say that no, no, women should eat less, whenever they work, they will show their full strength, a man wastes his time in cigarettes, the amount of time a man wastes in cigarettes, in getting a job.  I had made a video, do women do that much, how many women smoke cigarettes at the job, how many men drink how much tea, how much they gossip, the most chatty men are, sitting with the boss and giving the feeling, Sir is sitting here, the woman is ours.  taking care of one's own work  She goes ahead and if she does work from home for half a day on the day of her periods or she takes leave for half a day, whoever has more trouble, periods are not like that they come once in 12 days, they come once.  He comes only once in a month, he will come 12 times in a year, in 12 times, if he uses some of his paid leaves, some by Han and sometimes luck favors him, then the next period will be on Saturday Sunday.  So it is a very good thing that periods will come even on Saturday Sunday. If you multiply the probability from 2 to 12 then there will be three periods. There are 12 periods in a year. I can even tell you the math. If there are 12 periods in a year, then three to four of them will automatically come.  There will be default holiday days, there is no need to take it, no need to ask. Out of those eight, you can work from home in some of them and in some of them you can get a half day leave.  Take yours for half a day, you give me for half a day's unpaid, the issue is solved, at least I got a feeling that yes friend, someone is thinking about us, someone is thinking about us and the women who are in need.  No, don't take it, those who don't have any problem, those who don't have any handicap, those who don't have any, but I am telling you that everyone has problem for one or two days, on that day you will call the body and keep it, the soul will not be in the mood to work. That even men suffer from fever, cough and cold two-three times a year. It happens to everyone, men either accept it or they get relief from it by taking medicines. So, if you know what productivity is, then a little.  You will have to be a little sensitive, before making these blanket statements, you will have to think that you have raised your mouth and made a statement, there is no need, we do not need to do this, hey, don't bring the law, you can discuss it if you have opened a ministry.  You can do some discussion, some survey, some report in the name of children and women. How many committees are there in the government? How many surveys are there? Do a survey. Nowadays, do a survey through digital medium with random 2-4-6 lakh women of India.  Brother, who has so much trouble with periods, then it was found out that out of a thousand women in the village, only four have trouble, in the cities so many have it, so many in this age group are working.  It happens to so many of the working people, it happens to so many of the non-working people, now when there was a housewife woman from the Middle East, she herself was speaking, then she said, women are the enemy of women, they get so much maternity leave, they get so much leave, they cost so much.  Hey madam, you have never done a job for two days, you have not come out of the house, when your periods come, you have troubles in your children's life, you are irritable in your husband's life, you do not like food, you do not like food, which  This is a very natural thing and sympathy and empathy is as I am telling from my personal op, but you are the one who speaks for the woman who is working, you have not worked for a day, you do not know what it means to work as a teacher.  Have you ever seen the condition of teachers these days? They have to stand and teach. Do you know that when a man has problems during his periods, the man wants me to sit somewhere and that teacher.  You stand and read like this, if the teacher is listening to me and you also do not write in the comment section, then from where will I get the moral to make my video, some teacher must be listening to me, some must be the teacher's wife, some can still be there.  So you must be watching the video, the teacher cannot sit, a new one has been made in private schools, whether it is government, I have not been off late yet, but in private schools, there is no desk and chair, after one period, second after second, third, third, fourth, that.  Lady is standing, standing, hey, tell me, when there was Covid, we were talking like this on Zoom, so studies were going on, you are the teacher here, raise that chair of yours a little higher, like Judge Sahiba, like Judge Saheb.  We will see a little more, what is the need for the teacher to stand, so you have brought complete technology, power point presentation, computer laptop, pointer, pointer, everything is here, you charge a fee but that is for the teacher to sit.  There is no provision that she should stand all the time. Tell me, which is the office where she sits in the plane for two hours? Even when the plane takes off, she sits for take-off and landing for half an hour in between. No one stands at his job the whole time, and those who stand, then their hours are less. You have opened an eight-hour school. The teacher is standing the whole time, so it has to be seen that she is having her periods, poor girl.  Then she is taking leave  Or she is not able to do the job or she is having cramps or why is she being harassed? Why do we have to harass people? Brother, if at least someone gets periods, periods means he has come to school, period in school.  Confused, if your menstrual cycle is going on, can you sit in the staff room and check your papers, check your book, fill your teacher's diary, do some other work? Is there any provision in the school that Madam, this class is a little free. Madam, she will come for a day or two and do some work. She will do work from home. Is there any provision because I see the teachers' problems and I see the women's problems in the same way?  By looking at it one can know where the problem is coming from, whether it is of the body, given by the mother-in-law, given by the husband or they are running their own programs, I have become a little experienced in that regard, but in vain.  Hey brother, if you take a little care of women, I know this much, whatever you give to a woman for the society, I will give back 10 times to you. Remember, what the society is giving, she will get back 10 times. Time of every choosing and  Every place and women, I am telling you that she is the biggest enemy of women. Again video on the same thing. If you agree with this then write yes enemy YD. Write YD is code that yes enemy. We believe that any woman, be it a woman or a woman.  a lot of  The biggest enemy is that men will have to come in between and tell things and many women are kept like this, they are kept in Tokism where if women have to be silenced then men do not have the courage because then there will be a huge uproar.  Only a woman is kept and when a woman speaks to a woman, then they say that, man, what did he say to us? So do you want to be such a woman? Keep a hand on your heart, just because you struggled, I know Minister Sahiba.  They will say like this, I had so much struggle, I came up like this, it was a complete struggle, but madam, if I can't continue that struggle, now it is easy because the minister has a bungalow and a car with all the amenities. If you get a good one, then any woman has to face problems.  There will be no period, but the woman who is going, who is going hanging in the metro, the woman who is going hanging in the bus, which does not have last mile connectivity, get down somewhere in Gurgaon.  One has to walk the last 600 meters in the office, it is okay that those who wear sandals due to the pressure of their society, cannot wear PT shoes, cannot wear sports shoes because the society says no, if you come to corporate, then wear those clothes. You are having those cut cut cut cut heel periods, then 50 types of hormonal problems occur, PCD occurs, OD occurs, irritation occurs, the pain gets saved, you lose your job, then Your work force participation rate is stuck at 1819 in which the middle class people are not doing it at 9. Where are you taking the country and then you are saying that we have to become world leader, we have increased the GDP, do this, make it 5 trillion.  Do this, do everything like that, the whole story is female empowerment, there is no female empowerment. In the name of female empowerment, pretend like this and cast Rs 1250. Vote for us only. That's it. Female empowerment is the female empowerment of the poor. Only the women of the poor have value because they are the vote bank. Middle class women have no value, there is no value, there is no discussion because brother, they might vote for you anyway, donkey.  So while saying this, it will become political because inside me too, Jaspa wakes up many times when I should not wake up, Guruji should remain in peace, my aim is not to influence anyone here, my aim is here.  This is an awakening that brother, please discuss about them also, it will take 15 years to become a vote bank, these women will not get anything for 15 years, after 15 years they have to meet, write here and take this issue within the elections of 2000-39.  What I want to say here is that in 2024, whatever political party is there, make it an issue and say that we will give that leave, when you are giving reservation to everyone, then reservation.  Many people are feeling chilly here, here one or two women have spoken on this matter, no one has spoken against it in the Parliament, even the men are saying brother, we don't know, try it, no one is standing against it.  Two women said something like this, we have this or that, other wise, you are getting reservation, many people find it chilly, but you are giving free electricity, water, mohalla clinic programs to many people, herds are being distributed, ok.  A lot of things are being given in many places, so brother, then discuss this also because mostly this discussion only affects the middle class women, the rest of the job conditions are different for the lower class women.  There is no such policy required there, you don't take out any HR letter, appointment letter policy before hiring your maid and she does n't come, never comes, sometimes you bite, sometimes don't bite, sometimes she leaves, sometimes you leave.  would have left  Yes, that program is running there, so it is not needed there. If it is not needed there, then brother, then this discussion should not happen because it is the vote bank because give them the cylinder. Hey, you gave the cylinder, so it is possible that 00 are left for them.  There may be subsidy in the cylinder and out of the Rs. 500 left, her husband drank alcohol, it is okay, it is not necessary, there is no benefit for the woman, he did not drink alcohol, you saved Rs. 500 and he started drinking alcohol and started smoking cigarettes.  It is possible that here the direct benefit is to be given to the woman. In this, the direct benefit is to be given to the woman. So, when the woman gets the cylinder, the benefit can be claimed, which according to me, may be there may not be direct benefit, may be there may be no. No, but there is a direct benefit here, but why is it not being discussed here? Brothers and sisters, make this video a discussion. I have made the video with so much effort and so much effort. You know that I am not able to do so normally.  In the videos and I still have a little cough, even then I have shown the passion, so if I have shown the passion, then you also show the passion, share it in some form, before that film which comes and go to the ad hall of Akshay Kumar and see it, just for that. You have left just this menstrual cycle thing, nothing else, no important discussion can be done, it cannot be stopped, society has to see, subscribe the channel, share this video vigorously in the comment section. Write what do you think of it. Don't think from the prism of just what is the benefit to me. Every man who is listening to me will become a woman. She is the mother of all. Without a mother, people are not born. Mostly, even if you marry, you will be the wife. Some will also have sisters, some will also have daughters, so don't think that whatever you are doing, don't make it man versus female. Even today, if someone  You have a choice, right? If I do a poll and tell men that there should be some provision that you brothers, sisters, sorry sisters, no, you will get two days leave. If you can bring periods into your life, then all the men will join hands. Say brother, freedom.  Give, we will do it in work, we don't want period bard para ke ki feeling hai, this is a fact, so when in your heart you know as a man you will never want to take  Two days leave and one day leave and two days leave paid unpaid and what ever changes in this what ever the woman goes through so have a heart and I know men are not so bad here I will tell men more in this thing  Not only this, I will say here that women are the enemies of women, when women are getting something, someone is starting the discussion, it is the man who is starting it, women should be welcomed. Debate, yes, talk, mention it, come and set it on fire, there is no need for nonsense, women are equal, power, women power, women power, you do it differently in the Olympics, you do it differently everywhere else, one half, someone is giving you the provision of his.  Take it, otherwise there is no need to take maternity leave. Don't take anything. Hey, the government has now started giving this leave, child care leave, to men also in case of divorce or if the woman leaves.  And if the father is alone and it is a boy, then it is being done for the child. Maternity leave is for the child. Child care leave is for the child. It is not for the mother. Maternity leave is for the child. This is the leave which is given to the woman.  The woman who was saying that she is a housewife is getting maternity leave and she is getting maternity leave. Hey, maternity leave madam, that is for the child.  It is being given for Chotu Baby, so that his mother will feed him milk. Even without feeding him, the mother's work will be fine. What will happen to her? Maternal tea for the child. Nothing is being found for the mother yet. Woman.  There is nothing yet for a woman. If she does not become a mother, she is not getting anything. If a woman does not become a mother, if she does not marry, then she is not getting anything. She should get a little bit. I am saying this, I am still not saying this.  I hope you can stomach everything.  I am not even saying, do it for five days, I have calculated the math and told you, but I am saying that open your mouth and ask, he or she can make a call, or even say 'not well' today. There is no need to even tell a sensible person, a hint is enough.  Yes, Understood is a very good employer, I am getting a lot of space, maybe Jomat, Swiggy, four or five more companies whose names I am forgetting or maybe I have written about them somewhere, so I will try to read and tell you, if it is written somewhere, there are many.  company  Sugi is giving, the company is giving by marketing, Zomato is giving 10 days paid companies, nine companies are giving this in India, there are nine companies in India which are already giving this, I want this instead of nine companies, 90  Let the company become 900 companies and if it gets mentioned then giving it to everyone is true. What is true in Tokism is that there is no shame in discussing that thing. This is the only message, share it with everyone. Thank you very much"

    "title": "Merry Christmas Movie Review [aNnchwHJmAg].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, Merry Christmas movie review, these days my reviews are going very well, maybe people don't like the way I am doing, then I will review the Merry Christmas movie which is new, Vijay Seeto, Pati ji's and Kar Katarna Kaif, Shriram Raghavan.  We know the director, his genre is thriller, the first half of this movie is very slow and the initial 1015 minutes feels like it is very slow.  The movie is going on and the picture picks up pace after the interval. The background music is very good as it remains in Katarna. Kaif ji 's acting is showing because now that kind of movie is not Dhoom and that kind of one was Tiger and like this. Vicky Kaushal ji's influence is also visible in acting, I would look a little short after getting married, but it is a fact that the acting thing is visible, however, one thing makes me feel like the heroines of today are age cross.  37 38. I am not very sure should be said on the face. This thing should not be said. The butt is looking as if Botox and something else has been done because the face is not able to smile. If you will see many heroines like this in this age group,  This is too much, I think, if you do a little gracefully with your wrinkles or something, then I think it will be fine that the athlete, when you smile, your face smiles, so this part does not move at all.  I mean, this was an observation, it is a review of the movie, but a new observation is that that face has started looking a little different, so this is an observation of the same kind, you see, Vijay Sethupathi is very very comfortable with his what ever personality.  The body is a little fat but so natural and what a beautiful acting, it is very nice, good acting of hers and surprisingly if you see her chemistry with Katrina.  Coffee is also very good, I think both of them are seven numbers. The energy and vibes of seven numbers are visible in this movie. Incidentally, there is a video of one of my seven numbers which is youtube1 video. Nummol ji's longest and most detailed.  Commented upon the most views, so if you are someone born on 7 16 25 or is in your heart, then see that too, it is the vibes of Ketu, it is the vibes of Ketu.  The movie also has vibes and thriller, but Sriram Raghavan could not make it so much. If we compare it with Andhadhun, then the plot does not shock much, which was similar to the one we had seen in Andhadhun, so that way it is a bit lacking. Even without giving much spoiler, I will still say that I am not telling much of the story. If you have seen your butt, this one was of Kareena Kapoor and this was of Ahlawat ji. Jaideep.  As for Awad, brother, you can avoid this one. If that picture had not come then this picture would have been fine. Now, after watching the picture in the cinema hall, I am like, which one of those Mamas Mal's is that director? Cut to the one above on the top floor, there are four of them.  There were people sitting, meaning two or four, we were born, two or four, so the meaning of the picture is that it is not worth spending money in the hall to watch it. I can say that you can avoid it if I tell you in the short end of the review because it is thrilling.  The aspect is not able to come out, it is formed once, after a short interval, it is also a little surprise inside it, it is not like that, but it is like that promise is never fulfilled, it always seems like this.  That it will happen now, now it will happen now and he says, it's like someone drinks something like soda and it doesn't mean that much, it means he gets a little fussy, it's like that feeling and a lot of acting, but still I would say a lot of acting.  it's good now  You will not say that the acting is good but that plot and that thing is such that it feels like déjà vu when you watch the entire movie and whatever its story line is, it feels like this has been seen before, this has been seen before.  This or that has happened somewhere or the other and what happens in these movies is the same problem that in my opinion the movie has been kept in the long shelf, the problem of keeping more in the long bag also becomes wrong that in that way someone  And if he comes then they will say  Hey, that's what happened, so these are also a lot of issues in film making, this is fine, I now feel that the way cinema is left in India, it is now only this that the bigger pictures are coming.  Neither is it like Pathan Jawan or now there was Salaar or before that there was Triple R or KGF or now there is Fighter coming or in me also Tiger bhi lo tiger tha, then this is a big budgeted picture, isn't this the one in which you will be scared in the cinema hall.  dhuku And that noise and noise is still the same movies in my opinion, however, like Vicky Kaushal's 'Samam Manisha' and '125 Crores' are done quite decently, but now I have started feeling that cinema will be all about now which is this.  Hall's cinema will be all about the experience because now these things have come on OTT, which means that if this movie had also been released on OTT, then nothing like this would have happened, then according to Hall I don't think that it will be able to pull out its budget of Rs. 60 crores, which means I believe it has a budget of Rs. 60 crores, so I don't think that it will be able to pull off the release in 12 to 13 days, 12 days, 13 days, it's 25th.  It seems difficult, even inside the end halls, there is a feeling of excitement. I noticed one thing in the movies, only if a big movie comes, people are coming for the small one, so today I saw that  The way Animal was, it is fine, if it is a big picture, there is a lot of adrenaline rush in it, there is dopamine, there is adrenaline, there is music, there is noise, there is some background score, then people will be attracted and people are getting very choosy, call it inflation or different-  There are different platforms also, people are paying different fees for them, take this into action, which movies should we make next because if you release the film in cinema halls and make its budget Rs 60 crores, then it will be better than this.  Perhaps You sit for a while and watch a web series or something, because a movie is of two and a half to three hours long and there is an interval in it, and then you reach there half an hour earlier, then you walk from home, then you park the car in the mall and then outside.  You go and then eat something and then come back, brother, it takes about 6 hours. Even if it is a movie of two and a half to three hours, it takes 6 hours to leave the house and come back. In winter, if a person makes an effort, it will take that much time.  Any good web series ingressing c  That can also be seen, I had reviewed a web series, it was also very good, so if that can also be seen, I have already reviewed it, Fal Me Once, now I will post the review on this channel, I have posted it on different pages.  Finally the demand came that I will include only the Guruji form Gurugram channel for review because it is a current channel, it is a channel of current affairs in a way, the videos in it are according to the latest happenings in everyday life. I will put it here, so all my viewers from other channels also come here and watch the video number seven. If you want to see it, then you will definitely find it in the comment section. The chemistry with Neurology is very amazing for Katrina, this is from Vijay.  Vijay Sethupathi is a very fine actor, he gives very good vibes and from within, whatever scenes he does, it is not very easy to feel affection after seeing it, there is attraction in the personality and if  You see his movie in Jawan, like see, it has become a super hit, The Way He Speaks Hindi, so there is something good in it, there is something good in it, we have seen it in fake, it is okay and which one was it in which we have seen it, I am forgetting right now, it is okay  So Varvara, he has been seen very affectionately and he looks good, it is okay and I am liking his acting but some how acting, what should the poor girl do, if the plot is as it is, then a man cannot go beyond it, so that is where I am to the director.  I will blame a little on that, although Sanjay Kapoor's acting is very good, Vinay Pathak's acting is good, his scenes are like they are there all season, the actors are fine, that Amani Bhave ji also always comes in his roles, his last two or three.  The scene is she also likes good, okay, so if anyone has seen Jaane Jaane, the movie is considered tough, then he will watch it, save a lot of money, save time because time and money are very precious, okay for all of you.  So the times come, if you have seen Andha, it is even till the last scene of Andhadhun, that too seems like the ending because I was always like that, what is the ending? Starting and ending are like that, if you have seen Andhadhun, then what are those times?  It happens that some work of a director becomes so good that even an average or high average work does not seem as good after that, otherwise this is also a truth of life that many times you set standards for yourself.  You achieve so high that later on you are not able to reach even near your set standards, then people verdict is Disruptor, it is a little Disruptor, it is okay and can be avoided, however Katarna ji's acting has come out, Vijay Sethupathi's acting is very good in it.  There is no doubt but still the movie as an overall a dozen hold together and wow and it is not fun when you come after watching the movie, one is enjoying it, so why see?  Short of it, I will give as many marks as people review. I don't give movies. The review should be straight. Brother, go to the hall and see it. Or don't go. It means there should be a clear recommendation. I liked it, you liked it like this.  It didn't work, I gave three stars, 3.5, I gave two stars, I gave five stars, this does n't make any sense, I am simple, no, don't look, don't spend money, it's okay, don't spend time, so you people want this kind of reviews, you will accept this.  Channels will keep coming to the channel for you guys."

    "title": "Middle Class Ke Bache And Hard Truth About Naukri [NaXp-EsyZvM].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, it is a very important topic for the society, middle class children and heart truth about job and career. This is not being digested by the middle class and what is happening, I am telling when our country started progressing after independence in 47.  When independence came, every subsiding generation watch doing butter, give the previous generation because they came out of poverty, everyone used to work hard, payments took hard work  Kari children were infiltrated, literacy rate was very high, children were not educated throughout the period, children got posts and then their children got more posts and then a growth pattern was seen. Be it the reforms in 91 or our own economic reforms, after that the economy was accelerated, there were government jobs and  A middle class was formed because at the time of independence, there was a lot of middle class, okay, now the small quantity of middle class is the definition of everyone.  She keeps worrying a lot, what is the big problem that now in the middle class, if you are a group officer or a group officer or have reached here at some level, I am talking about the father, then the son is not starting from here and reaching here.  It is no longer a different era who is now clamoring for these jobs here, now access is through reservation, there is competition because of technology, internet has increased a lot, the passion has increased a lot or the population will increase a lot. That reason is very high, 30 years ago in 1990, if you were middle class and your father had decent money and was normal, then you did brilliant tutorials, you bought physical books, you had access to good schools, then you  There was a huge advantage in percentage and numbers. Now with respect, you do well in the fellow country, so children, the result of true has become right. The right one of a3 has come out now.  They have become parents, their children, we are coming inside the market, their children are coming in the market, and now the middle class also lives in the upper middle class, Milli-Milli class, what a time it has been, but what is the government now?  If you see, there will be no jobs even after 20-30 years. If 180 were taken then some 180 vehicles have been running for many years. There is the same vacancy and the population has increased a lot. You know, now the jobs are the same.  Now people from poor families are trying to compete in jobs. The children of poor families are currently at a disadvantage, they are not that much advantaged but still their numbers are so high, you can see that the girl of a porter has become the son of an auto rickshaw driver.  If the news of becoming IPS or something like this has come, now there are so many lakhs of policemen that even if a few of their children become theirs, so many lakhs of auto rickshaw pullers will become theirs, then the stories of those belonging to the middle class are not being made, now they will not be able to cry.  Because this is the progress of the country, but the problem was facing the middle class, now they are not progressing because they had extrapolated that if the father was at the same level 70-80 years from now, then the child will be at the C level now.  When the child came to C, he became a father, then the child went to B, now the B person went to the same place, the A person came to B again, now there is nothing above A, he is in the middle class and by the way, I have become a tycoon. Becoming a hero, becoming a star, that's your story, but now the children, it does n't feel good to take it from their father, now someone's father is a film star, he is a strong one, Jain was such an example of a very strong person and if the child's pictures are not becoming a hit.  The child will remain from there only, now Sunny Gavaskar ji is his child, so not so many matches, what to do now, I have to look at the box, now what is the middle class crying, is reservation okay, the government is asking.  Now the same middle class children are not getting employment. Some children are ready to go to foreign countries and do lower class work there because if you do it here in India, you will be billed as losers. You also do this work because you are a father.  Father is working. Yes, if he was working, then if the child is doing this by going to a foreign country, then he can tell these stories because no one is checking the kinship and all the students of this doing brother-in-law history. They are only chip labor, this is our foreign country and they take great pride that they do not take any expenses from us, they are leaders, they are doing the work here too, there is no expense here too, but India is on priority in late purchasing, such people do not have an arrow in the pumpkin.  Similarly, there is so much housing crisis going on in Canada, we are stuck on this political thing going on, we saw the housing crisis there, Canadians don't even have a house, they have it in the basement.  Children are living here, there is happiness and music class here, there is no sunshine there, it is so cold, mother lives in the basement and there you have to see also 400, 400 dollars, 500 dollars, you have to accept, a child of lower class when 40  If he gets a job for a year, then kudos to his father because his father's earning is 15-203025, the child is doing it from the beginning and is an officer in the middle class. Take it from the government or take it as it is, his father's salary in corporate is 2.5 lakhs, 2 lakhs, 3 lakhs, his child is starting at 40, starting at 35, starting at 30, then he is an Exide, isn't he?  And the child is also not exhausted, isn't mom?  If you have reached lakhs in 30 years, then you are starting now, so brother, you will start with this much, it is very important to start, but middle class is not able to digest this because that child is roaming around with a phone, iPhone worth 8000090000 dead lakhs, now his  Salary is 14 of the date Price of D The phone in his hand Video He is wearing Papa's expensive T-shirt Now he does not understand that this and  What is happening in many cases is that in practice, if a middle class child is losing his job in some other city, then it may be a child from a lower class, if he earns a salary of 35-40 thousand in another city, then he will go to one such child.  There will be a system where there will be a camera on rent for five rupees 6000, which will be in a busy place, the food will also be eaten as per their choice, the clothes they will wear will also be worn by the child, but here, those who are the children of senior officers are a little middle class.  There is an attitude that if he can't stay, then what will happen if his saree worth Rs. 40 thousand will be ruined and he will also ask for Rs. 10000 from home that I have to spend more, this is a fact, he will stay even if the condition is very good and only one camera is installed.  That camera will also cost Rs 14-15000, his system for minimum food will be like this, then his girlfriend's boyfriend's system will be like this, then he will have the system for buying a car and his clothes.  The system will end, the mobile will end, then the attitude in you, if there is no savings of ₹ 1 and frustration, then that father again asks how to get married, now he is a boy, if there is not even ₹ 1 left as a child, even in 40-50, there is no ₹ 1 left in the bank, then who will marry?  Girls will come today, keep it like this, these sarees themselves earn 35-40 thousand, they want all 2.5 lakh 2 lakh boys, they are like this fencing park, fencing plant, this kind of boy gets first  When all the boys have gone, even the Azhar girls are not getting married because this is the story of the middle class, neither what they say nor about the numbers, they say in their mind what are the good numbers, what is the good thing. Like bringing 70% at some time, very good, sometimes 80 BCM, very good, give 90, then 95, then we have reached 100, now even that 100 has taken on meaning, the number is roaming around in public money.  If there is no work then middle class has you do a reset no in their aspiration and in reality ki bhaiya competition is a raha hai you bill have you to do things where you have advantage default setting advantage middle class still has lot of advantage over d lower class  But unfortunately the debt advantage middle class is not doing it because maybe Shikha is not telling that middle class is yours.  There is an advantage and the class does not have this, you leverage it and whatever else will happen in the future, otherwise it will turn into ketchup, now can you people become moral science teachers and this Guruji, you are suffering, lower classed Kari, I am suffering.  There is no problem, brother, according to me, there can be a blacksmith class, there can be a rich class, there can be a middle class and I am telling you one thing, I am not getting angry with anyone.  He knows that he is a middle class, he does not need guidance from the lower class, he is ready to work for 16 hours, in the morning there is newspaper left, then he hits the cloth on the car, then he also goes to Zomato and then he drives the car.  Now he is doing six jobs, people don't know, if I tell them that I am no one in Gurgaon and am running Rs 90000, then people will be useful to them, they will believe that we are not getting our engineer here.  ₹ 30000 are working, ₹ 3000 engineers are working and they are needed, but one day this engineer did three lakh jobs by learning such coding for ₹ 30000 and that 90 thousand rupees went for ₹ 90. Will these people also think of writing in the comment area or will I think? Before thinking further, I am telling you that this is not going to happen, this 90 rupees will also go towards dead lakhs, it is going to increase the value of your workers a lot, brother, you are doing this also because it is too much.  Are you doing it or are you coming in the supply? You tell me a simple thing, are there more people coming to do clothes on the car or is it going to be a bad college with an engineering degree whose life you are a faculty, neither is there any engineering friend nor is it running a fan. Know that these engineers are getting more money in the market, think for yourself, it means that the good engineers are roaming around as stand up comedians, it is okay and they keep doing their own comedy, they too are so useless, 11 lakh plus engineers are earning 12 lakhs.  Every year, there is nothing which is not necessary, no such engineering work is being done in India, so it is for you to see, the middle class has to reset its expectations, you have some advantages, if you want, then I am the next one.  In the video, I will tell you that these are your advantages for you and you have to do them for yourself. This is how you can do them. Please spread this video in the society, discuss it with people and the video will force you to introspect yourself.  of Yes friend, this one is correct"

    "title": "Nationalism ｜ Current Scenario Discussed [AxgroEy4bh4].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, there has been a very good reaction on the channel, thanks to all of you, I have started the channel with a purpose, that purpose is being met and I am on my track, today we will talk about nationalism, this is fine.  Fear and other think of overdose of nationalism. By doing this some concept is formed. We will talk about nationalism which is the environment of ours. I would like to talk to you people under some examples. Request is to participate. Through the comment area and tell us about nationalism, this is a good emotion, love is okay but this fear is called anything, you can call it match of love, it can be something or you can match of nationalism or brother-in-law, this is what we call this. Sensitization of any one emotion, having so much of it, having it so much, having it so much that that emotion is not a pun, this is of Amitabh ji from many years ago, I had seen the interview of Amitabh ji, Jim had said that in the movies, he is so much  We have done the science of father's reaction, mother's reaction and have found out the emotions that when it happened in reality, it was a very very doubtful and careful emotion, how would it be because of these actors, all these people who have been watching their movies for so many years, so this is a real fact.  Have you thought so much about anything, because the game of anything is only of hormones, that is dopamine, call it Serato, now I am not going to know biology and life in it, but you know this. Whatever happens, even if it is excitement, I should not run away from it now that I have said a few words with nationalism, but just like a person feels one in the evening and relaxes and blossoms, but for many days, if the father is a relief, then  You will not get that problem from one person because nationalism is also a problem for some people. Talk about it, talk about it for a few days, do it once a week, then tweet it, then give him a WhatsApp message along with the tweet, then forward it, then do Chandan Chilli, and then send it to someone.  to one of his  There is a level to all these things, like they say many times, no it can't be a match of love, no matter how much should be done, this is the fear of limiting it, because if nationalism is so much, then brother who suppresses all the taxes.  Don't stop even at 30-40%, say 80% of the cat's clothes, we don't talk about that, pressing buttons with hands on social media and doing chillam-chilli or even doing some actual thing or what should I do?  It is like this, you tell me whether it is right or wrong, in our country it is a different thing in comparison to other countries, in our country anger and frustration are on the default setting, I am a marital counselor, I am also involved in war at different levels, sexual frustration, Merkel.  Frustration: The frustration of earning money has become too much. When a person travels on the road, it is not that he gets angry because of the car that collides with him or if he gets scratched a little.  It is like if I put a glass of water in it, then let me give you an example, I was drinking water as soon as it is a class, now this class is not the whole of India, there is only so much water in it, so if I pour some more water in it, it will be filled till here.  Many of us Indians are wandering at this level, till now India has become this, it is not our place, it is not our place, now if anyone of ours puts anything on it, then there is a lot of frustration, so we cannot pamper ourselves by asking for anything. Someone like this  Can't give a recent take, recently I am laughing, there is an MP who is a cricketer, you have to write who is that MP and cricketer, the fans of another cricketer were making fun of him by taking his name and the same show it is I too am feeling a little shy in showing the middle finger like this, okay and he did not know it, okay, that is on the entire record and the voice is being heard, when he was asked why did he do this, then he has to go and say that. Pakistan is mine  He was saying, meaning, this is the last excuse of a scoundrel, I would like to say that this is not their example, it is not just them, it is speaking to everyone, when everything is argument less, caste is there, then the address of the soldier who is standing on the border, but  The one who is standing at the border is the one who is sharing his opinion. He can also share his opinion. I will give him two to five for calling him nonsense.  I am waiting for the day, I have got a review on another channel, it is okay and I will review it in detail, it was a village murder, I came after watching the movie, no one has the courage, let's go ahead, Kajariya is a normal brand, it seems to be a tile. I saw his ad in the movie during Holi on TV, Ranveer Singh also came and this one also came, what is the name of our Akshay Kumar, earlier he used to sell tiles and the other brands were the girls, it is okay to show that also they are clearly showing-  By doing this neat and smooth and But now flavor of D'Math is low, air is low or time is low, this is nationalism, they are firing guns in it, driving on the streets, they are doing something like that and then they have linked it, both of them have become soldiers and they are using it.  I linked up and then I went to the tile, it has nothing to do with it, it has nothing to do with it, it is so expensive, so expensive and smooth, smooth tile, I don't know where it is found, it has nothing to do with it, you also talk about your tension, about the quality. talk something to him and do something to make him feel like this That ad also linked up with it, like earlier it was done to women, any society had come to sell something, there was a girl of A caste, I do n't know, swimming in it means there is no match between a girl in swimming costume and cement.  It was a ridiculous paint, but time had come to him, so now he is taking it to this level, it is big to open one's mouth in everything, yes, it is big, it is decent, you understand that it is necessary to enter something into everything.  Not many people Brother, if she bothers about any name, then what is wrong with her is that I should not live in my co-worker's house, she has an agenda to stay there or she bothers with her daughter-in-law too, so I can give you an example. I have to understand that to show money behavior, to show narcissism, one must be inquiring about something. When you are in the office, then in the office, inquiring is a caste. The lodge of the organization is on gold.  Very good of the organization and this is the caste that listens to English. He will always speak like this only. He is not asking me to make him private. Do it like this. So do everything. This is the catch caste. People are fine like this. Now that is what it is, isn't it? I will say for a few days, I, I, I will tell my story because after one stage there is a little pain, Gadar, you know that this is a useless picture, oh you are this one, which one is their party, this is the other one, you after.  This is telebrandu, now I said this one, which one is this Jawan, this also happens, now this is from someone else's group, so called, people feel like this, although Shahrukh has come, he has a very high opinion of us, next day, very high.  I will make a separate video for that too sometime, it's okay, but since I made that date, I have to say that you are a devotee, I am telling this to my audience like this, you also learn my words carefully. Look, hey brother, listen, don't hack every person so small that if his agenda means yours, mostly our thinking has been made such that we are common people, we are below and these ABCs are different from the platform.  If you talk about something like hockey in the party today, then maths follows, sometimes you do it with A, sometimes you do it with B. You learn it because you think that the next person who will be there, brother, will be one of them.  This is the platform brother. Why can't you become the Prime Minister? Now you will remain happy. Why is a tea person able to become the Prime Minister? A stand up comedian can become a minister. Someone of spiritual yogi type can become a minister. Someone with a story can become anything. A stand up comedian of Ukraine can become the President.  The fight is ready, I am caressing anything, anything can happen with Rasiya, who knows, I am sitting with this big [ __ ] like a young picture, do you know, do you know that you, your face, are going to you here with my hands.  I am not looking young, if my sister is not looking, then how do you know whose agenda is yours? Why are you making YouTube younger? Why can't I become HRD minister tomorrow? The number is only a sign. Now see this picture. Whoever sees the young etc.  There must be some technology. Do you think that what will happen next? Will the rally triumph in the sun, will the tents be put up, will everyone go to the village in tractors? That India will end in 10-12 years.  If you want to become one then look at me with respect and respect yourself too. Don't put an agenda. The agenda should be of my own making. How do people become like this? How can one become a minister who listens to me? You are my home minister and I am the prime minister. Second and third, the one who is clapping for me is the Finance Minister i.e. Devra Palmer. Many people have not elected such a university. Brother, luck has the power to open up to anyone at any time. This is what I have to say.  I am not targeting them. Whatever happens to you, understand that any story can reach at any time, I don't know anything about technology, so these ads which are coming like this, there is nationalism in everything, ask them, you put nationalism then  When you speak saffron in your tongue, your nationalism is reduced. You are not ashamed of it, it means that you are taking the youth towards cancer, it means that Ajay Devgan looks a bit similar to Shahrukh who reduces all this.  I put so much of myself into it  By falling forward, this super super duper star King Khan has done this, he has collected saffron, third, Akshay Kumar has come, in this one, Akshay Kumar is doing his ad, where are you going, he has a problem, that ad was good only yesterday.  I am fine recently, it is the problem of menstruation, do you know how much the cigarette is, if the cigarette is worth ₹ 10, then how much is ₹ 20, do you know, it has life back power, it is a very good message, and this is this Hero Giri.  This is not in drinking, dear, very nice and very nice Hero Giri, when it is not in it, then it is worse than this, you smoke gutkha, then you treat your lens like this, you yourself die because today is the day of money, cigarette smoking, no late.  No, everyone runs away because he has also become addicted to smoking and has no knowledge of spitting gutka in a public place. Any official who walks in it has painted it with all the colors and you know him.  You are doing it, you don't know that that marketing is of that kind, that brand is in the middle, everyone knows what is the calculation, but there is no nationalism in it, but if you catch the movie of his, then catch the nationalism of Ajay Devgan. Now watch Shahrukh's offshoot, Pathan and Catch this one too, Akshay Kumar is a declared nationalist, first there was Canada, now again ahead of Canada, I have done it like this, by the way, why brother, why are you doing this, leave this nationalism, hold on to some social responsibility, your toilet is good, it is a love story very much.  Excellent That padman of yours was also very good, if it is good, then its good will be appreciated, but how does it become such a monetary consonant by doing good, should I also create, I also know that I get paid for saying something, I also have three tax channels.  He is not the only one, others are not subscribing, do it, I also know that there is late marketing, people say, but sometimes you have to see such creators, promote yourself. Take someone whose quality you know about, instead of taking someone else's name like this and they do n't understand that they have wives, they are also intelligent, they also have children, they do n't tell anything, why should you promote yourself, this is nationalism.  Its hypocrisy is very much, very much, the real nationalist is the other nationalist, as if you have taken them under contract, it is like that only you love father and mother, the other brother does not love me, because you love me from morning to evening.  You shout 'Jail to mother', 'Jail to father', what else do you do, you cannot give tea to mother, now you can only talk, how did you say that you are my mother, do this to someone, that means this.  Mantra Bhakti Picture Bhakti hogi Mantra Bhakti Picture Bhakti Bhaiya, it is not a one day thing, daily organization is a daily thought process. Did you think in the big part of the country, this basic of national puts country in everything, it is not necessary to put country in everything.  like in everything  Just as there is no need to include religion in everything, just as there is no need to include gender in everything, just as there is no need to include caste community in everything, just as there is no need to include anything in everything, even different vegetables have been distributed. You have turned nationalism into salt.  Diya and salt are also needed but you know when its mantra is too much then there is something wrong with that too. Salt is a natural ingredient in most of the D vegetables. If sweet dish is not being made, if sweets are not being made then salt is needed like.  there is sugar and there is salt  These are the two basic ingredients of anything, so you people have to see that in the coming times, you will see this nationalism happening a lot and we have to control this thing a little now that we are also here, otherwise we would shout. This does not mean that there is no love, some love their wife, some love children, some feel a little roasted, they are giving flowers by shouting, I love you, I love you, I love you, if something new is new then understand.  he comes  The boyfriend is understandable for a few days but it is not sustainable, he has been living a constant life for a long time, he has been living for 60 years, there is love with your wife, the marriage is not broken, there is love, then this is how nation and nationalism are, brother, our mantra is land, it is our country.  Love is on the default setting. Is it necessary to show the meaning of it? But who will give permission to take this test? You were interested. Question answer: Neither speak nor think. Okay and okay my brother.  Live with sisters, live in nearby society, what will change, elections are a little pragmatic"

    "content": "Hello friends, today we will discuss a little important topic India, if you are feeling it and after G20 you will feel that friend, what happened just now, a very good buyer had typed, the wedding party, what they had gone, what they had eaten and drank, they were very happy, then this is like this.  What has happened, why is it happening, what is happening, is it only Canada playing in this or is there any yes, Western also, what is happening and if we look at it historically, let us discuss it a bit. The discussion is that India is playing this. Finding its fit in this world and asserting its position in this world, and brother Mirchi is singing, it happens in families also, some people have a very bad habit, keep listening to it, keep listening to it, keep it in good human being, do not value it much. Or is it that there is such a boy in the family that everyone loves him by making him miss him or nothing else, then many times we have to play with him in childhood, yours is raw, today we have to play with spice, raw and pure, so many children.  If it was raw then it is raw in many such countries. Yes friend, it is for their big stage. No, India's was good for many years but now it is not India's sure. Rakhi is there. I hope you understand this raw and sure, simple language to understand.  I am telling you the example as I understand that such big premises are not a topic, no one is taking up because they seem like premises but I am trying to explain in a simple way, so brother, Mirchi is singing now, what is wrong in this, what is the explanation?  Book  What is happening now is that the dispensation is a domineering dispensation, so now it is being said in the world that these people are great, this is how they also opened their mouths in Ukraine and said that if they do something then they will take oil from Russia.  Over here, they are not under control. Over there, they are not under control. We were trying to control it by doing something to China so that these paklu remain as ours. We are making them by taxing them and that one.  flower good factor  India is going to a leadership position, it is not possible that the western people will ever sing our praises, but we are the small countries of the African world and in Asia, because we never have the style, they have so much pride. Manch, when they were people of extremist type of organization, they also had the most faith in India, they also said that India should send its ship and take out its people and take them to the whole world. We requested us to give CAT to our people too, so much so.  goodwill  This is because she never harbored any such wrong thing or sentiment from within. You know how China deals with things. Give her the ones that looked like Seth Lee's in the past, or I will grab your land and your interest.  I will give you pulses and give a loan, how can you do that? Well, it does not belong to anyone. The westerners have some hypocrisy of their own. It is a relief that India is emerging like the hero of the old movies. It is okay that we are brothers because they identify us. Isn't it, he was one of us, now he is becoming a bit of a leader, so he is getting angry, now such citizens, what can we do because the video is not just about creating a situation of doing Wi-Bhai, it is about making the city center  What to do inside the house, different from our domestic politics, some different songs are being played in it, okay, do this, do it, that is the beauty of our country, yes, those songs will be played, but one thing, this is to be seen for the first time in so many years.  ours which  The system which is external is whether the external affair of the relationship comes within the ministry or whether it is about external affair itself, it has become assertive for the first time and now even Jaishankar ji says that you tell me, I will call him a technocrat, he is fine, I mean butt and I mean he.  I mean a politician, I don't mean a politician who has been contesting elections for 40 years, but I enjoy it, I don't enjoy it, I don't like four-five other departments, I have become worthy of someone else, I have given advice.  It is said that it is raw, when a small child plays, he feels that he is playing with big players, I will also get involved, not me, you are not involved, brother, that is what I have seen many children fooling their parents, first video games.  It used to be that the motorcycle is moving like this and it is on the screen and the game will run only by inserting the coin and the coin has not been inserted and it is caressing the child, it is doing like this, it is doing like this  The motorcycle is going like this because the game is not on brother-in-law, this is no connection, connection is live only when life is connected, when money is involved, they can't fool the elder child, he doesn't even know what they fool the younger one, so when you make him  After crossing the stage, you came to know that you cannot be fooled, you know because India is playing it extremely smartly and take us further intellectually, look ahead, one, I am this channel, the name is this channel, I am saying this again and again, six. People have risen above the bread and butter house, in their thinking and actually in life. For those who have not got a job yet, they are concerned about money, they will not be able to understand these things and I am saying this with great humility and attitude. No, I am not saying that many channels have made it, I am fine, I also make different ones because brother, don't come here, all those A's are there, there are no A's here, there are no A's here, do it like this, brother, no, you should have money.  You must have a job and your food and clothing.  There should be a shortcut to the house to talk about all these things, I don't have the right to do these things before this, so I am also telling you that I am not expecting 10 lakh subscribers or 50 lakh subscribers in this channel, I am making six but many more.  People write something like this further, I have seen in the comment area like this, Bhaiya is not for you people and you are on Youth Pay on Clarity which is my job there, there are talks about jobs on Singular State which are on you many and channels on Pay which are here.  But what is being said is to understand that there is definitely something wrong with our country as discussed over tea, why do they say that if you do something negative in your big then understand that progress is progress, something is happening now, in that domestic situation, we would have done that.  Hey, I have not got a job. There is something which is happening very well on the global stage. All of them from G-20 are not just America, only China and other people have also brought many good friendships. Middle East likes it. India is to Africa  India is a good country, it is not just this rich country, there are 200 countries, so there is something wrong that you are doing right which is being surrounded by us, but we have to see such countries in the future because that video will be made separately on this too.  For those who are thinking of settling outside, like you saw in Canada, if the relief fails, then bill has you take a call because in the coming time people of these countries will join us or can take over their government.  For this, there is no one better than our country from India, I want to earn money in Jain Bhagan, take photos, see colors, eat food, have fun and the money to do all this is also useful but I am based in my country, have a passport of my country. Debt of the country, list it, advise me, I will do that also to prove it, many people, no, not mine, here it is like this, here the infrastructure is like this, I will also do that thing and here there is corruption, I do not have the opportunity.  This is not that, not all that. Take the opportunity. Have fun. Do India and some of India's exports and imports? Money cannot be earned by coming and going. It is important to be cautious because when those clouds change, you sir have invested it in the country.  The money is like that and then those clouds are like that. You do n't know how the world will run in the next 20, 30, 40 years. If this is the dated and century of India, which is happening now, then there may be some strength because that is ours.  Bhavai, I always have doubt relief that I don't know why the political knowledgeable person is acting like this, it is nothing like this, but brother, when something starts happening outside, when your neighbors start teasing you and start doing it themselves, then something has changed in your behavior.  If yes, then it is a matter of happiness, it is not a matter of concern, it is leadership that is capable to be seen and done and here we have to observe all this instead of the middle class center-literals who have completely risen from the bread and butter house. This is in danger of being observed in the domestic setting, that has happened, we will make it there, we will do it like this, look outside what is happening in your own countries, talk to those who are your NRIs, your relatives and friends, what is the opinion of India because of my our What else do we know in our elders, what is being thought, what is being said, what is being said, what is being written, please find out that, please do not leave the country by raising your mouth so soon and putting it in Jain kinship.  Jain  Travel around, earn money, export, import, do business, earn money, we may be different countries but we do n't know who has friendship with whom. It seems that America is a bigger friend than us, we have to buy goods from it, we do this but forget about Canada.  Now his politics is also there in it, if he is going to speak then that means story or story, something or the other is happening, now he is Trump's friend, he is friend of legislation, science speaks like this, this one says everything like this, that is the meaning. What day are the brinjal people of Pedi?  There are lots of people without pedi, they will enter the left anytime, they will benefit everyone, but India is playing smartly for the first time. International Relations is playing smartly. If not for the first time, then what was there before? Everywhere the meaning of no was heard and told that  You bill do this, okay, they go there and stand silently like this, okay okay, you are also here, let's go, now there is a difference in that thing too, now it means efforts are being made to India from every side, but that is dense.  say that if you  Give interest in this way along with other countries that brother, you will become his friend but if he shows too much friendship then you will suffer these losses. This is the promise of India's certainty, it is very praiseworthy and what happens in many things.  We keep on whining about the daily news, it is bad today, this is how the government should be, something good is happening, we should enjoy it too and here in politics, I had made this in a video earlier too and  I had given a hint, now I am giving a hint again, I see a lot of change happening in politics, some things for the first time in India, in the next video, I will give you a little comment in the comment area, if it is yes or not, then I will tell that in 2024.  What is going to happen in India and where do I see Indian politics and this Indian system is going and only the public will do it and this is the B of awareness and the feeling that this boy has gone, is still in the minds of the people here.  To discuss this openly, I need a little bit from you guys that one more song goes like that singer Rockstar song's rota once more, then I will tell you right away, there was a little bit in the previous one also, let's say this one.  I am also staying in the next one, whenever it comes, I will tell you openly that brother, this is going to happen in India, you tell me how the system came into it, then don't say it to me again, do n't say it to me again, you are his, you are his, till now I am not there. don't paint this or that  Pay anyone because my party affiliation is changing on every video of mine, so I am happy that till now I am not sticking with one party, you hate this, now after watching one of my videos, you will say that I am this one after watching my six.  Ca n't tell, okay, so this thing is very good, wherever a talented person goes, he has to leave his mark, this is a big learning, unfortunately, they are different in different departments.  It is not possible to see across, that is also because of the meaning, where the capable man has been put, that camellia is seen in him, in the department, in the ministry, in the thing, and the meaning is visible only because of the opposition, Shashi Tharoor ji is there because of this also.  Among them and those who have also had exposure outside, like those who are intellectual type people, they genuinely appreciate across party lines and many of these stands are appreciated.  When it is being done, many a times when it is done right, then they go to do that among themselves, we should all gather here and stand here saying that brother, we all are here on this point, there should not be child level bravado in it, how do we do it?  Yes, by the way, there is a little level of discussion in it, but the country discusses it. Foreigners monitor their news channels, their people, their level of discussion is good, this is what is going on, all the people started understanding such a good thing, oh my God, this is ours.  Have you understood this level of our country, we have to increase the debate, this is what the news channel people have done, especially now I will speak in Hindi and English, the English will be more intellectual, it comes very well, today he taught him a lesson, we taught him a lesson now.  Lower your eyes, now do this, friend, what a beautiful story this is and what is the meaning of this and what is this old thing they say at the railway station, I used to sell it not only in magazines but it has been many years for me.  At any time at the railway station, if someone wanted to buy something else at the book shop, it used to be India Today, one person would be given front line, one person would be given the same saree and the rest would be like this, meaning such gossip, Gandhi means nonsense, you mean the retirement of a pure soul.  Do it, read it, you are debating at this level, do n't debate at this level, just to show that everything is nonsense, then your agenda is to grow the party, why are you declaring them idiots? Now, like this work is of such high level, intellectual level, India is doing so well, it is so subtle, there should be a good debate on it by intellectuals who should praise, now this is fine food, it is fine dining type, quality is needed to appreciate it.  Now how can he appreciate the quality of a person if it is not his quality? Do you need it from the mind also? Is it that he is only good at the lowest level? It is not a political person who talks like this. He can't do it, he needs the vote of the lower one too, he needs everyone's vote, the idiot also needs the vote of the blind devotee too, his check also votes, so every vote counts, neither can he do it like this many times, but I am an athlete, now I am a creator.  I am a private person, the day after tomorrow, I can do it, brother, I don't want such people. Okay, tell me now, you come, you do something like this, okay, raise your level a little and there is nothing to be shy about.  The place will be like this on first air, 2 air, 3 air sleep, class will be general, all are there, there is such a phone in it, that means second one is one, the first one has become a scoundrel, has become dirty, general bogie is good, everyone is doing their different cutters.  There are different types of restaurants for everyone, there are different types of hotels, five star or three star, so not every person can cater for everything, so I have been saying again and again that whatever little bit of enjoyment is there,  take as  I enjoy the content and let's see this, man, this thing is good, after taking out one etc., I made it like this, Italy on the chest, and then next next this, this is something, what did they do in Ukraine, this report card type, we have to discuss Ukraine, Russia.  How did the country deal with this? How did we send the message of consensus to all the people? How did it happen? How are they managing China? How are they managing Russia too? How are they not leaving their hands on Ukraine too?  The declining Middle East has also been taken along with Pakistan, so there too there is that chilling feeling that man, these are our brothers, they keep hugging each other, why do they meet each other, what is it, they have done a good job there also.  And the people of Africa are also entering into it. We are also doing it with the countries of South America and telling everyone that brother, there is no need to be afraid of us, our nature is not bad, we are the oldest civilization, we are the ones with the best culture.  Win  If we do this in the situation, then this thing is happening, this thing should be caught and unfortunately, the running dispensation of the ruling party is also not debating it because they do not have the reason to know that if this topic comes up then there will be so much famine.  If you do n't have it then you will be asked for votes. It doesn't matter what is your merit list in the class, the strength of your visa and passport, which country you come from, what is your background, many things matter.  Tomorrow is going to be a global world type, work has to be done, business has to be done here and there, where are you doing from, what are you doing, it will have to be monitored and data will have to be collected, you cannot do this like they are all experts on Indian cricket but batsman. When you go to the pitch in a foreign country, you get hit by the bouncer, so brother, you cannot say that I will follow the domestic system only. Hey brother, if you want to play matches outside also, then the player is very good.  The bouncer is playing and a great match is going on. The bouncer also has to be monitored. You are on this P. Domestic clipping of sixes is happening, fights are taking place over this, so concentrate on friend players also world, you have in D.  The team which is hitting sixes on your flute because that is also very important. If every friend is important then something good happening unfortunately or brief to their spokesperson.  It is not there or the public does not consume it or so much intelligence is great and good. It is very important to appreciate it. So please like and share.

    "title": "Nirmala Seetharaman Ji  And  The Patriarchy Debate [tU8zzzselOE].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, it is going to be a very interesting and good topic. The current topic is going to be political and social. Another small note from respected Nirmala Sitharaman ji on one of her commentary or whatever she has said in a discussion. Beyond that, the discussion has started.  And what is that statement, I will tell you, it is spread on the link, what has respected Nirmala ji said this time, this time because every time he speaks, there is something like this, so what did he say this time?  She has spoken on behalf of Petria, I hope you people understand that where is Petria, where is Petria, where does it stop women, there is no problem, and actually, she speaks a lot like that, isn't she, I am not this.  Saying that whatever happens, it can be 100% right, it can have any color, but do not leave any scope and there is a lot of scope in this, he said, what is it that women can do?  Even if Petki can do anything, nothing stops him and he never stopped in India And I want to tell that Indira Gandhi I will start with Indira Gandhi Did Petki Stop Indira Gandhi Extreme Wrong Example Extreme Wrong Example In two-three ways, she did two-  Three names have been taken, okay so Indira Gandhi ji was taken first, did Petki stop Indira Gandhi and Sarojini Naidu was here?  There was never a Petak who could do whatever he wanted, Indira Gandhi ji, so ask me, BJP people keep doing nepotism, so if Indira Gandhi ji has to speak like this, then brother, should Indira Gandhi ji eat nepotism if she is the Prime Minister?  Had she not had a daughter, would she have been able to achieve what she achieved? It was commendable. There is no doubt about it. She was a very strong leader. Many things were good. But I have a question whether she would have.  If Jawaharlal Nehru had not had a daughter, would she have been able to do all that? And the second answer to my question is: If Jawaharlal Nehru ji had a son, would Indira Gandhi ji have been able to do it? What ever you came from a position of privilege out of?  There was also an out of cast marriage, so at that time, if we assume that Indira ji did an out of cast marriage, then it means that there was no out of cast marriage in India at that time.  If I could have done then what could I have done today, try this shows a lack of understanding from the truth, such powerful leaders are inside so many top CCS, Finance Minister, India, India, India, One India, India, India, India, India, India, India, India, India, India, how many India, India, India,  I do n't know how many there are, it's again like I don't eat onions, onions have become expensive, then what's the matter? Tomatoes have become so expensive last month, so I don't eat tomatoes too.  This is in relation to a lot of issues on ground. Government's 'Beti Bachao Beti Padhao' (Beti Bachao Beti Padhao) went on in Haryana also. We had heard 'Beti Bachao Beti Padhao' (Beti Bachao Beti Padhao). Then today there are so many unemployed educated women in India. Why are they there? Otherwise, what should the government do?  Not everything, government has to discuss, don't start such dialogues, this is Smriti Irani ji equivalent of saying that there are no issues in menstrual cycle, I am a lady, as a lady I am  Selling you, those men are raising the issue. First of all, no woman, no matter how big a leader she is, ca n't speak for all women like when Smriti Rani ji spoke, there was so much controversy. I had made a video at that time and it became very popular.  That many ladies have a lot of issues on menstrual cycle, don't they all have them? Not everyone has them, not everyone has all the periods, not everyone is like everyone, they all have butts, this is the sensitivity that is missing and when a big leader, a woman leader, the government  of When leaders and ministers come and speak like this, it is a very unfortunate thing and it is unfortunate for all the women and women should come forward and speak in this regard. This approach is a cure all approach, it is not right because the government is becoming helpless.  This is because it has been more than 10 years and the 11th year is going on, so now if there is something wrong inside the country, then it will be on them again, otherwise they will say that there is nothing, ladies inside ISRO. And I am saying that there are lady girls fighter pilots everywhere in the Air Force, but it is a system, isn't it? If the population of 50 is at 1 or at 2, then you cannot say to them that you can always mention the names of five such people.  By taking the name of Rani of Jhansi, we cannot say that all the women are born with so much courage and they get a chance to show it, there is no meaning in such names like Indira Gandhi ji Sarojini Naidu or two or four such names.  And if you take that then the fleet of all women in India will cross. This is a very wrong way. It is something like saying that what is the need for reservation, what was the need for it because B.R. Ambedkar was at that time when Dalits were separated from the society.  If BR Ambedkar could have gone so far, then did everything go well? Some people from every society, from every gender, because of their struggle, because of family support, because of immediate family support, because of luck, go somewhere. So this is not becoming the norm, even today I would like to say this and I would like to speak very clearly and there is no much fun in this, it is a matter of great pain to speak. Even today, look at whatever women are achieving in life, the owners of top companies.  If someone is there or is on a top position, then there is something in him or in politics, then I will take an example and tell him that he is either a father's daughter or a husband's wife, she has got some status or  Does anyone have a sister or a godfather? Look in politics, first of all, there was any lady in politics, starting from Indira Gandhiji, then there is anyone in politics who has become the Chief Minister of all our ministers, except one, her name.  I will tell you about those who did not have any other wise. You see, Mayawati ji also had a lot of support. You know her. Okay, before that, there was support from Kanshi Ram ji. You know, Jayalalitha ji also had support.  An example is Mamata Banerjee, who is Judge Amarj. Okay, otherwise you look at any politician, even today you look at most of the Members of Parliament, in some way or the other, they are someone's daughter, someone's wife, someone's sister and you. Whatever position someone holds at the top level is also tokenism and show piece type and if in the rarest of rare case you will throw out five 10 names then it will be suitable for a woman.  Is n't it true that they have struggled a lot, they have spent three times the life of an average equivalent man to reach there, they have not reached there like this, there is no example, even today women are forced to do very routine work.  Goes where men don't feel like going like PRT teachers A for apple B for ball karke unko sikhao na walon ko or Monday in receptionist jobs where pe Hello good morning sir I am  Like what can I do means where the maximum of women is for such jobs only, wherever their mind is, like if a woman is standing in a civil engineer, then she will look like this, what is this cap, this pan, cape, is she standing here, if in an assembly line.  Where cars are being made, a woman will look like this while looking at you, that is, you do not see her in civil engineering, it is from Petya, brother, how can you say this, no, it is not accepted and in government jobs. Also, I want to tell you that those women who are in government jobs will tell me that there are a lot of prejudices there also, there is a default setting on those whose wives do not work and no one will say that as a boss, otherwise we cannot call everyone like this, yes, not everyone is there 80  There are a lot of such people at 90, maybe not at 20, but this is very much going on, look at government jobs, even look at private jobs, every man's own wife is working somewhere. His sensitivity is still there because his wife also goes to work somewhere, someone has her sensitivities, but even today, if you look at the total, the workforce participation of women is very low and that of married ladies is even less if married.  If the number of ladies is less then the percentage of men whose wives are working will be even less if 100 women are not married and their age is below 30.  And she is doing 20 jobs. Okay, so the one who is married is not doing even 8 or 5 jobs and the average is the same. Now they take out 19 20 and give it to the lower class maid level laborer level of this class.  The percentage is very high. If we take a break down of all the jobs done by women, if 100 women are working in India, then as they say, there are not even 10 jobs with pedigree. Either you will get exactly the same kind of maid jobs, it is okay, exactly the same jobs as the sister in school who sits in the bus, very low, those Mandan jobs or above that, they will come again, come on teachers, that too with small children.  Then everything is settled like this or everywhere like in real estate, sir, you will buy this, you will buy this, if someone says yes by mistake and asks a question, yes also tell me how sir, my sir will tell, sir, my sir will tell this, this is for calling.  The girls are kept, this is what is happening and this is their stomach that they are not allowed to come up, I talk to them many times when they are training with me, when I go somewhere to tell them, I say, is that your sir, is he from IIT?  Came out to tell the real estate expert, how much is this carpet area, how many acres is it, is there a payment plan, to tell you there are five 10 things, Sir will tell you that you are not even taught this much and she is happy with that 20 30-40000 because if she learns a little more, then she will have to pay 1 lakh, then it becomes that Monday in job, not 100 people have to call cold calling, 5 have to show interest, then how can a man do this work? Great, hire a woman for this.  In which I am taking an example and telling because these are the things which I am directly dealing with because this is the sector where I work so 100  Cold calling is a very very important thing for every person. Sorry, sorry, disconnected. Why are you disturbing? It's a truth, it is a useless job, it is more useless than cold calling. I don't think there is any job in the world to pick up someone today.  Just call like this, I do n't know what the next person says, I say many times, children, why are you doing this work, because if you ask two questions, sir will tell you, you do n't have it, that's why your salary is 203 Hajj, this is very very very within the society.  It is important that we discuss about the whitewashing that we have done to women and there is a lot of Patria just because girls go to two or five places and celebrate what they say is a glass ceiling or a wall and go somewhere else.  Can't do it, today in India first woman to do this is going on, in 2024 you will still see first woman to do reach this head, do this  Do this, this is still going on, what a big deal it is, friend, how many years have passed since the country became independent, now if someone does it in the first place then what is such a big deal, what is she supposed to do, is there an arrow in the pumpkin like this, but the women have come.  If he speaks like this even at the level of Finance Minister then I feel that Finance Minister should speak more on Finance because every time before this he had said in Cena's case that we should be strong.  You need to do some meditation, there is no time to sleep at night here, do his meditation in Brahma Purat so that you can take the stress of work, there is no time to sleep here, a video of mine on meditation is pending for a long time, you can watch it on that also.  If you want, I will make it, but how did you like this one? We have to be very very sensitive to the requirements of the female workforce. Mandwa, you can do it brother, you do it like this, work for six hours, we will pay your salary accordingly, they too are happy, everywhere they have to prove, they have to prove, the most sadistic pleasure is working, they take every woman in hope.  She does n't take a break, she sleeps, or takes a cigarette break, or takes a tea break, or a gossip, keeps working silently, when she wants to go on time, then the whole universe, all these people, come and see, sir, that Neha is gone, sir.  Sir  If it's 6 o'clock, you won't find Neha, Sir, I am present, so this approach has been maintained all over the place and if she is not there, then you have to prove it by going till late night or not, I am no less than anyone, it is going on very badly, it's called let's not only. No, its treatment will be done gradually, but the treatment will be done gradually only when it is acknowledged, you will not come and do it, everyone has equal opportunity, so the playing field is not the same, it is level playing.  The field itself is not the same, it is about the expectations which are forced to be proved. They forgive 100 times of a man's blood because that man can come and sycophant. The biggest one is a male boss, which is more male bosses, if a male boss is there.  A male junior is repeatedly saying hello sir to sycophant, drinking alcohol on Fridays, taking only quick breaks, showing closeness, then no one would say that he is gay.  There is a relationship, no, they don't say so right now, they say, yes, it's okay, I am a friend and I like her, if this female also starts sycophancy, just to let you know, have a nice work environment, I am giving the feeling to the boss or to the boss.  If you understand sycophancy, then what will people start saying? Just see what they will say, what is happening, if you tell me yourself, then these things are there brother, but if you do not explain it to anyone, you get very angry. But these are the things that happen to the girls in the competition and unfortunately, what is it, women are women, sometimes it seems that men are the enemy, so no one comes and says, I am a man, I have come here and am telling some more stories, but if so much. On an important position, if women speak like this, then there will be many people who want to exploit them in this way and if there are, then they will be given an example. Today you tell me if any lady on her menstrual cycle will talk to her boss.  Said that today is my first day, I have a lot of work from home, if I do this then he will get the clipping of Smriti Rani ji, I am a woman as a woman, I am telling and she is speaking on record even today in the Parliament.  You will get his statement, there is absolutely no problem, first of all, all these Narayan Murthy ji, Minister Sahiba people and all these things happen, they do not have to go and bring vegetables, they have a car, a bungalow, everything.  There are 40 people who are working for us and they are personal, so we think that if we can do so much work then why can't these people do this much also because if you remove all the 40 people who are working in your life.  If you are given a good travel option, instead of being chauffeur-driven, you have to wait in line in the metro, you have to go in buses, you have to go in autos, then you will know that you reach a minute before the start of your meeting and you stay there for 10 minutes.  You can also reach late, these people have to reach very early and there is no loss of your time, you sit and give work to people, they get work, if as PM sahib also says, I work for 16 hours, 18 hours and Narayan Murthy ji.  They say, that Ola guy too, do you know what is his condition? Are all these people who speak from such a top position, we work brother, you don't work, you give work, giving work is not work, working is not.  hee  Work is very easy to give work, come so that it does not happen that in the report by this, ate walnuts here, drinking ginger tea, some nice water bottle, all that fragrant environment, live in a QI of 40, live in 30, whether outside  You have kept it at 400, it's okay to stay like this all the time, some doctors' full face, fast power, brother, give it to me, I will work for 19 hours, give me 19, not 20, I will give it to me, everything.  The system and work will be done absolutely fine, I will go and see and I will not make such statements because I am still connected to the ground, I know what problems are happening now, what happens after 10 years, 11 years of power, that is now known.  I don't go to see what is happening on the ground to see what is actually the problem of the people but here I am a female subscriber who is an athlete and also a male. If you want to write then write in the comment section as a female subscriber.  I will speak, write your pain, things go on the platform, people listen to what things I am telling, you have to hear what are the issues, you look at this English, I will also agree with Nirmala ji on two or three things that friend only  Don't speak English, Pataki, this is a very complicated thing, don't speak it, speak exactly, what is the problem, father doesn't let you, husband doesn't let you, there is something wrong with the boss, there is something wrong with the society, men just say something like this.  Do n't get away by giving, otherwise we don't know what would become of that way, that I agree with one dialogue. They are saying that if it was not of Petya, what would we have become, I may be correct, not even a very great man is becoming like this.  Well, it is not like that, it is not that men are also going to the moon and I don't know, they said that they will go to Mars, they also took an example, but the way of speaking is very insensitive, only to show sensitivity. Shouldn't you come and say that it is not racism, racism is there even today, no more, look at it, Mandela only became the President of South Africa, he became like this, there is no race, there is always racism, reservation is an issue, Caste  This is an issue, now the upper class man comes and says, brother, there is nothing, caste is nothing, casteism is nothing, casteism is nothing, we have nothing.  If it is not a problem, then how will it be a problem for you, brother, ask someone who has had it, count the names of four of them. Look, it has reached here, it has reached here, if it has reached here, then there is no casteism, why is it not there, brother? Ask anyone who is traveling in a village in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar or in some backward district or backward village. If he comes just because I can't see it, if it doesn't happen, then this is a very foolish approach.  Not that you should give your mouth while living, your life is like that, it will feel like this, won't you get up and sit? Last time I went to some meeting of GST, Madam Nirmala ji and there there was talk of Kombu Tor. A very big businessman there had said that my Cream in a bun has a different GST, its age is a product, he asked me how to correct it because the software itself gets shaken and solve this problem, his class had started, he was apologizing later, the video is here.  don't speak  I can't do this, I'm scared of speaking, I don't know what will happen, I can't even speak, friend, the country is free, you are speaking, let us also speak, I feel scared, I feel very scared, I feel very scared, no one is yes, that big, no, no, everyone  Sometimes it seems that man, not so much in dignity, everyone is pleading with folded hands and legs to speak like this, otherwise if this is America, do you know in America how do people speak on social commentary, what language do they use? No one is completely open.  everyone is afraid  They say, America is America, people say to America, yes, America, America, anyone can say anything, be it the President, be it anything, and he has to listen, everyone is a troll there, everyone is a troll, okay, so in our country.  I believe that there is still a lot left to be done, just because of women there has been a sentiment against women, this 498 marriage is a different social issue, that is a different social issue, this is what  Negativity comes against women in this way, it comes in one thing and then it is suffered in another thing also, this should not happen because if something goes wrong there, then hi hi hi hi hi, everyone says it is wrong but  Brother, this is only a negative emotion, we have to make a positive commentary for our daughters, for our sisters or not, we will do it as practically as possible, why won't we do it?  The girl was asking them questions, I want people like us to be called, we will be able to address these questions better, those daughter girls have all their issues, they are seeing it but they just don't know how to articulate that much.  The question and the answer are as simple as the last time it was asked that this much tax is charged. In the share market, the government is the sleeping partner.  You guys have heard that every time, go to any forum, go to any forum, open the meaning of this controversy, just imagine, just imagine, go, anything, it's like it does n't exist, it doesn't exist, say anything, there is no problem, there is no problem, there is no problem, there is nothing.  Not everything is good, everything is good, it doesn't happen, there is struggle everywhere these days and the Finance Minister of the country should be very sensitive about inflation and all these things.  If you like the video then please tell me, share it, like it, discuss the channel on tea, if you want to take membership, then you can write in the comment section. If you are a woman, please listen and if you have a working wife, then you are a man.  Your working daughter is listening so please do share this video so that every time such a narrative is set because she was also talking about narrative in this discussion, every time  The narrative should also be countered. Counter- narrative should also be countered. Just because it should be discussed more and caught, it is absolutely negative that Petki is negative. I also say that it is wrong, but to say that it does not exist is also wrong. Because always the truth will lie somewhere in between and things will happen, the country is free, freedom of speech is within limits, everyone has the right to speak in civilization, keeping the same civility and dignity, please comment.  Please comment in the section. Thank you very much."

    "title": "No One Can Stop An Idea Whose Time Has Come [ish3tJ1zJNo].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, many times a man is very happy that whatever he says, people listen to him and believe him. This is a lesson for all of us that we should never think like this in life. Who will listen to me, what idea has come into whose mind from where?  If you do n't know his address then my heartiest congratulations to Vikas, Divya, Kriti ji. She runs a coaching institute of Drishti IAS. A few days ago, a tragic accident had occurred. Three students had drowned in the basement. I had made a video of that. You all had seen the video.  I always make it two, four or five days late. I do what people don't say. In that video, I had said a very big thing. I had said why all these coaching institutes and all the children are stuck in that place, Old Rajendra Nagar, Mukherjee Nagar. I said  That is a rubbish place, no good can ever happen there. You are getting into the trap of doing this, giving that license, doing this, doing that, doing this, doing that. I told you to go to Noida, get out, now that has been made, the announcement has been made.  It has come, I am very happy that if Diva Di Vikas Divya Kriti ji is going, then others will also do it, this video is an appeal to everyone  Let it be Mukherjee Nagar, Old Rajendra Nagar, those people used to suck on rent there, they will all get settled there because no facility has been given anywhere and this is going to be a different politics in Delhi, my video is going to be made, if you want that That Arvind Kejriwal and Delhi and Delhi 's future and Delhiites are painful for them but it is a truth if they want it, if you are from Delhi then please do write this thing in the comment section but the thing that I am going to tell you  I am listening to this, what will be the benefit of this, in reality, it is not that Noida will also be expensive, you should also look at Greater Noida from Noida, the ecosystem there is still better for rent, if you pay ₹1 there, you will get a  You will not get a cramped room, you can get a decent small flat of one BHK or two BHK, the air will be better, the security will be better, there will be no classes in the basement and you can take the premises in a proper way, it is a very good thing, however what about the real estate  It will not make any difference, what will happen to Gurgaon, I will tell you on a different channel  I will tell you because ultimately the genre is that of students and there is no purchasing power but still you should leave Delhi because if you go there tomorrow, it will be even better there and it will be fun to live there, it will be fun in a clean and tidy place like this So even the parents can shift there and they can also stay on rent and there can be better preparation for the child, so it is a welcome step, I felt very good that I had a contribution in this and I gave importance to it from the very beginning because nobody can give an idea Stop an idea whose time has come and I always believe that there is an idea and its time has come, I cannot take credit for it alone, it has to happen but its time will come, it will come out of someone's mouth, someone will listen to it, someone will hear it  It will reach him by doing that. Similarly, if you see the ideas that I have given on my channels till date, I give them on different channels as well, you guys can tell me by texting me or connecting with me or in the comment section, yes you had said so and I always  I tell you that what I am saying, you will see it happening in two, four or six months.  That is why I am saying that in life, the size of the needle is enough to take out air from a balloon and you people also write in the comment section, the platform is important for us, we should not do such a thing that nothing happens, it is logical  Things will always happen, don't despair, now when there will be no basement, no coaching inside Mukherjee Nagar, no one will live there, then it will not happen by accident, our problem is that we have to fix everything, many times many things cannot be repaired beyond economical repair.  There is no economy in it, you cannot drive it, many times the vehicle breaks down and it has to be thrown away, you just cannot drive that, many times your knee will get damaged, you are 65-70 years old and you are not able to drive, so knee replacement surgery will have to be done.  It has to happen, now you cannot cure it by doing Ayurveda, by going here, by injecting, by applying oil, by doing some Pranayam, so the same thing happens in many things, it is very good and I am concentrating satisfactorily on this because in this, I cannot work satisfactorily with just the social thing  Take membership of the channel Chai Pe Charcha Wali  Look, I will plan something separately for them so that we can create more impact as a society. The membership fee is very low but it is a transactional exchange. If you offer Rs. to someone, or if you offer Rs. 101, it does not make any difference. Isn't it, energy gets exchanged, so it is the same thing, so you can take Chai Pe Charcha membership if you don't have membership of any of my other channels because I provide that facility with all of them, but this one is my cheapest membership They are more expensive than these, so this will be a bit more towards social issues and you will see some videos first or you will also see some exclusive videos when the members increase and there can also be members only live webinars, workshops, something or the other can happen, so it is great.  It will remain and how do we consume politics, how do we consume our affairs, what are the economic things happening, what is happening in politics, it is a great art, we just cannot run away  Because it is being discussed everywhere, it is being discussed there, it is being discussed here, they will spread an atmosphere of despair everywhere, they will do this, we do not have to have emotions, yes, they move and wake up, but anger and hatred do not take us anywhere, give justice I  Wanting justice cannot be done, one has to give an idea, people keep on saying justice, sometimes it is fine, the one who has to do justice to the case, that is it, but the common man gets angry from within and gets BP, it becomes something else in practical  Talk about whatever is possible, I always tell them, low hanging fruit, go from Mukherjee Nagar to Rajendra Nagar to Greater Noida, Noida, low hanging fruit, don't even use your mind, there are chairs, tables, tables, you will go there, it will be already ready, it takes two minutes Clapping is for Vikas Divya Griti ji that you have taken the decision because why, why to be in their circle, the fire NOC will not come, MCD's is here, go there, go here, the date is becoming like a lot, it seems like this in many places in Delhi that Delhi became Gurgaon in this affair  I have lived in Delhi, if all this happens in Delhi, then personally I will probably benefit from the investments, if the garbage is dumped in Delhi and the people of Delhi come out, then it is beneficial, Nad Greater Nad will also benefit, Gurgaon has been getting better for a long time. But still it is a matter of pain, I want to make a video for it for the people of Delhi that it is disappointing that this is happening, still I will tell why this is a problem and Kejriwal ji also has a role in this, Aam Aadmi Party, Kejriwal and  This is everyone's role, beyond that, if you want to make an open video that there is no need to talk about anything, what happens is that an atmosphere is created against the BJP that everyone starts speaking against the BJP, no friend, it is not like that, now you will see me in Bengal  While the videos of this are also coming I have done a lot of research on that as well at least talk to the Doti Haj people there now talk, I mean not one by one I mean talk in a way what is happening, how is it happening because  Mahua Mitra ji and Abhishek Banerjee look very good there, it seems so in the parliament  Yaar, it is very very good and here BJP, Modi ji, oh, he has spread his influence there and people there told me, Guru ji, you are the same, neither BJP is great, nor Aam Aadmi is great, nor Congress is great, nor TMC is great, Someone is very bad, everyone has something of their own, we too the public have to analyse everything, this is what is called an independent thing, there is nothing neutral, there is nothing neutral, if there is something wrong, then if you go completely against it, then it will seem that you are biased  Then sometimes you will go here, sometimes you will go there, the independent thing is that no one is telling you about this thought process, this will be called independent, otherwise there will be some nonsense, someone will say something absurd, if something is wrong then a voice will be raised against it, behind the raising of voice there is someone else and  did not say that you should raise your voice against him and do something, he is independent and here is youtube0 in which people like Vikas, Divya, Kriti ji played a role because they are very popular and they heard all the noise that was happening.  Someone was saying in the noise that you are useless, I  I made a video in it that Vikas ji, you do not need to give 10 lakh rupees, I am not in your basement, everyone is creating a ruckus, they are doing this, they are doing that, you are being cornered and I, although I told Vikas, Divya, Kriti ji  You people see the content in many things, I do not agree with them, I do not believe that nothing else will happen, it will be an experience, I don't agree with this philosophy, yet I defend in that video that friend, it is forcibly just a man's name and it is popular  Will he become that face, I had defended him there and I had also suggested and now like Vikas Divya Kriti ji, I myself had said in it that very learned people and scholars should never be ridiculed in the country because then  He remains a fool, so I gave him a constructive advice and that advice bore fruit, which gives me a lot of satisfaction and it makes me feel that if you give advice to someone with a good intention, then he will understand your intention.  It seems clear and logic is seen in it and the benefit is seen, it is beneficial for the society, it is beneficial for our own coaching institute, it is beneficial for the children, so I make only such content that why not that thing which is beneficial for everyone, many of our things are like this  It is where there is some fight and quarrel that this will be beneficial, this will be disadvantageous, now those things take time to resolve but where we can build a consensus, brothers and sisters, that I too, gradually feel I will become a politician while speaking like this  No, then after that it will be done, vote for crocodile, okay, party symbol is fine, then I will leave it at this, but we have to spread this positivity also, brother, solutions exist, keep the thought process clear, now it will be a lot of fun, it will be very beneficial Greater Noida should become an education hub, Noida should become an education hub, now all of you should reach there, all of you should reach there, leave everyone there, everyone should go away and Noida and whoever is in Noida, Greater Noida, UP, BJP government, Yogi ji's government, Yogi ji's  Are the officers listening, is Yogi ji listening or someone please welcome it like welcome come here Modi Ji had welcomed him when he had shifted Tata Motors to Anand when it was going on in Singur, Allah immediately welcomed Ratan Tata Ji with a rupee please start, so if we have to do it in the same way, then Greater Noida will be Noida immediately.  The doors have to be opened, come in the first year, this discount, that discount, this fee is not there, that tax is waived, this is waived now, now I am saying, open it, open the treasury, come, you are most welcome, come, settle down once, we will take care of the tax later.  Tax, okay, come once now, at least at least at least and what are the students, most of them are from UP and Bihar, most of the students from UP and Bihar come, so what is the problem, you have to catch a train and come from somewhere, I don't know, from Patna, from Supaul, from Bastar  From Ara, Munger, Tihari, from where do the children come? From there they come to Delhi. What is the difference between Delhi and Noida? You will live in a clean place, you will live like a human child, you will live in hygienic conditions, you will be a little happy, there will be productivity and if there is safety, then very  good so it's a good thing for society we all should  Feel happy some times ok as subscribers you should feel happy as a content creator I am feeling happy I am nore Vikash ji is going to do a good job there and others are going to follow suit and it is good for everybody and please UP Govt UP government should take cognizance of this, you should take cognizance, it is good for you and vacate Mukherjee Nagar and Ranar, some other work will continue to be done, whichever needs to be done, but this work will not be done, get out from here, all the students should get out. All of you please like and share this video, take the channel's membership and fill the comment section. Thank you very much."

    "title": "Normalisation of Obssessive 84 Hours Work Week Discussed ｜ Must Watch Video [V25mnveYTTU].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, we will discuss Normalization of Obsessive Working Hours. By doing this, an article by Kangana Rana ji came in 84 Hours, before that came Nilesh Shah ji's article and you have to discuss it. Similarly, the video was due earlier because of Nilesh Shah ji. Kangana ji came into it and added fuel to the fire. In this video, I would not like to talk about any ill-mannered person, but if there are some strong words then it is necessary to tell.  The counter narrative to this is because if these people are not concerned about our sensibility then why should we be concerned about them, I will explain this under this example, such is the situation, they will not talk about unemployment and will say that whoever has done the work will You work for 84 hours. Why can't the entire country work for 20 hours a week? This one is doing it in such a way that he does n't get employment.  People who are in power now, Kangana Ranaut is in power, it is only BJP and Modi ji also keeps saying that I will work 18 hours a day, I am so obsessed with doing more work and there is no job here, there is unemployment.  We will not talk but will say, listen, listen, O unemployed people, you have not got the job, neither are you unhappy, it does not matter, those who have got the job, we will make them so unhappy that you get relative happiness.  India is the only country where even the one who is employed is crying and the one who is not employed is also crying. It's amazing. Wow wow, dash forward and do it. Every time you speak, you feel scared. Okay, you too are scared. Yes, that.  This is that Amitabh Bachchan's man does not feel pain, man also feels pain, man also feels scared, okay so this is the truth of life, in a country where there is so much unemployment, there is talk about 84 hours a day, where is the work?  is the work  Where is the work people will do? If you are getting good money on hourly basis then why stop at 84 hours? Brothers and sisters, cross the 100 hour mark. If there is work then why is this thing being talked about, why should it be humiliated?  What is this to these people, do they have to pay 40 hours' wages and get them to work for 84 hours? If the work has to be done then we will get it done. Should we get paid for it? Does he have to wear his suit and boots or will he go somewhere like the sea?  Pahad photo clicked, Anga, your work is going on full time and the most painful thing is that the bachelor has not got married, including Kangana Ranaut ji. Hey brother, whoever gets married has to live a troubled life, he has to have all these wives, children and marriage.  Leaving everything behind, husband and everything else, it takes four hours to work and keep taking photos and keep making selfies like this and saying how much work we have done, how much work we have done, who will talk to Kangana ji about productivity?  And through Kangana ji, I want to ask every person who speaks in the last 84 hours, brother, what mountains are you breaking, if you tell me, what do you do in the whole day, what changes have you made, see who is the corporate one.  The one who is in business, the one who sells food, the one who sells food, the one who sells auto rickshaw, he is doing as much work as he can physically, he is doing it in terms of money, but who is there who works for someone and  He is ready to do so much work, the CEO of the company is not working himself, get more employees to work, give 40 hours of salary for 84 hours, this bluff should be called out, it is not good for the mental health of the country.  Those who are from Biocon and two-three others who are promoters have said, what nonsense, there is no focus on productivity, keep working, keep working, keep giving presentations, keep giving data, keep meeting.  Keep sitting in the meeting meeting meeting meeting I took this meeting, now I took this meeting, I took this meeting, what happened in that meeting, then after 4 years, 5 years, then the election will come, yes yes, but look at how much work I did.  Look at how much work has been done, isn't it useful, isn't it a mess, and now it is 70 hours, 84 hours, I am saying do it for 100 hours, this is so bad, they will have to be made a laughing stock, whoever is saying this.  These people will have to speak openly, only those who have no family life, no sex life, no mental peace, no people, these are those people, I speak as an example, there was a song, Meet Na, who will work for 84 hours.  Mila re man ka aayi hai nahi hai, whatever nonsense they are talking, watch them ai n't they have any milita, that is his song and among these mostly what is Dil Jale Woh Yaad Hai Picture Thi Usi Ajay Devgan  In which Amrish Puri's hearts are burnt, all hearts are burnt here, all these hearts are burnt, they come and work for 84 hours, they pretend to do more, they are not, they are all narcissists, they are taking their own photos, glorifying themselves and telling others to do so.  We are working, working, working, working for 84 hours, why will there be any work left after working for 84 hours, is there any more work in it, if only for 84 hours, I am getting paid and there is work.  He is an idiot that he will not work and if he has to reduce it, he will reduce it but work must be done. Here the whole country is preparing for the exam. NEET exam is not conducted by you. Police constables do not have exam papers from you in the entire country.  If you get leaked or give grace marks in the exam, then one work is not done, then work for 84 hours madam, where is the work, Kangana, madam please give us the work, tell me where is the work and whose work.  I have work, I have come, how am I, I am actually there, I have work, but I am looking for my own work, I am doing it, but can I come and shame you people, you will say, Hey, you are too lazy, sir, what do you say while sitting in your drawing room?  By doing this on the shield and saying hello friends, one channel, two channels, three channels, four channels, five channels, one video a day, five videos, it is easy for you, yes, it is easy for me, that's why I don't say, that's why I don't tell anyone that I have so much.  I have sensitivity and intelligence, I do n't tell anyone this because why can I work 16 hours a day because I have nowhere to go, no one is my boss, no one is going to suck my soul, my soul is with me, my body is with me, my mind is with me and  Those people who have mortgaged you all, these people have all mortgaged them, so how will they work? Friend, everything has been sucked. You are hanging in the metro for 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours. Someone is hanging in Mumbai.  Delhi  Gurgaon is doing something bad, Gurgaon is doing something, everyone is like this, so where can you do this toxic work culture, you should call it out, brothers and sisters, you should suppress it and make fun of it, you should suppress it, you should make memes of it, you should suppress it, videos This type of video should be forwarded and this video should also be forwarded by pressing and liking. The more you like, the protest will go there. This is your EVM. The likes of this video are yours.  There is EVM and press the button beyond this, if you agree and press it then show them and write in the comment section. Such videos and mine are watched a lot. Some youngster will make a cut of my videos and make a meme and post it. As many youngsters can do it.  Yes brother, do it, I will not give copyright lesson to anyone who can use this content in any way, but the language I have spoken is the same, do not put any wrong language, it is okay, this much.  You can use it and call out this bluff of these people who have nothing to do in their own lives and in the lives of others and say that they are doing the work of sowing hashish. This is a saying that they are doing the work of doing such and such. Hey brother, people have to raise their children, they have to give normal balance, they have to look after relationships, they have to look after diseases, they have to look after their parents, they have to take care of their health, they have to take care of their mind, this life is fun here.  This is to do, to enjoy, to relax and if you know the population of Mandi and the population of Pahari, they are very stable and live with great love, those people learn from them, you are some very militant people.  Paharis work very hard, do it in spurts, also remain relaxed and enjoy their life, live comfortably, there are no diseases, at least you learn something, to beat China by working 84 hours a day I had made that video which became a big hit. The bus driver is driving the bus. He is a Chinese bus. Do n't follow him, don't follow him. We should not follow anyone. We have to keep our mental balance. We should come again and again.  Don't say that we are poor and lazy, there is nothing like this in our country and if someone is enjoying then let him do it, what is the problem with you, there are no jobs for 5 kg rice, you do this one thing, work for 84 hours.  If you want to get it done then stop giving this free ration, the man will work on his own, if you give 5 kg for free then why will anyone work? Give that 5 kg, give that house now, give house to everyone, give this, then it is okay, that is above that.  There is a roof, you are giving food, you get water, you get free electricity, free water, you got a house and got ration, now why will he work, then he does not work for 84 hours, what a contradiction and comedy and what a city man is doing, he has to  ca n't find time to live  I am in tears, can't eat food, today's children have to make their own food and give it to eat outside road side, diseases seem different, there is no time, if you work for 84 hours, then what is the time left for? There are only 168 requests, just calculate.  No, how many days will you sleep for six hours, not even sleep for two hours, what are you looking for, when will he work on himself, there is hygiene, hair has to be cut, bath has to be washed, shampoo has to be applied.  Have to relax a little, have a little phone call, do a little boyfriend- girlfriend, have to see a little relationship, or will everyone become dil jale like you, dil jale dil jale dil jale nahi chaleenge, desh unfortunately kuch dil jale chal rahein ya meet na mina manka, those people.  They are running ' Meet Na Mila Man Ka' or 'Dil Jale', these are the two categories of 'Meet Na Mila Mann Ka' or 'Dil Jale', ' Meet Na Mila Mann Ka' or 'Dil Jale' are in these two categories, 'Meet Na Mila Mann Ka' or 'Dil Jale' are in these two categories, 'Meet Na Mila Mann Ka' or 'Dil Jale' are in these two categories, 'Meet Na Mila Mann Ka' or 'Dil Jale'. You got it but your heart got burnt or you did not get it at all. Everyone else is doing a fine program.  You are sitting with your opinion, don't go and do this advice, useless advice, no 20 hours, how many of you are for 20 hours week, video will come, why this 20 hours week, will solve India's employment problem, I will give the idea in which you have the brain, work for 20 hours.  Do it in a week and then I will tell you what to do. Ask me to work for myself for 20 hours. I am asking you to work for someone else and the rest.  I will tell you what to do in time, you will also become rich, you will also be happy, you will also be happy. 20 a week is what India needs. Do you want a video on it? Please type 20 hours in the comment section. You will get a video on it. Call out this bluff. Whenever you find such a person somewhere, destroy him on the spot as if he does not exist, fly, mosquitoes kill like this, if mosquitoes come, they kill like this, as soon as mosquitoes come, they kill like this, whenever  If someone talks like this, just put it to him like this, what nonsense is happening, he is doing this for 84 hours. You have the luxury of having a house like yours, you also have a driver, you have a car, you also have a bungalow, there are six houses at six places. You have people cooking everywhere, I am arriving, the food is ready, no shopping to be done, no children to be seen, no clothes to be seen, no ironing, no washing, no drying. Do you know how much time it takes to wash and dry a good vest and how much to keep it?  It takes time to dry the shocks and How much time does it take to wash? How much time does it take to sweep? How much time does it take to manage the house? Someone calculated? Work for 4 hours. They all are speaking from their own point of view. Whatever you call work, it is not the same.  The common man says fun, you are having fun, you can exchange it, no, you do it like this, you are working 84 hours a week, no, let us do the work, and exchange the less work we do and our luxurious lazy life.  Tax  Take it for a week, we are ready to live that 84 hours of life where there is fun, everything is good, gold press, juice, almonds, walnuts, glowing skin, everything is good, everyone has invested in everything, it is everyone's luxury, all these leaders, fathers too.  They apply massage, it is happening completely, they say how fast is this speed, sweat is called sweat, that is why sweat is called sweat, look at the speed of the farmer, there is no speed on his face. The top leader was asked, hey. You have skin, you sweat, you work hard. Have you seen any labourer's skin so good? Someone works harder than him. Someone works harder than a farmer. The rickshaw that people are roaming around in in the heat is the same one that runs even today.  Her skin is looking so good, what does it mean, the color of her face is like this, the texture is like this, the softness of the facial skin is like this, now if I too have such a sexy skin, then it is because brother does not roam around in the village, he does not show off his butt.  come here I don't tell you all that I sweat, it doesn't come from sweating, it comes from enjoying, it comes from living in a very chilled environment, but I don't come and shame anyone or I or anyone like me, it shouldn't be done just because.  Your character is such that you have rest and to reach this stage, you have to grind a lot. No one comes to the stage as soon as they are born and these people who are on that stage have also not come.  They have also struggled, they have struggled, but now it is so easy to reach there, it is very easy to say, work like us, where is the opportunity, how much unemployment is there to do in this country, Haryana has unemployment at 38, India is at number one.  Haryana is number one in Haryana in terms of unemployment at 38 and you tell them to work for 84 hours, brother Guruji, we have worked for 10 hours so you give us 84 hours of work, how can you work for 84 hours?  Will you make me tell you what work you will do, what will they work if they don't have employment? So come, don't say like this madam, it's okay Agniveer has done it everywhere, he was working there for 15 years, he should leave in 4 years and then work for 84 hours. Please spread this video, this is the least I can expect from you people because if you don't do it then these people will come and say so much nonsense and so much nonsense.  You will not get the answer, nor will you get the narrative, you just have to share and like, do nothing else, you can do this much, I also made the video with great effort, worked so hard, it took time to upload, it takes life to do this, Hello friends, it is easy.  It doesn't take much effort for me to edit, but still it takes a lot of hard work. If you agree with me to do everything then please spread this one, you guys like it and tell me whether what I said was right or not. Every 20 hours.  Have to take this anchor  They say that brother, if you say 70 hours, if you say 84 hours, then there is no problem in making it 60 hours. If you say 84, then 60 will be less. I will take it towards 20 and will take the whole country towards 20. 20 hours.  Work brother, not for five days, not for three days, we will work for 20 hours, I will tell you what we will do for two days, we will rest for two days, how we will live life, that video will tell and that will make it a campaign.  We will give the rights of our country to us, we have taken the contract to Japan, they have done to China, they have done the work, they have done it, we have taken the contract, we are India, our system runs in a different way, Japan has made it here, it is not an ecosystem at all.  So the population is so high, so many people are sitting idle, their men were less, there was more work, so everyone had to do more, here there are more people, there is no work, if you are not able to work, then what to do if you kill a fly, you worked a lot for 84 hours, how much did you kill?  Take the money and do this work, if not then share a little and do it, then I will make a good video and tell you all, please like, share and post in the comment section. Thank you very much."

A fighter will go, then some other election issue will come up, then discuss a movie, then do something by the court, brother, six months have passed of a good life, then now elections are about to come, now do it once for the whole country so that sir the country Hey, these politicians come to say hello during the elections, the more they are there, the more they will ask for two paisa tax from you at one time, then we will meet brothers and sisters, we will reduce the tax after one and a half year, we will not even ask much for the whole year and a half.  Your God, what is this sir? I am not even asking you about the name. The name is a different matter. The name becomes very personal. If there are elections for the Central Government in Girji, then what if there are elections for all the State Governments and it has not completed the operation.  What do you keep saying, this one happened in Madhya Pradesh, the operation was done in Karnataka, first the government was elected, the story in Maharashtra, the story in Madhya Pradesh, then this band went, then this happened, then this happened, then this.  The elections have fallen there and if you hold them again then still the elections are being defrauded again. To do it at one go, you will need so many voting machines and everything else is happening to the municipality too, this is also happening to this, this is also happening to this. This means that when there are exams, all the students of 8th, 10th, 12th class are called together on the same day. In the school or board exam, the 12th class students are separated. Management is also done for the tenth class, relief is also given, first maybe one day everyone comes and does the same thing, because how can a person concentrate, this one is from the municipality, this is from the counselor, this is from the mother, this is from the center, this is this sign, this is made. Which party is it, what are the issues, that water, poor guy, he doesn't know how to vote, half the time he is such a confused dog, so now whose buttons will he press, no, no, this should not even be discussed, according to me, finger on.  You should remain tight lipped and don't talk, leave it because you are looking for a job inside your house, you are facing income tax, you have to do something about your health, you have to do about education, you have to do about investment, you have to give the image of your house.  And that has to be done, do it in such a way that it is as if someone has put a pass, isn't the question exciting? Hey, what opinion do you have of me, of mine, of my acquaintances, many times, you tell me, Guruji, why should I also give up their pension?  No, the political party and the most important party is Apple, but Apple is the only one who is doing this, who thinks this, they say that brother, he was starting the athlete, that brother, this will be that, one person will be his party.  Or is there another party except their leader, no one has opened their mouth, there are two-four politicians who have opened their mouth, one maybe Varun Gandhi has opened his mouth, you can check, only one person will continue, three will go home, now that money will go.  If he goes back, he will come to us, mother, talk to him, very good, good, good, good, what will you do with this child, by announcing whom, what to do to whom, dog, where will the money go, where will the country's money be saved, where will it be saved, what is the tax calculation? You have to see that this thing doesn't last, do n't tell it, I am the one who is this thing, we the intellectual middle class and we are on WhatsApp and these are we, we keep talking about this question, what is less or what is the difference between them.  What less tax does a government employee have to pay? 33 days. Look at the holidays of the state government. There are 35 35 38 38 days of holidays. There is no such local religious leader, no such political elder in whose name holidays are not taken, then they  There are so many festivals in our country, never do any audit on them. Here, we will take the child for two to five days and set the negative right for the whole public. Hey, it will be beneficial.  There will be benefit, there will be a lot of benefit, there will be a lot of benefit in the monetization also, no, there will be some benefit, that too, I will tell you that I mean, you Nazis had put gas inside the gas chamber, it cured cancer, so what is that?  What he was doing about cancer, is that a benefit in the default setting? Anytime you do anything, there will be some benefit in it, man, who said that there will be no benefit, if you don't eat food for three days, there will be some benefit in that too. Remove diseases from some body  You will light a little flower, you will do something, this is my only advice on this, it is very clear that this thing should not be discussed at all, this balloon rises, the balloon flies, I am the one in the department who is always worried about seeing where the wind is going. What difference does it make when the balloon goes up, you know the wind direction, you know where the wind is going, you even doubt and speak, it also becomes stronger, those who fly ships would know this.  Well, the wind is interested in how much wind there is, so it tells that brother, if the wind is strong then it will fly higher and then the direction will also be known. For example, a balloon can be known by its two smokes. Many people do not have a balloon.  We put smoke, we get to know the direction from where the smoke is going, if it is caste, then there are some such things but we do not have to tell about them, date wise is written, today news is seen first and power later.  Meaning, the scene of the newspaper is managed in such a way that the news is sold first and then the newspaper is sold. The advertisement that you see in the newspaper is only that advertisement, there is not much else.  Advertisement: You guys should also remember this thing."

    "content": "Hello friends, I am enjoying the episode with a new topic. There is a good feedback on this new channel. Today's topic is politics, society and people. It is okay, the meaning of 'Bin Pedi Ke Lot' is that it can go to any side, so we politicians.  A lot of people say that man, this is a lot of bin pedi, I was with him then he went there, okay and we are judged a lot on this, okay and now Tech D is middle class Tech N very higher model ground. Our opinion should not change like this, not in this life, so let us discuss about politics, you will say where and how is this happening, now you see this in Maharashtra, you saw the first election, there was a coalition, this one A and B fought together like this means it is fine.  This one won, then this one went with him, now this one, then his little baby was born, this little baby, then he went with this one, then there was another one, brother, the other one, he had a little baby, now he is gone.  big ones  If you don't know, then it is like this, everyone is coming and it is being seen that who is the opposition, who was the most worthless child, only the same opposition, so many times what happens is that people say vote, then I don't know, the vote goes to him.  Earlier there used to be such kind of laughter that when you vote, it goes away, now it has become such a kind of laughter that whoever you vote for will go as per your wish, then this is such a big comedy, Rakhi, so on one hand, you are very irritated.  can ok very irritated  Can this be so dirty? Secondly, be a little calmer, whatever I am learning because this channel of mine is more about what you can do Racer Dan King crime and crime is okay and this bad of telling, that bad world, leave it bad, you also learn.  If something happens, once I make a commitment, I don't even listen to myself, then this dialogue of Salman Khan sounds very good to hear, but please change your opinion, change things in your life.  In dynamic personal life, I am telling you to learn from this politician, he walks away with a straight face and says to one person, he is corrupt, dirty, useless, take him out like this, everyone has said this, after that he is sitting on the stage, then what else?  With such a straight face, all of them are small and fat, do n't think that your favorites are also the ones who seem more favorite to you, the elders, those whom you idolize, are also with such a straight face, now it is alright for you.  I have taken a pass in the washing machine, before that it was dirty, so learn it, don't call them big, learn it yourself. Who told you that economics is very famous, so that it does not become a shame, everyone around you is doing such things that they run in a corporate company.  The two companies were such big companies and there used to be fights among themselves and there was so much bitterness among the employees, it is okay if you become friends, then this story too, anything can happen at any time, brother, it is not like this.  Look in life, why do people have to change their opinions, the way they are, which movie is this, Amitabh Bachchan's Mohabbatein, this is 2023, this is a very dynamic world, Artificial Intelligence is the charge, survival of the fittest is Darwin's theory, it applies to everything. You will not change, the business is over, you will not change, the party is over, everything will have to be changed, you are a state, yours is fine, which used to be Patliputra capital and  Even today it is fine, they say Magadh, now the one from there, who has been turned so many times, now here, sometimes here, sometimes here, here, no one says anything to him, one is explaining with a straight face, now inside Western Up.  There is another leader, his father was also an SSC but now he too has been like this, everyone is like this, there is a story going on with someone at any time, you are getting worried, you are pampering them, you are pampering them. he got a bill  We were there where people went on the road, the date was 2 years ago, you know, they were depending on him, then they drew, then if they were like this then why were they making so much noise, she is giving class to everyone to defend for them and herself.  So much loyalty, so much loyalty, you know, my old subscribers are from the old channel, okay, you know one of the things which I do is medical, also, so brother, show so much loyalty to your wife or show your wife to your husband as much as you can.  You are showing these political parties, why are you showing vomit, why are you becoming loyal to them, why are you writing in the blood that you are the only one, you are the colorful one, the only one is you and you are the one who has played the note, I like Kant with anybody.  Whoever gives me, I will like it. Let's go. Those who are of lower class, they sit like this, you buy, wait till the day, no one knows about it, everyone is busy in convincing them, some buy something, some will buy, some will see this at night.  Of  Some DK, you know everything about the rich people, it is their own, they say that you have also heard their dialogues, it is our shop, it is our shop, it is whatever one wants, it is being discussed in Sanu and they do it like this, they say like this, this and this. These opposition people are from pro government, there is such a feeling that there is a crying quarrel with full emotions, Sir, everyone is with the feeling that you are like this, you are like this, he is like this, there is so much emotion that this  These are the people of this age. Why don't they show their grandchildren? Why don't they talk to them so much? Why don't they talk to them with such passion? Are they as passionate about politics as politicians? Are they servants? Politicians themselves speak, aren't they servants? So it is a big deal to call them servants.  When I go, the servants say, all are different types of servants, there are small, big and very big servants, so does anyone fight over the servants? Do you people fight like this, this one is good or this one is not? Why didn't you keep this one? I have also kept this one. She is giving such good service to me, yet she will keep that one. Hey friend, you can keep whoever you want, you are sitting with one mode, you did not get so much money and she did not give service.  And if that one goes, nothing is going to happen, nothing has happened in the country for 15,000-20,000 years, nothing is going to happen, do n't worry, it only creates panic, C I do Astrology, also the new channels which will come now.  They will come only then, Naam Guruji from Gurgaon, I do a lot of things, okay, as you understand, I am the second type, I will also tell some more details about myself sometime when the channel becomes a little bigger, okay, so what time you are, what I am trying to do. You also know about fair sales, you go to a doctor, who goes to an astrologer, who goes to a lawyer, who goes to a chartered accountant, who goes to an architect, brother, take this architect or else.  That letter may be crooked, there will be no proper loan, then you will get trapped like this, lawyer is not good, even four accountants will also get trapped in tax, this is how it will happen to you, nothing will happen, otherwise the notes will not be issued, this is how politicians are, politicians should be engaged.  Yes, I am the first person on YouTube, I am the first person who is engaged in turning normal people into politicians. I am saying this, everyone is like this, why are you hating this special person, learn this from where.  Everyone is different in category, so it is true that until the doctor says, O stand brokers, it is a mess, block it sir, it is empty, if he is telling the truth then he is lying, then there is no harm, get it inserted, anything is fine, the story is something.  Call me and get it inserted, yesterday I was having pain in the stomach, there was a stone inside the bladder, there was a fear of a stone, there was a pain of gas, this was a fear, the stone came out, did it not come out? I belong to this profession, there is a problem in the whole profession, brother, there are all kinds of people, they do this kind of thing, okay, now you can't say the answer, you hit this person and he likes them and this saree is his soldier, so it's like this How can it be that you love the specialist very much, you love the commander and make boils, I am from brother, love the fat also or reduce your hatred, how would it be that the counselor, you hate me, you hate the local.  Sarpanch, you hate local, you don't like, MP, but give you like, whatever is being said, I am not the name of any party, it is such a unique love channel, I do n't feel stressed from within, absolutely because  What I am trying to understand is that it is so nice and good and good but the country and the people politicians, I feel that they will clap me on a stage and give me an award as an athlete like I deserve because of you.  I am making the profession respectable because all kinds of people are going into politics because they never become middle class. Why would we do less? What is the biggest problem? What I am doing is good and this is bad.  If it is not good then it will be less bad. If it is not good then only bad people will go. Now why do you expect from bad people that they will do less good. Do you understand that cash in dicot is 22 oxymorons or whatever.  English term: If you want to do it to him then do it that brother you don't want you to do politics because you fool it's a dirty think ok nice dirty think if someone does then he will be dirty now he is dirty so you are having problem in him being dirty then Go and do it yourself brother because even these clean people who are going into politics are professionals and thus intelligent crowd, all these are parachute drops, these are some grassroots leaders. People who fought for Sarpanch have become big ministers. If you look at their background, they did not win the elections, they did not belong to the university, then the normal man thinks that if he is an intellectual type then he is going to the Rajya Sabha.  If the people are caste from the second route, then this Lok Sabha route will not be possible for us, it will be possible in the coming time, I want to do in my next channel that a normal good person like you should set up a political party.  Make a candidate and I will tell you the method, the channel has just started, you are a good doctor, your name is Chinese professional, you have goodwill, you have a small social circle, you are in a good city and you want a ticket, then I will show you the method, because politics will also change a lot, such political nobody is like this.  GUARANTEED OF GETTING TICKET IF YOU SEE LAST TIME How many people have got ticket in Lok Sabha, then you can also get it, it is not necessary that you have to be only up to the level, it means you have got the feeling. No rogue type image and so many people and that kind of dabang dabang hood dabang no no normal people are also burning depend on state tu state the difference in local politics is not like this but it is chase how do I leave it starting in this video Let's take water, friend, all this is useless, so let us stand up for something good, fighting elections today, which is called independence, vote and get the votes cut, say no one's cut, and that one, that one, the passion from within. You will also come to know that it is as difficult to get votes as the politicians do. You will get the realization that your family also has 10 votes, so they probably did not read you. Out of those, two of yours may have been cheated. I know that you are a blindly disrespectful politician.  Understand that the difficult entry barrier is very low for anyone, you can fight the election. If you have knowledge then please write how much is the security deposit in MP elections. How much is the security deposit in Ma's election and on how many votes is it confiscated? If he does not come, how much is his security, how much is his security? Keep it only so that if he does not contest all the elections, tell me how much is it and how many people can pamper him.  To see how many have this kind of money to do something like this, please tell me, okay, I will make the content very interesting, the content is like this, it is not the content and don't think further. If it doesn't make any difference, then I have no use, it means that things will be seen moving in the society, you people will have a lot of fun, okay, so please watch, understand, things will become more interesting and if you have not subscribed to the channel, then subscribe.  And whatever possibilities become open to you, don't think that it couldn't have happened like this, you don't know them yet, Abhishek Bachchan's first came in it on Time, if you remember, it was the idea of ​​​​making money through UPI till then.  UPI had not come, if you remember, the audience is small in the past, well, time seemed to him like this thank you idea, money reached, money reached and he did not have time, but the idea came, you never nobody can stop and I am an idea in this time.  Come and I have gone so in history, come in time and let this bill happen and the public will enjoy, the politicians have already come on YouTube. If you have noticed, this is a very big middle. You will see this in six to eight months, the election will be uploaded on YouTube, this news channel of India is going to thank you as much as Chillam Chilli does and the audience of YouTube is being seen live on YouTube because of this, you will write this comment, one more thing. I am posting in the comment area of ​​Telegram group because I get voting on it. In Telegram, if you join by subscribing, I also get live survey and voting on many things. Big news channels cast 700 votes and then tell whether the speech was good or bad. By just taking these 700, I am 100% sure, otherwise I will get more than 700 votes in 10-15 days.  Within my thoughts, I too will be a person of thousand votes. Whatever vote you cast on whether I should do this step or not, okay, so please, I have a humble request to you all. On the request to all of you, please join that Telegram group, you may not be the person in it, but the person with the message will have a survey type in it, what do you think, then there will be a choice in it, so you can make the choice like this, then live, I will get the choice and  The interaction we have will be very cool and I will tell you that brother, I asked this and got the answer, my opinion is actually like this but if it is from people's opinion then it will be even more fun South Indian.  The audience is this also Dear North East Ordinance This brother is the kid of the audience is the brother I have a bill request which of you please make it interesting Way bill change about India What is going on, enough is enough, okay enough, time has passed, now is the time for me Tell me the dialogue is fine, a lot of time has passed on the channel, now the time for action is fine and the platform will become such that it will be fun, you will bill all this platform which is my subscriber.  He will feel that yes, something is happening, nor is it happening comfortably, nor is it going in the sun, there is no post, there is no commotion, read it, it is happening with great love and by love we mean absolutely true, we do not say bad words to anyone, we just take names.  Otherwise, what is the meaning? What can be better than this? Only love and affection will be spread. Clarity will be spread that friend, there can be such a thing, there is power, this can also be explained, thank you very match."

    "title": "Politicians And Their New Friends [4nEhI6RX69c].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today's topic is Politician and dear new friends, the latest test topic is very interesting, I am doing a base formation for my viewers, this is the best channel to subscribe, you will not find such content and in this some people started saying to me, Guruji. You made this channel but the agenda is soft. It will come slowly, so today in this video I will reveal my agenda. What is the agenda? What is the flag?  But what is that, what is that, that is tomorrow, I will release it to you in the next part of the video so that you people can have an idea where I am heading and you have to judge me. The story is going to be very interesting, so who are the new friends of the politicians?  You know that story about friends in politics, you have heard it and different politicians have friends, there were old friends who were earlier known as businessmen or yesterday or influencers in terms of Bollywood.  Personality and then Godi media thing, you heard it now, who should join the latest test, Batman, we are now the latest friends of politicians on YouTube, YouTubers, you must have seen that I told you in the video earlier too that if the 2024 elections will be uploaded on YouTube, social media will be ours. Okay WhatsApp Forward Spread Dham song That's that but the story will run now because now the new generation is ahead, go out in the sun and have fun in the rally.  They don't know how to formulate their opinion in advance, so there are many of them on YouTube and they have friends on YouTube. You must have seen them. Tell me the name in the comment section on which YouTubers are there on whose INLD politicians have started coming and on those YouTubes they have seen them.  Have started giving platform, which party comes from which party, how do they come, you tell me, normal people do not have the courage to call you, people from here, people from there, you  I understand, okay, I will also tell you my agenda, listen carefully, it will be fun, okay, because whatever I am getting done and getting it done, it is not just any six, okay, so you must have seen it recently and tell me who is this?  It's a matter of state, your GK will be checked, I will get to know what is the awareness level of my audience. Recently, on an OAT platform, it happens that the winner of a reality show on OAT is from a normal small province.  The boy's minister sahib came to her function because she collected three lakhs also, this is her on YouTube, that is her Neeraj Chopra [music] serial going on, one of them is fine, that empty man, no, I do n't want to do that, no.  So he gets it in a wrong way these days, Khali Das Das Munde, that saying of the people of Haryana, you can tell it is fine, it is achievement, achievement is nothing, those leaders standing on the stage are educated.  You know that too, but there is a compulsion, they are showing him the achievement that he has earned a lot of fame. Only after raising Rs 3 lakh, I am telling you that when you bring the numbers, be it of stupid people or of intelligent people, vote count in democracy.  If he spends Rs 3 lakhs then if this politician associates with him then it will be transferred, then if he is sitting on YouTube with Rs 80 lakh crores and he is giving the platform to the politicians.  Coming and flattering her, the read sign of the year on YouTube also gives coolness, I am telling you, look how the times have changed, these media people of yours have already declared who are we with, those who keep making noises, they do not know.  Will you open this channel, you are a sophisticated new creature on YouTube, it is okay that they will ask comfortably, they will ask and influence, and what happens, what is the proposal of a human being, you like me, my Now I am talking about something, now I have taken someone, okay, the leader, and now you, if he is with the ideology of the party, then you Guruji, you too and I too, yes yes for sure then he  The vote will definitely be there and the one who hates the party very much and he was listening to me and liked me, then he will also go to me because it does not change so quickly but the one who is in the middle is like Damadol situation.  Are there any or the opinion has not been formed yet  But he likes me a lot and I don't hate him. It's okay, whoever this other leader has brought, he will be inclined towards him. No, whatever political party you are trying to do, you do this only think of this in Hindi, there is a special on YouTube channel.  The party is visible more if you go to the local level. Of course, now at your level, if you do not have that language then you, like my audience is of Hindi or a little English, then you probably will not get to see it.  But if you do everything then the new land of work is your YouTube channel and now I will tell you my agenda also because now I have made a video of mine, I had a painting behind me in it, there was a flower in the painting, okay and related, you Lakshmi ji.  Lakshmi ji's flower Vastu, I told many of you who are subscribers of my old channel that I am also an astrologer, so Vaastu and astrology are other things, if you combine that with the party, then I will make you enjoy it.  You dog me by changing my party in every third video and finally you will know what you want to do, so I will tell you right now, I am also an agent, my agenda is to make all the politicians, no matter which party they belong to, public servants.  The agenda is to make the politicians weaned from politics. Guru can do anything. Whatever politicians have come into politics, the public should wean them. Now Janardan asked him how will we make so much demand to the public.  Be it a leader of any party, he will remain brother, I don't have to do it, there is no benefit in politics in this, then people will move away from normal and genuine, politics will also become less like a government job type or normal and many times it will happen like this, first you first, then you.  Become an MP, buy a ticket, there is no taste, that clarity has to be spread among the entire public, but let me tell you an example, you took a picture worth Rs 200-300, it is okay and that picture was of a superstar last year only, see this.  Which Chaddha did someone come up with like this, the picture of a superstar is ok, tell me which superstar is this, the public showered so much rubbish on so many codes, if it was not good because the public would be demanding, advice, it was a picture of Rs 30400, it has gone bad, Momo also gets spoiled sometime. Now I am going cyber, if my mocktail has gone bad then what will people know but so many people are backless and poor actor has disappeared, I am no longer in this.  Is this a good thing or should I have done this or that? Here you will see in all my videos, I will not discuss what is good and what is great, I will not discuss who is good and who is great because every man is looking at a man from his mirror.  One man's truth is another man's lie, every man has his own truth and whatever is our old knowledge of our country, if you don't believe in the date then read it.  So it's a simple thing, brother-in-law are actions  And the consequences are nothing right you do some action and because also you can change de action please accept de concept again and again aise aise hi miligi aise aise you have shown so much loyalty to your wife and friend and to your parents, mother and brother na you are here political party  You are showing that they have no loyalty of their own, ticket distribution will happen from here to here, let's see how they will change first, I mean, if it is Gurugram.  Let's talk to Gurugram only. Who is the MP of Gurugram? How many times has the party been changed? If he still wins, will you tell him that this is a bad thing, what is bad, but whose ideology is you with and with the party? You understand.  Understand yourself what am I going to tell you, you see many people keep changing tomorrow, not the fairies but the alliance changes everything. People, the problem of food and drink in the North Indian belt is not the same in the North East, the issue is different. i this  I am saying, if you want to do the first thing, then I have a request, you can go and watch it above, there are people like this who are here also, I have secretly started a channel in Koni, brother, it is not necessary to watch your channel Naked Shot.  Politicians were on difficulty, you join politics only if you pay ₹ 3400 ₹ 500 to a small service provider who is taking ₹ 500 from you, meaning of life in Haryana, please type lot of Hariyani people.  No bill, no matter whether I do this or not, I get only this much. Brother, the politicians will have to say this through their mouth, it is not in our power, we cannot do anything, the public is different, the public is defending the politician, that is.  Now I say to him, whether it is the state or the Centre, the government is less, protecting the citizens, joining a political party, every person working in every house, every worker, what is happening brother, hey, such a braided sir, I am happy.  Do it, I am not happy because the one who is not happy, the one who is nothing then and the one who has not revealed the vote, everyone is running after him, it is okay, let me also tell you that until your food, clothing and house are not sorted out, you are an intellectual philosopher.  He cannot go places, he needs rest, he needs peace, because if there is no arrangement for dinner, then you cannot be an intellectual. Intellectuals have been maligned a lot because those who were intellectuals also Overhero times, everyone becomes corrupt, but I will make a separate video on that. The power game happens, that's why they say no, no, everyone has an agenda, you have an agenda, everyone has what they want, but are we the public 's brother, whom will we vote for?  Will ask him because he is saying that if I take it, this is a party, I am voting for it, then I have voted, so I cannot ask the question of whether I get that slip on my forehead or not after voting.  something after Put the slip here and go around and see that I voted by asking in this stepwell and I am asking questions, do n't ask why is this happening unnecessarily, friend, you tell me what question should I ask when I go to someone for whom I did not even vote. Your wife asks questions to your neighbor or asks your husband that he was in love with you as well as for me. You answer why this is happening inside the house or with the neighbor. Brother, these days men are very bad. hey it's a forest  Home You are committed, why don't you tear her down, why do n't you do the same, why don't you lift the fragrance, why doesn't he vote for you, uncle, look at this, I am roaming around taking votes, if Ma Saheb, MP Saheb, if the party keeps changing its ideology, then Rakhi will do comedy inside Maharashtra.  Who gave the board of circular chair? If someone loses votes, then if he gives, he loses respect. You have done comedy and are with the public. Today is your day and you are pampering them for their loyalty. All your common people are making fool of your leader. They are making fool of anyone of any party, of any ideology. You are like the elder of the house who has not divided the property, his dog has to pay the bills.  There is some meeting, he doesn't tell in advance, no family member tells in advance, I will give you 20%, I will give you 10, I will leave bananas for you, that one in Noida, his flat in Gurgaon, that one in Mumbai, this one and so on.  If Sher Market tells this like this then many people will say Namaste and those who got cleared will take it as granted. In Inter Books, do you do politics at home also? Every person is a politician of India and there is as much politics as there is in the houses of India.  No, this much politics is not a story, so you are the same politics, who is my subscriber, in whose house politics is happening too, why are you not thinking about politics, why are you not playing real politics, Babli, with your WhatsApp ID. Why don't you start writing these decisions on WhatsApp DP or on stories or on social media? What's happening in today's status? When there is a status, you have to write marriage, only divorce, some have to write single, some have to write single ready.  You have to write auspicious, I have to write something committed, it is like this, brother, we should also put the status, also from the political party, what is my political application, mostly write 98 committed notes, this decide note, this decide then  Only one interview will be held, no one says this, this is how politics is, one thing has to be said, one man, this politics is bad, Gandhi himself is doing the same things now, what are you doing, tell me, what did you do, reduced this, did that.  If you do, then it means you should not praise them and be suspicious, they are all just one bag, you should not hate them and you should not love them, you should not perform aarti for them and you should not show them any harm, they should be a little different.  A little bit of resentment, you are not enjoying, brother, what are you doing, we have not enjoyed in 75 years, we have not enjoyed even in five, we have not enjoyed even in 10, we have not enjoyed even in one, we are not enjoying and want more, heart asks for more, we are not enjoying.  I did n't enjoy it, I didn't enjoy it, I didn't enjoy it, I didn't enjoy it, you are okay with those things, oh those things, that child failed with you too, he had not studied in the class 25 years ago, so you are a Math.  I had failed him  But not by talking, why did he fail? He is not even that intelligent. See, this had happened again in the 8th and then in the 12th, please get a job. Warrior of YouTubers and a guy who reduces the motivation of YouTube channel. Now he has given an interview to the politician.  He is taking it and he is saying that it is useless, it is good, the platform is good, the relationship and the questions too, meaning what people ask is a question of quality, you suck the message.  Or what question do you suck like a cat? Someone asked this question many years ago. People of India are not fooled. Many of our people are fools. One day we will take this mother and maybe our life will be improved and that too in the middle class.  I too am being very very, no matter how many classes I take, I do n't enjoy wearing a shirt. I am also a person who likes to sit in kurta-pajami. Guruji, but this is a deliberate attempt.  I want you to get into people, I am understanding, I am thinking, I can understand Hindi and I want you to be thinking, water thinking citizens, I have decided not to talk about them, that has already happened to them, what do they have to talk to them about what you have decided. Lia, we will talk about things that will spread awareness in our country. We politicians, whatever party we belong to, should do it like this. This is just a short time for both of them, they have to do this.  List: If you liked my agenda, please type. If you are with me, please type. And in the comment area, you will get the link of the telegram group which is newly opened. Do activities on it and I will take the vote in five days. Do you want to contribute a little? Maybe from inside you have a better spirit than me, but to do all this, you are busy in your job, you are busy in your world, so I am giving you contribution and platform, I am giving to the politicians. I am not giving a platform, I am giving a platform to the public that we have to join, we have to join and we are such an awareness board, so I know that whoever has to vote has to vote only one vote. Gives and see someone is sad, see someone is unhappy, no relief, no one has a choice, we will discuss all that thing, here you bill never see me telling you, you vote on home, so don't think this is what I am saying disclaimer  You judge me, I will not take any side of any particular party that it is good, I will not call anyone bad because according to me neither any one is absolutely good nor any one is absolutely bad. My opinion is that every friend is important for democracy.  It is very important for this, so please stay away from new friends of politicians. Politicians have new friends like us on YouTube, so now we too are looking at them from the mirror like this.  Which direction is it taking? On most of the YouTube channels, I have seen everything being done in black and white. What is this polarization type, this is towards this, this is towards this, brother-in-law, this is objectivity, subjectivity and this is not English, all this is not there.  Brother, let's discuss a little more. If the conversation cannot happen like this, then the topic is a little like this. What do you want to talk about? You will get long episodes, there will be long awareness and this is a journey story and destination too.  It will not be seen that there is only one YouTube and the story is not going, nothing is happening, you have also seen my other channels, whatever I have said is making an impact in the society, in the movie it is getting some kind of success, in the ministry, in a business.  She is coming in real estate, she is doing articles, if she wants to play out all the trends and things, then don't think that this time waste will come like this, by doing something in it, you will see in the video, sometimes chillam chilli, sometimes your hormones are surging, anger is surging.  Is  It wo n't look like this, peace, peace, because the man who is calm, relaxed, takes a long breath, has seen and smiles here and after seeing him, keep smiling, brother, you are playing a good game, we will also play with you, okay, only then it becomes fun.  Only then can one decide between playing and fighting and whether mine is better or yours is better."

    "title": "Politicians, Businessmen and Middle Class Rant [jPoyQg9WFZQ].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today's topic will be looking beyond the normal things which are talked about by the politicians and the general public, especially the middle class, gets carried away by it saying that yes, yes, it seems right, it is like this, there is truth in it, we will discuss that thing.  This video has been triggered by a short video of a popular opposition leader, i.e. our top most leader, in which he has told about pickpocketing that there are three ways of pickpocketing.  Let's operate, one person will come forward, he will get distracted, the second one will pick the pocket and the third one will remain standing like this, so he has taken the names of three people in it and it sounds like great creativity, okay and I also enjoyed it a lot.  If I even have the courage to speak like this, I enjoyed it, but I don't want the public to get misled in these terms. I feel that as a middle class friend, an issue is being made that normally this politician has helped this businessman.  If curry and this has grown then there is discussion beyond that, this discussion is clarity, higher order thinking, now will I defend any businessman here, am I a political party special, am I not a leader, friend, I am not like that, if you see it completely then you will understand.  What am I trying to say, let's start carefully, if you are middle class, your child goes to some school, you are in trouble, this is how your life is going on, he is a businessman, so called, someone helped him, the airports came to him.  Work  The business has come, whatever has come, what difference has it made in your life? Oh no, but this is not a good thing, hey, the other businessman should be suffering, the one who should have got it and did not get it, he is not making noise, you raised your voice for him. Because you hate the rich anyway. The middle class hits the rich. I am also not a big fan of the poor because the rich are talking about the poor. Look, you used to go to that airport earlier.  Let me take an example and tell you that there is a lot of commuting in Ahmedabad and it was there earlier too. Tell me those who have been to Ahmedabad Airport, has it made any difference or not but they are taking money. Yes, there is no such thing as a facility without taking money. If you take money then there is facility.  You get 100 150 200 300 400 and everything is smooth and good and those who buy flight tickets are 89 10 12 in small sector of Haj and so much more in foreign countries.  You take four people, brother, is there any poor person? If you start going to the airport or even the poor, then the definition of poor has also changed. You see what you want. Rotten country. Earlier it used to be like this in our country that only the government used to do business.  So the PSUs that used to invest so much money in it, Air India were holding their heads and said, take this Rs. 3 thousand crores, Rs. 25000 crores, Rs. 5 thousand crores, that is fine, then when the government takes the initiative, it can do something to someone. You drive it, you drive it, hey, if you help him, should you help Jeff Bezos? Alone, Tesla has not come to Moscow, right now, please help Tesla, do n't these businessmen provide jobs, they themselves sit at home and eat.  No, but if he became very rich, then isn't it your share, brother, that tax is like this, these loans are like this, he took it and then he became rich like this, so if he is not rich then will you become rich?  The government has to take away the money and give it to the poor, your middle class is a fish, nothing is coming, they don't reduce our taxes, if the tax is low, then in the higher slab, above 50 lakhs, above that, if it is above 40 lakhs, then you are rich.  Why is that rich person not paying tax? No, corporate tax is Rs. 25. Hey brother, as soon as he takes his salary, it becomes personal, but if I tell you that your money will stay here and here.  Tax is a little less but you will have to pay tax as soon as you leave, so keep being happy here, it will keep growing, then you also open one, who has forbidden you to put your MCA in the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, for SME or to open your own company, open a private limited, do business.  Who has refused to do the job? There is grinding and competition in it. 5 lakh crores are two lakh crores from these big capitalists. Alas, why did it become from 3 lakh crores to 4 lakh crores? Alas, nothing happens to me.  One lakh crore rupees have been taken away. Hey, don't you take your share? Baba, if the country wants to grow, it will have to be done only by these people, if it is they who provide employment opportunities to the population, this is what you have to see, friend, the infrastructure, garbage is collected in front of your house.  It is not picking up, you have to see who is picking up, to whom did the contract of Rs. 50 go, the 50 you have to pay, you have to pay ₹ 1, someone is picking up the garbage in India.  000 per month, but if you give it to them once, then they will have a monopoly and then those who go to our 8 will take ₹ 10 per month, yes they will take ₹ 120, they will take ₹ 1200, no because it is a competitive world.  If he doesn't take it, then other people will come, things are done through tender, bidding is done, wherever the private sector is providing electricity, it is getting good, it is not going well and they are getting full recovery.  The government is there, everyone has laid their wires there and half the time it is not available, then privatization, if it is what is this thing, what is the approach that has been taken because if it does not belong to the poor then there is no one in it, the poor, the poor, no one is making noise here, middle class.  Class plays a role and creates an environment. The middle class should say that brother, like America, there were so many people in agriculture. America progressed only when they left agriculture, which is a low productivity thing. People have moved on to other things, but in India, if someone wants to take the land of the entire farmer, then the middle class should say, yes, take the land of the entire farmer, the rich capitalists will take it. I am going to have a great video on that. You see, brother, don't buy, take a lease and pay rent to him, the ownership should remain with the farmer, I also agree that I am also a farmer, but you come and we don't do anything on this, all of you together do something.  Do it and give us a good fare  Give it to me, if I get double the money from that farm without doing any farming, without sweating, then what is the problem and that farm is mine and if someone tells me to put an option in it that son, if you even sweat, then it will be double.  You are getting it without any sweat, brother, even if you work here, you also have this salary, why can't this happen, because even if the government wants to do anything, if you do a little, then you will be sold, you will help him. You did it, you helped him, tell me, if there was a king's system, like the system used to be there earlier, then they used to openly allow businessmen, if the king of this country, the government of this country will not support the capitalists and businessmen of this country, then?  Who will do it already? Those of you who have some knowledge of these things, trade practices, international treaties and all this also tell us that you have to give level playing field to the others too who come from outside but at the back door, every  The country does it for its own people, it is mine and the one who should be hit should be hit by other capitalists that friend, you are on his side, it is such a big ocean, the blue ocean of Indian opportunity is an opportunity for everyone to earn money in India.  They are getting something, the only thing is that someone is making noise. Hey brother, if their competitors did not get this, then they got something else. Everyone is worried till now.  Everyone is earning money and they all are one among themselves, there is no enmity among themselves, they are saying that it is okay, you do yours, that is all this, it is wrong to do this with friendship because the rich man who has 5 lakh 10 lakh 20  The company which has reached lakh crores, will reach such a valuation and the company itself will grow suddenly, where will you get this small one with Rs 500 crores, whatever contracts will be left, whatever will be made of it. Also, if you want to see the entire airport or the entire infrastructure or not, did you benefit from it against him? Yes, you did, accept it, why are you feeling chilly, did your son go and plant it there, or did he take my son's share? Lal Office Office House Number 100 A 100 My son had to lose the contract of Mumbai Airport or Delhi or Ahmedabad or whatever, so many airports will lose if private players do not come and manage. So there will be dirt, you talk about your experience, no, my friend, the road is fine, the bridge is fine, because this is what the middle class wants to get from the progress of the country, nothing else, you will not get any subsidy, you will not get any free electricity or water.  No one gets reservation, half of you do not get reservation, those who do not get it, and those who get reservation, that too, if they had reached so many places, then what would be the need for so many reservations, it is just a game of government jobs, so someone somewhere.  If you are not able to reach, then take what you are getting, I am addressing the middle class, brother, you will get only better things outside in the growth of the country, you will get a road, you will get an airport, you will get a clean railway station, it will become one which belongs to the general public.  That is the other way, whether you want to give them the contract or not, don't do it, and then they will distribute this money among the poor, then you will be happy, give more kg rice to the poor people, then you will not get anything. So the businessman is not giving you two or three rupees, he is charging something and he is giving it to you. You can ask him, I gave you Rs 50, Rs 200, Rs 300, I gave you so much, so what did I get?  The question can be asked, is there accountability? Where else is the accountability? There was accountability for the government's PSUs, everyone has got the job, no one is doing the work, there is no efficiency, the union is playing the game of the product.  I do n't know that HMT has been running in losses for so many years. Do you know about Air India and there are 1500 such PSUs, some are Navratna, some do very well, but do you want the government to run the business and then because if any contract is lost?  If any private entity will get it, will you like it or not? It is something like saying that why is this topper student in his class topping, why is no one else getting a chance, this is the teacher's favourite.  He is a student, he is the most honorable child, brother, he will come first, you change the teacher and the teachers also change, in India the teachers i.e. those who are running the country, they came, they came, they came, this topper will remain a topper, tomorrow there will be a second one like this. Suppose the government changes, will these people who are worth Rs 10-20 lakh crores come down to Rs 1 lakh crore? Did they just float in the air or do they have no assets, no underline loan, no underline book value?  There is no underline business, there is no underline cash flows, or there is no management, or there is no brain, or the business is running in the air. Why are you jealous of someone from your own India, if he is progressing like this, then it is because of him that Do it for any reason, become that reason, you do that, otherwise what is the alternative you want, if he doesn't become then who should become, who should become some other rich man from his own community, that is, don't give the contract to someone worth Rs. 5 lakh crores. Give it to the one with crores of rupees or don't give it to the one with lakhs of rupees, give it to him or give it to your son, this is how you will get it while sitting at home, that means he keeps watching IPL matches in the morning and evening, he keeps watching T20, before that he is watching the World Cup.  If it is yours, then give it to your son, is it possible, tell me, if you put as much negativity on it, everyone should say yes, then what is the loss, what is not, he gave it to him as per our rights, what was the result of that, how did you give it to me?  don't understand  All the things are left out of bidding, bidding is done transparently, now there is e-bidding, there is one man on e-bidding, it is like saying, if Virat Kohli is hitting sixes, fours and is hitting centuries in the World Cup and  There are so many stars in India, brother, BCCI favors Virat Kohli. Virat Kohli has talent, brother, as long as he has the talent, he will continue. How many bosses of BCCI?  Look at the time of Sachin Tendulkar, who had such a good career. Look at the time of Virat Kohli, what has changed? The one who has talent will be seen only at the top, while the small players at the bottom will come and go, they will cry, they will keep talking, they will keep talking.  Why are all the fools given opportunities? Brother, a little bit of recommendation is enough, a little bit of friendship is good, it is there everywhere, but what harm is it causing to you, you check this, what harm is it causing to you?  Things are good, the biggest thing is that I, this argument does not mean the same to you, this is a business house, this is a business house, there are many, many, many, okay, you feel that it is progressing, there is favoritism, it is benefiting.  So brother, its listed companies, buy shares, who has forbidden, he is saying that which one is private, its listed company, those companies are also growing, are there any different ports, some have some, some have some, brother put it.  Take the money, people have already earned money, then someone will come and make a report of another country that these Indians have been cut off from the dense forests, cut off their disease, do the shooting, do this, make a story, rest of the Indians, we are ready to do our own thing, isn't anyone of ours  The man has reached here, we have to pull it ourselves, isn't it crime mentality? Yes yes, it is bad, you have not taken the lion, those who have taken it, they have got the chilli, whatever it is, they have sold it, whatever is the valuation or By whatever means, brother, the businesses with these assets will also do very well, even though the return on assets is low right now because these assets are limited, whoever took the contracts, who took the ports, the more the business will grow in the port, the more India's import and export, whatever it is.  Road people will earn money, road people will earn money, the traffic in the airport is bound to increase, if 100 people were traveling then it will be 200, 400, the number of ships is increasing, beyond this I am also clear.  I will make videos. If the opportunity is there, do you have it and through the share market and demat, do you not have the brain to take up this business or the spillover effect that will come from it that if the experience of the airport is very good, tourism will increase, then someone will think of building a hotel. Which shares can you buy or keep crying over this, made him rich, made him rich, leave it, he is becoming rich, so tell me what will happen next, he is fixing the infrastructure for the people.  If the experience is good then if you want to travel then which company's shares can you buy? Which is the company which does some work in the lounge? Write the name starts with D. It has some shares between Rs 500-600. It is not advised.  I did not mention the name of the buyer, I am doing GK test from here that there are many such companies of the airport which are managing the airport but they are managing something at the airport and are earning a lot of money from it.  And you can also earn or keep crying, he has become rich, he has become rich, look, the rich will be only the one who deserves it, you have to deserve yourself, crying will do something, otherwise I hope you will understand this thing.  If you watch, that pocket-grabbing video is a good one, according to me, but it has no meaning, its meaning is less, that video is just that the leader is showing it to show dominance, it is the job of the politician to show it, we too would have enjoyed it.  There is an audience but the intelligent audience will ask once, what is the problem, yes, it has been taken, they say, you have picked up your pocket, where did you pick up your pocket, brother, no businessman is in your pocket, otherwise all the businesses are picking your pockets.  Because whatever product is made for Rs. 100, it is not given to you for Rs. 100, nor is it given for Rs. 110, 120, 140, because if there is profit then everyone is a thief, it means only a middle class.  It is okay because you go to work in these companies and they give you this money, then you are absolutely right, but if you sell their products, then you would have become a thief, they would have become thieves, hey, Capitalism and the modern system of the world. Understand, instead of crying, how can it be that you went, I would say that today you drank two cups of tea and you wasted 20 minutes, you are a thief, you did not work in the office, you had a stomach ache, you did not attend the meeting. saturday  You did not pick up the call at night. You are also a thief. But who will say this because you are not called to vote bank, but all this is theft. That share price was Rs 100 and now it has become Rs 200, which means it is theft because that too. How did it suddenly become 100? Did this happen? Sentiment also becomes sentiment. Nothing has changed physically. If the management changes then the P/B ratio changes. Every company has one company.  Cupid by Cupid, its management was changed in September. Look, Sher Khan has lost his job. Nothing, there is a company which is running. How did he run away? Now say, has the market been stolen? The market is driven by emotions. Sentiments. You should use your mind, awaken your intellect, consciousness and conscience and you can gain from other things. A Tegra group has been given and join it in the comment section.  Do it, I will teach you things in a very good way through webinars. There is also a comprehensible happiness course. I have a very good course going on. The first class is on 3rd December. There is only one intro class. There are five-six classes. Fees are very low. H2 You will get things. Thank you Yuri for moving forward."

    "content": "Hello friends power gives clouds to everyone, people get clouds with power. I get this comment a lot in this area, generally I get it a lot, people say that Guru ji it is all like this, when politicians come to power, everything gets clouds, so today we will talk about nature  We will understand the power of power, there is another small party which also has people for 10-11 years, it is often said about their leader that they used to say this earlier, now they too have become like this, after becoming like this everyone becomes like this  Those big ones who are the biggest leaders, even among their elders they speak like this that I said it like this, I said it like that, it was not said like that, it was said like that, among the elders of the third leader too, I am writing about them too in the comment section. You must have heard once in Jaipur that he had said that power sponsor and when he had said it then it means in India and from Bharat, does it mean that what is he saying, what is this power, what is this nutrition, this is his  You didn't even understand the matter, okay now don't paint me as their player, I am not loyal to them, I tell you in the big power  I have been experiencing power in the Indian context. What is wrong with India when no one's intentions are so bad? Everybody who is a politician wants power. And you too need power in your home, father. If you are one, then you want to be powerful in your home. If you are a mother then you also want to be powerful in the house. Everyone wants power and with the power a man wants to do something good but the fact is that in our country the power that one has is not there to live on it and to do something good.  All your energy is wasted in this. Do you understand what I am trying to say, brother in law, there is no brain juice left on the politicians because the power that has been acquired has been told to different people by hearing many stories. When a person tries to actually get that power,  I reach there for the first time and then I am told that you know these are the limitations, you know these are the laws, you know what kind of thing is there in India, if you want to do this work, then you keep getting confused about this law. then you say this is confusing so why do n't we do it then we do this but this  If you do it then it will not happen, if the public is not satisfied, then you change the laws, so to change the law you need some numbers, you need power, then you have to work hard, this is a very similar cycle, this is the video, that's why I am making it so that the public gets so disintegrated thinking that if A is not there then everything is bad, this will happen with the power of A because there are so many constitutions, now as I tell you through my example, like I have this channel, my channel has my audience Middle class is defined, so I do n't want to please the lower class here. I can't say anything against anyone here. I don't even want their votes or their subscription. So I am operating in a very investment-oriented way. I am operating in a nice way.  If I don't contest the election, my work will go well, but think about a party, it needs all kinds of people, it needs people from every caste, it needs people from every sect, it is telling stories to everyone and all of them are interesting and conflicting, so it becomes worse  It's difficult but people consider it very, very difficult  It is very difficult because if he does not do this then he will not remain in power. So the person who comes to power, his power is full of money, he realises that he thought he could do a lot with this power, but he could not do it. This and then his energy gets wasted in keeping him in power, mostly those leaders do better who do not cling to power too much and say brother I have to do it, I will tell you with an example, you must have heard the name of Prime Minister, VP  Singh is fine, he was the prime minister for 11 months, okay, he created a big mess and left, okay, and he was not capable of anyone, no one had brought it before him and till date he has taken it, it does not go back to anyone, you understand, I  What am I pointing at, if I know so much then I am sir, it would be good for many people, then they do something like this, so the dream budget came at that time, if you remember what is called dream budget and that  At that time Madhu Dandwat was the finance minister, if you remember, during VP Singh's time, that too if he was on Dream  There was a budget of 89 and then of 97, these two budgets are remembered very well but the budget changed and both the times these were secret governments which came and went, people do not even know their names, I mean it is something like this, some such player came in 10.  I am a batsman and he hit three sixes, you understand what I am saying, so this person should be the one who is in power and does not need power, now as you saw in that, what is there in him is that there are two tenures of 4 years, after two there is a tenure of three  President cannot be other than vice president, if you ask about any popular personality then Bill Clinton still looks young, Obama also looks young, even President Boost who was junior, they all finished their life after completing 18 years and are still roaming around Why brother, the one who became president at the age of 42, mother, if someone becomes president in India in a balanced manner, he is not going to leave it till 85 years, if he is popular and good, then he will come and go till 43 years, you just look at it, now these people get the power  This is also a taste of  This is such a thing that now there should be a discussion on this thing that this power, yes okay the story is like in Russia, he once became the President and then the Prime Minister and he is stuck and that is because then he is busy in staying in power. Energy gets wasted. If you see that there are fixed ten years for some things, like the head of the institution or the company, if you say that you have 3 years, you have 2 years, you have five years, then he knows only this much right now.  You have to leave behind your legacy, you have to do something before leaving. Well, there is a lot of benefit in that one, so you have to understand in this power that we do it like this, if I get it, I will make you the Prime Minister.  Done, make him the finance minister who is listening, if you visualize yourself, by releasing you, friend, so much cannot be changed for the perspective, it is just some media management power, perspective can be changed, something big can be done  Strength is there, brother, the resources of our country have a growth rate of six to eight percent  It is just the same, it is not like you have made it 18%, it would be 2 percent, you can take any data by taking an average of 5:30, if the economy grows by 20 trillion, then if it was going to one trillion, it would be 89 percent.  Of course the pay will be a little less in the future because, brother, if you are getting 40 marks, then you can increase your marks by 20% to 48, but if you are sitting at 90, then it takes effort to make it 95, this is the base effect, you people understand this, but  The country is going well between 7 to 8%, it will go at that level only, okay, if you take any one thing, it cannot be very great, magical, nor can it fall down, but for the rest, you have to manage the headlines.  Ok, so this power which we get sad about on its own, hey, after coming to power, he is not doing anything, I do not want to benefit myself, my saga brother becomes a minister and you feel that hey, why the contract, camera, my brother has become a minister  I went here and wrote to you, you have to apply this  What has to be done has to be done and even if you qualify, the public is standing there saying that he has benefited his brother, nepotism, corruption, etc. will go on like this, so as soon as you become a minister, the first thing you do is to cut the cards of your closest relatives.  Two, first of all, brother, if tomorrow someone says that I have benefited you, then give me your husband, you will feel relieved after some time, otherwise you are staying in power, you are actually not able to do good to your relatives, liver side, common people, common people  What will you do only when someone fills your stomach, this Corolla, this oxymoron or which English word is it, this is such a situation which means a very cash 22 situation that friend I did not know this and then frustration has come at this time  that friend, can't I do even this much for myself, is my child not capable enough to do it because as soon as he does something then they treat him like this, oh brother he is a politician's child, he is a powerful minister's child, that's why today what is a day without it Politics will be only for those who are getting married, meaning if Abhishek Bachchan would have benefited in the beginning that Amitabh Bachchan's child got a lot of movies, some of his movies were also hits, it kept going, but now whatever you get from Netflix, it's fine, what do you say about the net, web  Whether you get a series or it comes on Netflix, they also tell the story, by calling it Oat Ka Bachchan, so now he must be taking it on his talent, friend, he will do something, now that Ghoomar movie has come, if the acting is good in it  If it is there then it is there, it means it is not like that the child of a person with power can never do anything, if someone 's child is good here then friend, if the child is an eye then he will also not do anything, it should disappear completely, so this  Power is a very negative thing because we have thought that if you sit for a story then you should not have any fun, you should not serve the story at all, how can this happen friend, how can this happen today because I am a practical person  I would not call myself a grounded leader but I am an observer and I am communicating the matter to the connected leaders in Haryana through dialogues.  Let's do it like this, if it will be like this then it's okay, the daughter-in-law will have to do the job, if this is power then the meaning of power does not remain, if the system becomes like that then understand brother-in-law, it is being considered as not some great power and this is a  The thing is that I am disillusioning the politicians and telling the human beings too the politicians or the small politicians at the bottom that brother, there is nothing great like this, you will not be able to do anything for your family because you will do the movement, we are sitting with love and that person is going to tell you Hey, he did it because no one has the courage to tell anyone that brother, I will work hard for 25 years to become a politician, if I don't benefit my brother, then what will I do for you, to benefit you, first I will do it for the benefit of 25 years, I will benefit my brother  I will take advantage of my district, I will take advantage of my community, I will take advantage of my people, I will take advantage of my feet, I do n't need the courage to say this, first I will fill my stomach, then as much as I can fill, then yours.  I will take advantage of it, if there is any other channel whose subscribers are then this power of  I will not make them benefit, I will not make them know myself, they also know, so they will shout the most, then they will monitor, then they will publish that this person did it, this person did it to this person, that is why this caste is so helpless in the system that in actual it also benefits  I can do it because look what the system is, understand the system of leaders, first try to fill their own stomach, then try to fill the stomachs of their devotees, whatever you do, even after that if there are resources then it is of those people who  Right now, I have n't reached the third one yet, but before that, I give it to them from here itself, and then today, what is the result? Sometimes, this power goes to that side, then these people reduce it, so whatever that thing is, pumpkin  It had to be cut, it had to be divided, it was neither cut properly nor would he tell and no one could enjoy it, so this power is useless to him. There are such big people who remained prime minister for 10 years and did nothing like this, tell me, they should never be seen in such power.  People come and just keep listening and watching, nothing seems to happen to them, they are like a Big Bus  The program is going on, there is relief now, now see, now sit, now do this, now do that, now you are happy, whatever clapping you do, very good and you like you my toffee, so Delhi, do n't you get happy after putting a toffee in his mouth, is n't it your brother  is it there isn't it ok ok hey give me dal too do you ever understand what am I trying to say power actually understand in India in our country we are feeling that we will get it or my gram seller should get it and one  There is more truth, okay there is more truth, now as I say, increase the subscribe amount, brothers and sisters, please increase it, ₹ 10,000 employees, increase it to lakhs, now after making it one lakh, the YouTube algorithm takes it up, then there is no need to beg so much No, now you are understanding what I am saying, when you become a leader of a certain level, then you do not need to beg that much, first I have to beg for more in specialty, okay, then I have to lie down more in the mother, but then you become a powerful leader  If yes, you will see it there, that is, the block  Till then people beg more, do not say Kariman now, please subscribe, it is number one, do not say that, please subscribe, that too by taking an example of one power, I am telling you that there is power dynamic change, you bill, only make people powerful, get that power bill  not give anything directly, you is the message, this is Guruji 's gravity, awakening, I am giving you my message from Gurugram and still speaking with a straight face, brothers and sisters, please please subscribe, make it one lakh once and then mine  See my complexion, see my reality, see my real face, right now I am begging, after 1 lakh I will not do anything, this is what happens, this is what happens, it is suppose you also what do you think that whoever knew a person when  He used to roam around on a scooter, he used to roam around normally, now he has reached this level, so will he look at you like that, will he give you something, we become very happy, people of our caste, community, our area, this is you, people from the village, relatives or nearby  It will do good that now we have a share in the power  It seems that I am telling the truth of life, I tell it carefully by taking examples, people think in caste politics that your caste will go up and this caste politics is happening like they say Lal Yadav does caste politics  Lal Yadav does not do cash politics, Mulayam Singh Yadav does not do cash politics, what nonsense are you talking about friend, we should listen to this carefully brother, Lal ji does not say that all the boys are good, Lal ji says my son is good, make him  At least you made him deputy commissioner, Lal ji said that remember, this is the most educated and intelligent boy who is not his, mother, I am telling you as an example, so it is not caste politics, Baba ji, you are happy with that  Where are we going sir, the name of yours which this brother in law I also belong to you community, I belong to date politics and this state, and we cannot even do it because if we do it then we will give it to the next one and your turn comes so low if you have to do something  If it happens then it will be done by such people who are very close to him. No, how can it make your number, your number is anyway very far away, no, it is ours, it is ours, I will tell you with a different example like Neeraj Chopra ji who won an Olympic medal, okay now when an Indian won it, then first of all all the Indians became happy because  We have accepted that he is ours, he is our son, now that we have done that, that feeling of pride has come, after that we see that the people in the village are happier, the community people are happy, then the state people are facilitating it separately. Yes, they belong to the organization, they are putting up different photos of their own powder but the fact is that whoever it is, you did n't get a penny from it, you may be happy, you want to do our community caste, we are so fit, he is fit, he gets medals from you. You did not get six packs by winning, your son did not get selected in 100m, you did not get admission in Delhi University in India quota, nothing is happening to you then will be happy but don't start getting into this to make my guy mine  Make him my man, if he becomes mine then it will be of no use to me, it will not be of any use to anyone, make him a good man Make a small man, make a confused man and make him a man who doesn't have his own thoughts, the same thing that I am telling you, all this is consciously coming forward in people's mind, that is why all the bachelors are gaining power and status everywhere.  Look at the country level, look at the leader level, these people were roaming around with their Kunbis, 10-15 kids and by doing all this, they have lagged behind a bit, so this is also a fact, this is also a factor because ultimately it also has its limitations.  Everyone has their limitations, that too sometimes you cannot do it, I am very supportive, you and I help you, so match you, reset your power and I don't expect anything at that moment, you try to do something but my brother is so many people again then I tell you this  I am telling that we should spread this among my subscribers in politics and among all the people, please subscribe a little so that the message reaches more people that we should not be too hungry and we should not be too sad that it did not happen for us and  we shouldn't be too happy  It makes someone, if someone does not become one then nothing will happen, no problem will happen, nothing wrong will happen, don't panic, if someone becomes one then nothing great is going to happen, understand this and enjoy, don't think like this, this is a match between India and Pakistan, India Sri Lanka  The match is going on, if India loses then the match is lost, India's cricket team is losing, we say India is coming, India never loses, then we will say it and if you say India never loses then not India but Bharat also never loses  I don't lose, okay both of them say that in India, do n't make it a matter of life and death in everything, enjoy it, this is the service provider, all the politicians from political parties, they are here to provide service to us, to serve us, to serve us.  She is competing to bow before us, this has to be completed, to become our servant, so you have to watch them by enjoying like this, okay what will you do, what will you do, did you not enjoy it, the heart wants more, you have to maintain such an attitude, what are you doing  yes you are pampering each other, hey we will take its service this one, its bill is not less  We will take service, hey he is a servant, you do n't fight, this will become the security garden, am I looking like I am taking someone's side to you or do I want to have an independent opinion and I am teaching you independence opinion, please write it down, till now I got it in the previous video  I thought that you belong to this one here, this wich is very good consistently, I have not yet been able to pinpoint which party I belong to, this is a very good thought because I do not belong to anyone, I do not belong to any party, okay, my ideology is independence  And that is the power, I understand that one time comes and you get caught, one of these buttons has to be pressed, but that time is still far, why do you have to tell us now, but we have to understand everything, we have to have fun like politicians with the common people  Have fun, do the common people have the power, don't have the power to enjoy the politicians, how should the power be to enjoy the politicians, if you public want to know, then please write to me and tell me to take it, you will get clarity on that as well, if you haven't subscribed, subscribe to the channel, Sher  Do more subscribers  Please increase it, brother please, when you have to increase your subscribers and beg, then there is respect for politicians from within, this note was defeated by these 6 lakh autos, how much did it get and how much effort is being put in by doing this here  Money is not being wasted, you have to subscribe like this, after that do not watch, come, watch, understand, see that, it also takes effort of many people to do this and with how much hard work they have to do it, only then it gets collected, that is yours So have some respect for the politicians and as they say, give the devil to this person, this is not that easy brother, you have to subscribe here and do it like this, it feels hard, who wants to do it like this, you want to do it in front of someone, sir. She has come again to ask for votes my daughter-in-law, where are you, did you not like it, last time you had changed me, I will do it next time, I forgive you, I have seen this with my own ears, I have not enjoyed it at all in my life, so enjoy it, I am one  I am giving you a new perspective on what can help in reducing stress  Are you all enjoying it?

    "title": "Pune Porche case Higher Order Analysis [p-VR53MziBc].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, we will discuss the Pune Porsche case, now we will say that this has become very old, this one lasts for two-three hours, the news lasts for two-three days, this one lasted for four-five days, now what is going to tell on this, this is the thing, when everyone  After all that was to be said and heard has been done, I have to say one thing which was not discussed and this is what happens in our country that any such incidents, accidents and these situations are superfish and do not go deep into discussion.  The country moves ahead after finding a bad solution, so now let's revisit that case because there was a lot of demand for it, earlier I did not come again because the news would be bad and old, otherwise it would not have come, then let us discuss that case. A person from Pune.  This is a rich family, there is a builder family, there their own child, who is not an adult, we know about that case, this case has happened all over India, this unfortunate two people were drunk in the night, their death was from an IT person, it is very unfortunate, now beyond this, he  to be punished  It should not have happened, it should not have been tried, it should not have happened, then mother changed the blood sample, grandfather did it there, then father influenced him, he ran away, arrested him, did this, see, the law was very simple, beyond that  There was nothing to be done to him, people, he said that it was written like this, then let's talk about changing the law, we told everyone to see that even Rahul Gandhi ji and other politicians took advantage of it to show that the rich are spared.  Look, the law is the same in the Nirbhaya incident, which was an unfortunate incident which is known to everyone in the country, the juvenile who was below 18 years of age was the one who did most of the crime, I don't want to go into its details.  I myself get disturbed to talk like that but he was not the child of a rich man, he was the child of a poor person and he had committed a despicable act, this is also a very wrong mistake and it is never necessary to compare two crimes.  A good thing is fine but there too he was left out but he was not left out there by seeing it like this, by going to the correction home and doing all that, whatever is their system but the law is the same, so first of all analyze it that the rich and the poor are not like that, it is like this.  This is wrong, now a new law is being imposed, when this video is being made from July 1, it is being seen as new, what has changed in it, what do we have to change, then beyond this, we have to talk about deep rooted things that these are such things. How will we discuss about it so that it does not happen again? First of all, I would like to discuss two or four things, these are the vehicles that run so fast, because we are talking about the issue of brakes in the Porsche car, it is a very sensitive car, how the speed thrills, what is the speed. I have a good idea of ​​how addictive it is, how much more than R at 300 kms, put 350 on it, how it feels on the ground at 350 kms, I have a good feel for it and what else.  Reaction time, I am not saying that it was running at 3500, it was running at a low speed, you know that such fast cars do not run, but some things, how is that thrill on the ground and what is the reaction time and how addictive it is.  And I realize how powerful a person feels from within. I am saying this that these vehicles should be banned in India because we neither have roads nor manners nor do we have the loss for I will tell you under the example that in this, now I look at the fault of that family, it is the fault of that child, it is the fault of the father, the law is already taking cognizance of it, but now we will discuss that which is not being talked about, that is the biggest thing.  It is the government, why do you import cars? No, even the rich people go out and drive them. You have not made the roads suitable for driving in India. There is no eco system for these vehicles and if anyone drives a car, he will drive it for the feeling, so much so.  What is the example that if there is a personal weapon for self-protection, it has one make, it is a pistol, a revolver, of such a bore, it has such a capacity, it has so much capacity, the government gives you a license on it, at any time the government gives you a 47.  They don't give license for 47 because they say that why do we need a 47, this weapon is for the army, for the security forces, because what else is this, this is a very dangerous thing for us.  Example: You will get a license to fly a small plane, a big plane in India, an air bus, this or that, but you cannot say that in a Russian country, many fighter planes are available for Rs 1015 crores, so if you buy them for resale, you will get Rs 15 crores from there.  I have brought this fighter plane, give me the license, I will fly the fighter, I will go from one Mac to Mac, you cannot do this, there is no such rule because it is not allowed, so they should also do the same.  These vehicles will have to be included in this category because man can live without vehicles and without them man can go from one place to another, so these are the fancy vehicles, it is only in these that we see most of the accidents at night and accidents during the day. You must have seen that they happen in many vehicles, some trucks also collide with buses, there are accidents with scooters too, they happen with big Creta too, they happen with Scorpio too, all of them happen with vehicles but which happen overnight. That we listen to these on dark nights at 1:12 am, so brother, this runs for the thrill and thrill speed thrills but kills and unfortunately in this case something bigger will kill anyone, that is a systematic problem which the government is facing.  Have to say that after this case we will stop these vehicles, he is a rich man, now if you want someone to run a cruise ship then go and get married in Italy where  Do what you want, run your boat in the sea, don't bother us here brother, you have so much wealth, it is like this, it is jumping, wealth is jumping like this, banging like this, buy a house like this, put expensive tiles, put stones, okay buy diamonds and pearls. But stop these cars, stop all the cars, now whoever has that much money, then go to a foreign country, buy it, stay there, do you have a taste for India, just to show off, what have you said?  Kudi kah di pehle jaguar le lu phir kina marzi pyaar le lu songs are made up ji Kudi is saying that first you know buy jagar gadi then you can take as much love as you want Yeh to hamare songs hai ji to hume meaning Jaguar aayegi  So then Kudi means the one you are seeing and showing and running it is a recipe. Yes, there is no maturity for disaster. We are as a country. Now there will be a rich man in it, he will be mature.  If it would be good then we can't take risk. Majority is like this because he had hired a driver but the driver handed him over to Baba, Baba pressed his vehicle, he had drunk liquor separately. Now comes the second thing which was not discussed in this case. All the pubs are there, they pay taxes by suppressing them. Again, the government earns money by suppressing the license fees, tax on liquor, so if you know that there is a pub and you will go there and drink liquor, then the park next there is  If it is a lot or a mall or if the shopping is complex, then why can't you appoint a liquor checker there to ensure that the driver passing through is not drunk, a policeman or any security person or  Why can't some mechanism be put in place because we know that scandals have happened, the first thing I want to ask is whether you can drink alcohol in a pub or drink it in your home but people don't let you drink it at home or people don't let you drink it, friend, friend, hi, hello, this.  so you said  It is 11 o'clock in the night and then 12 or 2 o'clock, you have made it because the revenue comes, yes you say that it is a society, enjoy it, do it, but brother, put the check there, not there, he will leave with the money even after putting his face there. So there is a CCTV camera and at least some person will be caught and there will be a scandal if he knows that I left someone like this and it will be recorded and if his car meets with an accident in the future then I will go to jail because I have been here for 18 years. Below  The child will be released anyway because he has not done anything wrong, hey he has not done any wrong, I want to ask this from the point of view of the parents, if you have installed a mechanism by making a driver, but if your child is missing from home at night, then he must not be doing any good work.  At that time, what is he doing in the form of social service? This shows on the parent hood what a guilty feeling you have because it has been seen many times that I will not speak of not taking information about this family and brushing it off against all the rich people.  I will talk about general and specific  I will not speak, but many times the parents themselves are so engrossed in enjoyment that they have no moral right left, they become so stubborn to stop their children from doing anything and giving these cars as gifts to them and running them is due to some old guilt of theirs.  Or due to lack of parenting, it happens that I can't give you time, so I will give you a car. You have to see that if you do such a thing, then only this scandal will happen. It is like I told the example that  You cannot buy and operate fighter aircraft. In this country, you cannot keep AK47 because it is not allowed. Similarly, put these vehicles in the same category. These vehicles are very sensitive, very sensitive to everything, their acceleration is very accelerating. 0 to  100 0 to 150 goes very quickly and it cannot be controlled by very good drivers because it is a big and different type of vehicles.  This and this, if given to a child, then it becomes the icing on the cake. Then that means for it to be like that, it means that it has become a recipe for disaster. That is an event. One night time, a spoiled child went uncontrolled in the car and  That couple on a motorcycle, were they wearing helmets? The couple is gone, their soul is gone, so now we can't blame them, but I have to ask a genuine thing, did they go shopping at night on the motorcycle or did they too?  Did they go to the pub or were they also drunk? No, you leave them, I don't want to leave them, Baba, it is their fault, but sometimes what happens when you are walking on the road, when you have to face the consequences of someone else's fault in life.  You also have to be catered for because if your life is yours, we will collide on the road. When you are crossing the road, will you not look left and right thinking that the next person will hit the brake? If on this theory, every person crosses the road, then he  Ca n't be safe for more than two months because at some point a person will come whose brakes won't apply, so whenever you have to cross the road, you are blaming them, so look at him, the child of the rich, the children of the rich and hate the rich.  Doing it is on default setting, if you want to do it then do it also middle class lower middle class because in this we get the good thing that there is no benefit in becoming rich even after becoming rich the values ​​are bad that this is a different thought process beyond which there is discussion.  It did not happen that when the rich  When a child does something, how much fun it is that he gets caught. The case of Shahrukh Khan ji's son, how many people tried it later and nothing came out of it, but yes, parents, they don't have time, we are the only ones who are good.  We are middle class, we are good, this is also a psychology of the society which tells us that in this case, we are not looking for solutions, we are not looking for solutions, the car should not be there, that car was running without registration and such a fast car, India.  someone worth walking in  There is no space, we are roads, we are not ok, the traffic is not ok, our discipline is not ok, we can't just drive, our ecosystem can't handle these cars, it will be a foreign system, tell them, will we import? No, that tax.  The duty of the government is to consume money, the government to consume liquor and the government will come and say what should we do then and then we have to leave this also because the law  It is written in it - Brother, I am raising this big thing from you for the safety of my life and property. There is a government and the government is the state government, it is the central government, it is their boss, we are the citizens of India, we are the public, we have to say protest now.  What has to happen is that we don't want vehicles on the road and if the rich are so adamant about driving these vehicles here at night and after doing this then brother, let them be ready on the footpath too.  Then people say that the footpath is not a place to sleep, but the footpath is not a place to drive, people will sleep on the footpath, that too the government cannot control because poverty is not a bus, neither can it control them and then in the court.  Do you know what happens, what kind of laws are there, if a person has not consumed alcohol and has a license, then it remains as it is and when the driver changes, who becomes the driver, you know, many famous acts and What kind of accidents have we seen, then the matter is that brother, whenever someone comes out of a pub, he is not there to drink pomegranate juice, then if all of them are friends, then all of them will come drunk and there is no driver or they have asked the driver to drive.  If the vehicle is not provided, then the athlete leaving the premises should be checked and the facility there should be mandatory that there should be an Uber Rolla type facility or a driver's facility or that he will drive.  Or you will go in a taxi, leave your car here, bonfire will not be done, this much tax is earned through these pubs, this can be done comfortably, a person will be charged with the duty, if he is a government employee then brother, he should have 25,30,35,400 Haj tanka.  If someone else is there, then maybe your duty will be reduced further. As soon as their backs open, you put the person on your duty. If people's lives are saved from this, discipline will come and challan will be issued. Because whoever is caught should be fined, a big challan. If you are sitting on the steering wheel of a drunkard's car, then Rs. 50 of the cost of the car should be recovered from you. Then, brother, if it is a car worth Rs. 1 crore.  Will give 30 lakh rupees, only when such law comes, will it happen? If there is a car worth 10 lakh rupees, then give 1 lakh rupees. A car worth less than 3.4 lakh rupees is not available. Nowadays, in my opinion, there is a challan of 30 4 Haj or when and this.  Will it be executed otherwise give me your iPhone, give me your car, give me a car, a car can be bought at Rs. 10 at any time, any car will be sold at Rs. 10 at cost, the car is confiscated, the license is confiscated and other things in this case.  What can happen in such a case and what laws should be made? This child should not get a license to drive in his life. Now he will never be able to drive a car. Say, Brother, you are done, you did not go to jail because your laws were like this. Nothing happened like that, but now you don't have the right, you ca n't do this thing, that is, a doctor can be very negligent and tell him, son, do operation after operation or he is a pilot, his license also gets lost if you fail to land.  If you mess up and something happens, there is a scandal and an inquiry and it is found out that you are guilty then your license is also lost. It is not just that you have made a mistake. Do it again. No, you have to be every buddy has to be.  Very true, the license is absolutely valid, if there is any negligence on the part of the person or especially after drinking the liquor, then it is complete negligence. If something happens then keep following the rest of the legal process, the judiciary and the Parliament will change that, but at least do one thing, this is administrative.  There is a control that brother, he will not get the license. If you agree, then tell me, I have found out four or five things, one of which is that the children of the poor do nothing by reserving the middle class. Let me tell you, speaking in India would sound a bit like that children of the poor, there are more crimes in the poor section. Yes no, that is a statistic, why what is the reason, because there are more poor and more rich.  If there are less people, then their crimes will be less. That is one and incentive incentive. I am saying that the chances of losing it are very high. If you become rich, your public image goes away, everything goes with the money.  If people come at you then this is the nature, I am saying that the middle class has to be removed, secondly, security guards have to be installed in front of the pub, thirdly, stop bringing this vehicle and public opinion and that, I told you that even up to Rs 300.  If you go, it takes a lot of effort, even go to 300, 350 control environment and that means when the ground rushes so fast and you become like this in the seat because of such acceleration.  Indians cannot handle all these things. This is my firm belief on the roads and this should not happen. We do not have such roads anywhere where you can drive these vehicles, there is no security there, there is no one on the big highways.  A car will come, a dog will come, a cow will come, a buffalo will come, we are somewhere else, we are not there in our country, we cannot insure that kind of issue, there is no need for us to make it, so this was the message.  The message was please share like thank you very much"

Earlier, I had also posted a topic about armed forces etc. People said that you could have posted the whole topic, why did you write like this, this is more of that after asking, yes, I just asked after asking, many people do not want to attract like this which is very bad.  There are people with short circuits, I am saying again and again, this channel is for people who have stagnation, whose bread, clothes, house is fine, everything is fine, which is called in Hindi, it is fine, you can sit comfortably and discuss this.  to discuss  I am also telling you that those who don't have the right come and write something like this, then you would laugh a lot that which content creator would tell so openly, okay then let's discuss today, I will change the whole house and one  Asrani ji's advertisement used to come many years ago. It used to come in the advertisement of some bulb. Now the party which is in power, look at the elections of Rajasthan, look at the MPs, all the MPs are putting it in and that means all the old leaders are there. I am enjoying seeing this big change taking place because it looks powerful and has a purpose. One thing becomes clear from this that the election of MP is set i.e. it is not MP i.e. Madhya Pradesh but Member of Parliament there. If you have the guts to stand, then show your MLA by winning. Local politics comes into play and faces change there. So many MPs have been removed from within Rajasthan too and the cards of big leaders have been cut off, Maharani ji.  Of  It has been cut in a way, now what will happen from this and time will see whether the party is bigger or the personality is bigger and this is a risk and this risk is related to taping ability and every time there is a new strategy in the match like there was a new strategy in the cricket match, there was a World Cup of 92.  If you guys have seen at that time, Martin Crowe was the captain of New Zealand. If you remember, he did two things in that World Cup. Tell me, I bring back such old memories with such fondness and love.  Let me explain, only those who stay will enjoy this, this is poetry, this is a poet's conference, you don't have to be that person in it, they did two things in it, they marked the great batch and by doing one Patel, the bowler, meaning the great batch had started pinching the tongue, fours and sixes came in the first overs.  It was seen there once when it has become normal these days. Okay, in 96, then in Sri Lanka, Kaal Rat and Jayasuriya followed him, but that first thing came in 92. Starting the bowling with St. G and spinner. If not the first over spinner, there was always a fast bowler, so this is the one from the ruling party who is also called Chanakya with whom I share the name because he is very accomplished, so I share the name with him.  My first name is fine, I share it with them, so I feel very respected by this thing because this is the fun of what is going on because the other grand old party of mine does not do that with them, no, they say that is also corruption.  is here and there too  Leaders also keep going, they don't get away from them so quickly, this is what I like about the Nobody is Indispensable type of approach, will you tolerate the nonsense and in this, brother, vote on two or four paisa, even if the leader whom you are cutting leaves, left and right.  So it can cost you the election despite the fact that this is being done. It feels good that there are such things in politics in our country because ultimately the country also changes with this thinking. Somewhere you will have to take risks, you cannot hang on to the old days and now we have to enjoy, we also have to see whether the leader who was pretending to be a bully is there or not or is calling the bluff, then as an audience, I will call us as an enjoyed audience because if  If you are not voting in Rajasthan, then you are just the audience, what is coming on the media and the news that is coming on the people there, what will they do such decision making for them, now what does that leader do, in 7071 year the leaf is cut. Now new leadership comes, new people get a chance, so it is good to see, what happens from this is that if you look at the long term, then we can also go in the American way, Republican-Democratic, where parties also have that importance and people.  Changes keep happening very quickly, otherwise it was like this, if you enter politics then brother, all of them are till 85 years of age and they will dominate now, that is, if you also want, those who are listening to me and the normal political way. If you want to go to India, then you can reach these parties. If you work, your image is good and you have it, then it is a good thing. In this, what is called entry barriers have been removed because it is not that he is sitting, he is sitting. He will remain because look, that mattress and the leader will not move unless the place is moved, that line will not move, it has been sitting there for 40 years, so if we get bored here, even if he removes it this time, then this one will go here, this one will go here. it  Paplu will fit here, if he goes here, then everyone's movement starts. Okay, so this is what will be the disadvantages, what will be the advantages, the elections are being held in November, the results will be out by December. Those who have not subscribed to the channel, Subscribe There is a motive to change the whole house. If you see in the cabinet of our poet Prime Minister of the ruling party, you saw that I don't take names even after asking, while everyone knows everything, this is a way of talking normally.  Many people think that no no aise tu yehi shanti hai the moment you start taking names, like in my comment section people start taking names of leaders, don't take it friend, it is not a matter of being afraid, the thing is that friend is in relaxation mode. Why do you have to live like this, he is like this, he is bad, he is good, this is good, he is good, he is bad, he is not good, then you come and contest the elections, no, I only comment from a distance, yes, it is only for me. Thoughts come that I cannot go and do it myself. Our poet who was the Prime Minister, those who were in his cabinet, now only one or two are left, that is, complete change has taken place and there will be change in the future too and when he used to say that those who are in the ruling party,  There is an organization which supports this party. That organization also has no relevance to the ruling party. When the poet Prime Minister lost the election, it was said that there was not much support for this organization at that time.  The political party that was in power, the Prime Minister, had 1.5 crore workers and these people were one, I am telling the ratio, the ratio was 1 1.5 as an example, so the relevance of this organization was very high because there were two workers for every three.  There were also people who were a different organization, which is an ideal organization, now the ratio is 1 29, now the workers of the political party have become so many, the people from the ruling party are so many.  It has become so much that their idol does not have that much value in actual. You people know that everyone will respect this thing but it cannot harm them in practice. Earlier the idea had a lot of power. What is the name of the organization based on ideology?  You can write that when I ask questions, you can write, don't write the names of people unnecessarily, you can write about the organization, so this one had a lot of power and this was a party and the party was a little like this.  Now it has happened like this in the numbers, it has not increased so much over the period of 20 years, these numbers have been these numbers, they have increased 10, 11, 12 times, they have increased a lot, so there is a lot of mismatch in the numbers, you are understanding that the whole story is being done as if  It is being organized and is going on very well. As a political observer with opinion, this is not a neutral opinion but an independent opinion. Let us move ahead.  Let's go, this neutral opinion has been misused a lot. How can there be a neutral opinion? If anything is there, it is good or bad. What mistake do people make of it being neutral? They say that if it is telling what it is, then it is not neutral.  No no no, we have to say that we are independent, in some things the ruling party will be praised, in some things the opposition will be praised, in some things we will be praised, but it is being praised, so how can it be a neutral opinion?  He has an opinion but he is independent. It is not that I love the leader of a party. If I want to vote for a party then I will definitely hate it and I will not like it at all and this makes sense.  If he is speaking sense then I will not promote him and if he is speaking some nonsense then I will not call him out. Brother, I will vote for him but I am saying that I cannot ask questions to the person I am voting for, isn't it? more than that  You should ask brother, I have voted for you, I have a contract for that, it is useless, it is good, it is bad, I have given it to you, why are you doing such a thing, answer me, I am your voter, the answer is that it is everyone's public in the public space.  But more accountability lies with my core voter who likes my content and has been connected with me for a long time. If you have not understood anything or I am there for you.  Some?  I talked here and there and you didn't understand, then it is my responsibility to explain that thing to you, the one who does n't like me at all, the one who doesn't like my looks, why should I keep explaining to him, you don't like me at all. Friend, you may be mine, but you may have understood 90 things of mine, but if you did not understand 10 things, if you felt something bad, then I will say that this was within reason, even after that I will say that it is okay, it may be that some cook fed you for 10 days.  I liked nine. If I didn't like one then forgive me. Let's move ahead. Consume whatever you like. But politics is changing. It is changing in the best way. It is fun and we have to enjoy this fun. We should not take any stress in it.  There should be a lot of political discussion in this country if this country has to move forward but what do we do, we do not know how to discuss, what we do is create political debate, what is there in political debate, you say, this party is good, I said this party  Is it good  We made a lot of noise on news channels like ' At the End of It', you still left the same party saying good things and you came back doing this thing of mine, then what is the benefit, I mean, why do you have to debate then, I am its devotee.  Both are devotees of it, both are of their own, there is no change to be had, if there is to be a change of opinion, then what is the use of debating, this is what is happening, we do not want to debate, we have to do it, we have to say it like this, this is how we have come here.  you are not here  These people are calling you here that you are mine, you like my words, you are mine, come here, don't fight, we don't want to see you, you make a show, what do you have to say, what do you have to offer to speak and you discuss and this  Why are presidential type debates like the ones held in the US or not in India? These are your anchors, why are they debating? Why don't the big leaders come and discuss this? Why are the spokespersons debating?  Why ca n't we go to the template? That's something we need to think about. Okay, so please comment. Share how you feel about this new development. And as a political observer, please look at it carefully and understand.  Thank you very much"

    "title": "Ram Mandir Ceremony ： Religious Or Political ？ [nJdNxB0SbvA].en",
    "content": "Jai Shri Ram friends, today on this auspicious day, congratulations to all the subscribers, there is a feeling of joy from within, but if you observe on social media and in general, then there are some people who are a bit angry and are not enjoying that much. I would like to say that Ram ji belongs to everyone, many people feel that some special thing has hijacked it and today beyond that I want to give clarity and comfort to my subscribers.  I want to give clarity. You tell me whether you got it and whether you agree or not. Many political parties are in opposition to this and say that it has become a political event. A religious event has been made political. Even the religious people are somewhat angry. If both of them are interpreted in the wrong way then I think.  It is being approached, there should be a third word, now the first two words are there, is this a political event, is this a religious event, is this a ridge, but it has been made political, I want to say this.  If you look at it this way, 8,000 people have come. If you look at it this way, it is a cultural event. We can also talk about culture. Why do we have to give everything a political or religious mask? Ram ji belongs to everyone, so many.  After years, a real estate issue has been resolved, finally Ram Lalla has got his residence, now it will be good for everyone and this country, I should look at this period like this and others who do not say so, it is also a very old one.  The dialogue is Nand Magadh, Ram is not Magadha, there is bound to be resentment towards Ram Ji, there can be resentment towards Political Party and Idol Ji, if not towards Ram Ji, Ram Ji, then meaning Rome is in Rome, within the culture of this country, there is respect for everything else.  It is within the culture and I don't think that there is even a single human being in our country India, I have got anything against, meaning Ram ji means anything, it is different from who organizes the event. Who is having a birthday party, who is doing this, who is doing that, if all this is understood, then I will say today, Respective of which side you sit, Adalaj has his own place, light a lamp, celebrate, it is a happy occasion, a festival of happiness.  It is a festival of joy. I want to do a little bit from my side to increase this joy and keep it sustainable. I invite you to a webinar at 7:30 pm for my subscribers.  You will find a telegram group in the comment section, that Guruji from Gurugram, you can join it, there you will get the zoom link till 7:00 pm, we will discuss for an hour, discuss over tea or over water, whatever you want to say.  At 7:30 we will discuss how to bring happiness in life. Okay, this happiness is happiness, all this is fleeting. Okay, happiness is sustainable. If you want happiness in life, then listen comfortably for an hour and would like to listen like a satsang. By the way, listen, you want to make notes, listen to notes with your family, listen with mother, if father is there, husband, children, elder children, then please everyone come, everyone listen, it will be very enjoyable, we will connect at 3:30 and some queries of you people will also be answered.  It will be a great day again, congratulations and congratulations to everyone and what else can we say, good wishes and religious tourism will take off in India, there will be a lot of growth in GDP and we  You will discover yourself, I have many videos on Ayodhya before, I had earlier made one on real estate, 2 years ago I had said that it will increase 10 times and I was happy because it became 12 14 times, I was one of the first one as soon as the ruling came.  Thi I made it for my subscribers on Sango live session that brother, take it now when people will take it and from today onwards the rates will increase. Whatever is the rate today will also increase from today onwards and my request to the government. Ayodhya ji will become very good for giving income to the people by the representatives of the government. There is a request to Yogi ji also in the next two-three years and government, anyone can listen to the video and it is not that the video should get 10 crore likes only then.  If you understand the idea then someone should put three things in someone's mind and in Ayodhya ji, if you people also want one IIT, one IM and one IIT IM and one AIIMS, all three things because religious.  Tourism will increase and along with it, medical tourism will also happen. If you are coming by plane to have darshan of Lord Ram, if you are suffering from any disease then you should have your own AIIMS. Well, the local people will definitely get benefited by having hospitals and big educational institutions.  IIT IM is called AIIMS, it is also for education, doctors are also taught there, so all three are engineers, doctors, management people and there are some such institutions.  They can come, big business houses can come, manufacturing can come, everything can come and as much local handicraft work is done, clothing work, jewelery work is local, all this should also come in my opinion, let's Ayodhya ji increase our hours.  GDP by few percentage on a sustainable basis, I want to explain the rough mathematics to you guys, if you understand the mathematics, I will make a video on that mathematics later, today.  The video was ok, very good mathematics, ok and that's what I'll leave for further so let's meet today at 7:30 pm most of you if not all of you find time join the telegram group and link will be there  By 7 PM and all of you are invited thank you very much"

    "title": "Real Estate Indexation Amendment ： Happy News [F-JLV2j7Hd0].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, you must have seen and heard that the government has made a good amendment in the indexation on real estate, this is the idea I was giving through my videos, so better sense has prevailed, you can say thank you to the government, okay  Many people are telling me that Guru Ji you made a video, your words are heard, it is fun to create such misunderstandings, if people listen then it is a good thing brother, okay then I would like to give another suggestion to Modi Ji on Republic Independence Day Brothers and sisters, if you want a speech then I will tell you a very good thing that if it is heard, I do not have any guarantee, it is something like I said something and it happened, so what has happened within the indexation, yes, once beyond that, if  Many of you don't know this, so let me tell you that now you can choose whoever has bought before 23rd July, the property owner who is new, there is benefit in going to the one at 20 with long term capital gain tax or indexation If it happens then many people will call it English  I also follow the grandfathering system so that whatever comes, I am surprised that the government changes such a basic thing after hearing it from people like us. It is difficult for me to digest this because I think that no, friend.  Friend, they must be smart people and if it is like that then it is a big lack of a channel friend that if it is like such a simple thing or it was like something that had to be done to shock and off because if they had brought it in the first place then the confusion would have gone away so much because  The sentiments of real estate have definitely taken a hit, confusion has been created. By creating confusion, anyone who is thinking of selling his property and buying it will think that my liability has increased, what should I do now, so why do the government do this, why so much  Why are the officials in the government so casual? Why don't they do such higher order thinking? This could have been done earlier as well, but it has been done now. It is also a great blessing that better sense prevails and the opposition also has a role to play in this. People also have a role to play, the public also has a role to play, I say that we all should love our government from within and should look at it like this and should tell them that we will also talk about you, sometimes we can say it in excitement as well  The government should be like our parents and listen to us because we are genuine citizens, many times see, in the opposition, many times it happens to vote for votes and create an atmosphere like this, but as you people must have realized in my channel, it is not my aim My aim is not to make Congress win by saying anything to the government here. I am not here to make the opposition win. I have not taken the contract of the opposition. The opposition should be strong. The opposition should also ask questions and whoever is in the government should ask questions.  If tomorrow the opposition government comes to power then questions will be asked from them, this thing should be ours, the government is just the service provider for us and if it takes any decision for us it is something like this, I tell people very simply that if your society  If RW is How do you treat him? The government also has to be treated in the same way. Do not have to fight with them forcefully, but if they are bringing some rules which affect your life, then you should go and give them a memorandum and tell them like that. Now we are here with the video  We tell people through this medium that how to go about it, we make them aware so that an environment is created and the officers in the government watch the videos and there is no point in taking credit, if the right thing happens, someone heard it from me, someone heard it from someone else.  I heard, what difference does it make? There should be dialogue, there should not be any dispute in the country. Dialogue is important, who is saying is not important, what is being said is very important, so a better sense prevailed, a feeling of great positivity came and it feels good when people say  Yes, many times I get frustrated, sometimes make good videos, make all this, people say hey Guruji, you have written it very well, but who is going to listen to it, it is not the case that people are going to listen, there is motivation, people listen and repeat something again and again. Speak logically, speak with love, speak without any wrong feelings  Do not say anything with an intention to insult, do not say anything with an intention to cut someone's vote, do not say anything with the intention of making someone else win, without alteration meaning that if you have any agenda other than the one you are showing, this is called altered agenda, agenda. So it will always be like whenever I come and discuss any policy, any decision, any law of the government, then as a citizen, if I am facing any problem, then through my platform I can inform my fellow citizens.  I want to address this and send a message through the comment section that my dear government please listen, if we feel like this, this is our feedback, otherwise keep giving feedback from where, feedback is given like this, yes it will happen through social media and many more  It is a good method and the government has a lot of appreciation that citizens can say such things and can do that, there is no ulterior agenda and even those people from the government often tell me that hey you say such things and you have such fears.  I don't feel this way, friend, I don't feel afraid because there is really no agenda  There is no reverse agenda of any kind, it is just a happy agenda that we will talk logically, we have our beloved country, we have our beloved government, we have our beloved opposition, we have our beloved Indians, we have our beloved people of India, and we do n't talk about sweet things.  By explaining in a harsh way, if something becomes good then why not, why not, it is such a good thing, a lot of positivity will come from this, in the sentiment of realism, people can easily choose because many examples have been given in it  There was a problem with the things that were going on, I had done a lot of that privately in my workshop webinars, I did not do it publicly because there is no benefit in giving so much free knowledge publicly, on the contrary there is trolling and those who want to listen, they come separately.  You can also take the membership of the channel. I am putting a lot of effort in creating content for this channel. There is no cost involved in it but if you want to enjoy good journalism as a content consumer, as Shekhar Gupta ji says, then this channel  you can take membership of  It gives motivation, there are quite a few members but if I do n't ask for them, they don't come, other channels also have them, the fees of this channel is very low, that is an incentive and whenever a membership crosses a level, then there is something different for the members.  Discussion from Chai Pe Charcha Chai Pe Charcha is the name of the membership. You can get Chai Pe Charcha Membership by pressing the join button. If you like the channel, it helps in the growth of the channel and also in its mission to reach out to more audience. A medium is created when there are youtube2 members as well, then you are a good boy, okay, then it also comes on youtube3, so this is also a way, if you like it, okay, its fee is 100 rupees, you can click and see it  Okay, so real estate will do well and what are the other things? Through this video, I want to ask my subscribers what are their issues so that by making videos on them, we can tell the government about those issues without creating a lot of noise and without getting too excited.  Without  You are rude because in the government too, there are officers, politicians, ministers, why won't they do what they can, my approach has always been that whatever is not benefiting the country or the political party, it is not benefiting the people.  Why should we do something that is not beneficial? Someone should benefit from it. Normally, the country should benefit from everything, right? But what happens many times is that the country is not benefiting that much, the people are not benefiting, politics has to be done for that.  Even then, smart people like us understand that it's okay, political parties are getting some benefit, vote bank politics is happening, let's do it, if there is no vote bank politics in India, then where will the vote bank politics happen, but many times  What is it that no one is getting any benefit, so when no one is getting any benefit and he gets that work done, then it is a fool's work and neither the people of the country are fools nor the government of the country, no one is foolish, everyone is good. Then why should such a thing be done, so I hope this video was a feedback video to you, feedback of feedback  If you want to give any feedback on this, then put it in the comment section that brother, it does make a difference, it does make a difference and you guys saw it and I want to promise that preparations must be going on for Modi ji's 15th August speech, the speech has just come.  There is nothing, we do not know what will happen, first of all coming and speaking about it, telling and explaining it is a very good thing, I feel like saying something for Modi ji that brother, if someone in PMO hears it  The speech writer is sitting there, Modi ji himself is there so who knows he might listen to it, okay so who knows what might happen from that, who knows it was already happening, who knows it might get clicked, who knows the attention might go there, so if you want that why me, we  We cannot give advice to our Prime Minister, we are citizens of the country, what is the problem, you can also give it, yes, okay, if you give it then you should definitely give it because there will be no benefit in dividing yourself into factions that I am against this, I am against this  I am a pro and I am here, I am there, we have to move ahead, we have to move ahead in our personal life and wherever we  If there is an obstacle in the family, if there is a child and he faces hurdles, the father has to plead to the mother that we are stuck here, we are stuck here, save us, take us forward, whatever happens, we are the little babies of this government, what problem do we have to face?  If you want a toffee or a chocolate, then there should be no problem in asking for it. Who knows, the government might listen and you might get the chocolate and toffee that you were asking for. You can definitely get it. So, I want to make that video. It is very deep inside me.  It will be made only if you guys write in the comment section. So write 15th August in the comment section. Brothers and sisters, who knows, some magic might happen on 15th August. Thank you very much."

    "title": "Reservation Ke Dard Ka Achook Upay Given [mcgzaJsRTFE].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, reservation is a very important topic and an emotional topic, we all agree that today I am going to tell you such a clear and interesting thing about reservation that a lot of pain is going to go away. After this video, the pain on reservation will be reduced for many people. You can be of two types of people, whether you are in a position to take advantage of reservation or can take advantage of it or not, there are only two categories and there is a third category.  If no one comes then it is very easy to tell one thing, who is suffering from reservation? Surely the one who is getting it is not, but it is very important for them to watch the video because they can also share it, they will also get perspective and those who  Brothers and sisters, if they do not get reservation and are in pain, then you must watch the video till the end, somewhere it will be fun, somewhere you will get peace, okay, let's start with those who do not get it in reservation.  Big videos are posted on this and people have their own opinion that for how long will the reservation continue, reservation should end, it is going on after so many years of independence, people do not deserve it, some people should not get it, everyone should not get it, Guruji, this is a matter of great pain.  The feeling is right in its place. There are those feelingless whose children come and speak to them like this. There are many parents too who feel like this, so we will talk about one thing that this time the reservation in elections will end and it was linked that the Constitution is a  This thing which was just a rumor will be changed. I would say that due to this rumour, the opposition has gained at least 25 to 30 seats, if not more, and the BJP has lost 25 to 30 seats, it may be more. I will tell you very soon.  I am saying this in minimum, meaning BJP could have easily touched the figure of 272. I am saying to touch, I am not saying to cross, perhaps it could have been 265-270. If this narrative had not been made, then I would have blamed it.  Why am I saying this, am I a BJP person, am I a Congressman, am I telling that this is a politically important issue, we will agree to this and no political party has the power to stop or even reduce the reservation in our country.  Now we understand the reality of reservation, it can increase, it cannot decrease, it is very good if it does not increase, but the good thing is that those who do not get it, brother, it should not increase further, it is only a matter of increasing the other way. Do the cast census, do it accordingly, give it at 85, give it here, give it there, okay, so now what about this much, watch it quietly, let it be a small video of 10-15 minutes, watch it calmly, if it is so much trouble, then something.  So it will take time to remove the problem, otherwise we accept this thing that reservation is not going to go away because why would any political party commit suicide, no one will do it, okay, let's continue until a small party is formed which can become upper caste.  Even if the caste party raises the issue of reservation and we get it dropped, the equation is such that they will not be able to win. The equation of our population is such that it is a rare case and if they win 51 seats then they can win but in Pan India.  By saying that I cannot form a government, this thing has become clear for me. So now let's talk about whether I know the people. Guru ji, there is reservation but the one at 10 has gone to EWS which is not in the reservation at 50.  it was  But if 10 go here then only 40 are left and they say, where are the 40 left? Those who are OBC General and SC/ ST like Tina Dabi ji, that type wins, that is, wins, I am saying, gets selected and he also comes here.  If they are above the cut off, then because their quota remains the same, then in practice it has become even less. Accepted that the subject of pain is also accepted, absolutely accepted, then how to reduce the pain.  This is the situation, this is the situation, I am telling this situation as it is, discuss it beyond this, it is wrong, it is bad, if you cry and wash, then who has the right to it, I want to tell you, listen carefully brothers and sisters, if there is an exam, 3 lakh children appear in it.  There are more vacancies, only those thousand vacancies are there, all the thousands are there, not 1100, out of those thousand, OBC will get it, SC will get it, ST will get it, EWS will get gold.  Those who have people will get it, everyone will get it, whatever the world, that is the size of the cake, Hajj, there is more, there is less, it becomes more, it becomes less, it is okay, but tell me, if we had ended the reservation, it would be as if some God had come and someone would have done it. Stop the reservation for 2 years, please suggest, okay then these 3 lakh children who are giving the exam will not decrease, these are 3 lakh, they will increase, the posts are also not increasing, do you know that somewhere there are only a thousand people on Haj posts.  will remain if Brothers and sisters, your rank is 1100 and coming, then what is the use of you crying? Look, the one whose rank is coming 600, 700, 800 and did not get the seat due to reservation, someone else took it, this is the reason for crying, of course I was there. Whatever was the reason for that, I will accept it, but brother, the 1001 person has no reason, this is what I am telling you, so 99000 people can't cry, somehow I want to say this if he  Out of 3 lakh, there are Scheduled Tribes and all these SC, ST, OBC all together, right? Out of 3 lakh, if there are 1.5 lakh or 1.25 lakh from General Co-Lets, then brothers and sisters, if any of you also.  Merit list will be prepared. I try to explain again. I try to explain only after taking the IAS exam because the popular exam is of UPSC. Brother, 12 people apply. Suppose 10 lakh people apply.  The exam is okay, 10 lakh people have given the exam, there are 180 seats for IAS, but all of them go up to thousands, 800 is up to 900, we round it up to 1000, the first step in that is from Prelims to Mains.  If 15000 students sit then I am taking the example of real time almost real time then if the cut off of general quota is  Lets score is 110. If you got 110 out of 200 then after clearing prelims you will get call for mains. You are fine and if you are OBC then cut off from lets is 101, 102 and went to ST. 99 and went to SC.  98 from late, now when the one from 98 becomes 99th and the one from general quota does not become 108th then the one from 108th becomes 99th.  It hurts a lot Guruji, it hurts a lot for the one who is 108 or 107 or 106, if I don't make it then someone's number comes in the general quota, 105 comes, whoever comes takes the number of 105, then 105 is more than 98 is more than that.  102 So that 105 one is there for the whole life, I am this 98 one, why didn't I go to Mains, I am more than this one.  I want to ask him, let us remove this from LETS and make a new merit list because if an OBC from general quota has got 112 marks in LETS, then if he has not taken the help of SC ST, he will be directly selected.  There will be many children also, it is okay and OBC too, if the one who has taken NEET 111, 112, then that too is not enough, he is not needed, so I want to ask this, remove your reservation from 105 seats.  If new merit list is made then you are coming in 15000, what if you are coming with 105 number, 300 40000 500, your rank is coming, 6 Haj rank is coming, then how should you stop, how should you stop, tell me how, why are you crying, how are you crying, why? You are crying, tell me, this list should be prepared, perhaps a merit list like this should be prepared, a final merit list should be prepared like this so that one feels sad and cries, but  There are only so many people who could have qualified had it not been for this reservation, you guys have made a mistake, you know what you have done that it is happening to the people of 98 and I have 105, so it becomes mine too, not yours.  Because the matter would have been settled in 100, 8.5 or 109, I am trying to say this and then the same matter goes on from 15000 to 3000 and from 3000 to 10000. And then the whole formula of IAS selection works like this. You have to cry for not getting reservation and you cannot give in to feelingless to meet someone. Who are we to speak, but brother, at least use your brain before crying.  Well done, you are so great, then you should do something else in your life, you are so good, oh this is how officers become, this is how they became, you became like this, then again you became like this, then it is okay, now I have become like this, not you, this is why  So You have taken all the contracts of the bad country, otherwise who will we take? If you become one then you will become very Chaudhary. Let's talk further and let's see. In India, Haj is above the Joint Secretary level. Whatever matter is at the Cabinet Secretary and Joint Secretary level.  What has to be done is to check among these Hajj how many SCs are there and how many STs are there? If you check the top 100 then you will know whether those who are allowed to reach Hajj or not are eligible, then it is okay. If they were not eligible then those who did not reach are fine.  Add any region, any SCST person will say that injustice is being done to us here also, there should be a quota here, no one will say that it does not happen here, now the question is that we cannot run away from statistics, which is this and that, it is everywhere. Say, I am left with five numbers. Hey brother, there were 500 more people in those five numbers. I think those who conduct exams should remove this list. Brother, look at the list.  Take out a roll number, there is your roll number and what is his/her number in the merit, that is the place where the final selection is taking place and it will be different whether SC is appearing, ST is appearing, it is appearing that but you will know your general status.  What I am saying is that how do you have the right that if this reservation is not there and you still give the exam 10 times, every time you are crying, then tell me where and how will you cry, then what will you say, then what will be the next cry?  I tell you in advance and that too, I am a poor child, I did not get that good coaching, I could have got it there or someone could have guided me. Look, crying is always there in life, this is what I want to say and I want one more thing.  I want to say that in India, you should remove all the reservations or put all the reservations, brother, everything is reserved, it is okay, for the general category, do the reservation at 10, reverse it, do the rest at 90 for the rest, okay, tell me, you are general.  If you have a category then you have 10 per cent of reservation, just come in all 10, rest 90 should be ours because this campaign will also continue, politics is happening like this, it is going in this direction, according to the census, do this, do that.  Do it brother, even then the problem of unemployment will not be there in India because of government jobs as the total number of job requirement is very minuscule if you today  If we do the calculation also, then 2, 3, will not get more than 4, Doti will not get more than Ch, and in this too, the posts of officer Ghan are very less, remove Group D, Group C, Group B, talk about Group A only whose Because many prestigious people believe what I say absolutely that one should not believe it any longer and you will get further videos on that as well, you should not believe it at all, why should you not believe it, what is happening now and what will happen in the future if you watch the video.  want to  So write down the group number because on that too I will tell you the truth, you are not being told the truth, no one is telling it, I will tell those who are running more for group A, then according to me, there is no need to cry ever in the reservation. Another thing I would like to say is that we have made the exams so tough, no one else has this much tough work, anyone can do it, it is very normal work, it is not a specialist work, if we are engineers, doctors and this course is not so difficult.  Is As difficult as the exam has become, perhaps if we create more colleges, more people will automatically get selected. Now these 23 lakh students give 1.25 lakh seats in NEET exam and 1 lakh 10 seats are around 1 lakh 20 seats.  So these seats can also be increased to two and a half lakhs. There is a genuine demand for doctors anyway, but we do not have the capacity to increase it. We do not have the faculty or facility to increase it.  As an engineer, you should make something because if you make engineers, if you make them bad, then the bridges are falling. Here, if doctors become bad, then people will start getting directly affected. This is also a problem, so that is why you cannot corrupt medical education.  There are assisting medical colleges, they have their own issues of quality. Already all the medical colleges and wherever medical is taught, you cannot call them very great, some of them are famous, some are very good, they have the pedigree, that is why.  This is the limitation of our country, we are not able to make more than that, we do not have the faculty, we do not have teachers, we do not have the infrastructure, we do not have the resources that are needed, when it comes to increasing it, it is the people at the top who take the decisions.  They say in the making that you are not able to handle it, accept that I have also opened five channels, I also want to open the sixth and seventh channel, accept it, but I am not able to handle only my five, but I am not able to handle all those channels, please post the videos on simple astrology. I am getting more, I will post it now, if you have not subscribed then subscribe, what is the use of opening more, this is also a limitation and that is the limitation of the country and we have to recognize this limitation and I am trying to get government jobs again and again.  -I say this especially to those who are my core audience. If you are studying for a government job in your family, then you are not my core audience. If you have watched the video, liked it and subscribed the channel, then  Keep doing it but I want to say that leave these government jobs for the poor people, leave them for those who are poor and if any government servant in your house, your father or mother, then please leave it. I am SC or ST.  I will also tell the brothers to leave the sisters to the brothers, I mean, this is an appeal, not a right, the right is yours, give the exam every time, pass every time, it is okay, but my appeal is that if one or two government jobs are your over period or 30.  If the year has not been able to do good to your family then it is not going to do good to you in future also pass many things and those who are officer level families where officer level people have been there, father and anyone else, those people are absolutely government.  The message is that they should not go into jobs, that is a different matter that they do not pass the exam anyway, their children also know whether it is a bitter truth or a good truth, but I am saying that you should not even make your children prepare for this.  One  The message is because leave all the jobs for the rural poor and the exploited class in the backward society. Give it to those people, they will get genuine benefit. Whatever government job they take, give it to them, they also need it because I am telling you, leave it.  I am going to watch the video in further detail, please tell me which are good families, good families or not, families with money, all are good families, all human beings are good, but according to the definition we say, good in terms of money is big.  One has to be diplomatic. These days, no one feels bad about anything. Anyone who comes from a well-to-do family with money should not go into these jobs because you will not be happy. This is the message. Why is there reasoning? There is a reason in it.  The video will be of 15-20 minutes and it will be that if you come from a good family, live in a big city etc. then even if you get a government job, you will not be happy. Sometimes you will bump into someone else and then you will feel, hey.  What is this  A lot of class issues happen these days in government jobs because this has been observed, no research has been done on this, nor is this written in stone, I am giving it by clicking on it, but this is your observation. So tell me, many government employees are also not very happy like this. You talk to them, what is the reasoning, what are the underline principles, what is changing, what is happening that at one place lakhs are going after that job.  On the other hand, those who have achieved what they want are not happy after about 10 years. There is a honeymoon period for 10 years, after that the eyes open when one turns 35-36 years of age and 10 years of service is done, both the things.  When it happens, how many people agree? Please write in the comment section and beyond that also the detailed video will come. Stay away from government jobs. Atlist is my core.  Audience, they neither need to apply nor need to go here. Bypass them and stop crying about reservation. Even if reservation is removed, you still have 99% chance of getting a government job because brother, you are a simple person.  Look at this thing, 10 lakh children give the UPSC exam, 1000 people pass, finally it is on the first stage, it is only 10000% off.  10 Lakh Haj I Pav And Haj Is Not Is It Is Easy Even Those Below And % So 99.9 Even If You Don't Make It So If You Remove Reservation And Remove It Completely Then My Brother Still The Chance Of You Passing Is Just % So Why Cry?  Are you that guy or not? I am the one who got 999 rank. Guruji, I was out because of reservation. If the number is because I got 999 and look at 1000.  It is okay that the one of 600 is made because the merit list will be made from 15000 only, the interview will be made from 15000 to 3000 and the interview will be made from 3000 to 1000, so there is mix and match in this 3000 also, so I am telling you this with a practical example. How did people feel about telling and sharing the video? Whose pain was relieved a little? Finally, some understanding of mathematics.  I understood the probability a little because most of the exam people do not have much mathematics and do not see the game of probability in this way. This is the same story in your bank PO. Same story is in all the government institutions. Brother, what are you taking in the 99.9 percent chance of failure? No, maybe it will be a point, it's your coaching academy people who are earning money, they will remove your 12th fail and after seeing that picture, you will get 20-30 lakhs.  People's mind will become like this, they will also prepare for exams for 7th, 8th and 10th year, they will keep coming, the supply is full, they have full supply and as soon as people's morale will reduce, disillusionment will reduce, then someone will make a movie with 12th feel again.  If you don't give it then there are going to be people in between who give motivation. There are big people who give motivation. Those who become IAS and IPS are youngsters. People conduct big interviews for them. Look, I have studied like this.  I said, Oh leave it my friend, one of your true falls would have gone wrong somewhere, it would have been known where someone would have done what, no one would know who would come after reading what, what would Kuchu Pudi Bharat Nati come and all this was cut off, he asked that of the bride.  I asked about something and I don't know what it is then about that or something else Moni Attam I asked meaning you had read something, remember something, luck is a big play brother, it is a big play, there is a role in it that whatever you read, you go.  out of that  Focused less and asked something else, every time it goes on like this, there are so many lakhs of them, so it is one lakh children who go through studies, out of 10 lakhs, the competition is only in them and in that, there is also the factor of luck.  If it remains, then according to me there is no use in raising slogans against luck, this reservation is here to stay, I have already told you that you belong to the general category, so brother, you must cry, you will definitely cry throughout your life.  Keep crying but cry only when you are coming in the overall merit list as many as there are total vacancies and this merit list should be removed by the government in my opinion. After watching this video, brother, it is like this, friend, your rank is 12000 and the vacancy is  If it was Rs 1000, then if there is reservation in it, if you also have reservation for 500-600 vacancies in lets, then you are in Rs 12000.  If you were not going to take it then why are you crying? You brought 900 and you have 1000 total vacancies. Now if you didn't get it then you must have gone with me because if there was no reservation then I would have got it. I did this three-four times as an example.  But this thing has been explained, I hope you guys have understood it very clearly, there is a need to cry but you will cry on 01 because it will be seen only on 01 or 02 in that category.  So who cares if you cry or not at 01. Okay, no, it is the truth of life and your parents will also vote for those whom they will vote for. It doesn't matter, so please share, like, thank you very much."

    "title": "Rs 8500 Per Month Promise ｜ How Middle Class Will Be Affected ？ [uzhzty3joH0].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today we will discuss about our party, Congress, they have promised to give 8500 women to poor women in their manifesto, this is because I was having a lot of questions about going to the manifesto level and talking about it, so let's discuss something.  Calling something very good or rejecting it very much is a very lower order thinking. There is no higher order thinking. According to me, we have to do a little higher order thinking because mostly if you  People are middle class, upper middle class, so it is very easy to come and you know that hey, what is this, it is like this, that is one second thing, by supporting it forcefully, then he suddenly said, you are the first thing, when 8500 or 8500.  Meaning, if it comes anytime, is it okay or something has to be given, like this, if the party wins or wins today or may not win, now it can be used in national level politics and national level politics.  Suppose I don't win, because right now the trends are like this, but some states will win, state elections are also coming later, so will they benefit from this, will they benefit from this, will there be off-course, how much will it be, we will see, okay then these states.  I will definitely announce in which state the elections are coming, after this my higher order thinking goes there like Shellac Holmes that this is happening, what will happen next then my state where I live is Haryana. Elections are due in October in Haryana too. Understood, I tell them as an example, they got benefited from it, which I also think will be benefited, then they will say in Haryana also, if poor women in Haryana will get Rs. 8500 then which in Haryana? Some of their families are living, letters and all such things have been maintained so poor people are identification supply, demand is supply then money will increase, that is the second thing, it is possible.  That now she will become a chick, now she said that I am not happy because this is such a salary slip of Form 16, the maid does not get it, is it okay that 00 will come to the account after linking your Aadhaar, it is okay, those 5 500 rupee notes. This is how they give, because this is how they take, okay, so how will she know, she is earning two and a half, she is earning five, she is earning 10, how much is Gurgaon earning?  If I take an example and tell you, it is possible that he may take even Rs. 8500 because he is poor on paper and has paper back anyway, it is poverty, that is, if you are working in three-four houses, then it is okay, but it is poverty.  8500 will be available from there. Now she can afford it. Friend, I used to work in six houses, there was pain in my body, if I have to go in summer and winter, then I leave two houses.  It is practical because we are meeting there at 8:30, now if you leave two houses, you will be chosen, so now two houses, everyone has this thought, if everyone has left two houses, then is this much supply coming at 40 and fresh is coming from somewhere.  If it is suggested that if the poor people come there then you will see migration of the poor in those states where if 8500 people come then there will be many poor people like our Arvind Kejriwal in Delhi. Ji did very good things like Mohalla Clinic and Bijli Paani and this one again attracted the crowd, that one attracts the crowd, then you understand where does its ripper cut go from where, I am doing higher order thinking.  Inflationary is there wherever it occurs. Why is it inflationary? Because if more money is given to someone for not working then the value of money decreases first of all. Money because how does GDP grow?  You print notes, in a way, giving notes is like reducing the value of that money because in exchange of that, now look at the emotion, it is very good that women work at home and they do not get it, okay friend, I do all that for them.  I am fine and giving money to women is better than giving money to men because if women have 85000 rupees then they will not smoke alcohol and cigarettes, its fine then it is big, it is not simple, now if you are listening to me then  It is very dismissive to call this thing a dirty thing or to call it a very great thing is not a this thing because its implications are of second third fourth fifth sixth order, in many places there will be some benefit, the economy will benefit.  There will be loss somewhere, it will come out of someone's pocket because now you see what happens in this, you try to explain to me that these women who come from lower class, their job is to sweep and mop.  The utensils are fine and all these things, these are women, their work is like indispensable, this has to be done, so what happens in it, if push comes, understand carefully, I am only discussing a little about the economy, no one is discussing this, we have given them 8500  If this woman is earning from lettings in Gurgaon or from her salary or from the salary of her husband's wife of that family, she will get the money. This woman who belongs to the middle class  She is a woman and does not have the leverage to go and tell her boss to increase my salary because I will have to pay a maid's salary. The boss will say, you sit at home and do the work. Corporates will not increase, the company will not increase. If we take an example.  The woman is a teacher in DPS, she is a physics teacher, she is a TGT, okay, TGT is a physics teacher or PGT, get a tank, how many are you, as many as you are.  Take 0000, it's ok, so 50000, 60000, let's assume her salary is exactly, what is the salary of DPS? Write in the comment section, that also gets learned from lets, if her salary is 50 or 600, then if she was giving her maid 000 now. And if he had to pay Rs 5000 then the cost of the maid in his household would jump by 66 rupees.  But their salary will not be increased even by 5% because of this she cannot ask, she cannot go to the principal and management, madam, these of our maids have increased because 8500 have been implanted in that state, so this is inflationary middle.  The middle class will always feel the squeeze because of whatever tax payers there are in India, it is very less, 8 crore people.  Those who file returns pay only Rs 2 crore tax and those who pay Rs 10,20,30,50,1 lakh tax are not very much tax, those who are paying lakhs of tax are very less, that is, they are very less.  But it is less than that, it doesn't matter to them, whatever the politicians say for them, now they will invest more, they are leaving behind 11000 Chinese, they are leaving behind 8500 rich Indians.  Everyone, hey, more are going to China. Hey, there are a lot of rich people in China. There are less rich people in India. If a thousand people are rich there, it means that if a thousand people are rich, then let's leave behind 11. Out of those thousand, 100 are going to India.  They are rich and they are leaving, so no one keeps that ratio, if these rich go away then I will trouble them, they will say that if I have to live like this, then we have such a program of air and water.  If I go out, then this type of socialism or communism, communism and communalism, all these things are going on, this has to be seen brother, we have to see all this a little bit, we can't even say bad things too much because maybe those women want it because you are 80 crores.  When you are giving ration to the people, then the situation is bad, isn't it? When the government remained like this for 10 years, the previous one also remained the same in MNREGA, it was they who started it, these people took it to extreme limits.  If it is given then it means there is a need, now people don't say that ration is given to 80 crore people. Oh no, if you give ration then there may be some more fights. The government is not stupid because there is no hungry person. No, so eat while sitting at home.  I will take it for less, anyway, I will have to eat it from someone else for 8500 rupees directly to me, because this idea that has come has to be implemented, I am telling you which one.  I am telling you that it has to be implemented in the states because this will become an issue. By increasing it from 8500 to 8500, the vote bank will definitely increase from 3 to 4. Whatever is done now, if it also increases from 4 to 3, we don't know how much seats will be transferred.  I am not saying that if they are getting 50 seats then because of this they will get 90 but the seats will increase somewhere if they are successful in messaging. But the middle class will grind, brother, the grinding of the middle class is certain and you can't do much, no, I will vote for him, it's okay, you won't let him come here, anyway, there doesn't seem to be much chance of coming anywhere else, he won't come there.  We won't even let you come, it's not like that brother, it's not, we can't stop everything, there is only one thing which is my message, suppress yourself, up- skill yourself, suppress yourself and go on earning your money, my message to all the women is my message to the middle class women.  Is  Special to housewives, Madam, if you have not worked, you are seen sweeping and mopping me after 10 years. You never spanked in your childhood because your father was middle class. You did not spank till 1015 years of marriage because your husband is also earning well.  And these medicines are available at affordable rates, but in the direction in which we are going in India, our country is definitely progressing, so what is the biggest thing of progress, you go to America and see, yes, how much.  There has been progress where the middle class does its own sweeping, cleaning and utensils, so brother, either earn more money so that you can afford it or upskill yourself or keep yourself an athlete. If you can move ahead then such an alternate day will come every day.  If you can't, then here I will not use the word warning to all the women, but one thing is that the future forecast is that if you are a middle class woman and are not working, then if your husband  If she is a salaried person then her wages are not going to increase as much as the people below will get and then you cannot go to any politician or come to the media saying that no we deserve maids, no having broom, mop, utensils is not a requirement like food, clothes and house.  And there is no medicine or health and education, this is a luxury, no one will listen to this, no politician will listen and whatever work people do like sweeping, mopping utensils, they will do it only in the houses of the rich.  Only the rich will be able to afford, it seems that many of the middle class, no, not so much, the country has not progressed, progress will happen on its own, right, 8500, because what Congress has said is that we will give 8500 in Gurgaon but in Ratlam.  In Madhya Pradesh we will give only three and a half rupees and in Supaul district we will give only three rupees and in Motihari we will give two and a half rupees because there is cost of inflation and  Purchasing party and not inflation, 8500 works every where, 65000 brothers and sisters, $1 is ok, $100 sitting at home in very rural and semi urban India and backward, wherever in the district of India, is a huge amount of money, huge amount of money. Women will also be included in it. Women will get respect in the family. Many women will be in their account because like old age pension comes.  Isn't it given in Haryana too, so from the time one gets it, one gets a lot of respect that yes, I have come, will give toffee, will give chocolate, then it is a bit socialist, if you get too much into it, there are a lot of benefits and the disadvantages are only for the middle class.  There is not going to be much loss to the GDP because that money will come from below, the goods of Hindustan Yun Lever will be bought, okay, we will do all these things, I took the name to increase the lion, meaning things will be bought, we will take oil and water, the utilization of 8500 is good.  It will happen because they are giving it in the hands of the woman. She is a beedi smoker and a non-drinker. Is it okay? No, her husband ca n't beat her. No, he can't beat her. It's okay. When he comes into his account, he doesn't come.  When money is earned and comes from somewhere, it can be snatched from the bank, so much money cannot be taken from the bank, okay, the woman has said, she has not said anywhere whether she is married or not, she has not told those things, the definition of poor is also not clear.  Now tell me, is the direction right? See, you will have to take oaths and promises to survive. You cannot be like this, you have a leader, a party, an idol, he keeps doing everything, clapping clapping, then there should be no talk of others like this.  No, this country is a vibrant democracy and it is the best democracy in the world and we should be proud of it and yes, anyone will come and make huge promises which will seem piercing to you and to anyone else.  If you don't agree, then we all should have this tolerance that this is a loss for me but it is a benefit for someone else and I can't do anything except working hard and earning money or telling my wife, God, now the time has come.  Is that you should also work? Is it okay? Many times the lady will say no, I too don't get 8:30, you won't get 8:30 madam because your husband fills the IT return, Form 16 comes, he has his track record.  Have financial history, have taken loan, have taken insurance, just now you saw that I had filled the form for medical insurance, in that also Aadhaar is there and everything is linked, everyone asks, all the data is going that brother, how linked you are, see technology.  If you know everything then you can't take unnecessary benefits from anywhere, everything is linked to the government because if you know everything about what you buy and what you buy, then someone like this will become tight. In time, the data is being available everywhere, you have to give all the data from the Digi Locker. If you are taking a private health insurance, then there is the issue of OTP and OTP and they take all the data from the Digi Locker. Who are you, brother, are you the proposer, how many people are there, how many policies are there, we have to pay all this, now what is there in giving, let's take it brother, now which one are we going to join in the line of Rs 8500?  But by the way, I am telling you that this is also a good thing, it is technology, whatever is there in the country is a good thing, so one thing came, when I told you, it was the analysis of 8500, what do you people have to say in this, if you people  There is pain in this, it should not be given, no, you tell the woman, work as a teacher, teach tuition, I do many different webinars, you will find these things in the comment section, if you are listening till now, you will find a group where  To you  You will get information about webinars, there are also polls etc., it is a good thing, you can join it if you want to join whatsapp-web and spread awareness that yes you have to do it, I realize that you are a woman, you cannot take a job.  Because you have not worked for 1820 years, now I wanted to say 48 40 42 43 38 38 and in Hindi it becomes 38 48, okay so you mean  In this age group, people are between 35 to 50 and you want to do something, you don't know what to do, have you ever studied? Okay, so I give some practical help in all these things. If you want to join, you want to get your wife to join. You will get it in the comment section, but if these 8500 brothers are not coming in the entire country, then they will come to the states gradually and then sooner or later, brothers and sisters, they will have to give something.  There will be a competition, isn't it, these things are good, if he has given, then yes, I will also give, he has given, I will give 10, okay, so all this will happen and all this is inflationary, this is inflationary, how will they give, how will they cover, can they justify this?  But someday I will make a video that we should not be so sad that if someone is giving and taking something, then I will explain this also under an example. If you want to understand then write the example.  What is the example under which if all these things are happening and we are feeling pain, then after listening to that example we will feel that yes man, he is saying the right thing, let it happen because I have my channel in M ​​Life.  Through this, we have to whistle a little like a pressure cooker so that no one gets too excited and hot, no one, this one, this one, yes, even if it is happening, tolerate it, you do this, you do this, a little brotherhood.  Build a little tolerance, build strength, understand each other's helplessness, everyone has to win the election, everyone likes representation, you are giving it to the farmers, someone is giving it to the women, someone is giving it to someone else, no problem, let's move ahead, okay middle  The class has to grind and grind like this and when the middle class people want to become leaders like this, then I feel that friend, whose are you becoming, all the sections of the society are like this. So the meaning of cutting is not cutting. It should be said as pocket. Sorry, it is okay. Because you are short shot, so you just keep roaming there. Okay, if you understand these things, if you understand the pattern, then this is the end.  Somewhere you will figure out what I can do so like the channel subscribe share thank you very much"

    "content": "Hello friends, this channel is for the intellectual or those who want to become one, every time I have to tell them in the beginning of the video, it will never have 50 lakh subscribers. Okay, so if you are a thinking individual like you, then watch it and subscribe in your own words. Enjoy. Today's topic will come, the game of snake CD will be fun, what is taught in the topic, it is a matter of Guru element, higher thinking, we will talk about nepotism.  This is a game of snakes and ladders and you will understand it. We will talk about nepotism because nepotism is such a word, middle class nepotism and nepotism is very famous. Kangana Ranaut made it famous. Karan Jhor also came and he did not know much about English at that time.  It's okay, if you are into politics also then the video will be very in-depth and may be a little long because it takes time to clear things in your mind at the conceptual level. Creator, I ca n't make a video by putting a gun on my temple, I can make it in a minute, just make a shot, it's okay, it will be made comfortably so that the energy is relaxed, watch it comfortably and peacefully, discuss it, discuss it with your family members that I have Started a debate on how will other people contribute, do n't make it a debate like this, make it about whether nepotism is good or bad because people make it that way, at least understand and then talk.  You tell me, nepotism is only in those things where there is high entry barrier, where there is no high entry barrier, a person can easily enter into anything, how can any people do nepotism there? Today, you are lower middle class, poor, middle middle class, whatever.  If you have aspirations then if a person creates a wall somewhere then you will now have a wall created, it becomes difficult to enter any place, now you need a CD and the people who Those CDs have reached here, they only speak of nepotism towards their brothers, they are ready to put them only, they are not ready to put you, without the CD they are not leaving you, no one is putting the CD there, you get that feeling from inside, there will be take aways from it. You will have solutions, what to do, don't think that this is just a matter of political discussion and social messaging, bye bye Tata, not a documentary film, no, no, it is practical, stay connected till the end, now it is very difficult to enter inside Bollywood at some time. There was a high level of nepotism in the movies because only the one who met whomever, whomever they liked, whom they knew, could enter, but now multiple platforms have come, now only cinema movies are not released, now you can get so many movies through digital medium. OTT platforms have come, now so many of yours have come on youtube1 time, this Esha Deol Twinkle Khanna Twinkle Khanna's Rinki Khanna too, that too a half picture, after making all these, which means films, theirs What should the children of actors do by taking everyone's name, but all these things were being worked out, it was fine earlier also, and many went on, went on, went on, and then went on so many, doing so much uselessly, that later on, they even improved a little.  If you keep making such useless pictures for so long, you will get better to some extent. So that was the difficulty but now equal opportunity has come through social media. If you see earlier, if you were from a rich family or a middle class family.  child studies Now every child can access it, because the Internet has become so cheap, so due to the cheapness of the Internet, nepotism has been encouraged. What is the problem for the people due to nepotism, that if someone reaches somewhere, he does not allow others to reach, but this  What is wrong psychologically and emotionally? Only a king's son can be a king. If Dhananand was a king then Chandragupta Maurya fought and became one. Boys, take training from Chanak, fight, risk your life.  Put it and then make your own umpire, Chandragupta was the king, Chandragupta's child was Samudragupta, then Ashoka the Great, then till he had his way, someone else came, then the king's child became the king, it would be easy for him, the rest is open to become.  Come, who will make you automatic? You will have to work hard, you will have to work hard, now in politics, in every particular party, there is nepotism everywhere and dynastic politics is considered very bad. Why am I considered bad because?  Father did so much work, he did this, so this heritage, legacy, this child should not be taken away by any new person, but think about it, the new person who comes is a suit-boot type professional and then he becomes a lamppost, doesn't he have power and domineering?  So he doesn't have what is required, leadership qualities are not there, he was good, nature is good, party high command has chosen him, there are such strong heads in front of him, so he got a chance, just by seeing the symbol of such party, half of MP's  Elections are won, if MP stands as per his wish then he is made of this, he is made of that, the whole public takes the credit of him, he is made of this caste, he is made of this class, he is made of this gender, if they are not getting power then it is nepotism. You understand what is happening in Bihar, now the elections will tell you, no, that is not good, no, the bullying is from him, now you have picked up a weak person from his caste, who has neither any following nor any brand.  There is no recall, no history or anything, if you do that then you will give him a ride, today you will give him the ticket, tomorrow he will cut the party ticket, cut off their ticket, show him even once, hey, are you supporting them, I am discussing, you understand.  What I want to tell you is that if you are a doctor and you are a lawyer, you give cases to your child, you allow him to come to a nursing home, you get a degree from him, then what sins have you committed? Now your competition people.  The chilling thing is that this boy is your friend in 12th, he is the doctor's son, you belong to a poor family, he belongs to some other family, he is from somewhere else, your father is not a doctor, neither is his mother, his mother is also a doctor, she is a gynecologist.  Yes, father is a Peddit, his is a nursing home, you are better in studies than this child, you have cleared NT, you have gone to become a doctor, the parents did not spend a lot on hard work, the government went to that, he gave somewhere between 50, 60 lakhs and one crore.  There are many colleges in the South, a person went there to become a doctor, now both of them have become doctors, you were intelligent but this one also became a doctor, now he is not such a great doctor but he can sit on the stool, you are the only one who has a job.  You are holding 60 70 800 Haj, you get a job only for one lakh, you will get into it and you will think that yes, this is nepotism, hey brother, you are suffering from luck, now you will have to accept that you are one generation behind. Then you will marry a woman doctor, then you will give birth to a son and daughter, he will become a doctor and he will be equal to this, people feel very uneasy in this feeling, even those who are not able to pass, do not even pass this.  Was able to pass the exam entry entrance test, he went on the basis of money, saying, why did he go on the basis of money, why I don't have money, the frustration which brings out the actuality of others in the name of nepotism, should be removed from his father and Look at what you were doing in the name of Grandfather, the clever efforts of the middle class do not understand that the formula rich people do not understand that you cannot deny the noble efforts of the generation, this is what we are calling nepotism and what are the noble efforts of the previous generation now. Shahrukh Khan ji did not have any father in Bollywood so he spread the shame in Bollywood, now will his children also spread the same shame, will they get a platform or do you want middle class?  There is this formula, isn't it? If father was here, when he reaches here, child, daughter, son will also start from here, rich people don't do like this, they say son, I have reached here, where do you want which platform, how many do you want, what is the problem in this? Why did I say the game of snakes and ladders? I said that they come to the reservation, like reservation, you know what reservation is, everyone knows that a CD is available in it, everyone must have played the game of snakes and ladders in their childhood or would you know, I am sure nowadays.  A lot of children play PUBG and these on mobiles, but the athletes who are listening to me right now are 253 years old and above that, they must have played it for a long time, I assume that you tell me, yes Guruji, you have played it, do you understand?  When we play the game of snakes and ladders, whoever gets the ladder gets very jealous, you have gone to the top, woe to you, let the snake bite you, let the snake bite you, let the snake bite you, next CD, knock knock knock, your six have come, mine has come. One by one is going on, it is a game, it is not real, this is real life, there are many stairs here, whether he was born somewhere in a community, in some caste, or by chance, one got here and even then the stairs were ready for him. And you are going like this, biting the snake, okay, and he reached here from the stairs, okay, and after completing 100, he is sitting comfortably like this, and you are there, first attempt, second attempt, then sir, I don't get the CD.  If I don't get it then I do n't get it, then you see whether you want to play this game where CD is required or there is another game outside where CD is not required. Play Ludo, Play Chess. In chess, the brain is used. Which ladder is used in chess?  Khiladi me Khiladi Both have equal mind Strategy Play this game but aapke nahi mere ko to khelna to guruji sap sidi hai swad to ud aawe sidi par sidi maine milni nahi aayi will not get the letter the other person  Will get the letter, but I boil my blood like I boil tea. Don't indulge me in toxic nepotism. I have opened an astrology channel which is very good. I have collected simple astrology. Come understand that yes, I was born, why was I born, why was I born?  Born in the same family, my father was also a high profile person but was not so poor that he felt like he belonged there and was not so intelligent that even if he got some systems done, brother, you are doing the window to others. You were born in such a zone that you  Neither will you be born in a poor place, if some CD is played there, nor will you be born in this place, even if you get something from here, then change it now. If there is some provision, then there is a change and adopt it, you do it.  Work like this or play some of your chess games, okay now some film institute comes from him, these FTI people do good acting, now that Jaane Jaane Jaan movie came out, those two actors are from FTI, okay  Who is Jaideep Balawat and I am forgetting the name of the other one, it is okay, he is Tamannaah Bhatia's brother, who is her friend, I have forgotten the name, it is okay because it has come to my mind, now both of them are amazing actors, so this is what it means.  No, Kareena ji is not an amazing actor. Now Kareena Kapoor ji, what is nepotism? Now where should she run? Now you see the whole country from her point of view. She is the top leader of one of our opposition, whose maternal grandfather is also the Prime Minister. Grandmother was also the Prime Minister, great grandfather was there and father too and now where should he go from that brother and why should he join a corporate or not why should he join a government job, you tell me what to do and his childhood he could not go to school because of security.  Poor girl of worldly life, I did not know half of the things, but the rest of the things were known, the rest is going on its own struggle, the rest is going on its own, I will link it very well in astrology that how to activate Shani and  What happened after the padyatra? After the padyatra, no one speaks Pappu. Why doesn't he speak? And I am telling you that many people used to make fun of Pappu by saying this, Pappu is never a hate word. Pappu is a very lovely word of India and when does the heart come to Pappu?  It means that Pappu is not Pappu, I like Pappu, Pappu has been made a fool, it means there is cuteness in it too, a little topic will be here, otherwise people will blame me.  Then they will start speaking, in the previous one, some devotee was saying, in this one, if someone says this one, then I will leave it. According to me, nepotism is not bad, if you feel chilli, then what should I do, okay, that is the song of Govinda, Tujhko.  If you feel chilli then I wonder if someone is born in a house where you are not there and then you will cry and become something, then your children will enjoy nepotism and then you will cry like this that you will not get married.  You will have children and then you will keep crying like this. If you go to awaken your wisdom and conscience, then you have this choice. How can you cry? Cry over your father and grandfather. Grandfather sold the fort. Father did not come out of the small town. You have nothing and no one.  I worked hard, I know I came from a community, you know because of my surname, if most people other wise, it is a community, okay, it is a big community from which I came.  There is less agriculture community, I am also a farmer, what is the definition of a farmer, one who has land, one who does farming is not a farmer, ask because many laborers do farming, they do not get the status of farmers just because they eat.  Whether you are driving a plow or a tractor, you do not become a farmer, you become a farmer only when you have land and crops are grown on it. A separate video will be made on this someday as to who is helped and the farmers are helped.  Am I looking like a farmer? But brother, I am also a farmer. This is the definition of my farmer. There will be a video on farmers on this too if you want. Very good, so my community remained here only but there was another community which came from outside, Partition.  When it happened, now I am not showing my community down or performing someone's aarti, although I am a person who has risen above all these caste color creeds, but still I am telling this by taking an example because in giving my example.  In such a day, the atmosphere is of fear. If you want to tell me something, you want to flog yourself, but sometimes you expect your own people from your community not to flog like this, okay, otherwise I would have given some other example, come here.  So people are being judgmental because Shivji is left, he is doing the preparation, he has all these notes, this is the discus, so it is not imaginary, he sold something at the ready, sold comb, heated the milk, prepared the dishes, skill set.  They had come from outside. That community had come from outside. Okay, they worked very hard. That's how land holdings gradually spread in that community. They did n't have it because they had come from outside, so they worked hard here with their skill set. There was hard work and the landlord was from my community. The landlord was such a big landlord that when the reservation was being given, the name of the Deputy Prime Minister was also from here and even then his name was not written.  Our opinion was written in this in 87, 88 and attitude in 89, when Mandal Commission came, it was the time of 88, 89. Attitude, now I will not speak further otherwise I will be flogged in actual, but the big thing is that the people of my community of Haryana do not have reservation?  Am I happy with this thing? Am I happy with this thing? I will tell you later. I am neither happy with this thing nor am I happy. Okay, I will tell you better later.  I will make a video and tell you on reservation, but watch the story, this community kept working hard, from ready to shop, from shop to bigger shop, then from shop to showroom, now the mess is visible in their community also in today's generation, so I will not talk about today.  This is the clapping of what their previous generation did and here the forts started decreasing. Brother, there were 100 children and so many children, then unfortunately, you know the dirty act of feticide in Haryana.  Whatever the boys were, they kept on increasing and increasing, now two kille three kille killi came on that stage, ready ready, they kept moving up, this is the story of the last 70-80 years, after the partition, so now it has become nepotism, this is his father's showroom.  Now he is sitting here, earlier he used to sit, nowadays he doesn't even sit, give me some reservation, so I am trite, put anybody down, I am just trite, prove an example. Nepotism comes is a generational mistake. Karan Johar has got the National Award. Alia Bhatt has got the National Award. That Alia Bhatt got the National Award, people were laughing so much at it that you don't know the name of the President. That President gave the award to her, this was an eye- opener.  Don't want the world because of the skill set in the next, now his father is a film maker, what happened to him, the film maker is everyone's child, he got it, the rest are all sitting there, Harman Baweja.  Is it only a film maker's world that has a list, so won't one take advantage? Has someone's father made films all his life? Now he says, \"No, son, you become a doctor because this will speak of nepotism, this is stupidity brother, abusing nepotism is stupidity.\"  Yes, what your father is doing is very important, but your father was in the government, so where will you put nepotism, your father should retire as Cabinet Secretary of India.  Then you will have to appear for UPSC. It does n't seem to be a recommendation. It doesn't seem to be recommended. So you will have to appear for UPSC. Where will the nepotism come from? Tell me, yes, once you have entered, you have become okay, then it is okay. In the old memories, your father is our elder.  Were and you are something, that is a different matter but you will have to come out once and wear it out. You cannot say that if the son or daughter of the cabinet secretary joins IAS, then he or she will not start from the SDM level.  He will be directly taken to Joint Secretary level. What is his parallel? These days they say that there will be a later placement because he is his son. It does n't happen like this, so you have to choose your profession. The middle class has a habit of resetting the game every time.  Like we play games, haven't you played video games, this generation must have played a lot, okay, I have played a lot, I also play a lot, okay, there are levels in it, level one, level two, level three.  Five, in that if the father has crossed level five, then the son will not start from one. This is the nepotism which has the chill, he will start from level six. Now whether he reaches sen from six, reaches seven, reaches A or remains at six.  He is not going to come to the four, he will play only with six again and again, father sat on the four with him and you have been trying all your life to reach the four, this is the feeling, there is pain in it, I understand but. I am telling you with so many examples, so what can we do to overcome this pain? Everyone should get equal opportunity. Hey, everyone should get equal opportunity. So, the opportunity is definitely being given. Who is making two exams but a man by giving birth to 10,000 children to a nursing home?  If he has reached 2 crores after shelling out, then you become a doctor, you will beat him, will his child start breaking on the first day too?  There is also a house and the girl who will be a doctor will be a girl doctor. The girl doctor will have the choice of two doctors to marry boy doctors. One doctor is beautiful, intelligent and hardworking and the other one from a college topper may not be as beautiful.  The butt who passed the exam with difficulty, his father runs a nursing home, so whom will this girl marry, not brothers and sisters, she should marry him, why would she marry him here, she is getting a jump, her father is a government employee, he was a clerk.  The girl was a hard worker and was doing something else. Now that she is getting a chance, the aarti of nepotism is being performed in the country. I am telling you this, you too have played nepotism and if you are not able to play, then you are on this color track all your life.  Now someone used to fill petrol at a petrol pump, then he made a very big company, so now his son should go and join that big company or should go and prepare for the IAS exam, he made the company, father left the company, he left this company very badly.  He builds a big company, makes it the biggest company in India, then he also has three children, two boys and one girl. Then he says, brother, the oil man, you see this retail man's daughter, and the telephone man's son, Ed. You take care of the finance person and now gradually we will transfer them and son, you promote them, now if they go, we will not talk about nepotism, no no no, why are only they getting the opportunities, so should they give you the opportunities, should your company give you the opportunities.  from dad  If you go to buy 15 shares of that company then give you 15 crore shares of that company which you have been holding for so many years but they had the advantage, so your grandfather worked and your grandfather did not, my grandfather did not get a chance, okay?  Then if your father also did not get it, then you too will not get it because in your family people do not know how to take advantage of the opportunities. They were getting the opportunities, they were offering aarti to them that you go here, do this, do this, do that. your grandfather sitting  They used to smoke hookah and play cards and what did your grandmother say? She used to go to the cow dung and buy nothing else. You did n't go, you milked the buffalo, you drank the empty rotis, you ate Shivji's food, you did this, you did that, and you didn't buy anything.  He is doing something, he has been judged, hey brother, whatever happens, if he gets in the way, he stays in the village, in the village, it is with taste, it is with taste, and the poor guy kept doing it, kept doing it, he doesn't know what happened next now.  You are saying that this is nepotism, brother, this would be cheating, if the youth has to vent out the frustration that they have because somewhere in their own family, ask questions to your father, ask father, ask grandfather, ask who it belongs to, ask mom, Nana.  Ask yourself, ask your community where the thinking is. Many a times one has to ask the community too, what was the thinking of all the people, whether Panchayat should do all this nonsense and do all the nonsense.  But then the children should never go ahead and sacrifice their lives, now they are going, now those children are so disgusting, I was already seeing them, it is visible in Haryana and many places, they are going straight to Canada, watermelon is the only place in Canada too.  It is not like going there and picking up and driving a truck, the watermelon is fine and the people who are capable of doing the work here are going there and doing it, so this is what it is for you, this is the nepotism.  For you CD, whenever a snake climbs up in a CD, a man climbs up like this, then in real life, the one who is getting the stairs, climbs down the stairs of others, then those stairs are his luck, that is, he has got them from where he was born and on both sides.  Is someone born in a poor family, he is sitting with a CD, now you should be such that your family members neither fall in this category nor in this one, then brother, choose any category of yours or you should just make dry fruits.  It's all about food, do you want it or not? Become a child of that house where the last four generations and five generations have done a lot of things for the last 150 years. No, you don't see that. Harilal &amp; Son Sins 18591 6 Should they go to Chandni Chowk or Old Delhi or  Go somewhere else like this, some shop has written that so and so sinus so so there, what to do now, your grandfather was smoking hookah, he was sitting at the shop, then what to do, can something be done about it?  If you tell me, then I had to tell this through this video, how did you like the video, share it with people, if you liked it, and if you did not like it, then tell me why you did not like it, because somewhere there is some pain, is n't it?  This should not be done. If this Golgappa shop is open and is doing well, would it want another Golgappa shop to come sometime? Will it not create anything? Mine is mineral water from marketing. I do it wearing gloves. Our hands are washed.  mirror  It is said, sit inside and eat, we are providing semolina oil, this is good, he will say like this, come brother, our shop is 100 years old, but we give you a place next to us, come comfortably brother, we are spoiled, do it to them, we are nepotism. These are their children, help them, give them a chance, brother, give them this chance, friend, Ruth, all the people will protect their business interest everywhere that has been.  Cape Hey lawyer, is it a lawyer's son or a girl? Have you come here after doing law? Father is such a big lawyer and has so many cases. Secondly, if you become a lawyer for the first time in your family, will you serve me coffee for 5 more years? Will you state your photo? Will they see the case or the draft?  You will do it, they will do it, they will take glory, now if you say there is nepotism, then why did your father not become a lawyer, he did not get a chance, then only your son will reach, only your daughter will reach, you are one generation behind, Mahesh, son of Ram Jeth Milani ji.  Brother-in-law Milani ji did not have to struggle that much in advocacy, what is wrong with it and if he also has children in the future, then what is wrong if he does not have to do it, what is wrong in this. If someone's child is a politician's child, then only he can become a lawyer.  A better politician, he knows everything since childhood, seeing people coming and going, helping others, but he doesn't allow a poor child to become one, why can't he become a tea seller's child too, he will have to work hard, he will have to melt down, others will not have to do it, and that is possible.  Is  He is in such a comfortable position that if he cannot work hard, then he cannot go ahead and you have the advantage of hard work, so many times it happens that a person is working very hard and the next generation is not able to do it because it is comfortable.  If you are in a position then you also have a disadvantage, then if you are not able to do that work then this nepotism is not for getting irritated, apply your mind in this and make the situation such that how we Go into the system so that our collective transfer of wealth cannot be done even of knowledge because if you become a doctor and your child becomes an engineer and you have opened a nursing home then it cannot be a transfer of wealth. Net nursing home has to be finished now because you cannot.  Keep doing that doctor's work for 98 years. You will do the work for 60, 65, 70 years. If the child gets caught in some other line, then that work will not be done for you. So what can you do now? If  If you are intelligent then you will do something such that you get transfer and wealth, or along with wealth, you also get knowledge, you also get experience and these people are doing many things, now if that is not a sexy thing then there is nepotism.  You will not say if the farmer says, my son will become a farmer, now there is no sexiness in farming, hard work is too much, money is very less, so now there is no nepotism here, now if the farmer's child survives, then you will not say that it is nepotism.  But if something is good or powerful, it is okay, there is nepotism, you understand why brother, now the child of the blacksmith who used to do iron used to do iron, the child of a plumber can become a plumber, an electrician can become an electrician, a painter can become a painter.  There is no nepotism here but if there is any good thing, a film star becomes a film star, that becomes nepotism, a politician becomes a politician, that becomes nepotism because now you can become a plumber.  I don't want to but the plumber is also making a lot of money. I am telling you that someone is making money by saying that this work is not good and sexy and some people find it more attractive that he is a film star.  She has become one, she doesn't know how to dance, she doesn't know acting, she does n't know dialogues, I took training from FTI, I have this knowledge, I went to the National School of Drama to threaten so and so, oh brother, her father is a superstar.  The father must have done something or his grandfather is there or there is some other man who has [ __ ] his own son, why are you getting involved in this? I don't know if he is taking money from you or you want him to do it on you.  Invest the money for your children, this is the problem, isn't it? Many people are giving opportunities to their children at many places with their money, but you are feeling this is nepotism that if we are not getting these opportunities then break the walls.  see you No, many times when you have to break fortresses, only then the fort is conquered. Other wise people will keep on building forts. This so-and-so dynasty, so-and-so dynasty, so-and-so dynasty, ruled for so many years. Then someone came, he broke the forts, then he created his own dynasty, Lodhi.  There was a dynasty, then came your Mughal dynasty, then the British came, now you can cry beyond this, beyond what will you do nepotism, you came and broke it. The one who had the power was the Peshwas, there were the Peshwas under the Peshwa, all of them had this Mewar dynasty, the Mewar dynasty is running for everyone, it is running for someone, they also become the Prime Minister, now Trudeau is of Canada, his father was the Prime Minister, he became the world.  She is electing, now the world is electing, so is she doing it on any basis, so I hope this video becomes a little bigger, there will be some bigger ones, I will have such topics. I will clear it and once you calm down, you will stop getting irritated and if you want to get irritated then if you get irritated with your older generation then forgive them also but next time that  You become a hero, children, if this becomes this, then give them this example that brother, you too could have done something but you did not, now we cannot be like that after scoring 300 runs in 50 overs.  You came after playing 42 overs and scored 150 runs and hit us 1 in eight overs, son, you come and hit 150 runs in one over, son, the match is over, you are dad, you are sitting at 150 runs in 42 overs, you are here, I came and hit 50 runs in eight overs, you  I scored 150 runs in 42, I should hit it in eight. Even in T20, I could not score 20 runs. Last time he scored 48 runs in three overs. Now I have more runs than Virat Kohli. Dad is doing like this son, I couldn't achieve it, son, there should be only so many dreams, if you make 150 runs in 42 runs then if you have a target of 178 then they will achieve it, this much happens at this run rate, so beautifully.  I will tell you with an example, for this a like is subscribed to the channel, I will tell the rest separately in the playlist where these are the videos with such ideas, some of my videos are current events.  There are those who go along with the event, they go to Bhuj like a full lamp and some like a long lamp in which oil is kept pouring, those are the videos which remain burning, then there are the videos which are burning, I will keep them separately. Go to the playlist and see that there are many such good ideas, there will not be many of them but they will bring you relaxation. What is there is to enjoy, here is to relax, there is no tension to argue with. So for those who understand things and want to do a little higher order thinking, this thank you very much is for those people."

    "content": "Hello friends, Sanatan Dharma is in danger, Finance Question Mark, I am speaking, not assistance, I will explain in a very parent-like manner, I don't think anyone has explained it in this way, you know, there is a lot of discussion, this is the way I will explain, no one will explain, this will be part one.  Because this part will also remain whole stick because I would not like to make a video too long. You will get a different perspective on this. First, in this part, your base formation will be done on the thought process of intellectual people.  This is a channel for intellectuals, this is not for those who are less educated, okay and those who have written companies or those whose vision of gold is very limited, okay, and this video is for every person who gets such messages. Come, give it to him once. Many of you, relatives and friends come to the family group, maybe you and I too send such messages, if you send too many messages then it is okay for you to listen. Religion is in danger, Sanatan Dharma is in danger, anything is in danger.  If it happens in  It means that it should be destroyed, it is like glass, it is in danger, brother, if he moves a little further, it will fall and break, then it is considered a word of danger, if what is the danger of this species, is it in danger? Tiger is in danger, Gir Forest is in danger of extinction, its meaning is basically the same i.e. someone can destroy it or wants to do so, first of all let us understand Sanatan Dharma only, I am an astrologer, I am a practicing astrologer, meaning.  If I earn money, then give me a little grant, the world gives money, so all this is lying around, it is understood that I am making money by picking it up, don't paint anything for me here that till now, after watching my videos, which from the beginning  If you see then you must have understood that brother, this is a different item. In my opinion, it is not that it has anyone's agenda. I definitely have my own agenda. It may be heavy and should be but on someone else's agenda.  don't bat  Now, I am trying to understand you by giving a different opinion. If Sanatan Dharma could be destroyed then it would have happened by now. Not how, why is it in danger now? Brother, was there more danger to this religion 400 years ago or is it now to those who follow it?  There is hair because if you have a book, an ideology, commandments and something in a dare, then how can anyone destroy it, just like it was destroyed in other places, different people did it, this is how history was done by different people.  You know, we keep giving the example of Persia and you know why the storm that happened has not happened here because how will you destroy the Sun if he is worshiping the Sun, how will you destroy the Moon, Tulsi ji is worshiped.  You will destroy mines, you will destroy people, you will destroy all kinds of animals, so many types of gods and goddesses, temples have been built, small ones have been built, big ones have been built under trees, so many things, no one can destroy them.  Will go till Pak will go till the last time, when in actual you say he was in danger, when in actual he was just one, Adi Shankaracharya ji in 8th century and in a way, he created the religion by roaming all around and making peat, tell him where to make the bench.  If you write it on Google, you will get to know everything. Brother, you are all about Sanatan Dharma, so your taxes, beatings, etc., struggle, now don't say this, who is Adi Shankaracharya, who is very important, who shouts as if he is in danger. Now, if you have any knowledge, you should know that you are in danger, otherwise you are not in danger. Take the knowledge, people are going to forget tables. 3 * 4 12 4 * 8 = 32 people are going to forget, they will forget, they are in danger, so this means  That you should revise from the table from morning to evening, are they doing it? Do they? Upanshidhar, Vedas, where to read them, let's go to study, no problem, I will not even insist on that, okay because.  This is so inbuilt but what is wrong with it, people have considered culture as religion and customs as religion. Religion is very different because people do not know what to do and if they do something then they consider it as religion which is a  There is tradition, there is color, there is culture, there is a lot of confusion, but even in that confusion, he has failed so much that now it is not in anyone's control. If it was in anyone's control, then brothers and sisters, it would have happened when there was no control in any way.  There was slavery when so many  If you look at the things according to religion over the years, but even then it did not happen, then how come there is so much danger now and if it is a small danger or something, then because of what, you will remain my part, but you will remain that part only then.  It will be like when you said something to me, I just told you, did you enjoy listening to it, did you get some relief or not, friend, this is true, friend, we have never checked this thing, we have just been ranked number one.  Hey all my numbers are like this  You are big in proportion, aren't you? Out of 140 crores, there must be some fraction too, there must be percentage, then there is his number too, I will tell you all about it, Part 2. If yours is very good, then why is it necessary to have that too? Is our soldier different from the enemy?  She is afraid of someone. If you want to understand that something was said in Tamil Nadu, you can make an issue of it and report the smoke. When you have made this very thing, it is not a shop which has no beginning and no more. As soon as you enter and  As soon as you don't become a proud Sanatan, then you yourself will realize that it is, it is, you will laugh like this brother, when you understand, you don't understand anything, you don't know anything, what is it like for the majority, then there will be brothers who have the realization of our country.  If we realize it then we can only smile and come and tell other people something like take a deep breath, nothing, hey, don't you know why we are putting so much emphasis on something which has been going on for 15000 years, it does n't happen suddenly.  It would have happened, it would have happened, there is no need to worry so much, read it children, read the book, you will know after reading it, then everyone is the same, master master piece, this is where everything is taken from here, I will still have religion, this one will remain of the other one, not me.  If he is talking then why is he so nervous, why is he in fear? Who is spreading the fear? Who is fanning it? Why is it being given? Hey everyone, let us unite that we too will make Tuesday ours, just like it does something to them on Sunday and something to it on Friday.  So we will do it on Tuesday, of course we will  So we do it from Monday to Sunday, Monday does something, Tuesday does something, Friday is Bajrangi's Wednesday, each one is our own, every day is ours, in our day we will do this in the morning, in the evening, not in the morning, sorry, in the evening, we will do this in the morning.  Will do when time energy is changing everything is scientific 100% with love Santi was 108 numbers what do 108 Sun's diameter 108 time system distance  Between Sun and Earth Distance Between Moon and Earth is inside the number 108 It is a complex system that is understood very deeply, it cannot be, be confident, be happy, do not be afraid, do not be afraid, it is indestructible, anything can happen, anything can happen because if the district table  If it had happened then they were not sure as to whom they were going to save, brother, this system itself cannot destroy it, no attempt would have been made but it cannot happen, this is a fact and when it does not happen  If you can, then be happy, do n't be afraid, the first thing is that don't be afraid, it is the truth and mostly you go, I repeat it again and again, I want to speak only against my profession, but that is also a fact, without fear, nothing ever happens, then you  If you do something of your own, then brother, if you do something of your own, then the agenda will not be set, then how will it work, so many people, how will they do their own, what will happen, tell me, write in the comment area, if you want to be scared, then I will write in part 2.  I will tell you what to be afraid of, if you are in danger of numbers only, because what have people done, they have started talking about numbers because this is an ideology, a believe system, it is fit, that whole thing takes a lot of effort to enter, to understand, but to do. Nowadays people talk directly that if they want to play on quantity, then I will tell them in part that you have control over it, there is nothing external and if there is any fear in that too, that fear is your own today.  It is a match itself, as you say yourself, it was the story of Kalidas that if you were sitting on a branch and being a cat, then it would have become very thriller type, that thing of thriller in de sense, no one has told this thing again.  How boldly did I tell him, he is asking me to complain, many things should not fail, Shakti Surya Bill, those people say that the sun rises, the sun does not rise in the east, this is a factory, no, it is a fact, brother.  The sun does not pick up the story, it is there, you are the one in the rice in the east, in the scene, the observer on earth, this is the scientific thing, it is like this is the sun, now what happens many times, the hen gets a problem, the hen thinks I am a croak.  If I do, then how is the sun? It is a matter of position and co-relation. If you force the co-relation of any thing wrong, then many things fail, it just doesn't happen. If it does n't happen, then this thing.  So don't be afraid of anyone, what is your actual fear, what is that fear, I will address it in Part Two, in everything, in water, in fire, in air, in every kind of animal, whatever it is, right from the worship of the earth to this earth. Where is the concept of Mother Earth? Where did the concept of Mother Earth come from? Tell me, where did it come from? All the concepts that we have created, we have kept them like this whenever we have created them and we have to understand them, then in the next video I will  to you guys  I will tell you, but I need comments on this issue, if you can give it to intelligent people, because this is not a matter of talking on a small level. I would like to come here and take your name, forget anyone else, which is fine. This program is going on for many years, it should continue for a few more years.  Till then we will go, this is a tiring thing because when Covid also came, I was saying, Ma will go, Ma will go, Ma will go, Ma will go, everyone will go, Ma did not know, there was fear brother, many people were in poverty, but what will end, people have forgotten.  No because human brain for many years  Ca n't stay in the fair, after that he comes out saying it will be fine brother, it will be fine and he is being a reflector in many things, so this again and again, this kind of psychological and these more brother, mostly those above 60 years, 30 years.  First of all, you have asked a crazy question that some of the activities are being done for some other reason, as much as there is a flood in it and it is for something else, but you are using it for the purpose of many people, this is really a brother, something is going on.  because it  It is big since this technology is big, even before there is growth in it, the country should also move towards a butter thinking, so for that, in a second, I will tell you a little openly what issues are happening, without going too direct myself. So when and where is he in Baahubali? We see Baahubali in the forest and this is the dialogue of Prabhas who is in Baahubali character when his soldiers are running away. What is death? Who is death? To do death, it comes from inside. No yes, in fear, then you have become inferior, friend, then will you do it like a child? I mean, there is no fear at all. Are you getting scared like this? You can see this clarity in my eyes, it is clearly visible that friend, this  So you know something is not me, I am telling you, okay, I have Mars, I also have Shani and everything, everything is on the face and the glasses are the same, but things can be worn in very different ways. i hope you  How many people have I elevated a little, how many have I elevated a little, so please write, it is okay, it is definitely not a brother, I will tell you in another post, what is this thing that needs to be explained, what is actually happening here, is there some problem with it?  It is not this, if this is this, you are walking in the lake, right, I have just given him some problem, first class problem here, what is this, that will be told in Part Tu, Baahubali Part Tu. Okay, I will tell you why Katappa killed you, but this is not a problem here. When you are watching this, I will try to bring it the next day, otherwise the part will come in two-three days. You will come only after doing all my ifs.  Have watched the episode, I am writing the episode only because I am making a lot of base in it. Don't think that this is just a random video, it is like a syllabus, Chapter One, Chapter Two, Chapter Three, Chapter Four, so if you  You can follow it regularly instead of the chillam chilli that happens every night on the news channel, the story will reach there, the story will get clarity and as many people as it will reach it, it will be a lot of fun in the country and we will not be dependent on anyone for this.  There is no moral science like this, a politician should do this, no no, what should we do, the same discussion will take place, what should you do, what should I do, this one should do this, they should do this, she should do this, all of them should do this, then I am not like this. How do we have to think and what do we have to do and how do we have to analyze and when we change from within we start reacting instead of reacting to whatever is happening, then when that response goes, it will change everything the way you want.  Yes you have understood, thank you very much, please share the match. If you have not subscribed yet, please subscribe. Telegram group is also in the comment area, you can join it also. Thank you."

    "title": "Should You Ask Questions To Politicians Before Voting  For Them ？ [Al7HijjjfKk].en",
    "content": "When you buy a washing machine, they ask for a warranty of 5 years. Even if you buy a pen, you ask five times how it will work. When you buy a car or even a scooter, they ask how much mileage it will give.  If you want to buy even a phone, then they ask how long will the battery last, then it is 5 years, when the government tightens it, then why doesn't it ask questions? This is a scene from Shahrukh Khan's Jawan movie, if you have seen the movie till now, then very good, if not.  see So it is a very good thing, don't watch my review, it is like this and what game is being played on it, it is a big study in itself, I will make it in the coming episode after two-four-five-10 days, it is very interesting, there is a lot to learn.  You will get more than that, watch it later, when it comes, tell me whether I told you right or not. By the way, the review has already been posted, now we will talk about youth on clarity. This episode was forced, it started getting a little fun, why do you have to ask questions to them?  so round round anything  You will talk nonsense and which is the platform to ask questions and which politician should you ask? Who will get the election ticket or if we get to know a day before the last nomination is filed, then whom should one ask? Who should one ask from the Supreme Leaders? Who should be asked from every party?  Hey brother, first tell me then ask this question, what will you do for us, then in the manifesto it is mentioned that we will give you ₹ 4, all the questions leave scope for asking questions, they will give this, they will give that.  We will show heaven to everyone here on earth without killing them, so is it practical? Do you have to tell the politicians? Yes, you have to tell me what do you want? You, the middle class, which is my audience, there is no one from the middle class. Now I have full faith in the middle class.  That if I reach a very good place, then in the coming time I will be in power and politics. However, there is another fact which is more about praising myself and saying that I want this, but I am not able to reach there, okay, I too, maybe my  My intention is the same but what I am talking about is the middle class and I am giving a hint to the politicians that no one will give you consultation as big as the politician who is so chatty, he has nothing to do with reality. Start catering to the middle class because of this middle class.  Only Bharti is going to become the messiah of the middle class in 5-10 years. She will say that 20 years ago there was a government which used to help the poor.  Those who came from a lower class than the poor, someone else came and gave it to them, and that was it. Now is the time to cultivate the middle class. I am here to tell you this and you who are middle class have to spread this thing, I am going to tell you this.  I am saying that you have to show your displeasure, you should not show happiness to the politicians first, questions will be asked only when you are angry, not only angry, but happy, Marshal has been kept, he has done this, everyone is already happy with someone, I don't see anyone angry.  No  Brother, if you are very angry with this political party, then if you are happy with it, then you have become its devotee, some have become its devotee, some have become something else, some have become something like this, everyone has their own name, it is okay infant me.  I laughed, you change me with every video, your ideology is that I am from A party and sometimes I am from C party. I was thinking that they will put me in ABC only but I am a communist even in C.  Hey, at least vote for them!  You have imposed this on me, you have shown me so low that it means even ABC should be removed from the party and someone else whose ad is being made will not even have five MPs coming. The next people are all of us, so you all have to understand this very well.  The basic thing is to be understood, people ask me how do we reach out to these people, this is a very deep video and all you have to do is that this is a political party, you are inclined towards it but there are resentments towards it, so you should not even talk to it.  Now it's whatever you want, it's power  Well, how did it reach this point because even their leaders are getting desperate. If anyone is thinking that the results of the next elections are done by the industry, then he is a fool. Even in 2004, people were feeling something like this and it was a big surprise, but now what  They are students of politics and those who are running everything, they are not very confident about the exam, they are doing a lot of preparation, they have a hint to them, even the people have a hint to them.  So, I am also a consultant, consultation is free, right for the politicians as well as for the public. If you want to show your displeasure, then that displeasure will be visible very easily. Your own uncle, your own uncle, your own neighbor does the work, he is the one from the party.  If you answer me then tell me that you are angry, we don't know what to do now and it doesn't matter to me, you did this, you did it there, you did it there, you started it, you are falling all around you, political.  The activist who is not roaming around as if he is a symbol of something or a brand, then it seems as if he is not roaming around but by observing, he is telling himself that he is a resident of the locality, someone from the street is telling him.  Then there is the locality and then that district, then that wind is going up. You have to clearly show your displeasure to the middle class, the trouble with the system is genuine. You are troubled by the buttons on which your taxes are.  Tell me, I am not getting opportunities, I have made it simple brother, don't make anything simple and complicated things are happening, many things are happening, the story is happening with the state government, it is happening with the center, where whoever doesn't vote, then  You can do whatever you like, but unless I tell the story here, it is difficult for anyone to take the trend because whatever channel you watch, as soon as you talk about its creator, you get to know what it is about me, at least it is there on every different video.  I am associated with a different party, my AP at list date till now, my ideology of my party, whom am I going to vote for, because I have not decided even in my mother, January, because if I have decided then I don't even tell a lie.  I am saying this again and again, I am telling you all, whoever has to vote, you will do everything, but now decide and tell this to the people and do not ask them questions, tell them what do you want, I want something like this and so on.  hee  Tell me 10 things that affect you. If you are not going to get subsidy and you are not in that category, then don't clap where the party is going on these subsidies. Do n't be happy that Vapi is being taken out since then, sir.  Matter and matter Sir, people, I will make the locator on free dish in future also, it will be in Sri Lanka, it will happen, it will happen, it will not happen, that too, I am giving a little hint of it, the video will also not come, it will not happen even after giving so much, it will not happen and Sri Lanka  I will tell you why it happened and even after dividing India so much, why it will not happen? I will also tell you that no matter how much we divide it, it will not happen. People do n't think that it will happen because when a Rewari sits, they call it Rewari water, the other says a gift. What is the matter of how much Rewari is going to be divided by Sri Lanka, its region is not going to be divided, now in the video I will tell you all and you all will definitely feel pain in it and will also be happy that we will not become Sri Lanka but there will be pain which  I would like to tell them in that, tell them clearly that what you are giving for free is not a problem to anyone, even if you distribute it for free, then see who will be distributed more for free, sharing is not everything, see who dances completely openly like this.  He is doing like this, he used to do like this in front of the mare at the wedding in Dhule, he did this with the band members, everyone has to do this when the elections are coming, now you don't have to do everything, but you yourself see which is the note.  Which one is worth Rs 500, which one is Rs 2000, it is okay, so which one is worth Rs 100, which one is Rs 500 and which one is worth Rs 50, not everything is worth it, the brother-in-law who is harassing me has to tell you that I  D middle classes waiting, this note that is being posted, I know you have a cough and if you make more announcements then yes, you will get votes for free, even with this distribution you will get votes.  Brother, but we will not meet yours, so what is this people, when they get the idea of ​​leaving behind those who are in front, I am going to support them and if they want to go further in cooking, then give them the bill, take a call, tell me how much. But what is middle class? Hey, I am with you, my vote is confirmed with you, now you go and make promises to someone, I like you, I love you, I like you, I love you for my wife and for my husband and for your children  And reserve it for parents, it is not necessary to say I love you to political leaders and political parties, you are speaking, my friend, we are not understanding, I want me, subscribers are people, I am listening, you are not me, you are foreign in love.  With these politicians, this Jat is not worthy of love, I am not even asking to hit him, if he gives a little, I will make the politicians moo with politics, you people are so much  By being demanding and the name of one party does not come out all the time. Do not speak about any party's wishes. I am not speaking against the politicians either. I am telling you that we can play another game. It is not necessary that we should remove this crowd from the big area even from the bypass.  Politician can be fired and set to such a state that he has no taste in politics. Brother, in politics, every person in life goes to those places where he has taste, enjoys where he is getting something.  Is there any taste in your life? Middle class, write in the comment section. Is there any taste in your life? Are you enjoying your job? Are you enjoying life? Are you okay? You are struggling everywhere. You keep giving this taste by making your narrative. That this is in danger, that is in danger, money is in danger, this will happen, that will happen, show this danger, brother, we are astrologers, astrology, astrology to chali kahte hain [Music] Chhakka Chhakka, how long will it last, I never know how to tell when in life  It doesn't look good, it feels wet and hot from all sides, then the man goes, then that man plays defending, he is a good astrologer, he is bad, he is a fool, he is a liar, he is good, that's how the doctor works, the doctor said, we too. There is a list, if you don't speak then who will not put it? If you are alive, you will die even without standing, you will not go, replace it, the pain will be cured, nothing will happen, everyone will attack the brother and someone will say that it does not matter what to do.  after  If it remains like this then will anyone get it done? Will everyone say that if it is not done then this will happen? It may be true or it may be false. It may be true or false. So I am including any profession, whether it is a doctor of astrology, a lawyer or  No one else is saying that everything is wrong, but brother, it is up to the brother, even then he has to open the book, you will not get a job, only if you do something, marriage will not happen only if you do something, brother of law.  It happens only then that a person gets relief from improvement in life when you know that challan will be issued or after drinking alcohol, challan will be issued only then in this brother you don't do it, then things work in brother only but that brother is seen through the eyes is true and false.  It is good, it is coming from the moral ground, it is coming from the moral ground, sir, the game is from there, so you all have to think about this big thing that we should not ask questions to politicians, questions are sweet, we will give a lot of love, yes, you only. I will get a job for his child.  I will tell you in the upcoming video that there is nothing to fear, you will be surprised by others, give 10 20 people, top politicians in D country, apart from that, 99.9% of the 99% have nothing in their hands, it seems that they do some work and come some.  He will show me that this is a small leader, this is a petty leader, I will follow him, he is not keeping anything, it will be good to join these leaders directly, bypass all of them, I will also tell you this.  I force this politician to change a lot, you tell me how many will get tickets, do n't ask questions, they are your servants, these are the servants, our politicians themselves say, we are your servants, questions are asked to the servants, I wonder what Chhotu will cook for dinner today.  For me, it is said or Chotu, what is your mother doing today? You are speaking to me like this, your servant is Hukum, this is the jailer picture I have seen, not that Hukum, it is Tiger's Hukum.  The public has to live in the attitude of Rajnikanth ji. One day the public Rajnikanth becomes a sari, then see what happens, then the public will want to become a public politician, one day it will come, one day it can be like this, it is not a matter of laughing once the idea is created by someone.  It got into one's mind and he gave a lot, so 5:10 15 years time, brothers and sisters, politicians will run away to become the public, because the common people will be cut loose in this country and the politicians will run away. Politician has already become very difficult, if you have seen that earlier he used to go for a walk, used to enjoy, now he himself has made a life of it in his own competition, you can see married life too, getting married is for politics.  It is considered very negative because brother, if it is your family, then you will also spend money on them. How many status people are not married, tell me which top leader is not married, tell me who belongs to the Sari Party.  Cross and is this becoming a very big qualification? Yes, this is the qualification that we make. I will fail in this qualification but I am telling you the same way. People can do anything. I have the power to do anything. I am telling you this.  I am six, do n't be happy by doing this, these politicians will rub us, will not let us rub, two-three statuses have power in two-three months, stay connected for the next eight months, I am giving a platform to you people, it is a platform for the common people only.  No, because what is that platform, Jawan picture is good, there were some moments like this in it, it was very sad, it was as if the public felt in this feeling that the picture was over and the money was taken out, they are saying the same brother, you are making money by doing Jawan. Ultimately, after doing marketing, why didn't you reduce the ticket rates, you are of little importance to the public, I have come after seeing the nerves, I am fine, so why did you do Maggi, then there is no condemnation at all, like fan, so I am nobody's.  but like and  But the day after tomorrow and D marketing and the video I will make, because after making that video of my youth, people started eating me, you are a devotee, then in Gadar I had said, don't look, I was something else, so brother, on one hand, tell me who I am.  I am from C party, you tell me, I am just subscribed till now, which party do I belong to, brother, I am from G party, I will vote for G party, I have not decided yet and I have not done it consciously in mother and I have been here for six years.  you are the one  And it is not necessary that whatever you do in the Assembly, you have to do the same in the Lok Sabha also. Again, you can change, be open, be open minded. Will you show through your social status and your behavior and conversation that yes, I have not decided? They have not opened their cards yet, this country will be dubbed, we will see that the country will break, it has been said a lot, there will be a lot of discussion, but I have another take, what is this game, right, should it be India, should it be India, which one should it be?  what should happen then  I feel there is a lot of clarity in it and I want to give it to the public in every word, I will give that too, but how did you like this video? Do share it. Politicians should be ordered not to ask questions. Like Rajnikanth, Tiger's order is that song.  Which is the Hukum Hukum Kar Ke Na, it is not enough scissors song, just keep it in your mother, Tiger Ka Hukum, tell it to the public, you have to give orders to the public, brother, there is no need to ask.  If you ask then it means that weak people ask, always weak people ask strong people, I have to give orders to the public, don't think that this is a small channel and this is a small channel, original history starts with the story and reaches the story.  If you have joined the channel in the beginning then you are in the early days of something happening at the thought process level of change of the public, fortune, fortune will roam around, I want genuinely that  Politicians, you are genuinely the vice- servant of the public and 70% of 80% of the current politicians, I want you to list, there is nothing left in politics, because by serving genuinely, you will go mad, when you do n't get results, a man serves only when he gets results.  So, first of all we have to attack the dry fruits by telling them and increase their difficulty level so much that even the daughter-in-law can't help but we will leave by doing this and she herself will say.  And the genuine matter that will go back will be a general matter and a new people will come. Change is happening. Politicians are like us. There is no difference in me. After 245 years, I will show you the victory of Lok Sabha elections through YouTube.  After winning, I will show the Lok Sabha, leave the Rajya Sabha, leave the Rajya Sabha, rally the Lok Sabha without YouTube, give independence, can this not be possible, what do you think, can it be? Thank you very match."

    "title": "SRK, Jawan And A New Formula [LtKn7npS8h8].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, Topic Shahrukh Khan Jawan and a New Formula, you all know that this is a little intellectual type channel, these topics are not being made, they are being made different, but if you guys enjoy then we will talk about Shahrukh Khan, we will talk about Shahrukh Khan ji, Jawan picture.  What is different in How He Changed, the movie is about to be released now, I am going to tell you this theory, you will know how true it is but there is a formula and a key behind it for many people which can open a lot of things in India and in that.  To all  Big thing comes South India name movie's Jawan Do Boycott Now write Boycott Jawan Jawan name itself, it cannot be written as Boycott One Smart This Thing Another thing what is made in his movie Vijla and all that is there so it is known from the little trailer Or if you show that commando and all that in the middle like this, then no one can say anything, then it has also changed. Good bad. Here I am not analyzing that because are there trolls on this section?  You know, because the movies were also made in such a way that this movie is becoming a hit, it is cinematic nonsense, okay, but if it is becoming a hit, there is a lot of celebration, if some movies are not a hit, then it is worth noting.  Conscious effort was put in then now people have come around it that is the message the formula which is the new formula is evolving South India for the first time means South India Bring a director, bring a producer, get main stream good actors of Bollywood from South Vijay Sethupathi ji and Nayanthara ji and do the marketing, get someone who is a popular music director and singer and do the music, reach there and capture South India because South Indian movies have been doing very  Well in North India, okay now that South Indian North Indian should not do this much but then this is something which a new formula has come  Evolve What are we doing? Whenever a lot of things happen in India, we forget a big section of the society. This is something new formula and it is I think very good for the country. On top of that, the Dubai route and Burj Khalifa are also there.  Vad and all that frills are there, so I see this film opening big earning lot of money, still I will earn lot of money, one more thing is coming, yes ticket in the mall 1  If you are paying Rs 1200, 1500, 2000, 2400, then you should not focus on money, it should always be on foot falls normally, if you are paying attention to foot falls, then South Indian movies have come somewhere, how many people's children have seen the pictures, how many eyes have seen the balls.  Movie Wahaan Tickets Rates Are Very Reasonably Priced So When We Compare Any Movie Lets Se Jailer Earn 500 Crore And Main Stream  Let's say Jawan and this movie earn this much, so the focus is more on earnings, no matter how many movies come, the focus is not there, this is also a big difference, hence your attention will always be taken towards the earnings and the picture is very super.  Hindi Movie Which has higher ticket pricing capability and they generally keep the prices relatively low in South India Which is for what ever reasons not that they are purchasing par parity low or there is no money  There is a lot of money there but it is generally of that kind, so the number of people watching South Indian movies any day more, if a South Indian movie earns 400 crores, then the number of people watching it is equal to an Indian movie that earns 700 crores, this is also a that. But South India can no longer be ignored. Now even if you are in politics, there are many seats and there is a lot to do and South India has shown us that while doing something for us, we also take something for ourselves in these terms.  Selection political choice and something you can't come back to them and say Oho you because the one who is beaten the most there is the one who is being beaten the most in India, he is the one who is being practiced the most, he is the same and what is the dash that  Tell me what is it, okay, then Shahrukh Khan said one more thing, what he got right, I think he will know this theory, okay what he got right, was first the name of the movie.  Evolving the South Indians Third is the dialogue that is going on right now that before touching the son, talk to the father and that has come from within. You understand what his son went through which a lot of people at that time also felt was that  Man, I did n't have the courage to speak much because someone in the main stream media said, Hey, you are doing this with this, a lot of people are worried about what they say when you see high end.  Mighty Fall People, I have that inside Shahrukh, that Dilli wala is still very much alive, the work of Chatak Chena wala is still alive and that is, even though he has gone to Mumbai, polish, polish and star superstar and all that Dilli wala element is still there.  So I Personally Feel I Personally Feel We Should Follow How the Movie Doesn't I 'm Not Here I'll Never Tell People to Go and Watch a Movie I Did Say for Gathering to Don't That's because his messaging was looking very openly like that, okay but which people liked the picture, nothing happens by making the picture hit, money is earned because people come, people come because people like something, what good do people like?  It seems that shows are a lot about the people, so here we are observers, social observers, social scientists, so this term would be too big, keep it short, okay, they see what people are liking, right or wrong.  You should never enter too much, it is coming, it is coming, it is stupid, it is good, it is coming, every type of movie is good, if India was like in 1960, how was in 70, you cannot recognize if you are born in 2000, 95  I go to the movies and see which picture was a hit, with which ideology did the man align and after watching the 70's movie, after watching the 60's and 70's movie, it happens that boys  Because Nirupa Rai ji is running like this, she is working as a tailor and the girl's mother is roaming around wearing cut sleeves, so today no one respects the girl's mother in the society. The girl's mother is respected.  Sense does not ask if it is okay if her husband has gone, then she is the girl's mother, the boy's mother is taken care of because movies set us till 50 years, movies are very important to analyze every movie.  Comes out you should see what is the emotion behind it, when you awaken that emotion then the smart movie makers see what scene is there in the public and make the movie accordingly, okay and then that movie strikes. Sometimes the film makers get it right, sometimes they put it in their mind and there is a disconnect, the picture flops, but for observers it is very good.  Tool: 60's movie had a different theme, 70 's was different, then 80's was completely different, you know they just catered for a very low lower class audience because VCR had come and the middle class stopped going to movies and that.  Films used to be shown in film halls and they used to cater to the same audience. You all know that films keep evolving and hence films are a mirror of the society. If you people watch Jawan picture.  If I get a chance to watch Suppose, I will do a review for it if you want. Okay, but my review is a very different kind of review. I do a lot of reviews, but I do normal things like they do on channels, but this one does n't do it differently. What kind of learning do I do? Like I once did Kabir Kha Kabir movie and did two-four more movies like Top Gun. I don't watch many movies but whatever I watch, I try to watch them.  So that I can review them, if you want me to do a review then please write it in the comment section and if you have not subscribed to the channel then you can subscribe yet. Thank you very much."

    "title": "Start Of New Phenomenon In Indian Politics [ZW73gB65Ry8].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today we will discuss that a new phenomenon has emerged from the recent election results. The chief ministers who have been elected after the election results are basically the chief ministers of all the three states - Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh - if you see, it is a master stroke.  By doing it as told, we will discuss it, we will do higher order thinking, there are two ways, on one side the section is saying that they do not have experience, then the opposition people cry about something or the other, which is good also they have to do something and on the other side  He is saying that he has made a party worker and given him an award, so that is a story that has been told, apart from these two, what is there that I see as an independent observer, what is the good for the country in that, what is the good for the common man  We will discuss what is the good of politics, see, in any state if there is a leader of any party and he becomes the CM and keeps becoming the CM or alternatively becomes the chief minister, then what happens to it, there are many camps  They start talking too much Yes, it gets created in English and many of these contractors and this money giving and this system is all set up from top to bottom and corruption gets institutionalised, it becomes easy when you change one person, right?  Then this does not happen now, this is a very good thing and it shows that a change can be made next time, other benefits of this are that the politicians who are big or who were a little less big than the big ones, theirs too will be benefited.  I was disillusioned that anybody can be brought anywhere at any time and made a person and it can be shown that if the intention is right then it is much better than me not trying to malign the Chief Minister who has been here.  As far as the system was concerned, but you, my mature audience, will understand that there is a well-oiled machinery in all these things, taking their names, their sycophants, MLA sycophants, minister sycophants, lower officials sycophants, that is the entire system. now if this one comes then this  Everyone will be happy, now who will be happy with their arrival because their system will be formed, it takes many years to form a system and in those many years, inform them and then change it, now tell them Bhaiya, we will give you this post in the organization  We will make it for the party and you will have to do this. This is a very welcome thing. It is not being celebrated as much as it is a welcome thing because those who have done it cannot even say this thing openly that how beneficial this actually will be for the country if every  Party and from this you can see one thing that those who are in opposition do not have good discipline and when their party high command itself does not have any power, here the party high command has so much power that they themselves are saying the name with their finger on lips.  One can get to know about the next chief minister in one way, that the entire double engine government which is called double engine government, will run only when both the engines run in the same gear, one is running in second and the other in fourth.  It is like a ship has two engines, right, they should run in sync, something in one engine  If there is an issue of thrust and one of them is doing it then this will happen, which means the plane will not be able to move properly, it will roll or something, I will not teach aerodynamics here, I will not take a class on how the engine thrust works, but what am I  From trim two, if there is anything, its coupling should be proper, even a double engine government will run only when both the engines run in sync with each other and not like this that its bullying is running its private limited company, so the opposition is losing it  Because discipline is not visible, now you just come and oppose, this is right, that is not right, theirs is like this, it is not like that, there is no story of yours, no one listens to you, there is no discipline within your party itself, then how to do it, I say this again and again  I say that there should be stories, there is no story at all and no one is listening to your story, you do not have a story, like your chief minister and ours, where chilli food is eaten a lot and in the state where there is a desert  That one who was his, his brother would eat it as soon as he heard about you The one who was number two remained out of it for five years and will leave the party, will leave or will not leave, will come, you guys kept fighting for them and it was openly the choice of the top command, they did not agree to that, so they neither listened to the top nor the bottom.  His bullying won't work again, the same thing happened in Madhya Pradesh, in Madhya Pradesh also, their main lotus has bloomed and there was another lotus, okay so the other one that was there, he listens to it in his own arrogance that friend, it has been so many years,  Right now the public don't have a choice, this public don't have a choice, the public changes their tune at the last moment, well one more interesting thing has happened which you people are not talking about because I do this political analysis a little late after the event.  Because other people do that, my aim is to come here and tell something new, my aim is not to tell here what people have discussed on other channels, one thing I find very interesting and you people will also feel that many MLAs  Many MPs were sent to contest MLA elections  Those were big people, that's fine, now he came and contested the MLA election and there he was a minister at the center or he was an MP, MP is a bigger thing than MLA, now he has become an MLA, now he has not become CM VM  Everything is fine, now what is his future and who will contest MP election in his place, again it is being shown that here politics is bigger and party is bigger than individuals, now the career graph of individuals can be raised or lowered at any time.  It is given here, it is not like that if you become a commander type then I cannot send you on a horse like a soldier, so this is a new interesting trend that is also emerging in this way and which  Like all the leaders are all talking in the same language, specially I am talking about the leaders of the winning party in these three states, it shows control and for anything to move forward, control is required, it is not that  Someone is showing displeasure, he is showing this  If you are seeing this then I can see a well disciplined, well oiled election machinery and this is very good for stability. Just winning elections is not enough. What happens after the elections is that you have eliminated anti-incumbency. That face has been made so, it is not visible anymore. The old face is not visible now. A new face is coming. There is a caste of new faces. It comes from that class, like you, whoever you kill in your country, they say, come here.  But he made two deputy CMs, they belong to their own group, the CM is from our own group, if you add all three then the population becomes 70, 60, 65, 70, all these are master strokes, so by calling them Chanakya and praising them like this  No, if you are in opposition, then learn something from them and learn that in such an interesting way because when these leaders were being sent to elect big leaders for MLA elections, then what should be the general first order thinking in media  I was scared that this  They are not scared of losing, they had to win, that was the interpretation, not how to do it, now the MLAs will sit in the Vidhan Sabha and not inside the Parliament and they will have all the checks and balances, so now many people will say no  This CM is new, he will listen to everyone, all this will happen, this will happen, look at the things that run from the party, the parties which are big parties and run within the party structure, there you cannot expect your CM to be like that  The CM of Bengal is the head of the same party, you cannot expect that CM to be like him. The CM of Andhra Pradesh is the head of the same party, he is Gadavar, you cannot expect him to be like the CM of Odisha, of course, if you are a head of that kind of party.  If you are having expectations then this will not happen because the CM will be changed in the party and what is the benefit in that, if the CM is not performing, he can be removed for any reason or in an unpause, then performance becomes the key and now whatever the new MLAs want  won the first election  But I am telling you that if you have been a worker for 34 years and are involved in politics and you have been selected so deeply, it will not be called a deep selection that everyone has been removed and you come here, okay, then you will automatically have a fresh energy beyond that too.  There is a need to prove and that freshness because experience alone cannot do all the work because there is a whole system to give you knowledge. Only a person becomes a Prime Minister for the first time. It is not that all Prime Ministers are like this who are 10 times old.  There will definitely be a change. Yes, it is a matter of control at the top but there is a lot of flexibility at the bottom. The message has been conveyed that no one is indispensable. When this message is conveyed in politics, then one realises that anyone can do anything at any time. If he can reach anywhere, then any good professional who is listening to me today and is even 50-55 years old and if he comes into politics and has talent, then he too can become a politician, this is my message. Can be made up to the age of 60 to 65 years  After doing it for 10, 15, 20 years, it also brings down the system of nepotism, it will bring in freshness and on top of that it has happened that the nepotism people who are running can now be picked up and called out for political compulsions or  What ever the reason and it is not necessary that if someone is someone's son then he cannot work or will not work but he is not being forcibly brought into limelight by a party saying that brother you roam here and there, something will happen to you but  It is not like that you will be given the title immediately, so this is a welcome change, how did you people like this change and according to me this kind of thing will keep happening in political dispensation in future and you will see this change in states as well in future  It will be seen that chief ministers will not be repeated. After a certain stage, big leaders will either be adjusted at the centre. I am sure this person or someone close to him will be adjusted in the next elections. It is ok but still it is a relief for the people.  there is a relief in  The terms of newness and newness always come with an energy and if for some reason that experiment doesn't go well or the performance doesn't go well then that is enough for what we call bench strength to replace you and it is not like you are running  Out of choices and as an example I would say that the discipline of the other opposition is bad and they have lost, you have already seen this but there is a state like Haryana from where I also come, now if we look at the opposition there then Haryana is a small state, it is not like there is a population of 25 crores, there is a prominent opposition leader in the state like Chhutku, what is our area where we do that but later on how many Chhutku, other leaders have also done this and they do it among themselves They keep fighting, do they fight among themselves like that, if the person above who is their class monitor does that then they will not fight, if they do not fight then there will be clarity, if there is clarity then they will win the election, but the election is not to be won, if they do not do that then there will be conflict only OK! what else  Then the one who is more disciplined, more hard working, more Chanakya type, sees the writing on the wall, puts in all his effort in the last movement and then gets more marks, then what is the reason to cry when you see the pattern  It is being said that you take things for granted that this Government has been in power in this state for so many years, look at any state, like Madhya Pradesh was or any other state, look at it now, it will go away, people are unhappy,  Now we can do whatever we want, we just want to get our car and go to the Vidhan Sabha and get crowned and then start fighting amongst ourselves as to why we are fighting amongst ourselves because it has been assumed that we will win.  If it is confirmed then who will become the king of this place, who will be crowned, the fight is for that person, hey your victory is not confirmed, the people also hold their head in their hands because of these antics of yours that if your meaning seems like this then leave it this time  We might find out here which leaders were sent, what happened, if there is a story then the election results will be known  As far as I understood from these things, mostly Ekta and Chanakya's results turned out to be correct, otherwise elections are the mood of the public which is formed in the last two-three months only. What is the feeling from long before, what does it seem that election has got no meaning  When the button is pressed, I think things change in one and a half or two months and can change five times and the biggest lesson learnt in politics is that nothing is sure and this is how politics should be and this is how it should  Be played, I personally feel the way this one party is carrying out batting, it seems like the Australian team does not lose the match, I mean it seems they will lose, they will lose, but it is always Travis Head who comes.  And somebody or the other does something, so I am telling them the cricket equivalent, okay, so there is something or the other now and that passion of not losing an election that brother we have to win and we have to put in all our effort  What I mean to say is that the Vidhansabha is very big, during the Municipality elections, all these leaders do not leave it, then all of them come and the rest of the people go on leave after roaming around, they say brother, the rest of the public says brother, when you are with you 24*7  If it is not there then let it be, although it is so tough, actually you have made the political life so tough for the politicians, that is why politics is not very lucrative, earlier people used to come like this, you used to do this and go away and the public used to see that sometimes  Now there is constant engagement, this is constant engagement and what is this and how has this changed, beyond this another great video can be made that what is this one thing that came, I will give an example of a movie from which the way elections have changed the way politicians  There has changed and the smart ones have learnt a lot from it and you can call the public stupid, yes it is okay, I do not say that the public is made fools because the public is not stupid at all, so it is rarely made fools.  But which was that movie from which it all started? If you want a video on that, then I will tell you on this channel, it will be a very good analysis that friend, yes friend, he is saying the right thing, friend, after that, there was a change like this till now, no one has  I did not make that video nor did anyone suggest it, but that was a movie and after that things changed, a lot changed, the smart politicians took a lot from it, so you people should also tell this thing that they would like to listen to this video.  Please tell me how you liked it and please share and like it. Thank you very much."

    "title": "Story Kaun Suna Raha Hai ？ [TuJb7hwLr34].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today's interesting topic is who is narrating the story and to whom. It is a very deep topic, try to understand it carefully and you will get a lot of clarity and peace in these times. If I say this in English, then I am in this controlling D.  I am narrative and I am setting and I am RD players. I will tell you under the example that Mahabharata is our famous epic. Everyone knows that if you look at it carefully and understand then Pandavas, Yudhishthir ji  Draupti Jeeva Game Gambling Har Before that, if we Jain Dhritarashtra had won, he was blind, he was the succession plane, if he went to the court on this day, what kind of thing would he have got, what result would he have got that brother, he could not become the king because he had to become the elder brother but he could not become it. Because only Baaz Note is capable so younger brother can be that because of this date, earlier it used to be like this, there was a rule about such pampered money, otherwise even the younger one was told that he cannot make it bigger, now the lesser duty is this, but you become  Go, now her thief was Dhritarashtra, her son was Samar, so everything was fine there, so now I became the elder, so it is not said that because he did also, now who became this, then he became this, that means, how is a litigation divided?  Was n't he state forward and who did wrong and did what was right Pandavas also conspired with Shakuni but Pandavas also broke all the rules and defeated him in every way Now he was like Krishna ji, he was ours If we are with them then we make it clear to them that brother is the one who is God, he is the one with them, you have given them, you are good but that is narrative, it is not related to the song about it, don't put your mind in it, speak to other vices. Brother, why did Duryodhana's thigh be broken by Bhima? It was wrong to hit him with the belt and there was no way to die below that, then everything becomes moot, I will tell you that too and give my small example.  After watching, I would like to tell you guys, what happens many times is that most of the times it happens that you want to talk about something, want to give a message, there is some understanding of it and some different kind of people get stuck, now that  You seem to be subscribed but the man has to be filtered in it because sometimes what happens is that you are what you were and you will go to the cloud. Many a times this is happening with the politicians too, they want something but many are asking foolishly, even if they join, then that too is water.  How to make him angry, even then no one comes and says that he is wrong, now as I will tell you by taking my example, I had given a little hint in the previous video that I reviewed the movie Jawan and I found the picture useless, I found Shahrukh useless.  I don't think that this one of my favorite day before yesterday is okay in public. If you want then please write in the comment area. I had condemned the picture, people went and linked it to Shahrukh and Dharam and stuck to it.  He is going to do my Baba like this with me, it is absolutely right Guruji, he should not do this, brother, it is not wanted, you, I can speak, I don't want, hello, what have I done, have I hidden this concept, it was narrative, something was going on, it was sticky, something was descriptive, no?  Bill control this think, I am very good, I can take it like this, hey, this is a big subscribe, big people are liking it, I was thinking something, it went something but it happened, this thing has to be called out by the politicians also.  You should have the strength to come and say that brother, it is not like this, it is not right but no one crosses party lines, this model remains silent, they do not come even once and say like brother and I know no date, the day after tomorrow, sitting in a position. Off responsibility and figure means in power he would not want this but that is that now if Aankh speaks, the confusion will fail because the agenda was going well, what happens to him now? In these times, you cannot control, there cannot be any experiment with controlled fire, let's put the story today, put the story pepper, put the story agenda and that's it, it will be controlled, it will be taken out of hand, I saw it myself, I saw it myself, one of my reviews which is very  People liked it because in general I was talking about the movie, I did not like Gadar Tu too, even though I am genuinely talking about the movie, it is okay, that picture will be a hit, Halla Match Gaya, that happened, its marketing has been good, dates.  So these are the things, you are content and movie and they are one hour and date state face because I actually had no agenda without agenda also this happened this is what I am trying to tell you when does the narrative go away like taking the example of Mahabharata and told that  Those people have been doing it all the time and this is this, it is going to happen and if you say it now then it is straight but that if this happens then where will the excitement come from.  Because it is easy to understand what happens to people, if you make them black and white, if you do something in between then it is very difficult but today also when they have you elect people, they have you see, there is a problem in this also, there is a problem in this too, there is more in this, less in this.  Which is the red flag which one do I like? What can I rate the toll, what can't I rate the toll, this is the kind of decision making you have to do, you are not clear cut, something is good.  There is something big, what do you want, what is happening and according to it, everyone's power will be lost, like if a person comes and speaks to someone, then it is arrogant or does some such words, by doing this, arrogance is written on their face, one thing tells me till today.  I did not understand, those who are lying on the ground after being knocked down, who did not vote, those who did not get their SIM, those who still do not have the chase are arrogant and the topper students who are sitting there are not arrogant, that is, a student.  Number A is 30, number 33 is not going to pass and the one sitting at number 90 is a bell, tell him what are you proud of, but if someone says this again and again, I am example DK, I am telling you all.

    "title": "Stuck Clock Syndrome ｜ Not Knowing Base Rate [h2C9E2CoS0M].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, there is 'Stalk Clock Syndrome' in Indian Politics, so this thing can be done in other things in life, but here I will tell you the unique thing, what is the unique thing, whatever the matter, we discuss it today, the story is also fine.  So any issue arises, one has to say this is not right, this is not right, this is not right, this is not right, this is all useless, bad and he is winning the argument, only then someone will come and say what about this, tell me this.  that's fine And this is also fine, so when it is fine then this is its advantage, this is why I linked it with the clock because if the cell of your watch is removed or the band gets damaged and the watch has a band and it is fixed on the wall and It is showing the correct time at 6:00 and has not budged but still it is showing the correct time twice a day. Brothers and sisters, tell me. It is showing the correct time at 6:00 twice a day. The rest of the time is wrong but during the day.  When 6:00 pm  If it rings then you can claim that the clock is fine because it needs time. Suggest that some setting should be made in such a way that if the clock strikes 12:00 then we will take credit i.e. anything that has gone up, any thing, this is also on personal level.  It happens in homes too, it happens at the institutional level too, it happens at the national level too, political parties also do that by making something good out of something, it happens like playing 12 every day.  If you want to play in the afternoon, then the one who plays at 12:00 in the afternoon, no one can play the rock, but the one who sleeps at 12:00, see this at the top, brothers and sisters, the word A Jo Sab A Jo Sab A Jo  At 12:00 everyone came, hey, what at 12 o'clock, very nice, very nice, many people will come and say, we are like me and this and this, now she has taken it brother, you people, many people said, many people did not say that. Sometimes it will come down, just like it has a wheel, brother, it goes down as well, goes up as well, then goes down, like this, when it's 6:00, then the bill comes like me from the note, because I have seen all this, I am beyond them.  I am your woman, but who will call someone like me, I am also an aunt, so what if I went to someone else's bank, what happened at 6:00, I was not there, what is our fault in this, what is her fault, what is our fault, what is the fault in your mind.  Isn't it a comedy that is being sent off by not liking you and if someone records it then they will say that there is a difference of 6 hours in everyday life in real life, there can be a difference of 6 months, it can be of 3 months, 8  If it is of the month then selectively clap at 12:00 o'clock and say at 6:00 o'clock, hey, you don't have intelligence, discretion and consciousness, so I am not a famine, what is the point in clapping at 6:00, whose  Do this, hey and you are like no, the idiots also shout more because what happens is that shouting requires energy. An intellectual type of person who has a brain, spends his energy in sleeping and cannot spend some in shouting.  If you are tired of your mind and have told him just one basic thing, then if he pushes you too much, then the intellectual cannot rock the one who shouts, because he is too noisy, so whatever argument he has, it will be done, right? Emotions will become heavy, either man, what will happen or two or four things will happen, either one man will get scared because the next one is shouting or mother lo, he will not even get scared, he is a bit domineering, he is also like that, so his voice is not ready to listen to the rider and he  He made so much noise by shouting that all the people around could hear him, not him, friend, let this brother also speak, listen to him too, otherwise you won't hear him, he is shouting, it's 6 o'clock, what's the point in this?  Yes, this is what happens, then many people are in favor of this, yes, it is about the right thing, but they do not know that when you were playing at 12:00, you had taken a clipping, what was the purpose of that, so what is happening many times in life.  In India, what is happening in our country, it is doing very well, it is doing badly, it is an elephant, it is not in anyone's control, there is a strong direction, then is it that many things are not in the hands of many people, like inflation?  inflation is in someone's hands  If there is a reduction in it, then why does one always want to do more, no one would want to do it, it can be controlled by making it artificial for both, because to control it, if you read the notes by throwing them, then you are not getting tax because you have done something there.  If you have given Chhath, then basically you are robbing Paul of some fear to Peter, it is said that you are giving to Peter, Robin Paul, now take that of Paul from here, people very nicely give some subsidy here, dog, then a little here.  Artificial cannot be done more than that for 2-4 6 months because if you take too much of it, it will run away, then there will be no one to loot it, there will be no one to kneel, then it will become a false rule, at least one tabla is lost.  They are not getting angry, they have to believe because they are more in numbers, they talk about those who are more in numbers, these people sit and look at them, they are the bread and butter, this I still don't understand, the middle class belongs to the poor, to the poor.  happens again  If you are asking why the poor have bread, it is being given to them for free, then I know one truth about it, which I know, I will make it for you, because even free food is more expensive than the middle class. There is a truth about it, if  If you want to hear the true video, then write the free dish in the comment area so that you can know the truth about the free dish. We are not from the lower class, if they are not going to be made because do you know it or not?  The politician is not having much fun with this going.  Where were the numbers, I made a video earlier also, you have to consolidate your numbers, brother is a great need, some political representation of the middle class, religion, caste, army represented in the political system, becoming a leader for everyone while not becoming one.  This thing is good for everything, this thing is good, this is just good, so if the middle class has to become the actual chair leader then why do they pay so much tax?  I am feeling pain that you don't tell the government to cut the tax by 65%, I really want it, my passion is very high for the country, I have got a lot of nationalism, I am ready to tell you a story of nationalism as well, which is how I capitalized on ₹ 5000. Even in countries where GDP has gone historically, there is a lot of nationalism, it starts decreasing after 5000 dollars and it starts at 10000 dollars.  It happens, this is the journey of every country, don't stop it too much, it is bound to happen, the intellectuals who are telling me on my channel, I am not trying to stop anything, I am not even talking about bringing about change in such a way that only such change happens.  First of all, let's look at the table of an intellectual to see what is happening, there are no intellectuals, thinking citizens are disappearing in this country, everyone is sitting with some pollution of their own, it is not understood that Running till 10000, which one is right, new can be decided, like that, I told you that 12:00 is gone, 6:00 is gone anytime, you have to understand the thing very well, it is easy to be seduced, it is difficult to understand, that is why it is difficult.  If it is not being reduced then people do not understand then this is what you have to keep as your focus. Whatever headlines have come from this channel and other vices also, whatever things have been told, they should understand it. Try to understand deeply and make dots first of all, then they can be connected beautifully later, you can do as you were told, he has said that report has come, this one has done that, here has come her, all this is ours inside this.  The game is a very big game, so watch it comfortably. I also told you the story to change your ideology. I am for him. Keep your WhatsApp status open, your DP on your Twitter, all the political statuses which you can write about marriage and his.  i every In the fourth and fifth video, I will remind you not to decide, if you want power, you come because of you, very if I don't have it anywhere today, know your political affiliation, your WhatsApp, your Twitter, your messages and your reaction to one such thing on Twitter.  It is known that you declare yourself first. The middle class is walking with its stomach open. The man who shows his stomach in the first game can never win the game. This is the game of life.  We're all playing Ca n't run away It's already happened Now I have to concentrate on her You need you get de fox and lime light on yourself Always come to de different place And you'll keep suffering like this from mole to mole And in everything  You will go to give your opinion, every issue will blow such a balloon and you will go to give the issue, this is something which you need, you against God please share  This video thank you very much"

    "title": "Swati Maliwal Incident , AAP And Effect On Elections [tZUqczv-R34].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today we will discuss about two things, the episode of Swati Maliwal ji and a short interview of PM Modi ji in which he is talking about 125 days, so we will talk about two things and how will you like it, tell me comments.  I must write, so the first thing I start with is the episode with Swati Maliwal ji, it is an unfortunate episode, it is not a good episode, initially it seemed like it was a miss behaviour, now I am telling you that whoever has appeared in the media, slapped me five or six times. Or have you misbehaved? So when I was telling you earlier that the issue of removing Kejriwal ji was a master stroke of BJP, it is very difficult. I feel a little stressed in saying that you are a party which does petty politics.  So when you do petty politics with others, the same petty politics happens with you. What is BJP, it is a national party, so it does politics in every domain, it will also do petty politics, it will also do local, it will also do its, it will also do its, it will also do visionary.  And they have captured all the bandwidth. Aam Aadmi Party people have not risen above this. Now they are getting so much embarrassment due to this incident that now Kejriwal ji was doing a joint press conference with Akhilesh ji, all that focus went here and then he  If you use the mic like this, it is looking, that means there is a feeling coming from inside, call it sympathy, I will not use the word pity because even if you  Do n't agree with some big policies and you are not a fan but it feels a bit like where has this guy got stuck, now after talking to him, Akhilesh ji must be thinking, why did I call Aam Aadmi Party now? Is it election vote in UP?  Dila Dagi, I myself do n't understand what was the need to hold that press conference, then they gave it to him, then Akhilesh ji started speaking, when Akhilesh ji started speaking, brother, whatever media is there, it would have become media for these parties.  Isn't it Godi Media, the second part I will cover is how the feeling is there, you tell the whole thing here, you tell me, those are more important things, they also took out the slip, they released it on Akhilesh ji, these people will not listen, they again took the mic.  You did this like this, you did the mike, then Sanjay ji, this is the good of his deputy or the one who is your leader's, and after doing this, they started again, Hey BJP, BJP, that woman wrestler, this is that, hey woman.  The case of the wrestler is going on, he has been admitted, all the action has been taken, everything is happening and the public will answer, but you tell me this, now Swati Maliwal ji has written that although he should get protection, he should not be politicized, it is politics.  Madam, you, Swati Maliwal ji herself, because she has been involved in all this, has done a lot of politics against women, now Revanath can do it, if that is happening in Karnataka then it is happening, it is right, it should definitely happen. If anything wrong happens anywhere in the life of a woman, people will say, now you have also spoken, everyone has spoken, now unfortunately it has happened to you, now someone will say in it that brother, tea should be served in the drawing room by going to the CM's house, there should be Aadhaar.  If you should wait then who has beaten him, now that name has been given to the opposition person by Sirsa ji, someone from BJP is his own, he is saying that he has taken the name of Sunita Kejriwal ji, now this sensitization has happened, is n't it?  Now that man, a normal man, would think that why would he hit someone with such a PA, it is not true, a great post, okay and they say that he doesn't even make much noise, so on someone's advice, now he would hit someone on someone's advice.  Also, why did we kill at his request, now this is the Indian mind, I will not use the word dirty Indian mind, that we think dirty, but sometimes we have to think logically also, a woman has gone to someone's house, his wife.  Normally, by saying Namaste, by saying Hello, Hi, how are you, are you a member of Rajya Sabha? Okay, you will have to ask these questions, I am not scandalizing here, but brother, this is a logic, for how long will they do this, why did you get this done, if it happens?  So if you got it done then you should ask for tea, talk comfortably, you should say hi hello, only then I am saying that when Kejriwal ji makes people vomit, not Modi ji, they are secure and will expel Yogi ji.  Have you fired Raman ji or have you fired Shivraj ji, have you done this? Hey, you too have done this. Who are the Rajya Sabha members you have appointed? Is any Rajya Sabha member working for you except Gupta ji who is contesting elections in Kurukshetra?  If you have, then tell me, all the singers are giving commentary. If you had included Yogendra Yadav, if you had included Kumar Vishvas, you would have included Prashant Bhushan and there are two or four more names who are not that famous but they are very.  The level of dissent of your party would have been high. In the Parliament, those people would speak, the learned people would speak, they would speak boldly and your party too had insecurity. You cannot depute anyone by going to jail. You are saying no, I will contest the elections from here even if.  Whatever it may be, because they want me like this and others say with a sigh that I have no greed. Firstly, I know all these politicians, it feels good to speak, if there is no greed, then why elections?  Why are you fighting in this heat, why are you doing this, not me, I want to serve you, I want to become the third time, someone wants to become CM, someone wants to become PM, tell me, where is my friend, what is the greed in this? Want power, want means be natural, do n't even say that I am very greedy for power, but I don't want this mask again and again, I just want to serve, in Haryana they say gal, sans gal, meaning Kejriwal ji, breath.  me some  I don't want it, I left the job of Ayres, the job of Ayres is nothing, there is nothing, the job of IRS is nothing in front of power, the job of IRS is nothing in front of the councilor, where did people tell that I know the job of Ayres? No, will it be great? Is it great if someone is showing the work of theft to him that if he could have eaten like this, then if he did not eat in any other way then it is a normal job. Yes, the starting salary today is 66100 basic salary. You are getting DA, you will get HRA on 501 rupees, so what is so great in it, I kept thinking this again and again that how long will these people keep eating bread, hey, when will becoming CM of Delhi become less than the IRS of Delhi, you had to do politics.  Curry, you worked hard, did a very good job, you struggled, you were not born out of nepotism, you struggled, it is very praiseworthy, but I had left him like this again and again, so I told him that this is this embarrassment.  It will cost you a lot of votes. I was already telling you that you are going to BJP after leaving behind a lot from Congress. This is yours and then this is us, we have abused them, we have abused them so much, we have abused them so much, now if you make us sit together then you will feel uncomfortable. People feel that those who were inside the party for so many years are leaving Chandigarh, so I was saying this only that what was it earlier, they were not expelled, they were inside, so that footage was going to be useful. Congress was  Now the entire Congress will bear the loss of their exit. It is possible that Congress may lose two or three seats in Punjab, it may lose Chandigarh, these fights are going on in these cycles, it is possible that it is not sure if it is okay and Delhi.  It is possible that what could have been done for two or maybe even three may now come only for one or there is not even one. If it is possible then there will be no benefit and yes master, it is sad that BJP people do not know how to do politics. How sad should you be, do something.  ASA commentator  Some big witness also comes because Aam Aadmi Party will have to get up from this petty politics. Now they are embarrassed like anything. Now let's discuss it and go further than this. We saw an interview of the PM who was saying something for 125 days and 100 days. 125 What?  It seems like a match fixing type interview. They all are sitting there like fan boys and are not even asking questions. In the entire interview, they ask questions to Agniveer once.  Friend, yes, we will employ, we will give the feedback. They wanted a feedback from the youth, they would have given some feedback from the youth in 25 days. Friend, do this to Agni, did you do that, that is not the point of the country, that Anjana Om Kashyap ji.  It's okay and one English one Rahul Tavar cover sorry cover cover It's okay two and the third one is a woman I am forgetting her name, she is also very famous and and she Sudhir ji, there is competition among these four.  What is happening is that who will bring more meaning on the facial expressions, as if there are no fan boys, he is like this and he is relaxed like this, man, this is the way this newspaper works, we, ours, I, I am not a journalist, but people like me are made to sit.  Two, I can ask such good questions to any leader with so much respect, with so much dignity, with so much love, and it will not at all seem like I will not behave like Karan Thapar. Do you know about Karan Thapar?  and why  You do that yaar bekari hai ok hai and the way Arnav Goswami conducted himself in that famous interview which he had with Rahul Gandhi aa wat ya woh anyway nahi pyaar se aaram se yaar tell yeh do yaar yeh toh ok nahi hai pyaar se to  He is not a journalist at all, I don't know, no one gives an interview to Shekhar Gupta ji and does not go to take it, is it okay or are some of the rest of our journalists also good, so this is also a vacuum in journalism too.  There is a vacuum, in this vacuum, wherever I get a little space, I also try to enter a little. Many people were telling me like this when I initially channeled that I should only contest elections, I should never contest elections, I am a good person. You can say, funny, cute, popular, if you want to become a journalist, if you say, look at this channel with a little journalistic eyes, do not see with these eyes that I am batting for a particular political party or I am supporting myself.  We have to do elections, it's not like this, it's okay, it's not like this, I don't roam around in this much heat, brother, we are like this all the time, okay, it's not in our capacity to do so much because we enjoy other things too, okay, so it's like this.  How many interviews are being done? How many interviews are being done? They are not being left anywhere and what is happening is that there is a different language in the interviews. If you go there then there is a different language and those who check in the media are watching but those who  It is being told there that if he goes to Andhra Pradesh, he will make Andhra Pradesh the number one state, if he goes to Orissa, he will make Orissa the number one state, old recording of Karnataka, he will make Karnataka number one, how many number one will you make? Friend, how many more number one will you make? So who was stopping you till now, I mean, you had to wait till the elections, they would have worn it in our Haryana, this is not a joke, I feel like telling a little, okay, it is like this.  Grandfather  The grandson has grown old and is sitting fine and the grandfather is in trouble, the father is in trouble, this is who will serve him now, that time comes, who will look after the old man, this happens in families and the elder one.  If you have a family, have many children, then one grandson approach is okay, okay Dada, you make such and such a plot in my name, then see if I do any service for you, then it is okay, only then I will translate it a little in English. Please put that plot in my name then see how much I will serve you then the dada says that you are waiting for that plot only, it is not the same, the public also has to ask it is the exact equivalent of that that you give us I will vote for you, if you are in the center, then make him whatever you want, give him, what is this or not, you give me a seat in the center also. Give this state to me, then I will create a double engine government. Looking forward to the double engine government, what will be played after this election, in the coming time, we will have to create a ridiculous situation and jokingly ask these questions through Wang.  Want without feeling touchy I think this is again a motive of this channel No ill will to be put on the politician Do n't call the politician very dirty But embarrassment I don't want that the politician is hated Yes, it is our blood, we are our brothers, we are the Indians who came out of us, it is not that all these politicians are from some other country and have come from that place.  I am some of them, I will say I may be most of them, I mean good, but sometimes the biggest problem of staying in power is that there is so much struggle to stay in power that there is no energy left to do any kind of work.  Every person comes for this thinking that he doesn't know what great thing he will do but his 95 energy, time and focus comes in staying in that power because he does and this is our Ben, we will discuss this many times further. Right now the election time is going on, after this if you want, brothers and sisters, then it will be discussed and it will be a lot of fun, you guys can subscribe the channel and if you haven't done so yet, share and like it. I will make a few requests leader  The type is fine, not one or two votes. Subscribers please from anywhere in the family, whatever they enjoy, whatever politics they watch, it will reduce the decibel level. I want to teach them how to enjoy politics, that in our India.  They say that friend, do n't discuss politics according to manners, we should not fight, we should know how to discuss politics, you are from that party, I am from some other party.  Well, I don't belong to any party right now, but if there are people of two different ideologies, then you should know how to talk from both sides. I, when there is such a conversation between five-six people, I play the role of an anchor in it. Yes, you too.  Answer this thing like if you get a chance to sit somewhere, that's fine, then I want that too and I want one more thing, I don't know, through Zoom it will be possible that many of you consider yourself to be a political analyst type. want  So, can we discuss on the platform? There are recordings on TV channels like these that yes, you said this, let us also debate like this, choose a topic, you are my real subscribers, I would like to give them the opportunity of the platform. Become a member of my channel. It is a very small fee but it will be fun. You will get a platform in other wise. There is no way of knowing you. If you become a member then you are like a member of some club.  Only if you can afford it, you will be allowed to jump in the swimming pool, otherwise no one will call you like this, okay, it is a small fee, I think, I don't even remember, it is around 50 per month, so I say, it should be done in a few days.  And if you enjoy it, whoever is ready to become a member and who has taken the membership, please write to me and connect with me, I have a very popular number etc. People are very easily accessible to me, I am very easily accessible in this through mobile.

Are you from any state or from Haryana, we will discuss comfortably and everything is among ourselves, it is not us but ours.  Whoever is my subscriber and who becomes my member, then I am sure whatever opinion he may have, but I am sure that he will talk comfortably and lovingly because that is the M. I want that we can laugh and discuss politics.  can discuss with pleasure And if you enjoy, then you will also see some of my podcasts coming and it is okay to enjoy that too, many people have taken my opinion on politics and on this, I am also becoming a small star like this, okay, so I am on this channel.  I want you all to join me through this, you also come and record, why are we all these journalists who have become so big, they are that kind of knowledgeable people, we are also knowledgeable, everyone is knowledgeable, so if you would like to join, please.  Come and I may want to moderate some of the debates and we may discuss some issues. I would like to do this so please you will enjoy. Okay and what is that next? This channel is fun, here I can also give my opinion.  I can speak and also listen, yes, obviously she will be in a civilized world, it will not be like this, it is okay that these users, who have such wrong IDs, all write bad things to me, till date I have used the proper name like My name is your name, so till date I have not seen that Rohit Sharma is writing anything else dirty, his name must be strange, when he has kept the name, he has kept the user ID because I will write everything dirty, dirty, okay, so this is also a  If there is a thing then I hope you people will join in this thing and will enjoy it because the story will not end with the elections now. After the elections, the government formation is the cabinet formation. Who should become the minister or not? Opinion halla first. Tell me, we can influence everything. We always feel as if some of the people around me seem to know me. Chhota, what happens to you? It does matter, brother, it does matter. Please give me intelligent advice. Do I have any misunderstanding somewhere?  It is not that the content on all my channels across them is making a difference to the society. Someone may call me a misunderstanding but I have no misunderstanding. Tell me completely whether it is there or not and that is my Motivates to do that in a practical way, do not treat anyone like this is dirty, this is dirty, that is, I am not like that, give good advice to everyone, whoever takes it, it should be good for the society, it should be for the good of the country, someone should follow the advice.  It is even better if you have a party and do everything, so I have always raised such issues and will continue to raise them in the future too. Middle class is my core audience. I raise the issues of the middle class, not those of the lower class.  I don't take care of poor people because there are many people for them. Not that my heart doesn't beat or I am a very selfish person or I am only a rich person, it is not like that but there is a special section about which no one is asking, so that is my core.  The audience is the same, it is okay and now everyone is crazy about that stranger's wedding, that person is doing that work, those people are okay, so the aim of the content is to keep it light, learn and enjoy.  Should learn how to enjoy discussing politics also it is inevitable we will have to discuss it. It seems that from inside everyone feels like not to do it but people are afraid that this fight will happen, so this should not happen if we have a mature society.  We have to build this channel and it will grow slowly, you people know that it will grow, you people will also support us and we have to take the level of this debate up towards happiness in life.  You have to take us towards peace, we have to discuss, you are very middle class children, the corporate people say that we don't want to discuss, no no, we don't have to do it like this, if the day you stop discussing politics, especially you read it.  It is written and your horizon is the view point, everything is there, but someone else will capture it all, then the same discussion will continue on politics, then you will ask why this discussion is happening because you have stopped participating and discussing. Given fact, if you are educated, if you are an intellectual, if you have knowledge, if you have exposure like I claim, I have, then we have to set the narrative that the public should ask this to the politicians and then the politicians are forced to discuss these issues also this is  The only way we will do otherwise is that even after 50 years from today, Mangalsutra will be gone. They will open the buffalo and take it away. These people will remove the reservation, Congress.  They will remove the reservation, someone will increase it, someone will reduce it, brother, this discussion will continue, this level debate will continue and then they will keep saying oh this is the level, what have you done, what hard work have you put in to improve it, you are very intelligent, aren't there many people who would write like this? And she becomes hopeless, you are very smart, what hard work have you done, I am working hard, support me, you also come and debate and then say, friend, why discuss all this, and one day will come.  When the rest of the lower class today is the middle class of tomorrow, India will also become a middle income country in 102 years, then only the middle class will be there. Seeing everything in one day is very big fat, then these new members will come to us, neither will this  This will also change when they become middle class, they too will have to discuss some such things, so from now onwards we will talk about intelligence, we will shift the narrative towards intelligence.

    "title": "The Curious Case Of Prashant Kishore ｜  Episode 70 [P-zcVJEPnhc].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today we will discuss the topic Curious Case of Prashant Kishor. I had a lot of respect for Prashant Kishor but of late I have seen one thing about him, you don't know whether you have seen it or not. Earlier I considered him just a consultant or not.  He is a pure consultant who will give consultation to those who come and do his work independently, which is very good but if you see recently, I feel like they are filling the B team of topper students. This is also called inception, not saying anything directly but telling one thing because he has a very good track record of being a poulter, however when I did research beyond that, I came to know that wherever he has won, that person had won anyway. In 2014, the topper student was bound to win, yes, he helped him win and that happened, but if you see, wherever he won, the win was bound to happen in Uttar Pradesh, when he was the weakest.  When he became a student and could not get them passed, then what am I trying to say if it is late? If you look at his words then he is from one side, the party which is going to provide justice, for whom he had gone to do some good and that party got the good done.  No for what ever reason, they are very angry with him, they are angry because telling a leader to take a break is of no use, this is not the case, since when did this start happening in our democracy because recently if you  Look, what is the pattern of the Jan Suraj that they are running, it looks very good, yes, they are also doing something of their own, may be political too, very good funding. Who is doing the funding? When he was asked who he worked with.  I had done that, so if you are doing that then the accounts of others have been frozen. In fact, these days I have also made some videos. Some people did not know from which side I am making the videos because it is not so easy to mold me into a single slot.  for but  Many people said that you have been sold, you have been bought by this party, now you have been sold to this party, how come, who is giving money to that party because if only the old people are giving them money then who is it with whom they have worked.  If they have done work with everyone then what kind of money is coming to them and it has to be every commentator, we have to tell what is happening as we see it, if we hold on to one side then I have given this as an example.  Let me tell you, suppose I am an Indian and I am a very good commentator of cricket and if there is a match between India and Australia, then which team would I like to win, brother, of course I would like India to win, but what is my job, the job of commentary.  I am sitting there in the commentator's box. From ahead I can see that one of our bowlers has bowled and a six is ​​hit, then I should say this and then if a six is ​​hit again, what should I say, man, his ball is week.  Was it or the line length was not right or should I do this or I will say no no no six read e no bowled, what can I say wrong if someone of my team's player drops the catch then will I say to him that man, what have you done?  What kind of player are you or you? What have you left out? No one's foot work is good in batting. So we have to speak about our own. And the same if any batsman of Australian team is hitting very good fours and sixes, then he is batting well.  Because When I sit down, I am an independent commentator. Look, these are the leaders, these players who come on the news channels, before the start of the match, they say only this, we will win, they are like this, they are a useless team, they are like that, those emotional fans are different.  Yes, but if you are a commentator, I come as a commentator and an observer of politics, then I express my emotions. Look, everyone has emotions, but yes, it is said to be an independent opinion.  It may be that you wish that this topper student should win, but if his actions do not seem right to you, then you will call him out, brother, this thing is not right, this Prashant Kishore ji will never be against the topper student.  Some don't even chew, they do n't even chew, they see all the faults in them, yes they have faults, no one is denying but that fault is obvious to the world, they are doing something good, never talked about it, they are doing the padyatra themselves.  What is good in Bihar? Bihar is a small province, a person has come here from here to there, from here to there, you could have said a few sweet words about him or you could have said something like 'Man, if nothing else, then on foot.  I am moving, my Saturn is activating, it is okay while walking with my feet, some Shani element is awakening inside me, some meaning from that side, it could have been told that yes, he is trying, trying is good or bad, that kind of thing.  come  Constant seems like a very mean and sour task, so as an audience, which is my subscriber base, my job was to tell them that when this commentary is happening, you should enjoy it wherever the commentary is happening because I am my  I am watching mine on the channel, I showed him a channel that according to the content, it was an expert and I said, my subscribers are not increasing, I get so many good comments, the way I get good comments.  In the same way, the subscribers say, 'I have analyzed your channel. My expert says that if you ever make the things you talk about good, then the devotee type will come and join and the others will run away. Then when you make them good, then  These devotees will run away and these ones will join a little, then they will run away saying that the constant is not yours, it is said like it is Dhruv Rathi's, it is Dhruv Rathi's. You know when the video will come, it will be one sided only, however now let me say that yes, I am also in it.  starting to taste  I started seeing a little bit of the truth but I still talk about the other side, so when you talk about both the sides, it becomes as if they were his own words. They say, Sir, did you see the movie Sholay in which he was the jailer?  Hai Asrani says, half go here, half go here, the rest of me and you are like this. They say that those who are subscribers now are the general public, they are divided, are they on this side or on this side, there is nobody who wants means nobody.  Very less people, my subscriber base is around 26000, it is 26600, so I request you guys, I have understood that my off-course is not going to run into lakhs so soon, but still I need your support, brothers. Sisters, many people were telling me, Guru ji, you fight the elections, we are on your side, friend, it is easy to listen, fighting elections is not so easy, brother, there is other work too. No good is going to be done by fighting elections just because the ideas are very good Datchi Pulao people are also there but they are different laid back now They also bring something good to the table They also bring something good to the table They also bring something bad to the table Now bring both of them, they cannot be patched up so that their government can be formed because it is ideology. Whatever detailed discussion you want on ideology, I will tell it to the audience so clearly that it is so confusing that you cannot understand. I am telling you today, whom will I vote for? I am confused, not decided, I am disappointed. Now I have gone in this direction.  I am like this, I am telling you today, who will my vote go to in the election, I don't know because I am trying very hard, I am using my brain, I am discussing, I am thinking loudly, we are ahead.  We will discuss Idol ji, both the main camps are ours, they are running only two political camps, so we will discuss their ideology and will dissect it and it will be a lot of fun, but today I have told that independent commentators.  It is not in the market, my channel is a fresh year, the reason is that if you start talking about something, someone has influenced you and given you something, but brother, this kind of thing. By using independent opinion, one can create one's own niche market. There is no one in the market who is talking like me. Otherwise, maybe I can become a breath of fresh air. Increase my subscriber base and increase my content.  If my viewership increases then I am earning money too, so why do I need to sell because it is like a person selling Golgappa is selling a papdi chart.  If I am selling a different dish, Bhelpuri, then I am not selling Bhelpuri, if anyone wants to eat Bhelpuri because everyone is selling Golgappa or everyone is selling Papdi Chart, then I am selling some different dish, if you want. Why should I convert myself into Golgappa or within it because there are only two types of things going on, either you, there is an English saying, I am with us and I am against us, why brother?  We can be with you We can be against you Independent people can be And this is what I want Our voter to be Our voter I want my vote Don't tell till the last breath Genuinely undecided in your mind As if I am telling you that it is not that  I am hiding who I will vote for, although there is nothing to be told in public because you know how the atmosphere is but still I am genuinely telling that who I will vote for is not decided.  It is not genuinely decided, I am not hiding it, I just want you to keep your eyes and ears open, we have to choose from the lesser of the worst, there is no best, best, greatest, there is not so much great choice, it is the misfortune of our country that we do not have  We don't have that many choices, among these they say, if not this, then who, if not this, then who? The answer is not given. It is not a matter of joy, it is a matter of concern and that. See. What should we import, what should we give more importance to, then I would like to make a video on ideology. If brothers and sisters, you want that video, then please write in the comment section. Thank you very much. Subscribe to the channel. The request is Ek Aadha Aadha To.  No, please add one complete subscriber because I want to hit 50000 subscriber base soon because that again gives a voice youtube0 subscriber.  Meaning, you are called a serious user, serious is also 25-26000, it is not such a thing, the figure of 10000 is also quite good, the figure of 25000 is also good, but at least get half century done, you people, the voting season is going on, the canvas season.  It is going on, brothers and sisters, it is increasing its subscriber base bit by bit, only then will the names of these few politicians also be respected.  Do you know how hard you have to do this in the heat? It's okay, it is not easy. Okay, so please subscribe, share. Thank you very much."

    "title": "The Hathras Incident ： What Needs To Change In The Baba System？ [1G341Sno40E].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, I want to tell you about the Hathras incident which is very unfortunate and which is not discussed. I want to discuss it and unfortunately neither the politicians are able to catch it, nor the public is able to catch it, nor the media is able to catch it, nor YouTube is able to catch it, nor Godi.  If the media was able to catch it or someone else could catch it, then I caught that thing and you guys tell me whether you agree with it and that thing is also a topic of discussion. Look, one topic is that 121 people. They are unfortunate, whatever has to happen means it is natural, okay, it is like in whose event it happened, only then is the person the rest of the law, what will be its course, they will know what will happen next, but what has not been discussed, I have to discuss that.  That discussion has to be done why do so many people go to Babas that there is one at every level, the poor have different Babas, the rich have their own sophisticated ones, the middle class is swinging.  It is somewhere in the middle, it is hovering around, that is okay and that is why I can say with this confidence that I have very good knowledge about this phenomenon because you can say this, small and fat Guruji, I am also Baba, but not Baba.  I feel like I am afraid of speaking, but many people like my talks, I find them very soothing, many different webinars join them and I am very conscious of this effort. How do I save myself from this?  And how do I save others? I save myself from two or three things. I never meet anyone. The second thing I say is, I consult, return to you and give me money. The moment you don't meet people, the moment people are on you as if you are very good.  He feels very good if he gives money and then suddenly he becomes a little guarded, then you, then you are no longer a good person, in his eyes, those people are fine because we, because what is there, there are two models, one is a model or good-good.  Talk useful, do logical things, get people above one IQ level and give them consultation if they need it or they should understand the things and earn money through it like mine, whatever I say, whatever I do, it is for  Earning Money That's One Aspect If You Take The Money Equation Out Of It I Won't Do The Moment I Tell This So I'm In The Very Safe Zone Then My Co  If something is clinging like this or hanging, then it is a different matter, okay, but this is the zone, but the rest of the guys do not do this, they come from a very high moral point that you will be like this for you, I am your savior, you are with me.  You will get some freedom or you will get some identity or you will come to know that your life is like a woman. Sometimes a Dalit says that some woman belongs to a poor family and comes from a backward society.  The community speaks, if it says something then he is troubled because of his gender, he is troubled because of his caste, okay he is troubled because of his poverty, that means trouble, look at the power cube will be the cube now in such a time. Someone will come and say some good things. Accept it. Okay, so you understand that no one is listening to him, no one is listening to him in the society, he is not being listened to in poverty, he is not being listened to at home. I told you about gender issues.  issues these  The issue is of course it is easy to become something and everyone's formulas are different. I tell people simply, earn Rs. 1 lakh from 100 people, you are fine in any way, the answer is not crores, and if you earn Rs. from lakhs of people, it is still a crore answer.  Okay, the question is that earning Rs. 00 is much easier than anyone, you will agree, the only question is lakhs of people.  Gather That's Itchy Hold Of People I Will Not Demonize These Baba's Also More Okay Why They Are Needed Is That Nobody Is Talking About The Mental Health Of This Country We Have A Mental Health Pandemonium In This Country The Government Is Sleeping  The media is lying and no one wants to believe it, because when they say mental health, they say they are mad, meaning if a person is  10. Take a scale of mental health from zero to 10, if 10 is the end, the person is crazy, if you call him that, then many people would be roaming around even at two, three, four, five, six, seven, or if zero is like the supreme knowledgeable person in the state of salvation. Gyani Sri Sri is one who does such things, if zero is on state means zero is hair, good state means mental state means absolutely fine and if 10 is passed then tennis is good, everybody will.  Give up brother, now its treatment is in psychiatrist word, that is, not even by taking medicine, not even by taking sleeping pills, not even by consultation, not by counseling, not by anything, so brother, now the treatment will be the same, it will have to be kept separately in the food. If it is that 10 then brother, many people are roaming around on 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. I want to tell you this and no one is even recognizing them because it is a stigma even with little stress.  Issues are constant stress, depression, anxiety, confusion, rest, every body of us go through that which upsets someone on a sustained basis, all of them create an exit route and especially the poor woman is unable to speak because  Just as I tell about women, I should also tell a little about religion, our pilgrimages and all these things, going to the mountains, going here to an average woman.  If you tell her, she will say, take me child on a pilgrimage, then the man will say, yes man, it is okay, mother is asking for pilgrimage, the wife will go, he will tell her, take me for a tour, take me to Sealand, take me to Kullu Manali, otherwise not Kullu Manali.  Taking it has become an issue, I am hinting at something that this is our culture, this is our religion, we talk about Sanatan very deeply and that is that he knew what was the status of women. What is the status of the people, so all these things were made, all these were made late because no brother, there are no doctors, so many people are having mental issues, what is the epidemic in India, no one is saying, there is a person in every house whose name is unknown.  Know that there are some issues in this, it can be on medication also and the rest also when one thing like this happens then it engulfs one or the other, that is also there and sometimes what happens is that people are on medication because of this. These  While eating, there will be someone who will unfortunately suffer, this is also a rule of law and this is a problem in big families and I want to talk about this, if there is hand juice, then drive unfortunately also, when you are chasing the World Cup like a crazy butch. There were so many slippers and the shoes have come out like this, they have not come out like this, there is a stampede, no one's shoes come out like this, you all know and you cannot go back and take it just  Because someone there unfortunately means okay, we survived on Marine Drive. I used to think that the people of Mumbai would not be that poor. Those who live in Mumbai are not that poor, isn't it? And I hope there would be quite a few educated people too. Look, thirty lakhs are going like this and permission was taken there, but there is BCCI, who is the secretary of BCCI and you know all that, okay, there is permission there, it is their government, there is no one there.  There is no problem and if a scandal happens there then it will come out again. Why was the permission not taken? Quickly the question is, all this is an issue in India, there is a crowd here and all this is there but the question is this.  Why do people go to Bhageshwar Dham to get the slip? I had also made a video once. People could not understand it at that time. People thought that it was good if he was talking about religion whereas I was not talking about any religion in it.  I was not saying it according to the rules, I was saying that after going to Bhageshwar Dham, someone's slip is issued to someone from Bhageshwar Dham. Is that right or wrong? I am saying that people get relief by going there. You are an alternate relief. No, in India many times one gets fooled and sometimes something happens. Why should we comment? If so many people are going, we have to ask why people are going. They should go to a professional because whoever goes.  I have been to these babas and are depressed and unhappy, no one comes to me in happiness, I am also an astrologer, okay, I am a good astrologer, but brother, no one comes to me in happiness, okay, no one comes to me in happiness, we are now in astrology.  If you take money by becoming a consultant, then our Baba type is like that. We don't allow it to happen on our own, otherwise at some times you can be of real help. I am telling you that this is the situation of mental health in India. If you are someone  There is no need to even speak to a normal man, listen to him politely and lovingly on a consistent basis. You can still have him be your fan. I am telling you how good this is because neither his father nor husband nor brother listens to him.  Neither do the children listen, nor does anyone else listen and you are just listening, yes, sister, no, not very bad has happened to you, no, this is very wrong, we are okay, no, you do n't do this, I am not making fun of women here. I am here I am not demeaning anyone, I am telling one thing about the system, Indian India needs lax and lax of mental health doctors, lax and lax of consult and counselors. Look in essence, psychiatrist is there to give medicine, but even in situations below medicine, people  There will be a place where there is no need of medicine, only someone can be found who can talk, one can only be found who can listen, one can be found who can give a little perspective change, that yes, life is tough but it is for everyone.  It is tough and it is for me also and 50 people come to me like this every day. It is tough for them too. Yes, no problem, if you don't get a job, then it does n't matter that many people are not busy, do your work, okay, there is a problem in the marriage, the marriage is going on.  Yes, this is how I am and this is how it is going on, otherwise you stay away. Yes, do something like this, there is no one to tell, there is no counselor or consultant, and on top of that, Indians are not used to being in the market.  They are used to paying them, they are used to going to Baba and paying them, why Baba will do it in a real world, will it take you to a different world, what is the work of Baba, I will tell you, understand it carefully, it is a deep video, it will do good to the society, even if it is a little long. Understand what I am saying, let me tell you youngsters, if you are the scientific people who do not go to Baba, when you go to a cinema to watch a movie, how do you feel if the movie.  It is nice especially if it has good visual effects or romance is happening or hills are visible or the heroine is cute or there is an action sequence Visualize any movie Why do you like it when you go to the cinema hall Specially watch a big picture Let's top gun, those big jha zhu are flying and there is background music and Tom Cruise is feeling good, someone or the girls are feeling like whatever the account is you  Visualize, I am going to say sometime, there we go, what happens when we sit in a cinema hall, a decent one, it gets dark, something comes on the screen, we get away from our reality for two-three hours.  That's why we get lost, watch the movie with the characters, be it a bad picture or if you don't understand, if Lal Singh comes in chadda, he will get upset, okay, but let's accept that there is some taste in the picture. Ficus religiosa  We are enjoying that experience and we are getting cut off. Baba ji also does the same thing, he will sit like I mean I too, I do n't go to satsang but then also do what ever I do and I talk like this workshop etc. and tell some things.  Yes, people come by paying money, sometimes it is free, you can take membership of 5050 channels, you will get content beyond the rest of my channels, I am telling you.  People, learn this from me, Blue Ocean Opportunity and we should not become Baba and should not do wrong work either. We do not get 'I' from anyone because what happens when you get narcissism, isn't he wandering in spiritual narcissism Baba?  He is a narcissist, I will give you freedom, I will tell you, the public will sit with crores of subscribers, they will come and meet again and again, give money to the organization, give it to him, then it will be easy to cut it off in one go.  Tell me, brother, I will take such a big thing and I will tell you something one on one and I will tell you that brother, I will tell you practically, never anyone, today I am going to give such a big knowledge, okay because what is it, you understand that we will abuse the babas like this saying. We don't talk about why there is alcohol, why are people drinking alcohol? It is something like that it is an addiction. A lot of people go to alcohol thinking that it will be fun and people also enjoy it.  I don't drink alcohol, but those of you who drink, tell me, I have never drunk, but I still understand the phenomenon because I tell people again and again that if you come to me, the difference is like in practice or in some baa jo Baba.  The good one is the supposed test should be that if I am good then you need not have to come to me again and again first of all the very fact you need if I make  If I create a need that you need to come to me every time For what ever that means Then there is no difference between me and others I want to be your woman Any person who is good will empower you and make you strong Don't tell you that  We are weak, he will say that you are weak, but this is not even weak and there is no need to be so strong and there is no need to depend on anyone, anything.  You will be given something so that you do not feel helpless. Mostly I have seen the Babas in this Baba circuit that they say that whatever you get, you will get it from me, you have to come to me again and again, they make you addicted.  This is absolutely addictive and ladies, we are women, they cannot drink alcohol openly, they cannot smoke cigarettes, but they also have pain in their mind, so they are more vulnerable, that's what I want to say, you have to check and this is just me.  Look poor people, my audience is not poor, I say it outright but this phenomenon is happening in middle class, upper middle class and rich too. Even among the rich, people have kept private babies. Okay Guruji, by saying that, you are telling everyone.  You call yourself, you are good, I am just a name, I am a consultant only for branding, the one with money is fine, those who come also get money, they get even more, Shraddha  We have a fee to speak like I am no difference from a CA or a lawyer or any architect or any you know doctor or any buddy else, so I am in that category but in this category anything can happen, get used to it.  Once again I will tell you and the family the problem of the rich, once the father of the family becomes the mother of Guruji, then the child will have to be on his own, the daughter-in-law will come from outside and she will say, what a mess is this here. Guruji decides everything. Look, whenever any person has any issue, I am giving you a hint to all of you, that whenever yours, whatever you can feel through your eyes, nose, through five senses.  Even if someone takes you somewhere else through these five senses, there is something else, maybe sometimes I also say this, but beyond that, I give a lot of emesis that there is something else and you cannot understand and even if I can understand, then the story.  In  The problem is that I am giving you a hit which can give you some logic within your five senses, whether it is a man or it can be a woman, it can be a Guru or a mother, it can be all the five senses which can be felt by your eyes, ears and brain. And the touch and smell and all these senses can satisfy you in terms of your curiosity, your pain and sorrow and logically tell you anything, whether it is using religion in it or not. Use spirituality, no matter what you do, but explain it logically when they say that it is not like this, it is something like that, you don't know, by doing this, then the matter gets messed up, this is what we have to see, then Hath Ras wale incidents are not only limited to gatherings.  Will happen in India, religious gathering takes place, there is also stamp paid, the question is whether it is such a simple thing in such a religion, can any gathering and stamp be done at any time?  You will never see a rich man in it. Why does a dying poor person die? Don't ever even think about whether a rich person is not religious or not. He does not die, but you will see because what is the reason for dyspareunia? It will be stamp paid. Look carefully and this is what I am saying to all the administration people.  And I am also telling him that if a big star comes somewhere, Justin Bieber, this and that, and you have made a system for him where people can touch him, either do this or you have made the stage so far that no one can even jump.  If it can be seen from a distance of 100 meters, then it is a safe zone. People are not dyspareunia, they will be happy but I am dyspareunia, we should not spread the situation. Look, I will tell you that this is how food is opened somewhere, it is okay to have such free food, I told people.  I have seen them breaking down like animals and I have seen them falling and I have seen it like this, I mean you and also they are not so poor poor people, I am telling them it is okay and  Even if someone is poor, no one is hungry, the government is providing food in India, but the fact is that wherever you see it being dispatched, don't yourself ever go in such places, there is some dyspepsia, then the issue will become very big, where do these people.  Go become so many people are having mental health issues they feel like they go I 'm telling you I'm not kidding I mean you are listening to me a In the particular time, listen calmly. There is logic in my voice. Many people find peace in my voice. You can find peace in someone's voice. He should know how to touch the pain points like you, but I also realize that  I do n't want to take advantage of these things, I want to help you, one thing is to take advantage of that, you will have to come to me again and again, take a little and give something, then come again Baba ji is good, if you go to Baba ji. Looks good, real Baba ji and  Guruji is the one who tells you the formula to make you feel good wherever you want in your life, go anywhere you want, you feel good and you feel good even without him and and you feel good with your husband, who tells you that you feel good in your life.  How do you feel good with children, how do you feel when alone with yourself, that is good, the real Guruji, Guruji is the test, if the first thing is that Guruji's words should seem logical, then what is good in good, so I am telling you that all drugs feel good, people.  What they do to someone who drinks alcohol Ask how it tastes, someone will say, it looks very dirty, it is bitter, it is poison, it is just like this, I look at it with hatred and smell it and drink it, people discuss it, a channel has been made on youtube1, she is like that, she is like this, this one is strong.  This is aromatic, I said brother, it is amazing, I mean there is so much pleasure in this as well as in seeing that, I am telling you that I neither drink nor drink alcohol, but I am giving this very good knowledge.  Hey man, this is what it means, but this is so much, is it a little spicy, is the liquor also spicy in this, meaning non-spicy, sharp and full English, Hindi is all there in it, it is like Motu Golu, it is a bit like me, it is right, it is right, it is ok and I said  Amazing man ok so what am I trying to tell people what you guys are listening to don't get addicted to anybody go to him what is adding value most of the people is mesmerizing ok this is also a  I know it's an art and don't get mesmerized just like that. People get mesmerized by leaders. Right now the aura of many leaders is breaking. It's okay but you get mesmerized when your mental condition is like it was everywhere in 2014.  It was as if someone had come again, may this not happen, good days will come and if this does not happen, brother, it was amazing magic, amazing like us, friend, should this not happen, yes, may that not happen in 10 years.  See how if it doesn't happen then all that too Baba, Anybody Anybody, I come and wants to influence you through you, Saraswati ji does not reside on everyone's face, Rahu ji also sits at many places and other people also sit, be a little careful, I will tell you a little test.  How are you given You should never become dependent on anyone If someone is making you dependent on himself It's okay to see him Barb I have to go and meet  Brother, the matter is messed up, remember, I stop the datchi, how what I do is that I create a barrier of money, as soon as I do money, a lot of money falls, a lot of faith, Hey Guruji, I like you so much, we give so much respect.  I watch so many videos, forward so many, I have been your subscriber since you had so many, I said, even then I will not get discount, the fee is so much, then if that person gets angry, then it is okay, he should come only then.  If I can create such content and keep control, then I have a request to these Babas also, if they are listening then do not play such low volume games and do it by charging fees. If this Baba had said that it will cost Rs to sit here, then such a crowd would not have come.  Meaning, you charge a fee and when you charge a fee, you can also give its facility because you have taken money, there will be security, there will be barricading and there will be something politely, meaning because the rallies are also so  When it happens, it turns out fine because the money is spent properly, so this is what I am telling you, no, many guys also adopt this model, by taking the money as it is, there are no such problems, but we have too.  Talk about mental health, smile a little sometimes, smile at many things, do not always remain angry and do not always remain optimistic, this is also a fact, it is okay that many people have this song.  Whether you are smiling or hiding your sadness, then do not be forcibly happy and do not be forcibly sad and when you are sad, go towards getting some happiness and do not look for positivity in everything. Do not look for negativity in everything.  I want to share a little discovery that I have made about living a good life. Just see the thing as it is, there is no need to forcefully add anything else to it or no, it is not that bad.  Actually, actually you know, this is good from the heart, this is good from the heart, this is good from the mind, this is good from the mouth, this is good from the face, don't get confused, whatever you are feeling, it is just the way it is, don't try to change it forcefully from your side.  Do your own thing to fit in. I hope you liked this lesson. You guys are liking the videos. Subscribe to the channel and like. Thank you very much."

    "title": "The Pain  Of Being An Ambani Or Adani In India Explained [4BpEkkcxuVU].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today's topic is The Pain of Being Ambani and Adani in India, let's talk about their pain, the pain of the poor, the pain of the middle class, the pain of the common man, look at their pain too, yesterday the Prime Minister also took their names. Rahul ji has come up with some figures that 130 times he is taking his name and 30 times the Prime Minister has also given him money. Now he is not talking about them. Firstly, I am not able to understand what the contact means because he  What is being said is that he does n't have social media, is he not attending rallies, I do n't understand what is happening but inside all this there is cross fire of political parties but oh man, they become memes.  Not why did he break us these days, you people understand this language, okay Ambani, Adani, you are wondering, why are you breaking us, friend, I want to ask my audience, or Ambani ji's Reliance said last year.  25 thousand crore tax was given to the Government of India, not 000 rupees, but 25000 crores. Friend, the rich people of our country are running business. Please spare them. What do you guys want in their name? Disclaimer: Before this, people should say this, O yours too.  I got the money just like we get it every day for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Brother, I did not get any money. The only disclaimer is that I am a shareholder in both these companies and this is what I am telling you.  I want to tell that when Ambani Adani grows then you also have a chance to rely, how much return has been given in 1 year, 20 years, 30 years, 35 years, how much wealth has been created, just look at Jio Financial, it is a company worth Rs 19 lakh crore, it is 21 lakh.  Their listed case is of crores, now they are talking about Rs 21 lakh crores, what do you want, look at those who are worth Rs 50, 100, 200 crores.  Those people with net worth are leaving the country, they are not explaining to anyone, neither telling nor asking, they are going to Kotli and thousands of them are leaving. Last year around 9000 had gone, it is almost fine, so if this is all the rich India. If we leave, India will become a very poor country. Brothers and sisters, the capita income which is counted in India, Andani and Ambani ji are also counted in the capita income, only then India will become the world's leader.  This person is at 140th place in GDP. Don't become a hero, he is at fifth place in GDP. But go to Capita and you are in 140th place. That's why we are saying that inequality has happened. These people have come to your house and troubled you.  But are they taking money at gunpoint? Are they running this business? Yes, this is a network, don't you go mobile? First, if the world is in your grasp, then it is still there, isn't it? Which one was this?  If you were ringing the BSNL phone then and there you would be talking to the lines man that my voice is not coming, now I have 5G internet in my hands, I am ready and all the resources and ports are being taken care of.  There is a separate video of me made at an airport, I will tell that separately, but what I am trying to say is their pain. Look at their pain, where will they go now? They are being whipped from both the sides, whose government will be formed.  But how soon will they be made to fight in their name, that is, no one belongs to anyone else, no one belongs to anyone in politics, what I want to say is that the opposition can allege anything, can make noises.  It is like he ate and drank, it happened, but if any top leader from the ruling party says that you have got the money, you have become silent, it has come to you, you have an agency, check, either you are speaking in the air or else.  if it is then it is all there  Right, that grip, tell me where, what has happened to me, how much reputation has happened to me, now where should that poor guy go, my love of Adani Ambani, where should we go, tell me whose photo is with whom, what is it, friend, what is the need of rich people? Har Har, if in this country they would say cleanliness.  The rich are very important, the poor are very important, everyone should have rights, it should be like this, then is n't Adani Ambani important? The pre-wedding function of Ambani, so many people came to it.  And its issue became that Jamnagar International Airport has been made for some time, people from the rich world have come there also talking about business, this is the interest of rich people, even if they meet in a function, at a wedding, or at a party, they also talk about business.  Let's talk, business comes, foreign direct investment comes, investments come, someone comes, he is not like that, only he came to sing Byag's songs, he also worked and did more work, India's sort of favorite seems to be that there is an Indian, brothers and sisters who  So much  It gives people the opportunity every day to come and dance and sing and so many highest paid performers go after dancing and we do n't have the slightest pride in it. Do they want to become a very poor country? Have these people taken away everything from the government means?  If you don't do this business then all the Indians will become rich. Both of them have prevented how many people have given jobs to Indians, how many have given direct jobs, four to five from those direct jobs. Six indirect jobs come from it, so it should be a little great, according to me, what do you guys think, now I want to discuss further on this, this small party, Congress, whose numbers are still not equal to BJP, is ahead.  How many will be there, what will happen, will Cha Joon come to know that he has been put on defensive, these answers are being given and this thap thap brother, you are batting very well, man, what is happening, he hits bouncers, this answer  give  They are saying something, they are giving answers, they are setting the narrative, that is why momentum is being created, why is there a need to answer, if you look at it, look at the twist in the story, if the public is intelligent, then why are you explaining it to them, but the problem is that the public  The public is not intelligent, the public is stupid and since the public is stupid then why should only one party fool the public? If the public is stupid and the public can be fooled easily, I also agree.  Majority of the public, we can fool them is a fact in India and this is why only one party should get the right to fool, that is why I have repeatedly seen in my videos that I am so against that one party has lied.  If someone attacks or does not give a genuine explanation, they talk about something else because they know that if they start giving an explanation then there is no use, they will not understand or if it is seen that we are giving an explanation then it will be considered as acceptance, very different.  Level politics is happening, you have to see, but you don't come here, that's the tension, because what happened in me, there was a joke going on, what was the joke, a journalist was going from somewhere and was stopped by some policeman.  If you stopped then you would have said journalist, then the journalist would have said which party, so that was the joke that which party's journalist are you, this will be the problem of the public, there is some element of journalism in this channel too, if you look at it and the work of journalist and journalist. First of all, you want to ask a question to the government. Do you want to discuss a lot about the party which has 52 seats and has crossed the limit of 75-80 seats? Brother, don't bring 75 seats, will we say something and stop it at 60?  It doesn't matter whether his 75 or 80 income means less income. So you want the country's opposition to become so weak and you don't even ask one side the question, just give them 450 somehow.  Take them to 500 5th seats and don't keep any narrative on the other side. Hey, this is this, why should you ask these questions to them, brother, is he in power? Will we ask questions to whoever comes to power? If they come, we will ask them, that's the only thing.  It should have been that in 2010, when the Commonwealth Games scam happened, all the main stream channels led by the great Arnav Goswami used to tear apart every day by doing Chillam Chilli, then it is not good.  We used to do good journalism. If anything went wrong, get it crossed Rs. 400. Devotees, when someone will come in the broadcasting bill, they will write in it that if you don't speak like this, then we too will talk about our mother-in-law and daughter-in-law with our finger on our lips. Who are we benefiting by talking here?  But that feeling comes from within, on the other hand, spending so much resources and time on this channel, my other channels are big hits, get a lot of views and are a source of a lot of income, at that cost I am making.  True journalism will come at a cost. I am copying Shekhar Gupta ji. I press the join button and take the membership to support good journalism. This channel has hardly any fees, meaning watch something, chai pe charcha wali membership is there if you like the content.  So you will get to know from that because even if someone gives ₹ ₹ 0, inside Super Chat, there is a feeling that yes, because the real appreciation is money and everything is money and this is what I am telling Sharma.  I do n't know why they are living in shame. Hey Adani, Amani Pai of our country, they are the symbol of money, they are the symbol of wealth, they are the symbol of Lakshmi, in our country, where symbol means they are the real ones, why are you detesting them, are they doing something wrong in the business?  If you are living then do that separately, they killed your son's share and took the airport, then tell me that your son had also bid and he won that bet. Hey brother, why are you unnecessarily competing with them, now this is the fashion. Went  Adani Ambani Adani Ambani Adani Ambani scandal is being carried out by someone else, the company is defaulter, someone else is absconding, someone else has run away with the loan, neither has he defaulted any loan, nor has he defaulted in any tax, nor has he increased the shareholder wealth in any way.  I have given jobs to my employees, they are all doing great work and they should be clapping and not just the two parties, but everyone in the entire country should be clapping.  Just take two names, take two names, maybe it is linked to Gujarat, although Ambani ji lives in Mumbai, so maybe he creates a lobby with him and becomes a source of targeting, but see how those people are in identifying friendship characters.  The thing is, brother, now you have jettisoned them, that too is a wrong thing, isn't it right, the job of opposition is to do it like this, that means no one is related to anyone else in politics, I also want to convey this message.  I am saying that if we win the election, we will tell that friend later. Even if there is a friend, if he sees it, he will understand. I have to say, is this the public being fooled or is it being done with friends, friend? Everything happens, you must know brother, Raja should support the traders, all the traders from top to bottom, but look at this pain, brother, after paying tax of Rs 25000 crore, if I am telling my tax of Rs 25000 crore for the year.  Look, if it is my company in which it is at 52, 53 or something like that, then it is fine and other people should also be made to grow and take a share of the profit alone. If you are a shareholder, then you would also be getting the dividend in the same ratio, is that alone?  The rest of the companies take away everything that is renewable energy, climate change, these people are bringing everywhere in telecom, financial services, health services, now people earn so much money.  They are bringing things to compete with India so that they can earn money, so everyone in India is doing this work and they are whipping us, how would be their moral, I mean, what do you Adani Ambani want to leave India and go to Australia?  In Switzerland, in Sweden, in America, how much time does it take for them to start doing business? You tell me, is there anyone who wants to ask you, how many days can a film star stay outside, see how many. How many days do big leaders stay, how many top leaders stay, how much do they all roam around and how much do these people stay in India but look at the data, the same people are living in the slums of Mumbai, they can go and live in better places anywhere else.  Everywhere, everything has been bought and they can go to any country in the world in 2 minutes, that is, they will welcome with folded hands, perform aarti, welcome, welcome Adani ji, welcome Ambani ji, in two minutes more aarti.  Will continue to pay, there are many countries where tax is not levied on taxes, yet in India these poor people still do not go and are also taking abuses, they are taking abuses every day, as much as they say, top leaders say, I take a lot of abuses.  Someone says no, it is given to Rahul, no one is giving as much as he is being given, both the parties are fighting in his name, this one is saying this, this one is saying this, this is also given to him, so it is not his matter.  now he is challenging me  It means that you don't talk about it and will start talking in the same way as you are talking. Hey, in talking about these, our MP Mahua Mitra ji told her, hey, you asked 50 questions, out of 60 questions, 50 questions or 55.  Did he ask Adhani ji, did he have any trouble there? Now tell me that when someone asked a question in the Parliament, everyone went after him, do you know?  What happened, what was the story and how did that story play out? Now it is being said, if you do n't talk, if you talk, you will die if you don't talk, then it's like this, brother, what is happening, is this a comedy or not or is a man speaking logically? Will he do this or will we just make the debate in such a way that you are against BJP and Congress, this misunderstanding happens just because a question is being asked about it, so we will not agree with it. Many people have done this, that means many big journalists too. Tiger Van Kade is an ideal for us. We are clinging to such small things. Our idol is Tiger Van Ghade. If he is directly asking the ruling party, then do n't think that he is not your friend. Neither will anyone benefit. If the ruling party is exposed and questions are asked then it benefits from the default setting. Did n't the opposition benefit? When Arvind Kejriwal did the crusade that  The anti-corruption IAC guy was running, India Against Corruption was running, Anna Hazare was sitting and all, there was so much riot in Delhi, do you all know that benefit laddu fell in it of BJP, do you all know whether that thing fell or not.  If you tell then everyone has to see this, inside this I would like to finish by telling one small thing and this is just this, don't hate people will just see how they are making it what  You can do this, you can be easily part of their journey in their company, if you feel that they are getting big benefits, something like this is happening then take it in the stock market, who forbade, not every man can take it, so where should the poor man go?  A man is getting ration. How can 80 crore people get everything? A poor man is getting ration, somewhere he is getting electricity, somewhere he is getting water, somewhere he is getting health care, somewhere Ayushman Bharat is getting it, all the benefits are there.  You have done something by giving, hey brother, he will create something in the air or he will set up a solar plant somewhere where there is a swamp, then the rules issued by some subsiding committee are for everyone, it seems like this because he is Rahul.  Gandhi ji too, I was going here, who built the road, who did this, who did this, this one, oh brother, everyone's time comes, there used to be a time when someone did this, who did this, Barla, who did this, this is how it happens.  Everyone's time comes, then someone else will come, become you, it takes 20 20 30 30 40 40 50 years, 60 years to work hard to form groups, to form companies, and the road is not being built by just one, the infrastructure is not being built by them, they are building the world.  Yes, but the thing is that someone becomes a poster boy, someone becomes a poster boy, yes brother, we have to take his name, how many companies in India are there to build roads, build infrastructure and manage airports.  It's all a matter of talk, but if someone gets [ __ ] then I think this is the age, we should call out to the public that this is their name, don't you tell us what they have to offer you, instead of saying this, they have got this benefit.  He got it done, he gave it to him, we will give it to him, we will give it to him, the middle class is jumping like this, both the parties are not talking except the poor, the middle class here is not a cheer leader or in IPL, they are standing like this and jumping, who are they? jumped like this  Hey, you are not getting anything brother, why are you becoming middle class? Only then my idol ji will slowly come out. I am the idol of the middle class and I want something different for the middle class. Now you will understand a lot.  It is easy to go and tell anyone that you are not from BJP, if you are not from BJP then you are a Congressman and if you are not a Congressman, then you are a devotee. You can be something else too, human brother, just because you don't know that here India cannot live with the Republican Democrat Party. remained  There are only two ideologies or 80000 ideologies, India is our country, so here we have to be a little broad minded and see the possibilities that yes, who is telling lies and where, illogical things are being said, useless things are being said.  Those who are being tricked or are being made to raise unnecessary slogans have to come and call them out every time, this should be our aim because the rest of the Godi media is already done, look at youtube0 now, the genre like ours.  All the channels started running because people want to hear that independent voice. I am saying this again and again that it will not seem neutral. People say no, no neutral, no neutral. What is neutral? Calling both good or bad and Saying that I am neutral is not like that. Independent is having an independent opinion by focusing on one thing and not having any personal agenda of course against the one you spoke against. Brother, you want that the party which is going to get 80 seats in this election, assume that by studying closely behind it, we bring it to 74, then you will agree.  You can tell me that something big will happen to you through seats, you will focus on them as well, but the focus will be on power only, only the topper student will be told, the one who is the fastest horse will be told to be the first, only the one who is the leader of the country will be told.  If I consider it as an illusion, it is okay because I belong to aviation. Consider my country as the judge. So, I will focus only on the engine which is mine and is sitting somewhere. It neither engages nor provides thrust nor can it even run.  The pilot of my country who is running the country will be questioned on his piloting skills. If there is a change in the pilot then the new pilot will be asked on that pilot that brother, your currency is fine, your weight is fine.  You haven't drunk alcohol, don't you have any stress, everything is fine with you, we are sitting behind watching, we will ask you why should I talk about that pilot who was grounded and whose license was canceled?  What should I do, hey, why are you asking this pilot? If he did n't come to sleep completely then what happened, he used to drink alcohol at night, he was like this, oh brother, have his license been canceled, isn't he itching to get another chance?  I will put it beyond that With such a beautiful example, I am telling you that it is related to life, brother, who has my reins, the doctor who will open my stomach, I would like to see about him only. If any doctor has committed a scandal, first of all, I am not telling him about that doctor. Whoever comes to power is that doctor who has the tools in his hands to open and close the stomach, if questions are asked to him then he has come to put the stitches, he is doing the right thing, is your mood fine, is your health fine, is there anything wrong?  Is the hygiene factor okay, all this is fine if asked from him, then what is the problem in asking the ruling party, you are saying no, he did good for my operation brother, he did good for you, he did good for others also, keep doing good for everyone else, always keep doing good, then checks and balances.  On this, only those who are in power will remain in the limelight. Only those who have more chances of coming into power will remain in the limelight. If they have more chances of coming into power or come into power, then they will be scrutinized and that From 2004, brothers and sisters, 2014, tell me one thing, those who are devotees, brother, who liked 14 from 2004, no one liked it, 9 liked from 2004, liked it only then the country gave it in 2009, now if they did not like it then removed it, liked it a lot in 2019  What happened to 19 from 2014, that's why 19 got 24, the result remains to be seen, but tell me one thing, brothers and sisters.  2004 Keep your hand on your heart, the amount of scrutiny that was created in 2004 to 2014 was as much as it was, is there anyone who can create that much of noise in 2014 to 24? Now many people will say no, he was a week student, used to make mistakes every day, there were red marks. That's why there was an uproar, this student is so sweet and good, there is no mistake, that's why it didn't happen, it's not like that, it's possible that since that time the word has opened up.  Don't want to use Dash, the dance was going on, it was not going on that openly at this time, but the dance is going on here too, and some came out also, but as many came out, as many questions were not asked, so the one who is asking the questions is the one who is demanding accountability.  Be it any small or big journalist, you too can become one through this medium. Today, every common man is a walking journalist, he has a mobile in his hand, he can speak, he can record video, if there is something wrong in the voting.  are you feeling  It is possible that a video is made of something going wrong and this is what is going on through this. There is an ambassador somewhere right now. He posted the video that there was garbage lying around. Their embassies are the Greek Embassy and an Austrian Embassy.  Probably there was garbage somewhere in the middle, they went and made a video saying, what kind of trash is this? They went to NDMC and cleaned it, that is, there was no chance and system to see it normally.  That's why the Ambassador of a foreign country had to go and make a video, so brother, in the video, he is also a journalist, so these things make a difference, this is how it has to be, now the next generation is not going to get beaten in the rallies in the sun in 10 years.  Whoever becomes the next Prime Minister and will be a user means he will also be a politician and anything can happen but he will definitely be a user through social media presence. Now everything will work here. Okay, so do comment here and go there.  Vote also because you have one vote, you must cast your vote, otherwise it should happen that elections are held in Bengal and you stay in Gurgaon only, you are going to stay here by bus, take the train and go, don't cast your vote.  We have to create an atmosphere here, that's not going to happen, if the chariot gets stuck, then those who are in trouble, my previous video was a big hit, the one who is stuck in the chariot, the chariot is getting stuck, you are in trouble, see, many people enjoy getting trapped in the chariot, those who are getting trapped.  I have fun, brother, go and vote so that the chariot gets stuck, it is okay, many people enjoy taking out the chariot, so go and vote, you have not come here to get trapped, so many have come here, oh brother, you go and vote, otherwise you will get trapped.  It is possible that the chariot may not get stuck, the horse may have to be changed, it is okay, anything can happen, be alive to all possibilities and one at the end of the day, brother, do not take tension, India is being run by Ram Lalla.  It works with confidence, more than half the time, so don't take so much tension, Ram ji has become more comfortable, now it's okay, Ram Lalla, you see, Ram Lalla has been established, so why worry, you are fine, whatever happens will be good, it's okay.  Whatever happens will be good, it will be for the good of the country and the country itself will decide. What will the country decide on 4th June? Whatever happens on June 4, it will be decided by the public, it will be okay. It may be as per your wish, it may be against your wish.  yes  It may happen or something in between may emerge. What do you want, how should we be? If someone like me comes to the will, questions will be asked to whoever is in power. On June 4, brothers and sisters, the government will be known as to whose government will be formed and whose government will be formed on June 5.  Videos will come to tell him that brother, he did not make me a minister, he made the opinions, he did not give this department, he gave that department, this country will run like this, people coming here are writing about me in the comment section, take a screenshot of this.  It will come again that you will have to eat Muki, why do we have to eat Muki, brother, we are commentators, the commentator is giving commentary, one team is losing, one is winning, why do we have to eat Muki, we are telling the situation with our eyes, one by one, fours, sixes, first hit. Now he is not hitting and he is doing the work of hit wickets. Okay, the second one which seemed to be a small and powerful team, I don't know from where because many times you have seen big teams losing matches with small teams.  I want to tell you, brothers and sisters, one more thing and then I will finish the video. Dhoni ji was there, many people love Dhoni ji even today and how he was run out in 2019 and was never seen again. Who knew that Covid would come again like this?  It will happen again that he wo n't even get a chance to say bye bye. It was a great pain. Do you remember when he was run out? Right, 25 runs were needed on 10 balls, he turned, took one run and came to take the second one.  You have got a direct hit, don't you remember that opportunity in life, everyone has to have courage, all the fans, devotees and everything else, but there we could not somehow make Dhoni win because he was skill based.  The New Zealanders were bowling, fielding, somehow we could not stop the ball from hitting the wicket because the match was going on, but brothers and sisters, here it is in your hands, whoever wants to win, win, voter.  Take your ID and press the button hard which you have to press, then for voting, because when we creators had gone, the Prime Minister had messaged one thing, I took it very seriously that we are doing award ceremony, it is not for elections.  You are not doing it for your own benefit, this is because of all the people, if you have distemper, then give it to the one who has less distemper. It is also possible that there are two people, both of whom are distempers, give it to the one who has less distemper.  It can be anyone, do go and vote, this is the message, it's hot, don't worry, drink water, go, it doesn't take so long, go with your family and be proud because when you vote, then you have the right to say that I went to vote.  My ward won, didn't win and the person to whom it was given and if he wins then you have to ask him more questions, this is the message I am giving, what do people never do that if you are asking questions to someone, then you  She is in the opposite team, this is a wrong expression. You see in every family there is a wife, she questions more than her husband or does more than the neighbor's husband, you tell me this, you will tell the neighbor's husband, you are not my wife.  If yes, then why are you asking me a question, but the one who is evolved has the right to ask the wife's question, so this is the message to you, know more about the person whom you voted for last time and the person whom you are thinking of voting for this time.  Ask questions because brothers and sisters, when you have to buy a flat, you feel like asking more questions, what is the payment plan, when will the position be, is it my one, is it not my one, what are the amenities, what is the reputation of the builder, what has been built before? What will happen back and forth in low cation, only then you ask questions, where you don't have to buy, you saw it as soon as you left, brother, I did not understand this, so when you did not understand, you left from there, no, you will not ask questions from there, now as a sales guy.  My  He has all this training, I also give training as a sales guy. You should be very happy that if some customer is asking you too many questions because if he is asking you too many questions that shows his interest, he never speaks like this.  That Oye, I am Godre Jaad, you are from DLF, you did not ask questions, what is the logic here, I am talking about property right now. I am in a property or you are going to buy it or no one should face any problem. Our education system has been somewhat useless. In India, there may be issues in our values ​​too because this is how parents do parenting. Don't ask more questions, that is, questions.  Asking more from parents means opposing parents. I am changing these things through this channel. Brothers and sisters, I am changing the way India things and I am being successful at it. Please comment section.  Write in Slowly but Steady I am Creating an Environment Which is Positive Which is Tangible Where Accountability is Question Where Argument is Ku Tark Nahi Hai Where Importance is Given to Dialogue Not Controversy Where Who is Contributing to the Dialogue  It is not important to discuss what is happening, what is important is what you are saying, what I am saying, who is saying it?  Not important said what is being discussed and at what level the discussion is taking place, if the focus is beyond that then please write in the comment section. Many people are finding these videos as my therapy in the election environment. Please share and I ask only at the last end that I will start.  I do n't speak because it is a request from those who are watching till the end. Subscribers. I know you are already watching me, but I have a request from you brothers and sisters, are you two to three?  Subscribers can be increased further because when so much effort is put into increasing the subscribers, then these leaders get respect. Asking is not so easy and not getting it even after asking takes a lot of effort and then come back and push again, brothers and sisters, like this again.  If it doesn't work, it's okay, please write in the comment section. My Agniveer movie is almost ready. I feel like after the release of that video, I am getting it checked by two or four people that yes, it is fine.  Because that video is made with a lot of emotions, it is very good and it is my promise that it will be released on this weekend because now it is made, it is fine, but now I have to recommend that video that you have to watch that video. You have to spread that video, you have to reach it to the people because it affects all of us, just because you don't have to go there to become Agniveer, that means it is not of your use, that video is of use to every Indian, you have to wait for that video now.  Like Share Thank You Very Much"

    "title": "Two Types Of Dreams That Middle Class Has ｜ Kahi Aisa Na Ho Jaye [F3NUMQRNVlA].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, as always interesting and original topic, will your dreams come true, friend, which dream are you talking about, dreams means, yes dreams means, whoever has dreams, then there are two types of dreams, brothers and sisters, one is a dream What you think about yourself that I should become like this, this should happen in my life, secondly you are shown dreams, there are political topics on this channel, so only politics is the topic, there is no tension in having personal dreams or goals.  It is not a matter of that but if your dreams are such which are being shown to you then you are not going to reach anywhere in your life. This is the message. Never let someone tell you in life that this should not happen, that this should not happen here, that should not happen here.  And you get drawn into it, these are just stories, someone is saying that if 30 lakh jobs are given, poverty will not be eradicated, someone is saying one should not reach here like this, someone is saying that one should not become a Vish Guru, some, aye it is the example,  Like the husband tells the wife we ​​are sitting, it's okay, it's evening time at home, the weather is nice  It's raining a little outside, it may happen that a tea is made and then the paneer one is served and it tastes good with the nice chutney and then the wife also says yes, it's okay, who will make it, it's a problem of dreams, especially of politicians to show off  This is that just show who is doing the work, he gave dreams, the dreams themselves are a feel good factor, if I tell you like this, if gulab jamun is your favourite or rasgulla or your ice cream or when mango is in season then mango is fine  If it is there then you feel a little good even after talking to him or by doing this, let's go to this house and have a holiday, many fathers are like this, no matter what happens, if you promise in June, then for 15 days your behaviour towards that person  It will be very good because father is taking you to Switzerland and it is a different matter that Gullu took you to Manali, he cheats you and many people take you to that ice skating rink in Omus Mall, it also feels cool, okay?  There is a mall called Omus in Gurgaon on the top floor, eye skating is available on the top floor.  He is very cold, if someone says that this will happen, just think about it, he has taken a trip to Switzerland, the temperature is this much, so by that time you have taken good care of the child, his behavior was like that, the same thing is happening with politicians and that  Now people tell so many people that it is the same, for some people the lollipop is the same and the lollipop is the same, so people separate it and when people collide with each other then they separate the lollipops, they have both the choices of lollipop  There are enough of them and there is a huge audience as well. Go to each one of them and tell them a story, this should not happen, that should not happen, these are dreams, I am telling you this about a dream, secondly what do these politicians do, they will forcefully play with your respect On self-esteem, we will tell you that we have done this work and it has increased your pride because it is very easy to increase someone's pride, especially if you are from a country where you suffer from low self-esteem, no one at home asks you about your job.  No, your looks are not good, your relationship is not good, you are not able to attract a boyfriend or a girlfriend, you are not able to attract a spouse, if you have a spouse then you have quarrels with him/her daily, you can say anything in such a mood.  G-20 do whatever you want, it was fun, the pride increased, now the poor person whose pride does not increase at all, he will say, yes it has increased, what do you mean by it, you organized the function, okay, so it's a great thing, the world is organizing Olympics, it happened in 100, in 1896, okay, so  It is being done for 128 years, we have not done it till now, do you know what incidents happened in the Commonwealth or in 2010, okay then I mean Chhutku Chhutku Barcelona, ​​I do n't know what all places, what all people have got done forcibly here.  If that was done then there is no pride, this is pride but whenever they play, it means women, any big leader of women, any leader is fine, anything and all those leaders are acting as women only, everyone knows about both the factions.  Both the top leaders are great They are playing a game, women know that they do not get respect at home, this is the bitter truth, mother-in-law will not let them, husband will not let them, women will never be understood like this, FinanciallyExpress I am not among the feminist MCPs here but the fact is that  Talk to any woman with a little love, I am telling this to husbands also, if you do it then they will not get into this mess that he is a great leader, he did this or that, it should not happen that your pain becomes mine  It is pain because no one is able to hear the pain of a woman, so this lip service, come and tell me I understand your pain, I have given you this, now I have given it to you, you want more, the heart wants more, there is no respect for a woman Give it to their closest relations, especially husband, brother, whatever you give to the woman, she will give you 10 times more. Leaders know that they give so much respect, give them all the vote, fold your hands and talk about them, the rest is just words and actions.  The thing is practically no one has done anything during periods  There is no talk of leave, only those people stand up there in the parliament, no no, don't say such things to us, it doesn't make any difference to us, it does matter friend, ask those who are responsible, there are many things, there is lip service, there is lip service everywhere  Looking at the women, but what are those women now, they have not become that intelligent yet because they do not get that much love, affection, respect at home, so the leader comes and gives them a little bit through his mouth, wow wow wow wow wow, and I remain a fool How much because, how much because, even then men have become aware, they are able to see through because what a man is, what is going on inside that man, many times it becomes known that this friend is fooling the woman  Those who stay at home and do not go to work, in the middle class and many sections of the society, women are working less in India, they work only till 19, which means only one out of five women works in India, between the ages of 20 and 60.  those who are of working age do not work, those who do not work  What do they do, what do they have in their house, whatever is inside the house give them some comfort there and then give it to them and they are sold for that much only brother, if we are about to complete 77 years of independence, after so many years if  If we become happy with some small things then it means that those dreams will become ours that I first become mine, hey whatever happened, I made you win the election brother, now how many times can you keep winning on the same thing, some fresh thing  Bring it so that whatever is fresh, those dreams are coming and talks of pride are taking place and that pride and the pride of India because we have been a slave for so many years, it has gone away from us as a country, as if anyone has come from anywhere  I saw a movie, you all must have also seen it, and I felt very sad after watching that scene, and I want to tell you because it was a very popular movie, everyone must have seen Lagaan, the Aamir Khan starrer in Lagaan, you know the whole thing at the end.  When there is a cricket match etc. then in the last scene he hits it like that and then he catches it and it becomes a six.  Which scene is that, it is not the one about the sixer, after that the announcement that we have won, so look at the faces of all those people who were there, the picture is beautifully made, there is no criticism of the picture in it but look at the emotion that  We are such that if we win something, we want validation even today; if some white man writes a good report on our country, if some white man comes and does something good for our book or praises us, we want validation even today.  While it is a different matter that we have progressed to such a level that if something does not suit us, we even reject it saying that no, your reporting is forced work, but still if it is good, then it can be boasted of.  We definitely play the game. We do n't want any report from such disruptors. I don't want your applause. I don't want your validation. I don't want anything. Even today I want the Oscars. Okay, even today I want the Nobel from outside. Even today we have a lot of outside  want and this is our low self esteem big things that if you have seen anywhere  Look, after the First World War, there was a leader in a country, many people are calling me dictatorship and beyond that, if you want, I will make a video, my take will be different, my take will be different, what about Hitler, the Germans  Was he very bad for the people from whom he got his votes? He was bad for the Nazis and he humiliated them with his shameless actions. Otherwise he only gave a feeling to the Germans which after the World War I, their morale had increased.  I was also not feeling good about his respect, so I heard his speech, I got so angry that I became a fool, now what is the matter, if I have to become your leader, then I cannot become one by insulting you, there is a different politics in Haryana, you will enjoy a different video on that People of Haryana live a little different, people of Haryana even like the one who insults them a little, saying that this leader is good, but generally in India, people of Haryana are a little different, sometimes there is a different video on them, the politics here always goes in the opposite direction, that is why  But still I am addressing a pan India audience That no leader can get your votes by insulting and degrading you, he has to make you feel good and there are no people who deserve to feel good, if he has not done anything great then it is all just a hoax and he is exploited in this way, what kind of a message is this?  I felt like making a video to tell you that can we see through these politicians? Can we? I want to tell you one by one why the people of that time did not praise the old leaders as much as the politicians of today do. Such a great work across party lines. Nobody did this, his son became the CM, someone else's, later on books were written on his father, when he was his father no one even asked about his caste, I am telling you this by taking an example from Haryana, there is so much flattery among the old leaders  He was not as great as he was made out to be, there was a half brother who was at the top, well he was deserving, but many such leaders are being produced, even in the past, who were nothing like this in their time, but there was no way to know  So if you tell me their stories, it feels good at that time.  Neither did they get much respect nor were they honored and these stories are being told, so there is a low self esteem in our country, a child has low self esteem, his father and mother are responsible, if your child has low self  If there is any reason for esteem, then she will be exploited, she will be exploited in the office, she will be exploited in the relationship as well, a girl who has low self-esteem about herself, the boy will turn her around by giving her a little affection, I will see how far I can go as a social observer by linking up things  I am telling you that my job is not to do politics here only, the atmosphere has become such right now, that is why I have to take examples, otherwise this video would have been uploaded on any other channel as well, but you see, in how much depth and how beautifully I am explaining by taking examples,  The girl who is our daughter travels with low self-esteem, so anybody can give her a little affection and lead her on the wrong path or exploit her and any such daughter is  The self esteem is right, no son you are very intelligent, no your personality is good, no you don't see those kind of frivolous boys who lay a trap, these Casson type, you will not get trapped in them, I am such an example and vice versa, I am also irrespective of a boy Low self esteem, any slightly beautiful girl comes to him, gives him a little smile, he is ready to return all the money, is ready to waste all the time, is ready to return the emotions, she will use and misuse him and then she will leave the boy and then he will go into depression  He will keep roaming around and will also lose his job, not me, I am talking about self-esteem, it is very good to have low self-esteem, the influencer who wants to take some advantage, this influencer can be anyone, he can be in a relationship, he can be a politician  He could be a businessman, he could be anyone, he could be anything, so every time it gives you a good feeling, in India people get stuck on the feeling only because they have such low self- esteem  Somebody's wife does not talk nicely, if you meet any other woman outside the house and she talks to you with a little respect then you will do her work by saying yes yes sister, sister, sister, everything is fine, why do you not say those sweet words at home No one gave me respect, same thing is true with ladies, same thing is true with us, now we have to get out of this trap, I am Guruji from Gurugram, my message is, sort out your self-esteem yourself, many people become fools because of your self-esteem  They are creating people around you, they are creating leaders, the world is creating them and then you get nothing and since you still don't reach anywhere in life, so low self- esteem always remains low self-esteem and you are always in this trap. You just keep on changing, the leaders will change, girlfriends will change, boyfriends will change, spouses will change, friends will change, you should see this every time when you feel exploited that someone is using me like this  When I left, look inside yourself and see that brother you  why were you doing this and validate them, become the most favourite of your life, do not chant anyone's praises, you should not do this because what happens is that they trap you, look, listen, by doing this any leader, Bharat Mata ki, now Bharat Mata ki Everyone will say Jai, it is natural, it starts with this only and this belongs to everyone, all the leaders, if you say Bharat Mata ki Jai like this then who will not do it, you should do it, I am not refusing also, okay now we will do this, after that then anyone else  And then slowly whoever is behind them, they say Jai to this person sitting and standing, so that atmosphere is created as if the car starts, first Bharat Mata ki Jai, then Jai to that person, then Jai to this one and then ultimately ours  I have to go and say Jai to myself, how do I say Jai Amit ji, Jai Guruji from Gurugram, so first I will say some good things like this, then you will say you are the rockstar or you Jai Jai, it happens like this, hey Jai to myself  You have to be smart, chant Bharat Mata ki Jai, after that he will say don't do it, now you know that this is a trap, this is a trap Whenever you are given respect for your self-esteem, whenever you are given useless respect which you yourself know that you do not deserve, every person actually knows his status, look, it definitely looks good, it looks very good, if any comment gets bad from me too  It doesn't feel good but if something good comes then it feels good, this is the truth of life but I have to train my mind in bad comments, it does n't break my heart in very bad comments and it does n't fly in the sky in good comments, okay, but it definitely feels good this much  also deny it but this is what you have to do so when someone is giving you too much respect which you know that you don't deserve then see through that bhaiya what does he want, we don't tell him, many times at home mom says it or  Wives or husbands, yes, what do you want, it means that today the elder one is behaving like this, but we get caught up in the emotions at home because we have to go in and out of those relationships, it is okay for us, but the leaders do not understand this  You have historically low self-esteem  They play with it, say yes, it's okay, injustice was done to my father, my grandfather, it's okay, such a thing is not happening to me, I will not think like this, I am not going to take revenge for my great grandfather in anything.  If it is not for you, then everything is going well for me now, who will keep changing everything, if something happened in 1800, 1700, 1600 then it did not change, oh brother, those people, whom people talk about, were out of power at that time also  He was as far away as he is today and you too were as far away at that time and as far away at this time. You should understand my point that you can maintain an identification relationship in the class, you did your work, if you cannot do it then you can do identification.  I am also talking about the fact that if there are people with very low IQ, you cannot do anything with them, so when you focus on that, revision is bound to happen, but if you make these 8 Haj divisions historical, then we  It is easy to deal with class because it will be homogenous  Because the class of people earning more than ₹ 1 lakh up to ₹ 2 lakh are there, there are so many earning from ₹ 50,000 to 1 lakh, there are so many rich and so many poor, all of those things can be seen properly by combining them together and there will be that much  No, you can go from one to the other, you can go from here to there, there is progress, but when you define your identity here, if I identify my identity only with my caste, the dominant caste of Haryana, some people of India  The number one real estate people have become ours, if it is okay with that then it is not he and me, if it is about identity then we are just friends, not brothers, friends, understand only then this casteism will reduce, you will have a friend who is like you, who works like you  He eats food like you, lives in a place like you, has aspirations like you, his struggles are like you, he is your friend, his identity has cut the cake like this, I am asking him to cut it like this, right? No, this is from God. So you will eat the cream one, yes brother the cream one  For the second one, for this the one below, for this I am asking you to do it like this, I hope that sometimes things become too abstract, but in this century someone in our country should talk about it, think philosophers in other countries should make the public aware.  I am giving topics to the people, I am not coming here and saying that I am the be-all and end-all and I am everything and I am the only one, I want you people to think about, discuss, think and how I am changing my channel.  The tagline is Let's change the way India thinks. It's time to change the way we think. The questions are different, thinking is different. Please share and like."

    "title": "Understanding Anchor Bias From A  Political Example [9-taVwBhshg].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today according to one thing of politics, I want to teach you a concept by anchor bias and you will try to understand it. Recently in our elections, we have seen two figures, 370 crossed and 400 crossed this time.  When the bar crossed 400, then why did this figure of 400 come? Why did the figure of 370 come so that people could discuss beyond this? Now the focus has gone here that if you get 370, you will get 400.  They will say that you are not getting it, you are not getting that much, no one will talk about whether 200 72 is coming or not, that is one, it is called putting anchor on it, put the anchor of anything so high, this is psychological warfare, this is done in marketing.  It is done in sales. If you want to buy anything then tell me, yes, for how much? It is worth ₹ 2000000. Now if the anchor is put at 200 then it is 20000.  Now bargaining will start from Rs 200, if you had said Rs 150 then it would have been Rs 150, then this is a big lesson in life and a good thing, so this topper student party is our topper student, all these things go from very good to good. And if you have seen how successfully they do this, then if the figures are not available then they have said on record that brother, we were giving this target to our workers and it was given to the workers.  It is like you are a normal middle class child who says to his child that he should come at 90. He should come at 95. This time, if he crosses 95 then there is nothing wrong in saying this, but this is a big war fair. In a way, a psychological game has been played because this is the first time.  What we saw in politics was one of our provinces, where in the elections of the province where Gurgaon is located, if it is good then it was said that there are 90 seats in that election.  In the discussion of total assembly it was said, this time it is 75 times, that is 75 par, 75 par, 75 par, after hearing it, I felt that yes man, if you are saying 75 par, then brother, 60, 65 have come, it is okay, 40 seats are up to the I and Opposition Party.  The morale was low and they used to say that brother, if we are in trouble then we should force them because definitely the workers of their parties and I talked to them also said that we were nervous but we did so.  If you do it then a lot of people don't even go to vote because sometimes what happens is that you want to vote for the winning candidate, if your candidate is not winning then you say don't go because you don't want to vote for the winning candidate.  You want to put it and the winning candidate is not according to your ideal and your player who is a weak player, you say leave me, who is sad that his brother-in-law has lost just like that?  People of Haryana do it, it's okay, so friend, this one has to lose, then I came to know brother, he wins by 2 votes on 1, the other one is fine and anyway, if you look at the seats, only 40 seats are there, then this is anchor bias, very strong market.  How much will happen, what will happen, it is becoming a very close finish, the election is very dynamic, wherever the election is late, you check a little bit, the position is very tight there, but in this heat, it can happen in a short time.  Some or the other story will come in between. I feel that between the video that is being made right now and the elections, I have a feeling that something should happen now, God forbid something like that happens but.  I feel that some event is needed to cross the line. If you feel so, then you tell me, it is okay because the matter is getting complicated and is a matter of great concern. It is a matter of great concern, especially for the topper students. support the party  Have you done this? You have collected all the corruption in the entire party. You have not left any moral ground. One good thing about this topper student party was the very good thing that when this party was not in power for 10 years, their idol ji In that second party, neither were you killing, nor were you getting killed, nor were they getting killed, nor were they killing, they were silently going about their business, they were opposing, they were saying something, they were acting and they were waiting for their turn and then they were Form the government and they praise the government but now they are ready to take everyone. These people, this thing is wrong and they criticize me and troll me, who are devotees at times. Hey brother, what do your top leaders say?  What will we call the leader? What will be the feminine gender? I will call only one of our top female leaders who is not even contesting the elections because she does not have the money to fight. Her husband, who is a top economist, is speaking openly.  Friend, if you are criticizing then we too can do a little bit. If your sitting members in the CCS Community Committee, the top four ministers of India and their husbands are also coming and speaking openly, then we can also do so, I think so.  It has been said that perhaps Sahiba may not be able to become a minister again, this also means that now what is there to regret, what to do, in case of no one becoming a minister, maybe the government will be formed, but because there is so much condemnation openly, I don't know what this means.  I mean, this is also one thing, I would say that democracy is very good at home, okay, okay, then that husband means, come and condemn that thing, I don't know, and he has not eaten bread, he is not a husband, I don't know how to do it like this.  I do n't know, but it is good to be an intellectual, democracy also looks good, if you look like an athlete, it is good on the fact that man, now how to silence him and no one is talking, his husband's name is Surya. Synonym of Surya, what is the synonym of Surya, like, okay, name starts with P, write them, your GK test will be done, name starts with P, surname and at the end, Kar also comes and in the middle, Ba also comes, Ba and P too.  It comes and its quantity also comes in small quantity. Now I have given the name, tell me what it is and it is the synonym of Surya in Hindi. Okay, so they are also saying that this is very wrong, how did they do the electoral bond like this?  It is not being told that the cover up is not happening, now everyone is being told that she is their own wife, we would have accepted everyone, why are you accepting everyone, friend, you, every man, is acceptable, come to the Dhobi Ghat, it means all your clothes will be washed.  Your sins will be washed away, why are you accepting, your worker is crying, you distributed 116 seats to outsiders who lived your idol, which is an organization, which lives by doing like this, right?  That is the organization which does not have ideology from those organizations which you are accepting nor the ideology from your party. They will come and create chaos. Why are you so short sighted because this is just to win the 2024 elections. Brothers and sisters, are you 29 or 29?  It will be seen later that we will win now, similarly, tita fish is happening now, then 100 more people are fine, they will be seen later, how is this, friend, there must be some advisor for them now.  You tell me in which team I am, I am a commentator, I am feeling sad, I am feeling sad that the batsman is not batting right, the strategy is not right, the bowler is not right, the field placement is not right, the fielding is not right.  You are talking nonsense, why are you losing matches, your team selection is not right, you have not picked good batsmen, you have not picked bowlers, you have picked up worthless students.  You are taking the bowler who bowls wide, you are taking the bowler, you do not have a candidate, the film stars have refused to contest your elections, one of those squirrels wants to become madam, no one is available except that madam. 15-  You approached 20 people here and no one is ready to become big, so what is happening, why are those who till now were asking you about mango pieces or gutli?  You eat like this, you suck, they are not even taking the same seats, they are taking the tickets which you used to see everywhere, were seen getting photographed, looked very close, they are not taking seats anywhere, so what is happening, you are not getting those candidates, big-  You guys are great, in the question paper where 26 out of 26 marks were obtained, people in that state are returning their tickets, friend, yours is a winning ticket, that means people here have heard the rest. In political parties, they take tickets by giving them, which means that here some unmixed tickets are considered to be lottery tickets. Within that state, they are returning the tickets of this party, so what does it mean, who will answer this? We are so confused.  As a voter, I am confused these days, I don't know whom should I vote, what is the matter, what is going on, you tell me brothers and sisters, post in the comment section where should I vote, how should I vote, then we will go to vote.  Don't press button on NOTA at all, NOTA, VOTA is nothing, brother, it has to be one sided, we will have to talk on ideology, we will have to talk on ideology, how do you guys like the channel, subscribers have started increasing a bit now, as I have seen in the last two  -I started speaking in three videos, so now I will speak again. This political channel is very much like a commentator. I have seen the situation with my own eyes. It is not at all one-sided. You will feel that those who are connected from the beginning are those who are part of it sporadically.  Once something came into my ear that I didn't want to hear about it, I would run away. Then he would run away. He is not even my audience but still I have a request from you all that those who are like you are my subscribers.  And the listeners who are listening to me, please increase one subscriber more, our mission is to cross the mark of 50000, this time we will cross 50000 in this election.  If you have to cross the figure of 50000, brothers and sisters, then you can get it done, okay please subscribe, add one subscribe each, how difficult it is to get an ad, then you realize how difficult it is to even ask for votes, it is not so easy, this is a matter of summer. Elections are coming, we will all go and vote, do all that and ask full questions, brother, what are you doing, tell us the syllabus, one man is seen fighting the elections, the rest is his.  Brother, this is what we must have won, we must have crossed this boat, we have nothing of our own, brother, it will be very difficult, it will become very difficult, the matter is very difficult, push hard, okay, because what is that glory sometimes, the leader takes it all.  Then many a times he becomes lonely and he says, Brother, when all the clapping is to be taken and the vote is cast in your name, then you are the one who gets pushed, which means you are the one who is unhappy. In Haryana, if I speak such a language, now the language is bad.  I am not using it anyway  I am telling you that you are the one who pushed hard and the same thing is happening. To me, only one person seems to be pushing hard, but in the rest of the party, still only one person seems to be pushing harder. Here, only one person is seen pushing hard.  It is being seen everywhere that brother, this is the Superman who will make you cross, this is the Iron Man, this is the one who will make you cross, so brother, this way the matter will become tight, the matter will become very tight. My video on ideology is going to come, you all must watch it. Thank you  Very much subscribe the channel, getting very good appreciation, very good comments are coming, likes are also coming, do comment, do write whatever you feel, this is not the time to discuss politics.  We can be saved, we have to discuss, we should know how to discuss, we should know how to discuss positively, which will be good for the country and our good, we should know how to discuss like this, but I don't feel like it, other channels are taking us away.  Holding my ears at one place, this one is not mine, I am doing this, I am claiming this when I myself am not decided as to whom I should vote for, where will I take you, I have not made my decision yet, so I Which way should I take you, should I take you here or should I take you, the rest is all clear cut, it seems that we will also practice our voting. Is it true that this is true because there is a lot of confusion, I am not able to decide on one and I am  Life I am a very intelligent person, Guruji from Gurugram and I feel that when I take a decision, because look, if I have to do it with my eyes closed, it is completely one-sided, I have to do it in prejudice, I have to do it in fear, I have to do it in greed, then the decision is easy.  Yes, but it has to be done with a genuine mind, if it has to be done by being genuine, neutral, open minded and with intelligent higher order thinking, then you cannot take a decision now, this is that stage and I want more.  People to be in this stage rather than be very clear brother, we are here so you are here so no one will come to say Namaste to you, people like us will still come to do so, everybody is sided NYD not yet decided let it be like this, na dhudkan hona Give a little more vows, let the promises come out, we don't know, we can go in any direction and whatever we are, this is 5, 7, 8, voter is also on 10, believe me, our  If we decide the elections, then we have the power, we become on 101, because 10 is a lot, 10 is a lot, on many seats, then the matter becomes about 20 lakhs, where votes are cast, there are 20000 votes.  Is % and many of your seats will be decided below 5000 6000 10000 15000 20000 even 50000 is just 3, if around 20 lakhs are cast, where even 12 lakhs are cast, it is okay at 600 is just, then 101 but if it is undecided then you will get a lot of power, rest of the people are carrying it on their forehead.  That brother, I will not do like this, they have put the meaning on their forehead, they are fine but we will decide and I am increasing our numbers, with this the citizens will take power. Politician to politician will not be able to take us for granted, I am trying so hard, so please subscribe the channel, thank you very much."

    "title": "Understanding And Expressing Criticism In Politics ｜ Higher Order Thinking [2Dswzs-i8aU].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, understanding criticism in politics is a small unique topic in itself, we will discuss it because whenever there are political discussions, it is always there that Congress did it this way, BJP is like this, you are like this, these people did it this way, these people are like this, these people are bad. This is you know that criticism goes on, so whenever there is a discussion about two-three things about this, then this point will be useful for all of you, which I want to tell, like whenever someone tells someone about this, even a tattler says something about it  You can say that when it is said today that today's government is doing this or that, the ruling party is doing this, this is wrong, these people did it or not, then the next sentence of that thing should be that these  If people did it then what happened to them next, this is also a matter of discussion, if at any time if you look at Indian politics, if someone becomes very arrogant then someone rises and he has to suffer the consequences, isn't it so?  that he did not get any punishment or his vote bank did not go away or someone did not get marginalized  If the voting percentage did not go down or the whole thing was not wiped out, then that has to be told in front of that thing also that yes, it was done and one thing cannot always be punished because political party is like your Bombay Stock Exchange, Nifty, Bombay Stock  How many of the companies that were in the exchange 40 years ago are there today? How many are there in the exchange 30 years ago? And if you look at the indexes of Nifty and all the other indices, companies keep coming and going in them, so the index remains the same.  There is a number in the index and it keeps increasing and decreasing but the participating companies in it keep changing, similarly there are political parties, how many people in political parties have changed from here to there, if the same Congress is bad but that is the example of Congress's Haryana People accept that now he is contesting election from BJP ticket, so they cannot ask questions that if he did something wrong then Naveen General ji from Haryana, I will take the example of Haryana because it is understandable that Naveen Jindal ji is contesting election from BJP ticket.  are the congressmen are the ears of the congressmen okay congress is right now  The ticket was given to him after making the change immediately, okay. Secondly, he is a candidate from Sirsa; he has been the Congress State Committee President for many years and is their MP. Thirdly, Dharmveer Singh ji, he too was probably in the Congress before Bhiwani, then this AAP's Rao Inderjit  Yes, what I am telling you is only those who are contesting on BJP ticket, I am telling you by taking their names, they have given election ticket to Ranjeet Chautala ji, he too belonged to some other party, let's go to Congress.  Even if he was not from there, he has been imported from somewhere else, so the one who is supporting him the most, Kuldeep Bishnoi ji, he came from Congress, so do n't go by the name of parties, I mean, parties are only human beings.  There is just one person, now that person was here, he came here, so brother everything became good, so the question is that whatever criticism is there, I will tell you two-three aspects like I have a subscriber, you are Aam Aadmi Party  if you are disliking their policy then I  So I used to vote for these people, then whom should I vote for now? Here criticism is not linked with voting, there are no parties, there is not much choice everywhere, go to any place, you have to vote for one of them, but who said that the  You cannot criticize or listen to the party for which you vote. When will we change this thing brother? What has happened that if you are voting for a party, you cannot criticize it. I give so many examples to many people.  It may seem a bit like that but the fact of life is that any wife will criticize her husband for not doing the work, the vegetables did not come, the children's fees are not paid, the grocery store does not work, does not come on time or she complains to the neighbor's husband that in my house  It doesn't work in me, you will criticize the one with whom you have evolution, with whom you have attachment, with whom you have some link, now how much am I changing, this thing discussion, why should I criticize the one who does n't give me power, whoever comes to power  No, because it would be better if you keep whatever comes tight so that it works properly.  There is one party sitting here and we are criticizing the other, what does it mean brother, it could be that we want to always keep this party in power, disrespect all the problems that we are seeing, but do n't we say anything about that problem, do you talk about it with your  You do n't even tell any child to get up and do this, so what don't you like, do n't you have a relationship with him, do you not fight with your parents, do you not criticize them, then the parents can get criticized  There could be a husband, there could be a wife, there could be children, so has this politician become related to them as well, in our Haryana there is a saying, why do n't you take them, in why don't you take them  To task or in so much criticism because in the coming time, through my channel, whether I call it criticism or call it accountability, this will have to be done, you cannot say that no, as a commentator or as a common man  Some people are feeling something and someone is in power and you say that  If I criticized them, then criticizing someone means if they talk about nationalism, then they criticized Bharat Mata, if someone talks about Ram ji, then they criticized Ram ji, if someone talks about Hinduism, then he says good things about Hindutva  If you criticize them then you are not a good Hindu friend, what is this, however a good thing has happened, now if you criticize us even a little in the country, people do not say go to Pakistan, okay this is a good thing  At least it is okay, otherwise that also went on for a long time, so still very very, I would like to say that now the awareness of the public is increasing, the public should be ready to criticize and should also be ready to listen, are you also a worker of any party  So listen to the feedback that you are the one who is becoming that, we have to be devotees, we have to serve, give us a chance, we will become servants, we will become chief servants, we have to serve you, so you are the one, we are not saying that you should serve You are lying within us that Yes, we have to serve you a lot, so we are just telling you that the service is not being done properly, please serve me a little better and I am not enjoying it, if this does not mean that if you are a servant then behave like this and we will do our requested program  Listen, now many people will feel that now people are starting to get to know about it, now people are getting a little clear about my ideology because as I had told you earlier, it will take time to connect because this kind of content and all this is not happening, everybody is speaking here.  People are saying that this is ego, that is, if we look at Smriti Rani ji, either she is exactly like him or exactly like him, there is no in between, that I can go and ask Smriti Rani ji and take the example of a leader as an example.  I am telling you what you did, tell me exactly, 342000 toilets were built, everything was built everywhere, what did you do specifically, tell me what else did you do and how happy or unhappy the public is, how many people came and went, so the question is that criticism  So we will have to bear the brunt of telling the politician that the public is saying this Bullying will not work, if you ask questions then it is like bullying and scaring you and along with that unfortunately you voted for the person to whom you yourself cast your vote, then you cannot ask any question or should I bring the voting slip, how will I bring the proof, if I come after casting my vote then here such things happen  I will also show you that I have filed the election, now how can I tell you that under whose pressure I have come, you will not believe, and if you believe that under whose pressure I have come, then you will speak, then why are you speaking against him, oh brother, when you can speak against the parents  Yes, parents can speak against the children, mother-in-law can speak against daughter-in-law, daughter-in-law can speak against mother-in-law, the country is free, there is democracy, then why can't they speak, what is the problem in speaking, don't even speak, do n't open your mouth, don't say anything anywhere  He asked what is wrong, more taxes are being levied, facilities are not being provided, do this, do that, look at the politics, if the government and the ruling party already have so much power that they do not need the city's recommendation, then the government is already the king of democracy.  The government also has to  Citizens give away many rights of their free will freedom, even if there is freedom in the country that you can decide everything on our basis, they do not need any further support in that, you have expressed your support by voting for whomever in the election, only then He has been placed in power, now that he is in power, it is your job to question him from day one, why is he taking this in the cabinet, no, why is he not taking this, no, why is this not there, why has he taken this or this is what has to be done. And we can do this, we can put these positive ones on tenter hooks, they all should dance and move around like this, change this CM, you don't like it, I am telling you, if you do n't like the CM of Rajasthan, the people of Rajasthan are not enjoying it for some reason  If you are coming then tell brother that you should change that party, brother, you do n't have anyone else, why can't you say that, just because you have cast your vote, if you have voted for someone then it means you will give love, affection and respect to all his leaders, you have cast your vote, idea  The game of parties goes on according to their ideology, leaders come and go, so one  Did you understand the story on Idol Ji, did you like it? It's very good. But after that, the leader in whose name the story was given goes to another party. You will then follow him again and again. Many people do not go, many leaders move from here to there.  There are so many ex chief ministers of Maharashtra or any other place who changed the party, one party made them chief minister, their original party made them chief minister, what party can make them higher than that, only the prime minister can become, above the chief minister is the prime minister  So he was made the chief minister but still he was changed. So now what will you do with such people? Tell me what is their idol, who is going into what and how is he going. So as a democracy, we should be ready for this phenomenon in the public space.  One must be ready for criticism, one must be ready to answer questions and our leaders cannot run away by joking. My last video was also made once of Nirmala Cheetha ji in which she said, I am the, we are the sleeping partner government, we will not do like this.  Answer: Ha ha ha and you went away. No sir, madam, answer.  So you will have to answer, you will have to answer and what is this, I have seen a video of some politician, they were playing a year old video of Smriti Rani ji on some other channel, a journalist asked something, he was doing something with Dainik Bhaskar, so he said I  I will call your boss and tell him, and she is intimidating you by taking the boss's name, and I saw that video for the first time last year, I could not see it last year, now there is Ajit Anj or someone 's channel, their YouTube channel is very good, that's fine.  So I saw that on their channel and I was so shocked and that poor boy even lost his job, these politicians should boycott them, journalists should not even talk to them, ask them questions as if I am asking them, they don't care.  Just stop giving it, they will roam around helplessly, their own generals who ask them such questions directly, and didi, how is everything good, what do you eat, what do you drink, what is your energy, boycott them all, friends.  Stop watching the content is over and  Do n't go to the good journalists, you should not go, they will call you by saying namaste and say that they will get credibility, you are watching the interviews, what kind of podcasts are being given, I had told you about the whole election long ago, those who had joined after going for the last few months  I am not very happy, the times are fine, the youtubers and their think tanks also read the comments because if I come here and raise a topic in a content, then brother, it is possible that I have some agenda, they can say this, although my  There is no agenda but it is my claim that I do not have any agenda for or against a particular party but when you fill the comment section with your opinions then you are real people and when that message reaches these people then it will be  Whatever you feel like writing in one line, do write it down and it is monitored, I am telling you this and there are very few serious channels like this, I am also telling you that you are connected to this platform, you can go somewhere  You will not see any change anywhere, there is some big thing like you say, it is not moving, is it a stone or something, who is that?  We had seen the movie, Nawazuddin Siddiqui's role was in Maji Hai Kaun, he cut the stone by hitting it, so it is not that big a mountain, nowadays the matter gets settled quickly, so whatever you do, whoever you are  If you are connecting with a place, always write one word about that place like I am so and so from so and so place, that will make a big difference, yes I know it will take effort but I am also putting in effort, my channel is very popular and the place is also good  The business goes on but I am also putting in my efforts so you should also put in your efforts friend just right from where you join it will make a big difference that when you join with a real name and place then you are not a butt it is not that I have bought someone, that is you, you are a genuine person, the comment section of all my videos and channel is being read, this is my direct feedback from a top place, hence I have received this feedback recently, only from my last few videos Before I was telling you this, I too was feeling the same way, how do I know, but is it making a difference?  It is written in positivity, this is a request, do not abuse any leader about anything, it is very wrong, then the thing gets misinterpreted, if you write the name of any leader and write a dirty word in front of it, then it means the channel's credibility will be mine You are insulting me and the channel, I do not say anything abusive against anyone here, I do not create any excitement against anyone to provoke people and make them angry, I do not do that, I want to change practical things practically, which people seem to  It doesn't change, it doesn't change brother, everything happens, everything gets called out, everything changes, genuine feedback is not available in the market, even the leaders are worried that big people are giving them such fake ones, yes everything is fine, everything is fine, they have a lot of misunderstandings.  It happens, no one has the courage to get genuine feedback, so there are some agencies which check it like this and give genuine feedback, the Chief Minister changes due to their feedback, I am telling you, the sitting Chief Minister changes due to the feedback. that this is not coming by just saying it  There would be a documentation section of it, so first of all you should join my channel from inside in any way, and my request is one or two, not more than one or two subscribers, please add it, it's a journey, it's like asking for votes, that the journey is an influence If you stay connected after reaching the point, you will start seeing the difference, you will become a part of that, brother, neither did you go in the sun, nor did you get pushed, nor did you do much of that, nor did you make any noise, you kept on saying good things, kept on saying, kept on doing, kept on doing  Keep doing it and slowly slowly slowly slowly slowly things started becoming clear and these parties are going to come to power, here it is not a question of influencing votes, so one of my subscribers told me that friend this is a common  When he spoke about Aam Aadmi Party, I said that vote for whoever you want to vote for, you can condemn it. If someone condemns your party, it does not mean that you should not vote for that party. You like other things of the party and you like them but if you condemn them then  Whatever you have discussed, get clarity on that topic with your workers or leaders. Take it, brother, why are you doing it like this, why can't you do it like this, why can't we go to this level, why can't we do it like this, there is nothing in asking questions, criticizing and voting are two different things, just because I did not support anyone Criticizing him does not at all mean that I will not vote for him. In fact, I am saying that whoever you vote for, criticize him the most, ask him the most questions and call out every wrong thing he does. This is a vibrant democracy.  There is a basic need and we will have to change this thought process in this thing, so hope you guys liked it, please share, like, thank you very much"

    "content": "Hello friends, today we will discuss about color for free and be a little pragmatic. This channel is doing very well. You are getting a very good response. If you are looking forward like this then please subscribe. Before I talk on this subject, an initial thing.  I would like to tell all my subscribers that gradually the essence of this channel will see what you have to tell the world, not the world but the politicians or the government or the officials.  Don't cry, here what changes do we have to make in our mother and how to take peace and how to see what is happening that is being shown is real and make some changes within ourselves with those changes and the whole time you have to be external. You will see the world changing. You will see the change if you change from within. [Music] By doing this, let's discuss the previous ones for free. Whatever this matter has come to, the middle class is an irritated caste. Is it okay, friend?  What is right, it comes from a lot of people that it is being done to them, so it is okay to feel that it is being done to them, it is fine, but many people say that if you keep telling Arabic, then Sri Lanka will become that. I heard that Sri Lanka's  If we look at the situation then first of all I am going to tell you that Sri Lanka cannot become a country, it can be happy no matter how much it is distributed because the Indian Mill Class will continue to grind, the committee will continue to pay taxes, it will not be played. Brother, Sri Lanka has a population of 2.25 crores. How many blacksmith class are there, how many are middle class, how many are rich, distribute them yourself, whatever was done to all the classes, then their condition became like this, if they were given to the middle class also, then this mess will never happen in India, the Government of India will never. If India is not going to give anything to the middle class then only Sri Lanka will not become Sri Lanka, please do the research in Sri Lanka, please do the research, it was not just for the poor, whatever theirs was, it was like that because they did less, whatever the politicians did to become more popular and themselves.  Coming late, he said, Son, we give it to everyone, a little bit is good for us, so sometimes we discuss it for free and tell some truth about it, there is a saying in Haryana, if all the Jains go to the middle of the marriage, then this is free B's.  Today I will tell you one thing, whose loan of Rs. 30,000 crore has been waived, this happened in the elections of a big state 5 years or 6 years ago, that state also search you on Google, here is a teacher who is not giving data to me but supporting himself.  We do  Guruji, please tell me, it is okay, the state is the biggest state, the figure also told is 30000 crores, this is not the election but the previous election, I had forgiven this election which was held in the state after demonetization, it is okay, I am sorry, absolutely clear announcement, okay, no mistake.  No, but everyone has a reason to forgive, if you are forgiven then do it again, you will get it, you will get it again, this is gold and on this, does anyone want to get their loved one forgiven?  People forgave the announcement. Was it right, but did the banks actually forgive Rs 30,000 crore? Have you taken your loan from me? It is okay with me from the bank and you are getting a waiver of Rs 80,000. Will you ever take a loan again for yourself and your family?  If I am not going to get it, then no person will get credit for my whole life. ₹ 80000 is a little less, if not more, then a little less, this electricity will be forgiven. What they do is that they roam around with their shirts out, which is fine these days.  Laughing has reduced, it's okay, all this happened earlier too, even the special people will forgive the electricity, they will forgive the water, now what happened later, from so many to so many electricity, oh brother, some man will run two lights and a fan for 100 hours after someone.  If a person is billed more than the unit, he will be billed more than that, then there is no more than this, there is no more than this, all these are to listen, to appease, to give a little something so that there are not too many miss matches in the country, they feel proud.  Yes, middle class is getting something from this.  There is no need to tease people, otherwise there will be too much class difference here, there will be an uproar, they will always be given the feeling of caste, you have to see whether you have done something in Haryana, under whom will you give reservation here, this was said in the companies in Gurgaon real estate. Everyone will run away, companies will leave, it is mandatory, then they fired him, less than 30000 jobs, how many jobs are less than 30000 in Gurgaon, those who were getting reservation were also not happy. People are also not happy, there was no happiness from him and he is a title fish, now he will keep coming out like this, we do not want to be affected, he will give it for free, he will give it like this, gave it like that, gave it to him, gave it to him, gave it like that, if that's all.  If you have DK, then only this much DK is there, no money, it seems like an announcement has been made, you are also the father in the house, I have been staying at everyone's house, you will get it, you will get phones, you will get it, you will get it on your birthday, you will get it on your birthday.  Then what do you say after picking it up, that nice Barbie doll has come, one is soft, biodegradable, this is organic plain food, the child should take it in the mouth, it is okay, the one of ₹ 5000 is okay, such big toy stores are expensive, the expensive ones meet their mother.  It is not necessary to do this and what happens many times is that in Tamil Nadu, political parties run their own channels. Now if they only pay for it, they have given TV to everyone. Very progressive state, the collection under GST is very high.  There is a lot of industrialism and the capital is also very decent, despite the D series and this is also free, some Punjab like I do something, it is ruined there, there is nothing worth giving, so brother in law, economics playing road, other vices, also many times TV  Seeing that you guys are giving a big rally every day, I was thinking of taking my Keval connection when will I get money from it, but man, this man got a free TV connection, he installed his Horizon 90 inside it.  There was a flood in 19, while the rest of the public was watching Doordarshan, something else happened to them in life, which probably was not even intended, sometimes they get a lot of benefits, sometimes these political parties give laptops to children.  So, among some children, I have seen the whole laptop thing, some do not do it, some interfere, this happens a lot, why is it worth the money, still some laptop goes into the hands of someone who becomes the value of the child.  Microsoft goes away, someone goes abroad  If they are also removed, then it is not that the inn is a loss. If your mother had made 1 lakh laptop, then she would have got ₹ 1 lakh laptop. Thousand 1500 2000 children would have been taken out. This is also a fact, that is also 2% in the country's GDP. Money from outside in the country itself gets spoiled and becomes criminal, anything can happen, now no one does research on it, but this is not a very bad thing. A family in which the child could never buy a laptop because it was digital internet.  The connections have become a lot of fun, once we get a laptop, we feel something or the other after looking at it, we can't even cry for every free thing, and in other things, I am making a video that Khan Sarkar is wasting his money.  You act like you go beyond money, where even a story is of no use, you can rock on those things too. Every time you come, you have to say that you should also band MP Ma's pension. Whatever is happening, you are singing cheers like this. Oh, you reduce your pension and you also reduce your pension.  Don't worry, tweet everywhere, just message on WhatsApp, catch one message, don't worry, whichever political party makes it an issue, we will vote for it, we will make saree, if we make saree, then it has to be implemented, why doesn't it say, it is written in the middle. If any class party starts rising then the rest will also be helpless. You tell me whether the red light has gone or not. Now the red light was symbolic but it would have made a bigger difference than that. The intermediary used to sit with a minister.  They are roaming around with the help of officers, it seemed that they were roaming red and the rest of the people's chillies appeared to be red and by the way, it looked like it was forced, so the Prime Minister did less, it was symbolic but it was very good, now next inline, this, this This issue of pension should not be made in 2024, it should not be made, the poor cannot be rocked, it is a vote bank, you can cry, it is going to your own brother, we reserve it, we do not benefit from it, it is a very complex question and  A premise is not the answer, in this way then no one will reduce it. Hey brother, impose tax, we will do some of them, it is not like that, not all laptops will be sold, not all will watch porn on laptops, some will also learn coding on laptop, some will also do something else with laptop.  That percentage and if it is take it 5%, if even 5% of this worth-d-effort laptop can be given to him, then don't blame him at this time.  It is a thing on which you cannot do anything. All you have to cry for are your tears. I am speaking to the middle class, your tears are your energy. You attack them on anything that can fall because for the poor, I have done it first. Just make promises, you speak from here, bring out a lot of things, you do this band of yours, brother, you have given Agni Veer a rock. [Praise] With that, he clears Agni Veer's pension that Agni Veer's defense budget was very limited, Agni.  By doing Veer, you have further reduced it and are modulating the money of the pension pack back, so you have given equality to it, so do it in such a way that the pension band will be for the government, MP and all of them, from now onwards it is okay to have this band.  So much money will be saved and if we put this money here for this cost then it will be a clear linkup that this much child and this much is going because it goes inside the relief mattress so it is going for these efforts, meaning some 25  Year  If he becomes a mother even for 6 months, he will not reach the age of 95, till then he has a pension, tell me, once it is opened, his bus is taken out, one is this, the other is you, you think this, the same DOESN'T be middle class if only this much kid.  I have pension of politicians, you also try to become a politician, become MLC, contest the elections, this is what I want, out of the list of my audience, 5% should come to the election field, see how it happens.  Make your channel, do Mussoorie, take the votes of the locality, take it forward, take it back, do everything and make your agenda, make this the agenda of the people, why wo n't you get votes, if I am you, tell me one thing that I am raising this agenda and you  If you like it, then mother, I will contest the election with the story and I will make the people there ok, you tell me Richard, if I do it then will I not get votes? I am not sure, I will win the election from there. Will I not get votes? Will I not get even a single vote? If I am talking less, I am talking good. Will I get votes? Now I am independent, I do not belong to any party. When the country got independence, there were times of independence when the country got independence. In the earlier cabinet, Shyam Prasad Mukherjee, who was from the opposition, was also a minister. People did not even think that India can run collectively. As soon as people thought, this is his ideology, his party will come to power.  Many people can also meet me in another agenda that I want to be fulfilled. If you want, I have the blessings of you all. Do we have 25 MPs out of 545 MPs in the country? Can we tighten only 25 NPS in such a way that it is independence to speak? Not for granted, there is actual independence and they come after being selected from big lions, where there is middle class, they should be educated, they should be businessmen, they should be of office, of course, they should be a social figure, are they not of such mood? Someone will come but their thinking will be independence, they can become ministers in the government if they want to form the government, but when they open their mouths in the Parliament, they will open their mouths directly for the countrymen or for the middle class and they will not have any brother on the party line, party, whip party.  That is, there are many politicians who used to sound very good to us and we have to read such words, nowadays Party with its name itself has the opposite meaning of scolding, isn't it? If my English color is not good, it means something else, then it is that.  If he said something other than the party line, he would be dismissed, brother, as many people call us independence, now those who are from states like Haryana or small states where independence is achieved, it is okay, then the experience there is very bad in many places because it is only When the government's numbers are less, then they have to buy money. Okay, this is a truth about completing the numbers. Do you know the truth about Indian politics? So, they become ministers and then whatever reward they get is internal.  You think that because of the buyer, independence is not respected much, I also agree, but if after becoming independence, someone has to play long innings and always has to open his mouth and stand up for his constituency, then 1 MP belongs to some party.  Yes, he is an MP, if he wants to do anything, he can do it for him every day, if he stands in front of the Railway Minister, if there is a stop at my place, then it will be built, and if he stands at my place like this,  HRD should be opened, if the college should be opened then the lab should be opened in front of the minister. If the hospital should be fine, then it will be there. MP does not have that passion. What is the reason behind this, why is oil not available to anyone else? We are more towards Independence NPS.  You have to go now because you are an MP of a party, whether you get the ticket or not, why will you push so hard, you will automatically hit all that, you can push so hard only if you are a low-income boy.  If you are an MP and your father is less or a powerful minister, then you can sanction people, you know what are the constituencies, I too have one but this is a city, the story happened there too, so it is okay, that story is different now in Tamil Nadu. If someone has less father or in Haryana someone has less father or the story is made up or someone becomes someone's aunt or uncle or someone's nephew, it means that such relationships are fine.  If there is, then he will do it, but it is very less because nowadays even in nepotism, only one person in a family will go to this, this will go to this and it will be more messed up. Earlier, what used to happen in nepotism, at least what used to happen in five- six districts.  Only one state will shine, this is a different kind of thing, you talk nonsense, I also talk practical, in this matter, if there is less in Rajasthan and his son, if there is anything in the story, then it will also affect his sir too, so he is there.  If extra money is less then sometimes it  If the area gets developed, the government of this area comes, then this one happens, then in 10, 20, 30 years, if someone brings out a model district, some great, some less, then it drags the people around it too, that is fine.  This topic will remain separate in the future, I am going to tell you this simple thing in the free also that it is not as bad as you think, it is such a big country, it is not easy to carry it along, this is also free.  Will work  Accept it, it is good, it is big, the answer is not so easy, you should not think that all the resources will go to the middle class, you have to see if anything is going to the poor even through free resources and if they are getting some benefit from it. How can I make indirect profit? If the story is being run, then which pipe is it going on and which listed company is it? If not, which one is going these days? Story is the car, story is the laptop, story is the mobile.  It will be digital, there will be digital regulation, the solution will be for finance, what is happening with all these things, then the middle class has to do second third fourth sixth order thinking and also look for such investments that if one system below is improved then I will also benefit from that. In Karnataka, if women are allowed to travel in buses for free, then it is not necessary to run that much. If there is a woman standing in the bus and going for free, then what is the problem? The bus was going anyway, there were only six women traveling there. So her family members said, 'Hey, it costs so much for you to travel, if that expense is reduced then maybe she can go out more, can go here and there, can go here and there anytime, so it is not so because the Karnataka Government has given permission to women.  If the buses are made free then the Karnataka Government will have to buy ₹ 10000 extra buses. No, it is not that the rate of diesel has gone up, it is not that they have hired more drivers, they are taking buses from the same buses that were running. Now she is walking further, standing and walking, from her second third fourth, you will get to see the order benefits. Have you understood the messaging? Please share.

    "title": "Unified Pension Scheme ｜  05 Aspects Which Need Attention Of All [SFsVD-TXB1E].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, we will discuss about UPS, earlier there was NPS, before that I will bring it in OPSS, people with higher order thinking, beyond that, it has not been discussed till now, only its detailing has been discussed till now, I always have that video after a day or two.  Make and explain its beyond that which has not been discussed, then quickly quickly first let's discuss what is UPS and beyond that, brother, something like a new phrase has come up which is politically motivated and the government is under compulsion.  The government has to be brought in and the government is looking weak due to this, turn another U. Turn by this government, due to which N has been removed from NPS and U has been added. They are saying that why not name it as OPSO PS only and OPSPL has to be paid at Rs. 10 per cent.  They did not give anything in the old pension scheme, the real government son-in-law was the same, so those who wanted OPSO PS will be happy, no, in UPS you have to pay Rs 10, but the government will give it at Rs 185, which earlier used to give at Rs 14. That has been increased, now you will get an assured pension at 50, it will remain off your last drawn, you will have to work for 25 years to get it fully, if you do 20 then what will be the proposal, 20/25 and you will get it at 80, if you do 15 years then 15 25  That is, it will be available at 60 but will it remain cute, there is no discussion beyond that which was there earlier, the discussion is about the index that it has been adjusted for inflation.  But just like there was OPSM, pension will not be available like this, what will be better than NPS, it is not necessary that it is better but the fact that it has given you assurance, minimum guarantee program has been given, it is an advantageous thing that NPS was lex, it is a great complication.  Whether it is to be or not, they are also checking just now, 23 lakh employees in the Central Government or Co are benefited. If all the State Governments employ them, then there are 90 lakh more employees, so the total.  Around Rs 1 crore 13 lakh are affected. There will be a lot of cost on this issue, so now let's start with those five points which are higher order thinking about what happened after doing this, what is the end result, who will benefit from this, will they benefit or not?  He will tell in the end what will happen in the elections of Maharashtra and Haryana, is there any benefit from this, people are happy and angry, so the first thing that has come out after doing this, brothers and sisters, this government is weak.  It is visible, it is not visible. After this, now everyone has those things which they will sharpen to attack, that they will surround this government and this is the oppression, they are afraid, now all the organizations are saying that we need OPAC, we need OPSG.  And good work was going on with NPS and fingers should have been kept on lips and the country was doing well. The government had changed during the time of Atal ji. This was the BJP government in 2004.  From 2014 to 2014, there was Congress government, it did not miss a beat, it was going well silently, but brother, so much jargon, has something happened in the last 10 years or else these people also raised issues, they are stuck, now they are looking weak in the matter of UPS.  The second thing is that the government would like to turn around and ask the biggest issue, brothers and sisters, the story was amazing, the pension bill on Agniveer was to be saved, now which government employee of the country is a chump, I am trying to act like Amit Shah ji.  The employee will take pension but pension will not be given to Agniveer, who faced bullets standing at the border, whose job is to give papers, give files, give tea, make some adjustments to the chair, do dusting, his pension is assured, wow wow Modi ji wow, what a master stroke, what a master stroke. You see, the fear of YouTube is also disappearing, I am surprised, I mean, earlier three-six months ago, they did not make such things, they did not even say, what is happening, I am surprised, I am so worried about BJP.  Why are they becoming so weak? What is this? No pension to Agniveer, nothing to Agniveer. Raised it in Parliament and here you are giving it. What is this? And all the state governments will give it. Oh Karnataka, Kerala, your Tamil Nadu is from the border.  It has nothing to do with it. Yes, the little water bearer there will take the pension. My soldier Agniveer standing in Jammu and Kashmir has nothing to do with it. I am telling him about geography. If he gets it then everyone will feel a little ashamed of himself.  They are getting trapped, they are getting trapped in the trap of opposition, they are getting trapped one after the other, there is no clapping. Now do the third thing and tell us what will increase the attractiveness of government jobs. Practically, no one has become very great. I am straight.  I am saying with face that government job should not go even after this, I will make videos for a particular audience in future, the secret of government job is black secret, that is left, the video will come because it was not made because dynamic. What is the situation? They should have made it first and then this would have come. Now this has come, if it is still made then wait a bit, nothing is happening so soon, it is okay, then the clamor will increase, caste census will be going, what do people say, sugarcane, sugarcane, caste sugarcane, sugarcane, not sugarcane.  Sugarcane census is fine, caste cast census will be made, clamor will come, now we will have to accept that whatever Rahul Gandhi wants, he gets it done, this is the wheel of time, what is astrology, brother, I am surprised.  Yes, if you are surprised, then tell me, the devotees are also shaken, now I will tell further about the devotees also, it is very interesting, there are two more points, okay, this is what reservation is all about, because it is given here, now there will be more noise, politics of government job.  The same thing is happening, the opposition is setting the agenda, they are coming weak on everything, it is okay, otherwise there was no need for them to do anything, what else could they have created a narrative, what could they have done, I will tell you because ultimately.  Brother, the government employees, whose salary is Rs. 23 lakhs from the Central Government and Rs. 90 lakhs from the State Government, they do not even go and apply this, otherwise they are on duty, well, I will not tell anyone, no one knows anything even from the ballot paper, it is okay but to do this much.  There is no need but still we will talk further about the fourth point of accountability. Now the government becomes accountable to that corporate employee who is grinding from morning to evening and now he has to pay tax and  Will have to pay double the tax. Where will the expenditure of Rs. 6250 crores come from for the finance? Where will this come from? The government is also paying arrears. First of all, the public's anger towards those who are in government jobs is increasing.  And accountability can be sought, because now you are earning this pension also, there is no such benefit on paper, but you see this, if a government employee earns 10% of his basic pay.  Put it in direct mutual fund and brothers and sisters, if you pay 15% and grow it in 15 years, then 15000 rupees becomes crore. If you invest 15000 rupees for 15 years, the average return at 15% then it becomes 1 crore. This is how Warak ji teaches by doing this. I also remember all the figures, so I am telling you this, so brother, he should do his OPSG, now the government is 18.30.  But now it has been increased from 14 par, so what happened to the one who had joined in 2005 till date, will he be given areas as per 185 par or will he join from now on at 18.5, we have kept so many catches. Like experts who take time and understand, there are conflating reports, newspaper people also do not apply any mind, children have read and told something, even the users do not do anything, there are some stories and this Those who are breaking news are just pointers, they tell you a simple question, is it common, what is the restoration, will DA be given, what is the meaning of indexation on pension, earlier restoration used to be a factor of cuteness, it seemed like there is some such system or  There is no provision, it is just a phrase, then what is it, there is nothing, there is no big money, earlier for 10 months, graduation was given up to 20 lakhs, now the government has made it six by teaching the old things in English and explaining them. Not like I am telling you, it's a pan cake with a lot of potato pat inet and shallow fried with touch of mint and some this thing, say something in English like this, do n't say this, you are eating it like potato parotta, you are fine.  Many people can explain potato paratha in English like this, brother, what a good thing is Aloo paratha, but by English it like this, eat it like this, I also do foodie copywriting, many times they give big names to them.  Write in good English in hotels and give it to the people so that it seems to them that I do this work too, so this government is also doing the same thing, by putting the same thing in a phrase again and again, the focus is on if he dies, if he dies, if he dies, then  If you die, you will give it at 60. If you die, you will give it at 60. Why not give it in full? What was the family pension earlier? If someone dies while doing a job, what will you give? Why is this small thing that earlier used to give Rs. 00 to someone, now give Rs. 50.  are  Yes brother, you are adding that too, you think this is amazing, that's why I am going to tell you, the same thing is going to come on the fifth point. First of all, in today's country, I am laughing but it is black humor because I also fall in this category. Because I belong to that community which does not have reservation. The people of my community in Haryana do not have reservation. There are other places in Rajasthan but we do not have it here. Our people were special when they were getting it.  I had cast my vote so many years before I came, it is okay, during the time of Devi Lal ji, when Mandal was there, he was the Deputy Prime Minister, that's why Mandal had come to Mundal, then I did not get him to cast my vote, so it is not even for his own community, you can say like this, what came?  I am trying to say that I do not have reservation, many of you do not have it, so in India, if a person is in general category and does not have pension, he is in general category and he is normal.  You have to do a job, you have to do business, brother, he has a lot of load, he has to support many people, he has to give 80 crore grains to the poor people in the country, now he has to give pension also, Madam Nirmala ji will increase the rent again, this time Bhuvan will be given three rupees.  Guna La Gyan will have to be imparted, now this Bhuvan who has become the brother of all, is it okay, what to do, now I have not got a government job, I have prepared for the competition, now I am doing normal, I am not your only child, I was worthless.  If you did not get a job, now you will have to work for it. To get pension, you will get a pension at 25. After getting a job at 22, 2, 24, you will have to work after retiring at 48, 49. So you have to realize that this is a backward step. Pension should be full in Armed Forces and CRPF and BSF and in belt jobs where there is risk to life, pension should be 100% for those people and where  Life is not going on, normal water has to be given, tea has to be done, file has to be picked up, life is not going on now, in these villages where life is not being lost, PS was fine, now you have made the bank unions open their mouths, PSU banks, PSUs and I don't know who -  Who will be there now because they will say that this is the vote bank, now coming to the last point, the BJP government does not see any political benefit from this because there is still resentment in it, those who have got it are still happy. No, it is said that the OPL caste and the bigger class it is, the employee strength is 90 lakhs, if you add 233 lakhs of Central Government people, then even 145-150 crores of the country, these people did not even make it to 1st, their families also got it.  Even if it is made at one and a half two, brothers and sisters, how many people will get angry in the matter of one and a half and two layers, today I want to ask if you were a devotee.  If BJP is okay, then how are you feeling? How are you feeling now because what are you getting these things, that religion has become a religion and has been going on for a long time, it has even become a Ram temple. You had good ideology too but your  You see what is happening together, tell me in the comment section, is this a U-turn, taking U-turns again and again, which was very good on YouTube, Godi media has no brain now, but YouTubers used to insist and say, now how will you defend everything, then U-turn.  It is doing what Rahul Gandhi ji wants. Everything seems to be going in that direction. Is the old pension system a bad thing for the country? Can't BJP say this? Ca n't it take that one? Why is BJP afraid? Why don't they come and speak?  There is no need of UPS also, there is no need of NPS and for the sake of the country, explain to such and other people because you BJP has become that party which makes one of its 100 true and false and fill in the blanks also to do wrong.  not ready  If one or two percent of the votes are lost, then five questions will be left out. This is happening that your supporters are getting angry with you, they will also go, right? I am telling BJP that those who used to consider you good, now your performance seems bad.  They see that this is a crying child, you gave him toffee, what did you give to him, what did you give us, today BJP workers are the most cheated, right now elections are being held in Haryana, elections are being held in Jammu and Kashmir and BJP is in Jammu.  Of  The workers are crying, those who have come from outside, Congress's Jumma Chumma, it has not been 15 days, they are getting tickets, the BJP people are just keeping on laying the carpet, the heart of the BJP worker is beating, he is sitting to lay the carpet, poor fellow.  He will put a chair on the table and a carpet without any hesitation, rest all the tickets are Congressmen  It seems that in the vote bank politics, the new people whom you have tried to make happy may not be happy and in this matter many people have got angry and many unions have got angry and it seems that there is some political benefit being made from it.  Mileage is not visible anymore and there is no OPSG, Bhagwant Maan ji's government and I want to ask Bhagwant ji, Punjab has OPSS, have people taken it, there is a lot of difference between speaking and doing because many things may happen, see, the leaders are  Money turns into anything, the state government will print a little mint of Nashik, they have it and the central government also knows the resources and what is the fiscal deficit. Fiscal deficit of the country is increasing and this is just an initial figure. Beyond this there will be inflation.  What difference will it make? And the higher order thinking is that when you do such things, the value of money falls and so does the economy.  There is no very positive effect, the fiscal deficit is increasing, politically it is not very great and the common man is not getting any benefit from this, now it is better than this when you are doing it like this then it is better than this then it is Rahul Gandhi friend ladies  Look at the poor woman, give me the money, then all of them are busy in giving this. Who earned this money, tell me who is busy in looting it. Sir, does she loot by asking, have we announced to us? We gave it. Hey, did you bring it after earning? We do n't earn. You collect. What does the government earn? The government collects. People work and pay taxes. The government collects taxes. The government earns. Now the government has to pay taxes from you.  The officers hired to collect will also take more tax from you for their pension so that they can collect better tax from you. Have you understood what they told you about tax from you?  Those who collect should get pension in future, its fund will also be given to you by taxing more so that it can collect more tax, it is a wonderful thing, it is a wonderful thing, how is it feeling, how is it feeling, BJP's vote bank was growing at 36. You tell whether it is visible or decreasing. Inflation is not under control. School fees are not under control. Real estate is not under control. Potholes are not under control. Water is full. Okay and bridges are falling.  Statues are falling, anything that is standing is falling, anything that is walking is derailing, I am surprised, if you guys are surprised then tell me how you felt, tell me the video, you have to be sarcasm and show that you have to make 10 people happy.  If you are going, then 100 people are going to be angry with you, this has to be told so that these activities do not happen again, otherwise, what a weak government is a good thing, Manmohan Singh ji's government was not weak.  With 145 MP, he is showing too much weakness with 240. No brother, he is weak. With 272, majority is formed. If he is sitting with 240, then according to me he should not be weak, but Manmohan Singh is not looking as strong as he should be, so he is 206.  In 'Singh is King' he became the second time when Manmohan Singh ji came after winning the 2009 elections and in 2006 he was his MP and before that he was  145 In the first tenor, when it increased from 145 to 206, that song Sing is King was available. There was only one Sing is King song left. Later, whenever they were shown, it included Sing is King by news channels. So brother, in 206, Sing is King.  Had become 240, these are the ones, I am surprised. Yes, Maths and the country are better than that. We have to be happy, we have to keep smiling, we have to work, we have to learn. More money has to be earned and more money has to be earned so that more tax can be paid so that more pension can be given from it. Pension OPSN is being discussed everywhere in the future. It is being talked about that it is okay for the ladies to give that to everyone.  Everything is ready, then reservation will be done after cast census, maybe it will be done at 75, all these people can go in that general category even at 25, so now you know that it is becoming clear now, friend.  Do it clearly, do all the reservations, do all the reservations, then what is there to save and also look at the taxes, if you have to give them pension, then it's just fun. I am asking, if you are a government employee, are you happy?  Raj, do you want to be told, okay, government employee, are you happy? Look, the government has made a scheme for you. He would know in more detail what is happening with me. The government will deduct 10 rupees and 185 rupees.  Will give then I am getting gratuity, I will get this much money, I will get it at 50, then what will I get next? If he will put 1.5% of 183 then he will put it in a separate fund somewhere, he will put it at 10 in the market, in the market at 10, in the market, at 185, the government is giving it.  Will buy in the market at Rs 10 and will put 85% in a separate fund which is giving guarantee at Rs 50, then it would be better if he puts the entire government in it at Rs 185.  Returns can come, this is a thing to be calculated on excel, how much is the jumla, how much is the benefit and what else is it still clear to the employees that Bhai Swaad to OPSO PS who after looking at the demography and life expectancy of Indians, is taking the country towards banker's money. If that thing is further exploited, then this political party, which is also in opposition, is not a ghat, it comes up with more ruinous schemes and the regret is that  The government which is BJP, which knows everything about the entire government, what is its account, it is bowing down for such popular measures and is bending on popular measures and the Agniveer who works for the security of the country and the country 's money is on him.  Then brother, you are saving money, so you like saving money there, you don't like it here, so answer this now, where will it come from? No, it will be funded, funded by home, where is the government bringing this 185 from?  But he is giving 185 rupees, the government is giving 14 rupees, now it will contribute 45 rupees, then why ca n't you give it to Agniveer? The question is, why did you do the affair of Agniveer, why not in it and the rest.  There will be many questions in this place too, so questions will keep arising, you must share the video, thank you very much, please like the channel, subscribe and put it in like minded individuals. And do a little higher order thinking, rise above these fifty-eighth ho, this is just a phrase I have heard, after this it will also impose tax on everyone, those in the 30s and 40s will also be included in it, whoever gets the retirement benefits may also be empty handed.  Empty it and say, Guruji, keep quiet, don't give them ideas, they don't wait for my ideas, those who give them ideas have servants sitting near them, they will give with one hand with the other hand.  Will take it out and you will say tell me clapping now people have doubted or not friend this is not a happy thing once again mercy there is something black in it which one is ok there is something wrong in it tell me again how to explain what was found what was lost  You will give with one hand, you will take with the other hand, they will say, please clap, okay, now that clapping is not going to happen, there is no political benefit, you have made your core voter devotees feel shaken by your action, then that means the time will come to pick up the bag.  go  It is coming very fast, we did not want it to come so soon but it is coming very fast, I cannot understand and it has been made 25 years old because now look at what intelligence has been done in 2025, this is implemented since 2004, master is mourning. 2024 is going on, so only 20 years have passed, so it has been made 25 just to push it to 2029, not yet, there will be a complete account, who is retiring now? Now we will make it pro rata. I am saying that the old ones who were paying at Rs 10, those who were getting Rs 14, what will happen to them? Is it so complicated? Look man, and normally if there is any service in the government, then its salary is the same, so is the pension.  It should also be the same, we will retire accordingly, here Bhranti Bhati's pension will be this much, her pension will be this much tomorrow, if we complicate this much in the future also, there can be a scam in this too, that address is very big.  This will not work in India after 15 years, it will not be known today, it will be known later because the tax is so complicated, who will press whose buttons, what is the selection, how many should be made, who is deciding, that too, the government man will sit and calculate whose.  How much is your pension? How much did you make? How much did you make? How much did you make? How much did you make? Your NPS was this one, this one was the return one, this one was going to give you the curd of your brain, this one had just increased the capital gain. From Rs 10 to Rs 125, then brought it back, then removed its indexation cost, then imposed it, then it happened again and today Chartered Accountants are holding their brains and say everywhere that we have simplified, simplified, like in Haryana, we have simplified it.  The door will be broken, Poopa will be fine as October 1st is coming, I have made the portal a secret and here is a portal, there is a portal and everything is fine, I have given a photo and written the rest of his house in his name.  Have you kept anything aside, I have to concentrate a little in Haryana. Elections are coming. If you want videos of Haryana, please write Haryana and write which province of Haryana and which place you are from. There is one more request.  It is a request to every subscriber who is watching till now, please write in the comment section from which district or city you are listening to me so that you get that national feeling as to where.  There is reach so that the issues that are there can be raised because there are many issues in the country which are not being raised by anyone because they neither generate votes nor make any issues out of them, nor are they clickbait-ish but they are necessary.  So please write in the comment section thank you very much"

    "title": "Veg Vs Non Veg debate [w71YpPzhGt0].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, Veg vs Non Veg debate, many questions were being asked on this, it would be a very good video, watch it and circulate it to everyone, whether you like it, I will explain it very well, I will even take it to religion, is it okay, actually take care, how do you understand this thing?  You should approach him, I will tell you the thing, you will either be veg or non-veg, whatever you are, watch it comfortably and enjoy. First of all, let me tell you that the debate that is going on is on two levels.  It is on the level inside your house, the level of relatives, mother's, daughter-in-law's, hey, he eats non-veg, he doesn't eat, hey, so and so eats, it is going on at the micro level of the society, it is going on at the level of the family, friend, your dear.  There is identity and the other one which is going on at the political level, which is going on at a bigger level, both have to do with the story or the story control, it will come out in the best way, but now let us understand in the beginning that there is one level at this level.  One thing is going on at this level and the other thing is that this debate is going on a lot, so in this we have to understand whether the veg people are putting pressure on the non-veg people, they are putting pressure on the debate as to what is better or bigger.  Is that a recommendation? Are the veg people making too much noise that non-veg food is bad and should not be eaten non-veg or are the non-veg people making noise that hey, you veg people should also eat non-veg, meaning you yourself tell me what is happening in my opinion.  from and 99.99 100% According to me, you will agree that only those who eat veg or are vegetarian and the institutions or organizations associated with witch one are doing this, then the atlist understands it at the level, do n't jump too quickly now, oh Guru ji.  Quickly tell me which is better and bigger, when will we go because what are we doing in India right now, we are arguing more, not communicating, we are sitting with our own points and the dispute is becoming a dialogue.  What happens in the dialogue, we go to contribute and talk to him comfortably about what is happening, then we know the third thing, there are 820 crore people in this world, about 780 crore eat non-veg, only 40 crore are vegetarian.  So it does not mean that the issue of democracy is not happening, that if there are only 40 crore people and 780 eat non-veg, then has it become correct? Do not do it like this, I am telling the figures. Whatever it is, I am not saying that 40 crores are wrong and 700 are right or 780 are wrong and 40 crores are also not right. I am not saying that, and out of these 40 crores, who is vegetarian in the whole world?  Approximately 38-39 crores in India, if you see in our country also, out of 140 crores, 100 crores plus are non-vegetarian and a huge rest in the world.  That 97% of the vegetarian population, 98 crore population does not eat non-veg, that Vigan Vigan oven, we will talk about it further, is it under a movement or could be due to health, okay, that is very subtle, 1 crore means out of the world. Apart from India, the population is around 700 crores, out of which one crore is just fine, so you should know what is happening. Okay, now let's move ahead. Veg people say that by eating non-veg,  The carbon footprint increases and the earth gets harmed. Okay, we will not debate on this. Further, there is Acharya Prashant ji who says that even in giving birth to a child, it is not known how many trees would be cut down. If there was a carbon foot, then don't even give birth to a child because  There is no other reason for this debate, it does happen but carbon footprint is there if you are a vegetarian and you drive an stay butt  I want to tell you that this happens with 10,000 other things too. Okay, many people will say that the earth has given such a good thing, is it necessary to do this to eat? It is also said that our teeth are not like this. We Kutch cannot do what a lion does, its big eight are like this, so first of all, such arguments, humans Kutch do not eat non-veg, they eat cooked food. So, when asterisk is given, then a little bit, when those asterisks go to many things.  Yes, it is wrong, this is how I will go about the issues in India, I will also tell you that, watch the entire video properly, only then you will get clarity. Most of the people who are non-vegetarian, speak from the Mauka Terrain type. I have not heard anyone saying that those who are hardcore non-veg, remove it from the month of Saavan.  Ghat, why is this guilty feeling going on in the houses? He is asking more, he is a vegetarian, he is a complete vegetarian, he has no interest in eating non-veg, he is also not asking first.  So we should ask that who will the video hit the most, those people whose idea is completely clear that being a vegetarian is a sin, then the one who knows that brother, I want to enjoy committing this sin, don't listen to me some story.  It is also clear that who are the people, whether it is the caste that mom heard or the daughter-in-law eats it, sleeping with someone or any other relative or acquaintance or those who are facing prejudice, this is a video for them to liberate them.  There is a video for this, now let's go ahead, you have to see the vegetarians who also create noise, many of them are less than date feeling, show some achievements in their life and show some virtual ones, I don't know how to sing well in my life.  Story: I have not reached a powerful position, I do n't even have much money, suddenly you think what is it, then tell me, I am not a vegetarian, oh my God, I am a vegetarian, the issue is also like this.  It is not for everyone, but it is true that they have to do something, how can they be insulted at some point? Any other person is getting this insult. Vegetarians are insulting non- vegetarians just by asking this question, and what is this thing?  I will continue in the future as well, it is okay, smoking cigarette, drinking alcohol, no one will say good, till now I have not said about non-veg, it is good, it is okay, vegetarian is called non-veg, it is okay, smoking cigarette, drinking alcohol, getting intoxicated, home intoxicant.  Do Hajj Go Nobody Bill Set This Good Because It Affects People's Life Note Only Your Health If someone near you or someone in your family becomes an alcoholic father, someone in the house gets addicted to drugs, some cigarette causes illness, the whole family is affected.  This family is this affected society, this is also affected, so issues should be made about them also, but have you ever heard that there is a protest against cigarettes or against alcohol?  There is opposition, the government is killing the revenue of the dhaba, there is control, meat production is happening, everything is happening but he is not like this, there will be no hue and cry in the name of religion, but there is not much hue and cry in the name of politics.  This kind of thing works very well on him, one half state is fine, what happens, let me tell you, whoever is yours is fine, then do not oppose them, then we go ahead, what I would like to tell is that many times it is said that hey veg.  After eating milk and curd, I am in Haryana, I am not blaming it on my personal side, I know that I am clear, but I am not telling others that brother, you are normal, it is very good because opposition is bad for every stomach.  The thing to be done is that if you eat curd bat, that too, it may cause more harm, it also contains more date, it is called another thing, there is protein in it also in your pulses, it does not contain that much, because those who are imparting so much knowledge, your lentils are cooked  Let's take 100 grams of dal and weigh it and tell you some stories. It is cooked and there is also a bowl of dal. People will eat six people and one person will eat it. And if you are comparing it with that then wrong wrong new country like 70 lakhs.  Had taken a medal along with population, if one of our medals is gold then we keep walking dogs, then that is the lack of muscle, okay, it is our choice, but I would like to say that yes, this is a lifestyle choice.  There is a lifestyle choice behind the lifestyle choice and behind every lifestyle there are some advantages and disadvantages. Another person can live. If your lifestyle is to go in an expensive car and a fuel guzzler, then you are ruining the earth. Your lifestyle choice is to live in one and in the conditioner. Many vegetarians who live in a conditioned environment are also causing damage to the earth. Consuming too much electricity is also causing harm on paper.  By writing, trees are also being cut, 10,000 such activities are being done by you, you are using plastic, you are not recycling it, you are not recycling waste, you are not putting your garbage separately, you are not putting it in dry bed, then you are doing it every time.  Where you have issues on this, Irrespective of Veg Non-Veg, so I will say again that it is a lifestyle choice, your life should be a stall choice, power is wearing jeans, I myself am wearing dhoti, maybe wearing jeans.  I will make a video on it to give clarity on what harm he is doing to her. It is okay for you to see but that is a lifestyle choice. Girls are roaming around wearing short clothes, they wear salwar suits, they wear sarees, what else do they wear?  It is a lifestyle choice, people come to that too, so one thing is that it is a lifestyle choice, people come to comment a lot on lifestyle choice, one is inside a democracy and one  In a democratic world, one limit bond is not good, how to do it, how to pace it, I tell you in a very good way, G-20 has just happened, our country is India, we want to promote it, we want to tell this thing to understand the world.  So the food we had was the menu, the dinner we had was a very good menu and it is written in the world that brother, the taste can be taken from these things also without doing it like this and did not tell him that brother, this is good or bad, I also told him.  If you stay at home or in a hotel  You are here because many of us Indians are not that many. First of all, there is one thing in our India and I want to tell you that there are thousands of meals to be eaten for 33 days in a year. Out of 365, it is possible that one person may keep that fast and may miss it.  Go Cobra Dena, a person eats approximately 1000 meals in a year. There are thousands of these so called non- vegetarians too. These thousands of meals are not of non-vegetarian food, so it is not such a big issue that oh my God, if you go to a foreign country.  See, it starts with breakfast. In India, you know no one eats breakfast normally. Yes, I know eggs. Eggs are used but they eat normally. Foreigners eat breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks. Take such a time for them.  It is okay to keep it, if it is a relief, I will explain those things further because they are all bad and if you tell me this, then I will explain it to you in the best possible way, but people say that drinking tea is bad, some say it is very good, some say  Some say that the milk one is bad, some say that other one is good, then one, this is too much, now many are saying that drinking milk is also wrong, vision, vision, vision, they keep saying, one Virat Kohli will come and see how big he can become.  Hey Virat Kohli, the one who eats according to his father's mind is getting knowledge brother, not everyone is getting that, a normal man drinks his milk and eats less cheese, sometimes like in Haryana they say, eat milk and curd, it's okay Haryana, eat butter.  If you eat this then tell him it's good too  It is said that even a desi cow is called good. You have to say whether or not extracting milk from a cow is also a sin, then we will go crazy. Here in the world, this thing has been going on for so many years, is n't it like this that just now?  The sin is big, this is happening now, this was not happening long ago, it was not like this, we did not fulfill it, okay, it used to happen everywhere, everywhere you have seen that it was used to graze, all used to be less, earlier all were less, old.  Everywhere in my books, in my knowledge and in my epic.  It is written that you are religious, you are Gods, that too is associated, so you have to drink milk, now you don't want to drink milk, then tell me again, when nothing will happen to anything, then in the future, that bread and that should also be band.  Will go to what is the issue actually which we need to raise is the quality of the system of non-veg antibiotics which is being used in comparison to other countries and we are not trying to stop the cut off limit. Hygiene factor is extremely important because too many antibiotics are being used, too much is being done in unhygienic conditions, in unregulated conditions, cleanliness is not going to increase and date is a problem in the outside countries, if sense it is so match is prevalent then their  He has fixed all these mechanisms, even if he talks too much, honestly, I too get a little distracted, I am not like him in the details.  I will go and I am going to tell you that here we have to be the most important thing because one thing is certain that if this thing is happening, if the people are vegetarian and have sensibility and as they say, murder is done by typing and they are in the drains.  I am bleeding and now I have to speak a little, to do all this like this otherwise I will not be able to drive the point, that is very wrong, it means on de face, very tricky where mean things are happening in the society, a dare.  It is happening in one place, it is happening in one place, it is being told, whatever is happening in the system, it is happening behind the curtain, it is happening in cleanliness, it is happening in hygiene, the sensitivity of those who do not do it is also kept in mind.  Then perhaps this opposition may not be so much according to me, then he is the one who is a genuine vegetarian, who has nothing to do with you, your stomach, your life, your lifestyle, whatever you do, you should not come in front of my face if I have. Date Right, so if the story is about the place of food, then vegetarian is different, non-veg is different, if that sensibility is there, then here the non-veg, the people who eat non-veg, the people inside the supply chain and they have a responsibility to fix this thing is very big.  And the role of the government should be in this. You go to one place automatically and then at one place, a hue and cry is happening here and from another place, if the political party was in some other area of India, the issue would have been the region.  The hypocrisy is understandable. Anytime you will see me criticizing the political party, speaking foul is not my cup of tea because that is their politics, what do you want, at one place they are creating ruckus, at another place they will not get votes but these vegetarians.  And those who are very sensitive here, that city is a hit, their caste is there and they say political, they see the same party story of two roses and when they go and don't say anything, then you too don't think so much. You ask them for real time thing, no brother, we need regulation here, we need a standard here [Music] There should be a distance to maintain things, the story is like this, no one should open anything because of the thought that you are a locality.  Or is there a place where it is normal, most of the people like this are vegetarian, if someone goes there and starts doing his program then this date is also not correct just because you will remain or not, what is the harm then what?  It should not be like this, like many people say that we do not want liquor vends near our house, we should eat liquor vends, they should be regulated, there are some rules and regulations, such liquor vends cannot be opened, the story is that brother.  Open the story also, although many places are open and government is also happening, but people protest in it that brother, it should not be near the school here, residential should be very close to it, commercial place is a different place, its place is  Honey, this is the way we have to see this, we have to do this and do not make it too political and hateful. Inside the house, when she is the mother and he is there and she does not want this to happen, then brother, don't do it in the house but buy your own separate house.  Then try to do everything according to the owner of the house, this is also a fact, no, mother does not like it, there is no need to make sister-in-law, separate your house, live separately, eat and drink whatever is yours because it is a lifestyle choice.  There is a class and then there is a debate in it that what is the meaning of making others feel guilty all the time and what do they say, I have heard such incidents with vegetarian people too, what do they also say, it is okay to show Nisha.  For that is also a kind of sin of someone. Now I was trying to explain it according to religion, what is its technique. It is very simple. See, live your life as per Sanatan. Not having judgment is your karma and its results.  There are actions and consequences, there are inputs and outputs. Do what you are doing. What is wrong and what is right. Maybe if this thing is wrong then she will suffer. If you have issues in your digestive system, you are not exercising after eating some food. You don't necessarily need protein. You mean, where you live, this kind of thing is not of good quality at the hygiene level, so if you eat this kind of non-veg, then it will take a toll on your body.  Will she give up or will your dog say something is happening and if brother nothing is happening, infact you are feeling good, I am getting strength and everything is going very well, if everything is good, then it is good, then it is good. So a third person should come into it and another person should come and be the judge because his input is his output, leave it to him, you pay attention to your input, if you see it with such simplicity then people go around propagating their ideologies like YouTube.  The channel is the movie people, watch ours, watch ours, brother, if you have butter, then enjoy with your butter, don't go so far as to tell others, no, your butter is not your butter, that too on lifestyle choice, a good thing in democracy.  No, who will eat what, who will wear what, who means what, who will marry, who will marry and how, do not involve us in all these things if we want to progress the country like this, because there is a lot of debate in this, there are definitely many issues in it.  The issues are inner sense, this non-veg industry is going on in India, on request, lot of regulation, health and also the condition of poultry is very good. If you see it, its condition is very good, then according to it, it is not good.  If you want to copy and say the same things to the best, brother, so many people are doing it, then start doing like them, then tell humanity a little story, because of the way I see this, what is happening, note it down.  Very, in my opinion, nice is fine, so still I debated, I did not tell you whether veg is good or non-veg, anytime in lifestyle choice you can tell me, brother, do it like this, do it like that, tell me like this, but eat here.  What is there in the drink, there will be so many things, if you all agree then you will not be able to enjoy anything. You tell me one item of food, I will tell it in the comment area. 50 There is a video on that why that thing is bad for drinking tea.  10 disadvantages of tea  10 benefits of drinking bread, disadvantages of eating grains, benefits of eating grains, sugar is poison, stop eating sugar, everything is fine in its own sense, but ultimately brother, you do something, no matter how many Babas you become, how many yogas you do, how immortal no one is.  No one has come here after drinking the nectar to be had. These people have to live between 60, 70, 80 and 100 years. I know in one state where I have lived for many years. It is a completely vegetarian state. In a way, even liquor is not allowed there. And his name also starts with 'G', rest I will not tell more than this, ok no 'G' but it is not from Goa, that's all I will tell you, ok he gets the program in the state in 60-65, ok, he is very healthy.  He doesn't eat, drink drugs, that's a different matter, Kakra Fafda and all these two cloud daklas are okay, but brother, the choice is not like that either, okay, there too the public is dripping and it is dripping faster.  It's okay, but they are also happy, so everyone is happy, we have made a system that is working, now they will stay at our place and it is very strict there, even the maids in the society check what has been made here and call Malik and tell him.  If your tenant eats non-veg food then he gets the same notice, this is also less strict, so where there is as much shift, there is as much education, there are many places, I told the name of a state, I have lived there for many years, it is okay, so it is there now.  In that we are not even on them Now they have sensitivity, now they can't say no, no, no, what is the harm, why are you doing so much, now his house is his house, his colony, his state, his and all the rest, don't think it is a simple thing there, no, we will stay here.  That thing is also a matter of caste sensibility. If the vast majority (99%) become vegetarian, then we will give them this also as a fact. Then you will say that she is mine, then don't take any other mother in the family, if you are so concerned about it.  Hardcore is not a non-vegetarian, I have seen it in a love marriage and whether it is a boy's wife or a girl, I will tell the boy also because the girl has to know that at home she is very vegetarian and does puja and all these people must be in trouble. Either they will have to compromise, you will have to do it and it is very difficult to compromise, so this is also an aspect of life, but in this, if this person does not say that this is bad, then this one will say this, you, this oil.  What is the point of this that you are doing dirty oil to that again and again or do that again and again or keep drinking tea, drink cutting tea, drink big tea, sometimes sweet tea, this is also a habit like this and then let's compete.  Who is living longer? Then we came to know that brother, the one who was living a very healthy life in his life is going first because if you look at veg and non-veg people and like this, then brother, if you look at foreign countries, then their life expectancy is  The story is more than India, they also get more medals in Olympics, so according to him, has non-veg become good? You know the West has its own diseases, everyone reduces them. First of all, the news has come in this state, first of all is that condition is not good. It's a lifestyle choice and we do n't have to attack each other, I have to do it for you, but by staying within the boundaries, everyone has to be sensitive to each other, it's not like only the non-veg people have to take care of the veg people.  You also have to keep it to the people that you yourself will go and tell someone that I will explain to you what you are doing, if you want to understand only this much then these people who drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes, take drugs, misbehave, do so many things in life and many more.  There are issues, those are the issues to raise, raise those too, then it's okay, then you are the only one raising it. If it's everyone's lifestyle choice, ask a question, I hope Pragmatic Kelly, I explained, you guys must have understood, okay.  Please feel free to share a little with me on this, I have tried to pour too much cold water in a gram pan, brother, approach it like this, just like I have explained and told you, the facts are not changing for you. 40 I don't see 780 vegetarians being converted from crores of vegetarians. How much chillim-chilli can I do, what will I do? Even if from 40 crores to 40 crores we have become five, it is still our victory. There are many people who say that it is victory.  It is your butt, you know Vijay Patta's your ₹ 50000, there are more fields where you can spread humanity and this meaning in a more butter way, this is my opinion, okay, please share, like, if you have not subscribed the channel, then you will subscribe, thank you.  you very match"

    "title": "Vikram Betaal Syndrome ｜ An Interesting Phenomenon Which Can Change Society [eOq-nXxH0kw].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today we will talk about Vikram Betal Syndrome. Call it Vikram Syndrome. We have seen the throne of Vikram Betal. In childhood, many of you must have seen the other wise. His small back story is that he is a Betalik ghost and the soul is hanging from someone else.  Vikram brings him and he narrates stories to cross the path and at the end he asks him a question and the question says that Vikram, if you know the answer and you remain silent, your head will be broken into pieces and before that he makes a commitment.  It is like if you open your mouth, I will fly away, so it's like a very tough choice, okay and every time it was Arun Govil ji's character in which the one who played the role of Apne Ram ji in Apna Doordarshan jine kiya hai was the one who  Old Asan Basti type thing, if anyone ever came after that then I don't have any idea, I only know the same one, ok then we will talk about this syndrome that in life we ​​all should behave like Vikram and if you are not behaving then something is  Wrong in the end of the story that soul gets free and they get something and they get something from Simhasana Batti It ends on a very happy note for a king whose name is Vikram ok so this is what happens in life I travel with this thing I will not enjoy, I experience this syndrome. You say that in life we ​​have to support the right and after knowing the right, we definitely have to open our mouth. Many people will fly away if we know. All of them are I don't want to use but subscribers, they run away. Many a times, you will see that we model ourselves on one or the other thing for our own benefit. Some of us consider ourselves feminists.  If it becomes so, that means now he can't speak against women, someone is doing wrong, women can't say that, someone only with prudence, intelligence and consciousness will catch him, someone with a political sense of shame will catch him, even if the politicians of the party change it.  But you catch an ideology that the actual politician who is in power is changing the party and these people are also accepting him. Hemant Soran ji is coming and meeting Modi ji, you know and before that Sonia ji.  When we are going to meet, we do not understand who has to do it, but politicians are also doing something of their own, but we shy away. If someone has taken a side of religion, if we take the same side, then we will handle every situation in our heart. According to me, it should be judged individually and whatever you believe to be true and which is your truth and is the truth of that situation, see, there is a definition of truth, what is truth, what is truth, if it increases or decreases, then the truth does not remain true if it increases or decreases. If something increases or decreases, then the truth is no longer true, why is the truth only this much, meaning it is so small, it is equal to the tip of a needle, the truth is only this much, if it decreases or increases, then the truth is no longer true and there is no limit to lies.  Otherwise, like I say many times in the exam, 14 14 196 is true, 197 195 is a lie and anything can be a lie because the truth is only 196, so if you are not traveling through Vikram Betal Syndrome in life. And I will not again use the word because in syndrome many times we use the word 'travel' and if we are not experiencing it then I don't think so.  You are on the right path of life, then you will never get the throne 32. You will feel that Betaal did not run away, Betaal remained on your head but you did not reach anywhere, your mouth was closed and you will never get such a feeling if you keep that mouth closed.  If your head is breaking into pieces then you don't even have the knowledge because when you reach the intellectual level which every human being should reach, one of the goals of this channel is that you people Taking the subscribers somewhere on a thought process level, then if you do not reach there then you will not be in pieces. Sir, you will say that your address is of the menu of Sanu of Sanu, oh leave it, get the soil of Sanu, if it is done, then that is one.  What is our name? There is always a meme of Amit Shah ji that if my blood gets spilled, then perhaps one should not spill blood too much, it is not good for health, okay, that too is a different extreme that on everything.  It is okay to spill the beans but there should be opinion and mouth should be opened, there should be no panic, if you don't feel that this is not right then say it in front of the state face, this is democracy, enjoy it, look here, there will be no Singapore in India if we remain here.  There will be no potholes here and pollution will disappear and a paradise will be created which is not going to be created here, there is only one thing to enjoy right now, freedom of speech as long as it is there, it is okay, enjoy as much as you can, if it is okay then yours.  Enjoy, don't force others to do that, it's a mess, but tell the truth, whatever you feel, no, I don't feel like it, no, don't force it, I don't do it, it's not for me, so do n't do this, it's fine with me.  I don't feel alive, if it is not there from inside, then either I say it or I say it or someone else says it. Whoever said that if you are alive, you should look alive, you should be seen, you should feel it, it is not just like that, it is alive. but everywhere What is the use of such a relationship in front of the wife in the office that you cannot open your mouth? The wife will leave and will get angry with the parents, mother-in-law and father-in-law. Nowadays, in front of the children, okay baby, okay son, okay daughter, take ifo, don't be upset, then girlfriend is someone's.  No Shona, no baby, no baby, how did you get angry, convince him, stay clean, friend Vikram Betal, remember what is happening now, how long will the tantrums last, what are you bringing to the table, this is the relationship.  Let the other person also feel a little bit of logic, this guy is right, when you see you will become like this, brothers and sisters, then you will become a consultant, people will pay you to listen to the truth, once a big order will be placed, there will be many people around you, what will they do to you?  You don't have a diploma, this is what I can see, I will tell you, then your personality will become such that people will start knowing you that man, this guy is right, that means look, if you are getting your own wife and  If she asks you how I am looking, then you should have the wisdom to tell her that no, this saree is not suiting you, it is a night party, wear that one, she will love you, she will respect you and she will like that.  Man, it is so good because she is in doubt, she is asking, don't call him, everything is fine, she knows that you, the wife, knows everything, the wife does not make a fool of the wife, the wife knows that the husband is a fool, he is running away, no wife no.  Nobody likes someone who is buying peace, which is called buying peace, every man likes that man, he knows, he knows that he will not force me, if I am not looking fat, it is a very tricky question, no, I am lucky, fat, then you can say this  No, you are looking good, you are looking a little fat, I like fat only, there are many heroines to choose from, you have seen that everyone is South North Worth, every person has his own choice, not everyone has zero size.  I like this, I have to take such examples to tell, I am not trying to shame someone here, I have to tell more examples, tell the truth, tell who feels how, tell the truth, why am I afraid of saying this to my wife, let my husbands see how you look?  Ho has got nothing about how you look to me, how you speak and how you treat me, this is the thing I look at you, the rest is yours.  The body that is yours, even your mirror will tell you how it is. Why are you asking me about it, but how do I feel? When respect for me comes out of your mouth, manners come out, logic comes out, love comes out, then you seem like an angel to me and  Brother, if you speak like that, then you can do whatever you want, why don't you tell me the truth, how is the food, it is a little kheer, take it out from the bottom, do not mix it, this is a good reply rather.  It is good to have one bite, how much has he eaten, how are he eating, he should know what is the fear in giving feedback to people, that is why I am saying Vikram, tell me the moment which Vikram is in his organization or in life, he is earning the maximum boss. Asks, Oh Sir, what kind of preparation have you made, it must be good, this is not Vikram, Sir, I think you have forgotten this, this aspect has been missed, it should be seen like this, I think we need to rule look at.  You will go ahead in the organization too. No one is giving wrong advice or how do you guys feel? First of all write in the comment section, this chatu khor naa, the feeling is good, but if all the chatu khars become sour, then your party would have become that. B then to start from Bombay, to make B to B, there is no one to tell all the chaats, no one to explain, no one to guide, all is good B for Bihar, bridges worth Rs 1700,1700 crores are falling down in Bihar, I don't know. How many have I counted in the last month, maybe it is okay, but money has to be saved in Agniveer, it is not his, no, we did not make it by the Centre, so the State Government made it, so the State Government got the money, which means the Central Government does not give it to destroy it. Nitish ji has such a sweet spot that opposition people don't say anything because they can come to him and BJP people don't say anything because they can go.  This is an amazing point, bridge after bridge is collapsing. Where did Nitish ji come from and with what reason has Nitish ji written his destiny? Look, Palturam ji, it is destiny. Opposition does not open its mouth because you do not know when it will join, so do not criticize them much that tomorrow they will be there. This is the advantage of Nitish ji that he will bat with BJP, he will bat anytime, he will become a bowler, some will become one, but we need someone like Vikram, who can come and tell the public that he likes BJP. Nitish also looks good. Nitish ji also looks good. How many bridges have they demolished? Someone must be responsible. So many bridges have fallen in Bihar. No one cares about how many have fallen, in which district, how many have fallen and for how much. Try multiplying and then say thousands.  We will save crores of Agniveer, the country will become a tycoon by compromising on its security, hey, build less bridges, cross the river, you can't do it, or do n't cross, or hire a taxi, do something.  Every time you demolish a bridge, nothing happens and no one talks or mentions it. It's amazing, it's amazing, there is corruption, there is no moral corruption, these opposition people are becoming big heroes, these days poor BJP people are having a bad time, they are not talking.  If you can open the question, why are you becoming a hero? Why are you not becoming a hero? And why is that Jan Suraj guy also not saying? Whose BT is there, what is there in the AT? Tell me, will you tell the whole thing? How come, it should have been Pul Pul Pul Pul, all the things.  Yay, the whole country is busy in Anant Ambani ji's wedding, bridges are falling there, it has nothing to do with it, you are going to be rich after seeing his Ambani ji's wedding, you are going to subscribe to him and you are trolling and abusing him in the same way.  Collect their data from their phone and give it to the public. Who will come to insult the subscriber? You people, we are all yes, and everywhere else it is fashionable to insult the politician, this is Vikram syndrome.  What I am not able to remain silent is that there is benefit in remaining silent, subscribers will be added, Lari Chappa, talk something, Lari Chappa, talk something, talk against girls, all the people with wisdom, intelligence and consciousness will join, how many four crores are roaming around, crazy idiot.  Boys will definitely make you a Guru. You are very right. Girls are ruined and whoever goes after girls will be like that. Leave the women to the women, wake up your consciousness, do it for yourself Guruji, it is good, daba daba, like, subscribe, knock.  There is no Vikram Betal syndrome in this. Do you know the truth of life? Every real person who is at Guru level knows it. So the only difference between Guru Ghantal and Guru is that he is able to stop the truth from within.  I know there is not much benefit in speaking the truth. There is no benefit in the short term and in the long term. Donkey, I am not too. I am also not a fool. You will get the throne, it is okay, but you will run many times to get the throne.  There will be a patience test between Betal and Ka and then you will have to go and hang Betal from the tree again and he will again say Betal, if you say, you will stop and if you don't, your head will be broken into pieces. Tell me brother, I will speak, otherwise in reality you will feel like you are in pieces.  That's why you get the feeling, that's why this original video is being made. You haven't seen such a video anywhere. It's not a cut, copy paste. My example is there. Do you feel like it's in pieces, if I don't do it?  If you say that your head will break into pieces, then every person wants to save himself that now I have said it, now your head is not going to break into pieces, now this is the truth, are you living this truth in your life or do you feel stressed as soon as you speak?  Only mother, mother will get angry if he says this, wife will get angry, let both of them get angry, then what will happen if no one goes, mother can't go, there is no provision, parents can't separate, isn't there a provision for the wife? Divorce also happens, it is not like that, truth will never cause harm, I am trying to tell you, truth will never cause harm, you will speak the truth, you will always speak the truth, you should always speak the truth, not because it is a good thing according to moral science, not because speaking the truth is beneficial.  It is the responsibility of the speaker as well as the listener, therefore one should always speak the truth, and what is the truth, what is your truth, your truth, every truth can exist differently and it is written in the religion that there can.  Be So Many Truths at the Same Time You Can Live With Yours I Can Live With Mine I Will Speak Mine You Speak Yours We Can Agree to Disagree and We Will Live in Harmony Not Taking a Stand Not Telling This  If this is right or wrong then do n't raise the flag of these people becoming gendered that women are good or only men are good, right? Raise the flags, don't raise the flags of Adalaj, say, Situation is situation to situation, everyone can mess up at a given time and any person, even the worst person, has the capacity to do a lot of good and the best person also has the capacity to do something bad. This  This is how humans operate and we have to speak the truth. If we want to appreciate the truth then I hope there should be applause for it. If you were giving a language speech somewhere for me then it would be okay now.  So, if I am not giving a speech then whoever enjoyed it, libre, liked it, liked it concept wise, then please write, are you feeling Vikram Betaal in your life, then tell me whether you are afraid of Betaal or the Betaal who is speaking.  I just became silent so that my Betal doesn't run away. If you go with the Betal on your head, then he is a ghost, he will not be of any use, he will not change and he too will not get freedom.  It is not going to be of any use, it is not going to be of any use, it will also remain hanging and many people are roaming around with a very restless thinking oh if I have delivered it then my work will be done, it will not happen, you will have to open your mouth open your mouth so I hope all this  I am successful in explaining things to you people very well. Please share and like. These topics are very dear to me. They come from an abstract level. They don't come from  Something which is easily understandable and which is easy you know you can tell and two p two four became G 3 4 became 12 G 12 12 became 144 1990 361 like this is not easy a little abstract thinking of the brain you think this G  I you my videos massage your brain then I am your massage ji masa massage  Whose brain is being massaged? You go to the gym, you make moves in the gym. Okay, so think of it as a mental gym. You come and get a massage. You have to think about whatever part of the brain you are stimulating. Write to him and do n't kill your Vikram. Ok then please share, like and subscribe the channel. Thank you very much."

    "title": "Vishwaguru And World Cup Final [ADr6DMIB77s].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, very good feedback is coming on this channel and I am having a lot of fun making videos on this channel. Even though the subscribers are less, the topics that I am bringing are for batting openly and you are on my face.  You can also see that today I have brought a unique topic, I would like to link both Vishwa Guru and World Cup Final a little. I remain steadfast. You all know that I have no connection with anyone special, on this side or that side, those who have watched many of my videos. which a  When he watches the video, he says, gets stamped that this is the next one, will watch the video again and changes it. Some man is changing colors like Greg, so brother, I don't know which one he is because of all types. I am posting videos. In today's video, we are making a world guru and we are going to become world gurus. Type it is something like like you mostly people who travel by train or have ever done it in your life.  that train big station  But before reaching there, it is on the outer, just like we are standing on the outer of becoming Vishwa Guru, this is the station of Vishwa Guru and here our train is standing on the outer, the bus of India, now he is going to become Vishwa Guru and he is bound to become so.  If we had won the World Cup final, the only thing left would be a little pettiness. There was a lot of pettiness in that stadium and such pettiness does not suit someone who wants to be a world leader. I did not watch the entire match. I do not watch the match. I do not watch cricket at all.  You guys who are old subscribers  You know, I have clearly posted a video on Clarity for Youth, which is a very good video of that World Cup. If you have n't seen it then you guys can watch it and if you have seen it then write in the comment section that you have seen that one on this page.  I want to tell you that if one of your batsmen scores a century against the opposition and the crowd is like whether we call it a good cricket or a good thing, we call it a good cricket or a good thing, you guys know that the opening ceremony was so awkward. When are the crackers being lit, what is happening, you cannot cry so much, friend, the world is watching and most of all, what is coming from us is an arrogance, one is confidence, one is this arrogance without substance, in that arrogance you find many people.  Let's take this away, this time a very unique thing has come and it has been published in many places that for the first time in a World Cup match, there were neutral people who were neither from Australia nor from India, they were there for Australia to win.  Especially the cricket playing countries, they were rooting, meaning they were thinking that by clapping Australia, Australia, arrogance is being shown somewhere through BCCI and that is one of India's thin lines, being assertive, being confident and being arrogant.  These three things are Assertive, Confident and Arrogant. Arrogant is never a positive word. Graciousness is ending very fast and it has a different meaning.  You have renovated that stadium, the last one when India won the World Cup, it was different, the crowd was different, now whatever you see, the ticket rates are coming by paying so much money, do you know what you have done, the ticket price has increased to Rs 50,000 in the plane fare.  They were quoting hotel fares which had become lakhs and lakhs, so the city shined, the city shined, that city where I like it, there are investments in that city, I have lived in that city for many years, I consider myself half of the same place.  I agree  If not completely, it is okay, then quite a bit, my thinking is also from there, okay and I am also half Gujarati, okay, okay, but despite that, despite that, the thought process we are showing and the direction in which we are going. I don't think this suits Vishva Guru in any way. What do you guys say who are my subscribers? You guys write in the comment section where does such a sense of entitlement come from that this is the only entitlement that is there.  That only we will win, we are the best, this person should also come somewhere in the young generation, who has cleared the prelims, then I have to clear the interview and I have to get the IAS and I have to get the IAS. I have to get a home carder, it has to happen with me, so you set up your whole life and make this appointment, this is no way to live, always have the benefit of doubt and for that, it always has to happen.  It is necessary from above that we keep sharing our complete knowledge to the world, do the work, desire the result, the whole time while batting, the desire for the result was happening, the work was not being done, that is the real knowledge of Geeta Ji, Australia has Do they enjoy? Well, in their country, there is no such thing as big, someone stepped on it in the World Cup match, so the world, that has become a very noble thing, what a religious thing it has become, what a trophy the world is, they don't say the world.  At the feet of Rajni Gandha Ad The world does not come at his feet, so he did that Michel Marx, there will be a lot of trouble beyond that and he is doing very wrong thing, he went there and no one came to welcome him and that too, if India had won the World Cup then it would have been half the amount.  India is standing at the airport, it's fine, it's not a big thing for them, it's not a big thing, that's why they win easily, no media person comes there, no cricket comes, I think there's something, not now people will  Release I think Travis Head that day with his century has killed a big part of cricket enthusiasm in India and I am very happy about it if it happens Judge Votes only time will tell but if it does then we waste a lot of time on this match If you want further videos in our country, I will make them. Burnout is happening a lot and in that burnout country, at one place we are getting crushed in work, at another place we are wasting our time.  There is so much contradiction where there is so much work, they are lagging behind in the work and also wasting time. Here, what is called the common public has been made crazy by the Illuminati system in the system, so that they don't know about themselves. Think about it, if you don't ask questions then there is a word called bhalo in Haryana. How many people are there who understand this word, it is kept as bhalo, it is ok to say a little Haryanvi too, you will learn it, follow the channel Guruji Gurugram etc.  From Haryana only. Okay, so tell me, how many people are kept here for good, they keep showing such nonsense about anything, the only care is taken, like when a child cries, we give him something soothing, give him a lollipop. Or some nowadays they come with silicone or something so that the gas coming out from his teeth is like an irritation, give it to suppress like this, let's do the work, for many it is cricket, for some it is discussion on religion, for some  For me, this is a discussion on politics, for someone, these discussions should be done, I am just a discussion on this channel, but in this discussion, there is no detached discussion, you have become like Chhotu Baby, whoever comes and says something in your mouth.  It is also given by you and you start thinking, Oh, there is no one even that small, so this is our conduct from somewhere, whatever is going on right now, according to Vishwa Guru, from somewhere, our conduct is not like this, those are the feelings and now for what reason? What is the justification for emotions?  Brother, it is not at all like a Vishwa Guru, so it is okay to claim what is called Band Bacha, and there is a lot of difference in how the actual result is to be obtained. I am a very popular marital consultant. I do marriage consultation. In weddings, the Band is very loud.  That's got nothing to do with How is the quality of marriage The quality of marriage has got nothing to do with  Do with this what is our focus on Band Baaj Baraat, Band Baaj Baraat has been done, events have been done, grand grand wedding has taken place, meaning that boy is coming from the lift like this, Haad Dhula is coming from the hydraulic lift, the stage is coming like this and the other stage is coming like this.  The tune remains and this is coming, the commentary is going on, the lily flowers were expensive in the entry, O Verma, it is raining from above, they are joining like this, okay, and then 70 lakhs were spent on this event.  Marriage does n't work for 70 days, both the families come and sit in marital consultation. You sit like this, you look at both of them like this, with the same glasses, they do n't understand this. They are sad about the loss of Rs 70 lakh. They are sad about the loss of their children's marriage, brother hydraulic.  If we had reduced the lift, there would be no substance. In our country, the band is busy in the wedding procession, in personal life as well as in that, and those who are at the top, who are running this whole system, do the public know how?  It's fun, organize a great event, it should be in your face, it should be said like this, say such a good fare, that means till now he was looking at the wedding photos because so many photos were taken, within that time there was chaos in the wedding too, Holi meaning 30 40 50  Till now in the day, the clothes that they had given to each other had not even been made, before that they sat here like us, come and say pencil, cancel your marriage, come in that stage, pencil marriage is canceled and till now  Actually, that suit is not stitched, I have not seen the complete photo and till now this is happening in personal life and is happening in public space only and the spread is so much and Vishwa Guru is going to be made somewhere like this, not yet, not yet, very much.  We are far away, we can't decline ourselves so quickly, relief has spread in families, relief has spread in personal life, we are not able to find jobs, we are crying, we are getting burnt out, we want to change the job, oh whose. She is not engaged, she is unhappy, it is understandable that the one who is engaged should be happy, he is also not happy, there is more work, less salary, government servants should be happy, the public all say that government jobs are their own, the private ones are crying.  The businessmen are going on their own business, the businessmen are going on their own, hey, some party should be happy who says that they are looting, they have taken away the loot, are there any robbers who take away the loot and there are no such robbers too?  now you are  Look, why do I feel that this destruction of cricket is going to happen? There are no bookies, there are no bettors, this time there was no betting market, otherwise, every time we used to hear that the rate of the betting market is this, which is n't it?  Used to play, this time they are also disappointed, what a match, what is the match, there was no betting on anyone, there used to be so much noise in every game that it is like when an IPO comes in the share market, Tata Tech's IPO.  as it turned out  In that, the gray market premium is calculated from somewhere at Rs. 50 or even if the share is worth Rs. 00, it will be listed at this much, then the gray market premium is running automatically, the market decides it, then it shows that this IPO is being oversubscribed 3040 times.  There are people and you put them on the de-mat, now I am absolutely sure about those Gujarati cigarettes and all these things, I am not here and the maker is telling you, but I am trying to tell you that it is not there, there is nothing there.  But it will be very difficult to sustain further. Disillusionment is getting disillusioned and it is good when disillusionment with all the things is disillusioned then only people will be disillusioned with themselves. I don't know why people are not disillusioned with themselves. Most of all, be disillusioned with yourself and then your wife and children.  Father, brother, sister, be attached to the family. Apart from these, everything else is being discussed, what will happen to Ukraine, Russia with Putin, Pakistan, China, taught him a lesson, taught him a lesson, we take pride in pettiness, there is a fog ad called 'Hey yours'.  Here I have heard that nothing is happening due to inflation, then he says, there is fog in your place, this is yours, you enjoy it, this is yours, which one am I saying that the Aarti is not done but you got the same by teasing me like this every time?  He is the one who has to be teased by that student who is not getting 20 marks. Out of 100, you are sitting at 70th position. Out of 100, you should talk to the 90th one and you are getting happy by teasing the 20th one because  That self- esteem is good from within, isn't it? You tell me. Those who work in advertising are very creative and intelligent people. They understand the psychology of the people and what they will enjoy. Look at all the ads that come these days, they are based on this. If we are doing all this, then maybe we are very low in the process of evolution, brother Vishva Guru.  No, this is not the case, accept it and they did this to us, we are taking revenge from this, okay this fog of yours is going on, this is revenge, this is revenge due to fog, or the one who is actually powerful, he has to give it to someone.  There is a need to tease, there is a need to tease again, there is a weak person, isn't it, today is my day, so I am teasing you, tomorrow and then he will attack you, or do you want to look forward to such a country and the public and go out like this?  Tax  Now is coming, just like us, we just sit and watch, this is here and this and many people get disappointed and leave the country, wondering where are they trapped in these, now people like us don't want to go and that too.  My video is pending on why one should not go to Dispat La Cartoon Girly Happening Half the Time because what is there in our country, if you go to share this knowledge with the people then they will come back to beat you and abuse you.  What  Yes, it will be fun to do this, there is fun in it because it means that it is fun to rub the neighboring country because he cannot say anything to his parents, he is a rub, he cannot say anything in the office, he cannot say anything to his wife. So it is fun watching this ad, something is going on, the fog itself is going on and even in the fog box, you see the one who hangs up the phone and the other one after him, okay, this is okay, you are being insulted.  is that  There is also a flaw in the ad, you are showing him down and he puts the phone down on your face, after that you are saying, ok, ok, ok, to whom are you telling that he has just put down the phone, you are watching, this is observation.  There is observation of one thing at a time, what is happening in life, we have to go deeper, next time that ad comes, then watch it carefully, he hangs up the phone, then he says to his boss, okay, this is also okay, this is also okay, is it yours? keep the phone  He put it on your mouth, which one did you give to him? What is going on? Whatever is going on, take it from there. Where are we going? What is happening? We do not complete even one item. So many people go beyond that that they  It becomes doubtful whether we got that work done or not. Chandrayaan was completely successful this time. Be quiet, a little graceful, and yes, the world is applauding, take it, it spread like this, and that video of mine was also made earlier in that. inside him  Meaning, you can see anything and sir, did the rest see it or did they leave it, their behavior is not like this, where did they bring it from, who were the people, who had prepared this, then the public is reacting right and the leaders. Speeches were coming from inside him, it is very good, so this we need to come down as a country, it is fine, this much we need to come down as a country, this is what is called a match, because if nothing great is happening in personal life, then every event is like this. Nichod feels like following a film star, his picture becomes a hit, if nothing else, Virat Kohli gets his 50th century, and if nothing else, someone else's child becomes that cricketer's life. Celebrate, at least some good news will come. Hey, see in your life, Vishwa Guru, Vishwa Guru, this is India, India is the people of India, so it has to be so that we are separate from our country, we are the country, all together and we all crazy  Keep doing booze type activities and then who is becoming the world guru, that is, who among us is becoming it? If we want to become one, then we will have to do some Guruji like behavior, otherwise if we want to become the world's guru, then someone becomes less by keeping his name.  Have you made the channel Guruji from Gurugram, have you become Guruji? You will have to do some Guruji-worthy activities, you will have to talk a little, you will have to do some work that requires whipping, it is possible that someone may feel that he should come and tell the truth because  Coming and telling the truth to the country, telling the truth to the people, telling the bitter truth is not an easy thing, no one likes it, even the one who is able to understand, does n't like it every day, that's why I don't even make these videos every day, and very simply.  And I make it with Wang, don't stress about this thing, but next time someone makes a fuss, be it your neighbor, your relative, uncle, uncle, uncle, any relative in your family group who is angry over this.  It happens that they sent a video and you did not show that much anger over it and you did not say that yes uncle, you have forwarded it to 25 people, very yes I agree, this video is like that, a lesson should be taught, everyone should be told like this.  If it should happen, then check the meaning every time because he is running the narrative. The more foolish he is, the more he is running the narrative because it has come into everyone's hands, it has great power, so as long as he says no, there is an English proverb, isn't it?  The Truth by the time The truth was tying its shoelaces The lies had traveled five times the world And the lies had traveled the world five times While the truth was going on To get out And today, after one hour After anything, it  Time fish, useless useless things are hyped up and it seems that we don't know what will happen due to this, the country has wasted 45 days, that is, a Bigg Boss was running on national TV where  There was a cricketer, today it became his century, today it became his, today he got out, today it became his 50th, today it became his, look at the statistics of all the cricketers of India and not just of today, look of the last 15-20 years. Right from Sachin Tendulkar.  Yes great and look at the Australians, they are sitting with six World Cups, their Travis Head is not to be seen every year, one of them comes and leaves after doing something, so it shows about the country, doesn't it?  That here we run after individual specific individual glory, when the country runs after individual glory and sacrifices only the individuals, then that country does not become so great. You become great only when you concentrate on your work, sacrifice it.  There is no point in offering it to you, Idol ji and those who debate so much inside that it is right and that energy has to be conserved and your  You have to work in life and take yourself forward. If your net worth is 50 lakhs total and it is 70 lakhs, then it has increased by 40%. Now that he came in two years, your net worth has increased by 20%. This is yours. He is your direct influence in GD growth and the growth of the country is going on at around 6.6.7 per cent, so if all the people of India think that they have to increase their GDP by 10 per cent then every person.  Imagine, if someone increases it even more than that, the country's GDP will increase by 10%, then it will automatically increase. Focus is on me. This is what I want to tell you through this video: Focus on yourself and these big bands are playing all around, what is life beyond that?  There will be no guarantee in the marriage, like I told you people that there is no guarantee in the marriage that if the band plays so much, the marriage will go well and the marriages that took place during the time of Corona will break up, poor people, only 10 people came.  Only five people had come, Pandit ji had also come sitting in a suit. Photographs had been taken. I couldn't tell who was washed and who was dusty and who was the father of the scumbag. All of them looked the same in those photographs. Those marriages also went well.  So be aware of what is happening thank you very much"

    "title": "What BJP Should Do Now To Win Haryana Elections ？ [lbd5rKewYmk].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, Haryana BJP will talk again about what BJP should do now in Haryana elections. I like the very good thing about BJP that they accept the ideas, suggestions and advice.  Will go especially for their own benefit, that of the public is still a matter of later but for their benefit, whatever is told is done immediately, so now I want to advise the BJP people again and end  Before anyone tells me whether you are a devotee or that, there is a video of mine, episode number 100, in which I have told about my idol ji so that we should come to taste and see how the public makes the politician dance, the common man which I am.  When we make politicians dance and have fun in politics then we will get power. Power does not come like this, you like this, you like this, so now I am going to tell the people of BJP because there is a lot of fight going on for tickets. I am giving a clarity in the distribution of Haryana elections, especially that whatever ticket is to be given, give it as per the family principle. Do n't be shy at all and do not be nervous at all. Yes, the top leader has said before about a lot of familyism and so on, but brother.  The most important work is the biggest religion of any political party. To win the election, if you have to give ticket to someone's child, give it to Rao, give the ticket to Inderjit ji's child, Rao, whatever is yours.  It is Dharamveer ji, it has to be given to his children, whose children are asking for it, Ram Vilas ji's children, give it to everyone, what will happen like us on YouTube or like me, after giving advice here, after 10 days when the ticket will be known, they will make a video that Look at the face of BJP, they speak like this and see what difference it makes that they should get bigger seats, that is important, so the first thing is that the winning candidate or the chance of winning candidate should be given a higher priority. Don't get involved in moral science, you will lose the election, that is one second thing, I had made a video on Ad Ring, the English of Ad Ring would be like this, then the views would be less because it becomes a little sophisticated intellectual, I would have made that video by clicking on it. Jaan pooch chem, many people say that I don't click bait, they are like that, brother, he is not like that, it means I do n't take him to the level of Ram Se Brothers film, at least I take him to a little level.  If you are an intellectual type, then there are some words in the topics that become such that not many people enter into it, this is also a fact, okay, but despite this, I want you all to increase the number of subscribers and like minded. Do you think I am the intellectual type? Send this to those people. Another thing BJP should do clearly is that they should not ride two boats. Jats are not yours, yes, Jats are not yours, Jats are like the Muslims of Haryana, they voted for you.  If you don't do it, then why do you have to wear this mask? Bat openly, you BJP people are advised to do very badly in rural areas, what is Harrogate, lose by one vote, lose by 10,000 votes, lose by 50,000 votes, lose the election.  Defeat happens whether as they say, lose by 100 runs or lose by one run but defeat is defeat. Concentrate on your city thing. I will make a more in depth video on why I think that.  I will give a hint as to why it is very good in dispassionate politics. Urbanization BJP is the party of cities. Unfortunately, what did BJP do? They could not make the urban people happy even in the matter of infrastructure like Gurgaon. The population of Gurgaon is not pro Congress in any way.  Gurgaon is a Yadav belt in the default setting. Gurgaon people are mostly like that because I also say here, most of the trend is towards BJP. Resentment is disputer, wash and deep.  Water and the car got stuck and water flowed in the flyover. Is there water and pot holes under the underpass? The public is unhappy, but please convince them, get anything done. GMD etc. are engaged, brother, create an atmosphere when the pot holes are filled.  If you had delayed the election a little more, you would have forgotten all these rains, people don't remember anything for more than 10 days. If you had delayed it a little more, it would have been four days. You followed my advice about the holidays, that's a good thing.  So, you will save it on your clothes, but now it will become difficult to hold elections again and again, but brother, you could have easily been late, you could have easily been late, people would have forgotten, had the festival season come, you would have cleaned it and made it shine, but you don't have to work hard because look. Now some Hindu-Muslim incident has happened here, which place in Haryana has this happened here? Yes, from here, yes, by doing such elections, you will win. You will become a party of clear cut cities and urban people and all your Brahmins and Baniyas, Punjabis, who are your core vote bank. Give them clear cut messaging. This half- baked messaging will not work. Now you say it openly, friend, that's why I am Guruji, I will give two-three advices to Congress also here so that it does not seem that I will give it only in this.  Congress people are also listening, those who love and love Congress have to give advice to Congress so that the match is good, democracy and our democracy becomes strong only when both the parties are exactly like this, brother.  You do that, you do it, then if this becomes their setting, then it is the public's loss, yes brother, this time you do it like this, next time we have to make our work tight, then BJP people have a lot of chances of you winning in GT Road. Concentrate a lot on those seats. As soon as you leave Panchkula, from there go to Ambala, then Kurukshetra, Karnal, Panipat, Sonipat, then Faridabad, Gurgaon. From here, apply full force, then Rewari, then Mahendragarh and that side. Put full force here, put full force here and work in such a way that these Lok Dal people and the rest of JJP and this vote-biting party, give them a lot of support. There is one more thing the Jats can do, now BJP will get a little bit of that advice.  Contrarily but still the BJP people are wise enough to understand that there is a psychology among the Jats that if Congress is not giving them ticket in Choudhra or you make them a heavy district by taking them from Panna Pramukh, right?  Brother, one influential Jat brother will take our 10-12 thousand votes. Now you tell me, no, you are a cunning man, what are you doing, brother, he is nothing but an idiot, you have to tell both the things, which of the things do you believe in us?  Will accept, it's okay, BJP people believe, they seem to believe one after the other, so on top of that, there is no need to make too much noise, no one feels bad about getting a ticket, no one feels bad about getting a ticket, no one feels bad about elections. No one feels bad about fighting. In the locality around you, in front and back, in the colony, in some part of the city, Chaudhary Haat. No one feels bad. If a photo is taken, it becomes a ticket. By doing like this, someone like this with Kamal. Who wants to get a photo like this?  If you do n't like it, then do that kind of politics, then openly assert yourself, change all the tickets, BJP has one of its sitting MLAs, like these are Anil and Ji, it is okay, they do n't even know that they will get the ticket, the bad leaders will probably give it, don't give them. Don't give tickets to people like these, who talk too much like this, the public is well fed up, it's okay, they did some Gabbar Gabbar, nothing came out by doing this, it's okay and you people also know what it is and what kind of case it is.  Hey, bring some new leaders, some good doctor who has a very good reputation, some good professor, any good person who has genuine integrity and is popular within his area, I am fine here.  I am not suggesting that you should give me a ticket, many people will say that you have to take it because I want to tell here that my aim and ambition in life is very big, do not limit me to MLA elections and this state election, many people are like this. You say, you want to take its ticket, if you ever make a video like this, you want to take Congress's ticket, even if I am speaking, then tell me, this is what I clarify, because when there is a doubt in the mind of my subscriber, I am a Guruji, I am a man.  So I understand brother, I am a very high thing, okay, here we are not interested, if the ecosystem will be right, the thinking will be right, then if any wish comes, things will be fine and when you can influence up to that level in life, then Chanakya.  If Chandragupta happens then anyone will come, the problem remains that the one who explains it, the one who establishes it, the one who sets the weather for farming, the one who prepares the land before sowing the crop, the one who puts emphasis on it.  Life is lost, after that the work gets done. The advice to Congress is that in this, Congress will remain a party of Jats, hence they have made a very good start by Shailja ji doing that so that Dalit angle is also included in it, which is a master stroke.  According to me, because Jat plus Dalit is clearly BJP, look at it mathematically but it does not happen like this, not all Jats do it, okay, we count like this that there are Jats on 28 and how many Dalits on 19 20.  It is 48 but this has already happened, so that's it, not like this, not all Dalits will do it, Chandrashekhar will also come, sister will also give some money, will give something to BJP too, Dalits too have different types of hair, not all are different.  This is also a fact, so Congress does not have to rely on these two communities. Even if there is Jat leadership in Congress, which we know, Bhupendra Singh Hooda ji and Deepender are one.  If there is leadership, then they have to show that brother, I am not the leader of Jats only, I am the leader of Haryana. They have always tried but still they always say that it is Jat land. I am a Jat land and it feels very bad to do this land.  If the name of the country and province should be taken, then if people start talking like this about the communities, then it becomes the same thing for the country, take out Rohtak, Jhajjar, Kuhana and Sonipat belt. Bhiwani of 50 km etc., I have to become a leader above this, I am not seeing that much, I am not seeing Congress leaders coming to Gurgaon and trying, I don't know what is the matter, what is the setting here, what is the matter, what is internal because sometimes what happens.  Isn't politics such a thing that you don't know if you will get more than 50 MLAs, so many times you want to get only 48 seats, then that kind of internal politics becomes very bad.  Many times, because the internal dynamics are like this, as a party, Congress is playing the game a little smart so far, but it should not get trapped in overconfidence, then if Congress reduces its fighting amongst itself a little and does not show that it is only for the Jats,  It is a party and everyone's party and it will take care of everyone so it is an advantage. This is an election for Congress to lose. This is an election for Congress to lose. This is an election for Congress and they can lose. Like they say, it is a match for India.  To lose like this, it is about that, please share, like, thank you very much."

    "title": "What Does Success Of Gadar 2 Show ？ [_meqyK5mTgw].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, we will discuss episode 3 Gadar movie, Gadar 2, what is the success of Gadar, you tell us about the task, we will discuss it, it is a good movie, okay, it is our entertainment, what is there to discuss, it is very important to discuss, the one who is a politician, he is very careful, I have seen.  I have also seen it and you also have to watch from further, my audience will know which movies are doing well and where they are doing well, who is watching, what is the reaction of Gadar now.  So close to Rs 250 crores has been made, the money will go further soon, how much will it earn, maybe if it reaches Rs 300 crores, then it has become a super hit picture, those who have done it well, they are not telling, there are many like Sunny Paji's, so more later.  The role used to come and go, but there is more going on in the factory generation steel and small lions, like if you see when the numbers of the film industry go, then there are different things in it, they have their territories and that. Territories are not spoken according to status, they speak differently, what do they say, you have to write, meaning you will say something, it has a different name and our Delhi circuit is different, I don't think so it is anything in South whereas the movies of South are so  Here, money is a work thing, you know South India is not seeing it at all, they have no zinc vision, it is still there within 20-203, now you see that hand pump story and this little story and us. Let's see, today we are still getting the taste of 'n country' that if one world is one class and there are 200 children in the class, then it is okay if you put 200 countries, there will be 204, but if you put 200 then there are 200 children, now we have any standing in it.  Today in 2023, we are still competing with the child in different parameters and the child is failing and is becoming very happy by showing it to me again and again. Got a higher number than you, scored more runs than you, you have to make a movie, show you a confirmed station, you have to show bloodshed, you have to show emotions, how will the movie be made, why did that happen, where, how did it happen, our brother Shahid, and many others are our own. Weller also showed very good work, this is just a fictitious story that even now people have gone there, Sunny ji goes there, you don't come to the Parliament as much as the people of Pakistan, their relief, the effect of life.  No one questions but we take it as nationalism. ₹ 300 were given to Chillam Chilli for Chillam Chilli, Chillam Chilli is sunny and nationalism is done today, this year's quota is over, which one will come next year, she will come on 26th January, make it over Balakot. Friends, the atmosphere should be created for the fighter picture, once Babu gives it somehow, then don't be stupid enough to make such noise that if it is necessary, give it, tell me first, yes.  We will give you health and education. Why don't you ask? Talk about everything, this will happen, this will happen, this will happen, the syllabus of education will change someday, our system will be overhauled, no committee is even thinking of changing education.  That committee is sitting, make a change here, make a change there, make a little change like this, it is the whole overall system, it is definitely an education system, why is it not discussed, why does no one discuss it?  Why doesn't nationalism become nationalism by holding a good job and earning good money for good work and paying good taxes? Gadar, you still showed us like this and it is not a matter of great happiness that so many people are getting excited by this thing. Someone else?  The picture would have been full of entertainment, it would have been different and Rocky Rani, there is no nationalism in it, it would have been understandable in it too, we are seeing the changes taking place in the society, Karan Johar's picture which was once happy, sad and family has now become family.  Jai Bachchan ji, she is controlling me like this and she has always been there for me. Controlling gender parents, atheist parents, those who sleep with their elders, that thing is very welcome, this is the fun, yes again we have made Pakistan like this, it is a lot of fun.  Next year we will meet again on 15th August, again by doing something like this, now I had told this last time too on a different channel, otherwise, who is telling Pakistan to love, is indifference a thing too, is power, hatred is the opposite of love.  when does anyone hate  If there is a cloud in love, if love is in hatred, then there is relief. Indifference is the same today. Today is the country of India of 2023. They should be you. Why are you fussing over the match? The one who is defeated and has no energy, and has no time. And there is no point in watching or understanding anything less. Let the picture remain a picture. Emotions are there only. That's what is being said. The politician is the only one who is seeing, brother, which emotion is that and how he has to play his game.  Everything is being watched, which game will be played for which audience, what do you think, IT cells have been formed for all these, trends are being monitored, discussions are being made accordingly, everything will be decided only by us, the public.  Will the public decide? Poor general public, you cannot decide anything, everything is decided by you. I tell you this as I do not give consultation now, no, I used to give it to mothers who used to be worried and used to say at some time.  Child Mine is not drinking milk, you must have also seen it, those who are mothers and those who have children, you must have seen that many times small children do not drink milk, so what is your method for that? If you have to feed him milk, then at the time of feeding you go ahead of him. Keep two cups, one made of red Mickey Mouse type and one of that and some other download but Necessarily, this is not here, so you are feeling that you will disassemble, you cannot disassemble anything sir, everything gets disassembled.  from you and this  Regarding all the things, like we are consultants like us, whose mind has gone, here too there is consultation, there too there is consultation, now we are explaining the batting from both the sides, now now you are also being told that it is free here, brother, it is not like that.  You are being decided, what is being done, it is an environment, Allah, every faction will make every effort to build the setting from their side, in the future you will see more movies will come, now Veer Savarkar will come.  Then keep discussing about it, who was fine, good, very good, great fight, made amazing, Inception is this D world, you can do whatever you want in life, but whatever you want in life, you cannot do this. What would be the word offered? You are made to like something, what you like and want in you, good but you can't want and sorry, you can't desire what you want, you desire. Do you understand the confusion? If you are facing a lot of confusion, then you can drop off the third episode, it is not necessary from the channel, here it is taking the right brain of the person to a higher level, now he enjoys learning and understanding more.  Because if we become so intelligent then what will we do, what will the politicians do? Otherwise, they are very worried when the public actually tweets like a servant, but till now they do not do so, because till the time a servant asks for votes, he has understood that he has to ask for such a thing. Becoming a Politician and Being One Ise Note in Easy Think Subscribe on YouTube One has to beg for the bus 171800 ₹ 5000 Aise Bada Do Bada Do, I am still asking, brothers and sisters, please subscribe and Bada Do, it takes a lot of time to ask, why would I ask for attitude?  If I don't ask for it, I don't get it. At night, when the child is sleeping, the mother does not wake him up and feed him milk. She gives him milk even after having bread.  If you have n't listened then it's good that if you are crying then you will have to turn away, then go and drink milk, mother, now this is the strength of a politician, so interesting things will come to you in an interesting way, keep enjoying the episode, thank you very much."

    "title": "What Every Generation Needs To Do For Their Children ？ [ri78OZZTlQY].en",
    "content": "The biggest problem with the middle class particular is that we are very very socially conscious of our status, what is my status, as you said, there is pressure on the people who belong to the lower income group or lower class as they are called.  There is no need to do something very excellent like supposing lets, if we take the example of a watchman, if we take the example of a watchman, then if his son  If he becomes a watchman or something above that, then it is a plus for him, it is fine if as we were talking about, he has studied till 5th class, if the son studies 12th and does graduation then it is a big thing, he has achieved something in life but middle class.  What is the problem with class that our parents are educated, they are doing a white collar job, some of their parents are engineers, some are doctors, some are doing some jobs, so what is the burden on you.  The minimum that you have to achieve in life is that your car will start from there, so you have a lot of pressure in a way whether I have to go above this or I have to start from here, I will not go down and start by doing the job of a watchman. One point concept is Mansabdari system. It is very important to understand that in the old times during the time of Mughals, they used to choose that brother, you will become my Mansabdar, you select your tax, five-four horses and army but what.  What ever you will earn in your life time What ever you will do once you go you die now the soul will give that mansabdari to anyone It will not transform to your kid Nepotism will not mean yes, churches will also talk about nepotism sometimes but yes no  If he became very happy then it is a different matter because he was a king, but in today's time, how does it transfer to a lot of people who are struggling?  The children were their parents who were doing this type of job, government job or corporate job. Even if you become the Cabinet Secretary of India, your child cannot become an IAS on the fact that just because my father is Cabinet Secretary, you will have to clear M.  And after clearing it, he will get the same post as before, that of SDM, whatever he gets, ca n't he claim that if I belong to the Cabinet Secretary, then I will be directly appointed as Joint Secretary, so father said that  3040 years of work has got no meaning to the child actually other than that because of that re and salary and money the child was provided education a food and khana and security other than that it is of no consequence where as if I am a lawyer  If Ram Jett Milani ji was a big lawyer then Mahesh Jett Milani hu son din  Start from there Chandrachur ji is CGI, his father was also very big, so he also got the name from where he gets it, datchi because those who don't get it, only they cry if the father will not, now if my youtube2 jam can also push that much If I have a shop, someone opened the shop and says, Shamdi Hatti 186, go to Khan Market, this is the first shop, okay, Shamdi Hatti 186, that is in 186, just now.  2024 is going on, so that shop is definitely running, isn't the one who is running it, his client is the tail, I don't know if Lahore has shifted from there in the old times, then it will be used by the next generation, otherwise, will it be of some tea vendor or someone else?  Give me that shop of yours or not, don't do nepotism, you tell me, first of all, in all the times, a farmer's son becomes a farmer, this is not called nepotism because when ever anything is not very sexy and good in that. Not nepotism, nepotism has to be in politics and it has to be in the film world that these people, hey brother, I am making my child's film with my own money, what is your problem, don't come to see it, no, why are you not giving a chance to others?  Why should I give a chance to others, I will give it to others, I will give it as per my wish, if there is any meaning, it means basic understanding, people do not understand, there is so much nepotism in the middle class, you can Don't believe it because you are saying the same thing, you are saying the opposite, so what is nepotism basically, that someone is not worthy of someone, push him in that direction just because you have the power, this is what nepotism is in simple Hindi, not that you have the power.  You don't have that much intelligence or you got advantage because what ever you took advantage of father, tell me if Shahrukh Khan will teach Suhana Hu is better than him too Teach Right is also sitting with jeans, there is coaching, there is also network and everything, many people say, many people say, man, Suhana Khan has gone in this picture, she was played by Archie or someone, okay, she had children in it, many people, this is nepotism.  Hey brother, that picture was made because one went, otherwise the picture would not have been made and you should be grateful that the picture was made because the person taking the photo was the photographer, the editor, the film maker, that normal man.  It is good for all of them, if there is a wedding worth Rs 1200 crore or a function is held somewhere in Jamnagar, then that ecosystem earns a lot of money. You will tell him, what is this display of wealth? What is this display of wealth? That money was from that family.  Do n't share out of your pocket, you had to distribute it just like that, why just like that? If I paid the flower to the flower seller and paid the cook for cooking, that skill set is the same.  So why was there no free fund, how will productivity increase in Batu country? Then everyone will sit like this, I will keep working and you and I will keep distributing, brother, the one who came and sang the song got the money, the one who installed the lights, the one who drove the car there must have also got it.  He was running it, he too must have got it, there must have been 100 Hajj activities, everyone shared everything, it is easy to call it nepotism because a middle class is stuck in very loose type C jobs. And their children are not getting any benefit from that job and the rest of the children are getting benefit, so that is why you just debate about nepotism or do not allow us to enter, then those who talk about nepotism as king, then brother Chanak Chanakya said Chandragupta.  They broke the Nand dynasty in Magadha and created their own, then their nepotism started and they said that the king's son should become a king, why should you go and kill the king and become a politician's politician? Why should you become one, stand up and win, who has forbidden you, luck was not with you, you were not born in that house and if you don't want to work hard, then things are achieved only by luck and hard work, if there was no luck, then hard work.  do it"

    "title": "What Have  Politicians Learnt From Winston Churchill ？ [vYsqgNHU2bE].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, what smart politicians learn from Churchland, they can never imagine that playing out was so easy and what was it that the person who was in bad condition of Britain, you know that Hitler was winning everywhere, so Battle of Britain took place and England was saved from it.  It came out okay and won but the British defeated the Prime Minister who won the war. The British have a lot of brains. At that time he was the athlete for sure. Okay, they chose another Prime Minister.  He did what he felt that Churchill was a very good war time Prime Minister but then now the war is over now there is no danger now there is no such issue now we have to rebuild now this has to be done so he changed  OP because politicians learn from politicians, common man cannot learn from politicians because politicians are smart, they too must have some syllabus, someone must be teaching them, they too must have some party. Ideology and discussion must have been off course, that is not in school and not in college. People all over the world have learned about these things. In India, people have learned that danger is never far away. This is the message. If people think of you as one type, then if you  Said that yes, now there is no need and the fact is that now this world over is getting conflated in every way, this has been done there, this has been done there, due to globalization, now we are going into our local type, what used to be before.  One  Country used to meet with 10 people in a way, now everyone has their own relationships like in schools, colleges or anywhere, there is no 'my friend, this is my friend, that' thing, now it is not like this that there is no account of the group, I, we, this and this.  And according to the group, we will gather and we will be 10 friends and 10 will go to party, so it is individual, whether we drank samosas with him, ate cigarette with him, smoked a movie with him, went to watch a movie with him, I am telling you something very deep.  You people will enjoy understanding the geopolitical things, you will also enjoy understanding the political things and as a voter, you will also know what to do, so you have to see one thing and I want to tell you, you guys should also tell us about that in the next six months. Even at personal level in the country, people are uncertain that the result of the election will not come till uncertainties because we think, I too think and you also think that it is settled, brother, what is the result going to be, it seems that yes, it will be the same.  It will come, but despite that, uncertainties are creeping in your life. Which career do you have to choose? You have to buy a plot flat, you have to invest, you have to put it in the share market, you have to take something out, you have to do something, there are uncertainties in your life, elections should happen.  Then I will decide even though it has nothing to do with this thing. If something is happening in your identification life then it is anxiety but in such an environment of the country there is anxiety that what is this?  There will be so much anxiety, like India will win the World Cup or will it not win or something like that, there is not so much anxiety in that because it is an event, it will happen in a week, it is okay, it will win, it will not win, it remains to be seen, okay, then who will come?  It is like Kumbh Mela, it will come in 12 years. It will come in three, three, four years. Okay, then the story will come. Okay, but this is happening in the elections because what they always say is that when Shikanji is made, if you have seen lemon.  Water is mixed in it like this, it rotates round and round, water rotates like this, it is okay and it is getting mixed, lemon and that, you add sugar too, like this, if that thing is not stopped and that  If this continues then if they are its particles then they will never get peace, sometimes at some stage then keep it and because that water is always said that if you take water like this then you should not drink it immediately. Anyway, I am telling you about health.  say it or whatever Call it astrology or whatever you want brother, when you do water then keep it quietly and it will calm down like this after some time, then pour it and then drink your Shikanji, it is fine but no one should rotate it.  Keep rotating like this, it will keep rotating and if you believe that it is inside it, then someone has taken this spoon, someone or many people have taken it, that spoon never lets you stop and keeps you saturated in life. How to keep it saturated  You have a timeline, even if the video gets a little long, then understand what they are understanding and what these politicians have learned. Look, my topic was something else, I am taking it here beautifully, this is so that not many people come after seeing the topic.  It's not about making these videos viral, it's about engaging the person who is of intellectual and intellectual level, because what happens when the opposition in the country becomes very weak and not because it does n't create an uproar.  There is no noise, they are making noise, but there is no strength, there is no logic, there is no logic, there is no brain, so the intellectuals have to rise up and it has always been across the world, I am an intellectual, I want the intellectuals to come here with me too. Such people will rip, tear, destroy, it is useless, why is he talking about your bread, clothes, house, if you are not sorted out in life then you are not worthy of becoming an intellectual, now you tell people that you are classist, this is us poor people. No, if you are poor then please, I did not say this earlier but I have to say this because I have seen many times that if you are poor then it is not there because now if you are poor then give you something and give you something in the thought process.  It can be done, you will not be able to engage here, I am not only for the rich people, no, I am not even for the rich, but the one who has risen a little from the poverty line, has food, clothes and a house, he has his own and he does not have to depend on me. someone give me a job and do something like this This is a channel for those people who do that, otherwise what point of view, feeling, whatever thing I want to discuss with you, now we are talking which can be discussed with a very full stomach, it is proposed to talk about big things. These are big things, that is, if someone is not satisfied now and why would he participate in the stock, then the only message is that you should understand that I am telling you the method on social media, you have limited time in life, you have to give these so called facts.  and so much from things  These people will saturate you that you don't have any way to verify it and that happens a lot; there is an emphasis on verifying the truth to an extent; even in the Parliament, things can be said as if they are true but not the whole truth. Like Ashwathama died and if he was not a man then he was an elephant and if he was not a man then he was a horse and if he shot an arrow then he was a man and not an elephant. This statement was correct. Someone also says Air Force.  Did you ever go to the East and do this, your Air Force dropped bombs, it was not told that the militants had captured Air Force officers, that was your system, that was to show that this statement was given to show that it is not a man but an elephant, but it was not told.  But who will check that this is true? Yes, even if you do it, it will come out, but reading that article and researching what the circumstances were, then whenever old things are talked about and something about them is said, it is a fact, it is a fact.  It is a fact only then you see that in my across the channels facts do not tell anything. Talk about facts. Facts are nothing. Look at the trends. Look at the sentiments. Look at the facts. In the pursuit of facts, you are fooled by the facts only because when you have no  Such a thing should be started on this thing which is a fact and then a story should be told beyond that that since this is true then this is implicit whereas the  The actual crux of the matter is that this and this are not linked as they say cause and causality. One fact is that the sun rises. The second fact is that the [ __ ] also crows. The third thing is that the [ __ ] crows when the sun rises. But  There is actually no connection between the cock's cuckoo and the sun rising. If the [ __ ] forgets to cuckoo and falls asleep, the sun will still rise, but every time this  This thing is happening in the real place ok this sun is rising every day and murga is doing cookdu someone it and making videos and doing fact check and every 30 days this thing is happening is this case ko to aap shuri bol doge because this is very common sense  Yes, this is very common sense, you will also say, yes Guruji, you are right about the chicken and its relation.  No, but many such things are happening in which you are not able to catch this thing and to catch this thing requires time, energy, effort and no one is required to tell this story and one person is sitting at the computer and gets salary of Rs. 1.5 lakh.  Now if someone becomes a person who keeps telling all this then he will say that this is not a fact, you are true to it, you say this, if this is anything that no one can stand against it, then you align yourself with it.  add up  So if you add this to this, then now this is called something, that is, this is called something and this cannot be called anything because it is a fact and you silently joined here, you took ownership, so here I would like to say that it is very old.  Kavat hai Nand is not Magadh Nand is not Magadh Why did you say it Who said it When did you say it How did you say it And you work a little hard This is a channel with hard work This is a channel with higher order thinking If you understand even in this much then it's good Even if you don't understand then it's good  Google it and you will understand it. If you don't understand anything at all then you are on the wrong channel. You do n't have to waste your time coming here again. If you understand something then this channel and these things are for those who do higher thinking. Higher order thinking is not that this is happening but what is happening by this happening is that higher order thinking is this is happening now this is happening and this is happening now this is happening and this is happening now and this is happening and  who are very smart Those who want to get this done, do this, do the butterfly effect also, if you want to get this done, then if you want to get this done, do something directly, then don't make any noise, then it will be done, now by doing this, this will happen, by doing this, this will happen, by doing this, this will happen  It will happen and then ultimately this will happen, so many steps have been put in it that the normal person who is at 99.9, the intellectual and intelligent person, the thinking individual is less, it cannot be more and there is no time.  Because the person who has to pay for the food and clothes in the house, who has to go to the job for two hours, all these things, then there is a need to pause in life to think about it, as if you are sitting in the comfort of your own home wearing a tie and not having to go anywhere or come back.  He has time to do all this, he doesn't want to impress anyone, he will keep talking about depression, he will keep talking about food, he will keep talking about job, he will keep talking about religion, he will keep talking about reservation and this one, now this leader should be arrested.  If he goes then the government will run from jail to him Or we have taken the contract from outside to drive you from wherever you want. If you can drive, then drive whatever has already been done. Forced engagement has already been done and is being done, so this is what you have to see and do not get trapped.  No, if you want to become an intellectual, now you tell me, what will be the biggest benefit as the number of intellectuals increases, every person like me, through our medium, I also have some 17,18,000 subscribers. 10, 15, 20 thousand people can definitely see that it is possible to move ahead and if we see, then these numbers of thinking individuals will keep increasing and if we have to take the country forward then we have to think ourselves, brother, are we being suggested or are you understanding?  That brother, you think only this, this is the syllabus, every time I come, I do something inside you, you do, you think, you see, you tell, you tell me, then this is the thought process when you look at what is shown in the media and is being told.  Because newspapers can lie, social media can lie, news agencies can lie, something is going on everywhere, the reality is something else and it will be known only when you first stop listening to them and see what the story is and yourself.  You will think and question yourself, otherwise he is the forward of the university, that is your truth, this happened or did not happen, this is not done like this, this is not done, why did it happen, how did it happen, when did it happen, where was it done, and there is also how, one, many things happen. What is that, let me tell you one more good thing, everything like how do I show you something, okay this is the background or it is white, okay so this is context capture text, you are understanding now this is a little clarity visible in this.  Now you can see the fingers of the hand, it is looking a little better, according to me, now if I do it like this, then something else is visible, so this background is context compatible, but by changing this, the thing changes, you understand.  At that time, you used to call me your wife, in the old fights, you did like this, she did like this, you did that, what was the time, what was the reason, what was the reason at that time, maybe we were poor, maybe it was to save money, so M, it was not this.  To make you feel bad, now that we have become rich, we don't think like this anymore, so it is not that we humans have become better and at that time humans were bad, at that time the circumstances were like this, now the circumstances are like this, now people have become like that.  Contact has been made, but it is important to tell this thing selectively. I repeatedly say that in our country, making a fresh idiot is much easier than convincing that yes, I am an idiot or I have become an idiot, no, you will not believe it, no matter how much you explain it, see your You are being made a fool, you have become a fool, if you do n't agree, then what is the easy task when you don't agree? Making a fresh fool is easy when it is the first to make a fresh fool.  The thing is also remunerative, meaning there is money in it because what would happen if I tell you AS Guruji, I am a great man in my life and I prove to you that brother, you are an idiot and yours was created and not now.  It is being prepared for many days and this thing will prove to you but you will get a bitter taste that you will not like me next time because whenever this comes, he declares me a fool and goes away, brother.  That guy is good, this is a truth of life, any man will tell you the truth and the truth will seem bitter and no matter how much bitter thing a person eats, many people write in the comments that Guruji is very right, it is bitter but it is the truth and once it feels like this. Yes brother, it is fine, but he will not come again and again. He will come every time. Every time he will have to eat bitter food, he will feel like eating sweet pills too. There are more people who give sweet pills and there are more people who want sweet pills. It is bitter, but it is neem or bitter gourd, these things improve health by improving blood and eating too much sweet, you know it leads to diabetes, but you still get diabetes and then after  Then we go to eat that now it has happened, so if somehow we can control it, then we do this, brother, look a little in advance, this is the message at the thinking level, now people ask me, what is the M of your channel because now till which  If you have seen so many videos then I have not been able to express my love for any party as an idol of mine. The one who is boarding an individual bus says that you are this, you are this, my change happens on every video which one.  This shows it self shows that I do not have any affiliation with any party and if you watch some videos completely then the party's attitude changes in itself, sometimes they say this, sometimes they say this, that shows that.  My work here is not to promote any particular party, it is not to promote any particular ideology, it is important to tell my M here and it is important to tell it at the end because for those people who are watching the video till here, only that is my work.  The audience is not the people on the boarding bus, here I am, I want to change the way India thinks and when you start thinking smartly then the politicians are already smart, the day they come to know like the British are very smart.  The day they came to know that now our loss is going to melt, they got up and went away. In 1945, when there was a rebellious program in the Navy, a lot of things were going on even before that, but they released that this is the army we have kept and When they became aware of what we get done, and those who came for IA's trials, that was the last thing when they released that brother, now bring the commission, it is now not in our control.  To control because at the peak of their population Britishers were not more than 9 lakh in our country. 9 lakh means there were only so many fair skinned foreigners and there were crores of Indians here, meaning you think of this. 10 means out of 60 to 70 Indians, one was fair. Sometimes they could have been thrown out just by slapping, but if you think logically then one person means that one is fair, everyone should come, let's come, apply one by one and go away, it was not like that.  Why was it not because we were under their control but when the realization came that now it has happened, it takes a lot of time to bring that realization, there is a lot of contribution, I do not want to let down any freedom fighter, any politician, any big politician. Everyone was being awakened and they started working slowly and gradually and kept doing it, kept doing it, if God is smart then our politicians are also smart, when they will come to know that the public is very big. Will be intelligent, intelligent is asking questions and I go to make it evasive, I speak, discuss it, say no, leave it aside, tell me this, don't discuss this here and there, tell me why the caravan was looted, tell this, why not this?  It is not happening, all that is fine, that is good, you have done well, so when the teacher checks the paper, the questions which are fine, it is fine, where there is a mistake, it is pointed out, ask why this mistake has happened, find out here. Number  Why is it not important, you are True and False, you have written half of the questions of one mark each and here there were 10 questions of 10 marks each. If you are not able to solve them, then your marks will be given in the same way. Teacher, my five True and False. Hey brother, there were 10 true and false ones, if you made everyone true then in probability five became right, then only a little has been declared, now tell here, there are five for everyone.  Donkey's have also come and anyone else's have come, tell me here, I will check your paper here, it is difficult for the public to reach this level, it is not going to happen so quickly, but if even 5 or 4 become a ne, the same is very good.  There is no need for everyone to be there. There is no need for everyone to be there because this pull will take them. There should be one Naa in every family. The population of every family is 10 to 20 people, which is a big family. Big family means mother-in-law, father-in-law, grandparents too, grandparents.  Grandmother, father, mother, uncle, aunt, uncle, uncle means a family, if you call it family type, then there are not so many families, the population of India is 14 crores, but the family is only 6 crores, the family which is called big family is six seven crores, it should be only six crores.  Everyone needs one, that's the only aim, the work is to reach 6 crore people, the work is to reach 6 crore people, the work is to educate them, so if you want to support this campaign, then you are a subscriber.  If you don't speak, we will not grow. Say such a thing, we will not grow. Tell us what happens with this. We grow slowly only. There is organic growth, there is little growth through advertisement. Get people to advertise through advertisement and then they will come again and see it at the thought process level.  Now you have to join, you cannot join by going out and holding a rally. Just like you did a rally, they will say, you want to become a politician, why do you want to come, I can't become one. I don't want to be a politician. I do n't like any politician of any party. I do n't like any politician of any party. I don't know all the politicians of any party. I like this politician of this party. I like this politician of this party. I like this of this party.  This thing tastes good, it tastes like this, it tastes like this, now it cannot be mixed, brother, I drank pineapple juice by mixing it with seasonal juice and pomegranate or dal, it cannot be like this, so we have to drink it.  We will have to give weightage to what is important that we will tolerate even your nonsense, this thing of yours is good, that is why you are getting votes, so don't think that I don't know your nonsense and don't think that I am clapping on everything you say. And if I am voting for you, then I will ask you the most questions. Why should I ask them? I have not voted for them, if I have to vote for you then I will vote for you.  If I want to vote then I will ask you because what happens is if you go to ask questions then people say you are against it, oh brother why are you against it, you are voting for someone to whom you voted, how can one be against the person to whom you voted, but you will ask questions, this is the problem. Now people in India want to make everything black and white in India, it becomes very easy by making it black and white, isn't it? Human mind is lazy, it controls everything, brother, is this good or  No, it is good, he just wants to put it in that category that brother, it is this or this, he does not want to learn in total, whether it is to buy a plot, to buy a car, to buy a phone, to buy something, it is okay or not, it is not good, hey brother, how can I tell you one thing? Well, what do you need? What is important to you? If money is important, then this is the phone. Otherwise, brother, it would be the best for 5 lakhs only, but mine is that much when your budget is not that much. Then why is he asking which is good? First tell me, my budget is this much, which is good in this? Will there be a filter or will the search be filtered? So this is how we need to think. I hope you guys enjoyed it. Please share and like. Thank you.  mech"

    "title": "What Indian Young Men Need To Learn From Virat Kohli ？ [n0Y1AY6VrK0].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, this is a very positive video impacting the society, you have to share it on your groups, on family groups, What Indian men can learn from Virat Kohli, here I am addressing those men who are not married or will be married.  You have not had a child or are about to have a child and even if you have crossed the stage, you will still enjoy it. If you are older in age, it will be useful for your children, but there is a need to spread it in groups and in the society.  Let's start this video according to me, Virat ji has been blessed with the baby boy on 15th February, I believe Anushka ji means baby boy has been delivered, what we should learn and what I want to tell the youth C Virat Kohli is a very busy cricketer, he is a top cricketer, informed cricketer, test match series was going on, he chose to be with his wife, here men do not understand. I especially know North India very well but this disease is spread all over India. People take too much of pride. I have heard from my own ears that brother, we were wife's delivery and still we are working. Nothing could be more stupid and shocking than this. If you who are listening to me, you were not with her at the time of your wife's delivery, before a few days on the day and a few days later, your old age is going to get worse. It is 100% that the woman will keep it here. It is the worst red flag in the relationship. It is the worst thing a man can do. No matter how useless a man is, if he is arriving on the day of delivery, is it okay or is he arriving after it and then  Don't run anywhere the next day. Everyone gets a break in the society. If they don't provide buses, in fact they would have given everything. Many people are not ready to take that leave. Many people are ready to run away from men's responsibilities. They feel that they don't know what they will have to do.  Hey, you don't have to do anything, you just stay there physically with that lady because her stomach gets cut these days, if you use the word, she comes out like Bhasmasur, so many stitches are required, this is the only operation which is done.  After that, the sweets increase in the hospital, otherwise see some operation in which the sweets are increased. I am not saying that the sweets should not increase, but see how many come in the lady's sirion and how much is her struggle.  Hey, it used to happen earlier also, this much was done, if this was done then look at the old women whose husbands had such a casual attitude. Check how their old age is passing these days. Check the men in their 60s and 70s.  If you are a youngster then ask your grandfathers and if you are a little young then ask your father that the relationship between parents, the relationship between a lady and a man is completely unstable, so when Virat Kohli Bhai has been able to take leave, then all of you can.  So that is what my message is, you are not doing something so great, okay and don't take pride because the child you have has only one father in the cricket team, you do n't know how many players will come, what will come to your office.  Whatever it is, you are not running that office, you feel like you are running that office but you are not running that office, great work can be done without you, so we have to be free from this pressure in the society.  Do n't take too much pride in it. The system has come out even after taking paternity leave. It has come out in the government also but it should be there in private also and it should be taken by one's own rights. Today, brothers and sisters, how many children are you producing, if you cross the limit then two or three is not enough.  It is okay these days, if someone else has twins, then it is a different matter. On the other hand, if you are fat, then you are giving birth to only one child, most of the people are there, and half of you are those who have the part of conscience, wisdom and consciousness, then they are not having even one.  If you are not even married, then you are not having that many children. You cannot take leave, that is, you should take a minimum of 152 days. The woman gets mental support. It looks to her that yes, what should I say? I am not alone, I am doing this, yes.  This one is also seen standing, at least it is nothing but my struggle, he is seeing it because he is the struggle of a husband-wife relationship, that is your story, life is nothing else, which song is yours?  Lata ji has nothing, the hero in my story was missing because you are the hero of your story, no, I got trapped there, I was doing like this, I was doing like this, the one who is standing at the border to serve the country, he should also Everyone gets leave, everyone gives everything for the child, if there is a war going on and the country is at stake and you are defending, then even your wife will forgive the world, then there is no problem for everyone, then you have to become that Mathura Das.  I am not talking about the border picture, you are fine, but there should be a war with Mathura Das and then you should also be on the border. Okay, so those people are the rarest of the rarest, meaning there is a war in the last 70 years. How many days have passed, count it, okay, everyone has got leave there too, it is available everywhere, there are many people who are unemployed men, who run away from this responsibility, saying, ' My meat is mine, my meat is there, mine is there' from job  If there is such a job from which you cannot take leave of one week or 10 days at the time of having a child, then that job is a disgrace, leave it as it is, there is no need to do a job which you cannot do when you have a child, no matter how much technology has come.  No matter how much happens, delivery is considered the second birth of a woman. Yes, a lot of safety and security and all that has come, but still delivery is a very big thing. Life is coming into your life, it is a bigger event than your marriage, it is yours.  There would be three or four events even from the job.  There may be many jobs in life, it is okay that marriages also happen, you know how it is nowadays, but brother, the birth of a child has to be cherished by the society and there should not be a missing father in it, that father has to be there, Virat Kohli has set a  Very good example in this we should because it is saying that should we look at the other things, okay if they do something wrong then the celebrity should also follow, okay they come right  The three from Juba Kesari are fine, so they see all that, they influence so much, but these are the subtle things, these are the subtle things, these things also have to be caught, have to be followed or seen, the next one took leave, the test matches will keep coming, friend, 100 kings.  It's okay, 500 runs less will be scored, what difference does it make at the time of retirement and he will become fit, he will remember the wife and the child will remember that moment, not that repeat.  Can do for a father 99 But when ever the baby happens, first of all he comes out in father's lap, that is a movement of the British to cherish, so come on and funda, that is delivery and that we see in movies, come on, I am so short  I don't ask to put it in because half the people will faint while watching the delivery and in our country these days there are more seizures, I don't know why there are more of them, so there is no need to go there, but when the baby comes for the first time,  The father should be late to the family member, it is okay, he should be missing, who is shooting the arrow in the pumpkin, what will it do, what will it uproot, what will it reach, anyway, it is a struggle throughout life, he will also miss his birthdays sometimes.  It may happen somewhere because father cannot do everything. Father has to earn money. I know father may not be able to witness everything. For the first time he is speaking, for the first time he is walking or for the first time.  If the child is doing anything then it is possible that the father may miss it all. Ideally, one should try not to miss it, but then you cannot catch all the things in life, but at least you can catch the birth of the due date of delivery.  The idea is that everyone can take leave before that and availability can be done, it is a matter of 510 days, plus caesarean are going on at 90, my core audience in big cities is fine, so according to me, it is fine.  This is something which society needs to discuss. How did you like the video? Like, share and subscribe the channel. I will keep bringing such things. Thank you."

    "title": "What Is Wrong In Financial Policy Making ？ Is There A Better Choice [zSYmUPJiisk].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, this is not a very deep analysis, it is a superficial analysis, tell me how much you agree with it, but as a general direction I will tell you, after the budget comes, these things will become very clear to people like you, but right now I want to discuss that the financial policy of the  I want to discuss about the government that we can do this because the same ministers are there, the same government which has been there for the last 10 years, so a simple observation in this is this, this is mine, you tell me whether it is yours or not, you agree or disagree with it This government, my audience is the middle class, so I will tell you what affects the middle class. This government talks a lot about doing a lot for the poor but doesn't do it, so in a way it is good for the middle class. That all the money was not invested in the poor, but what is it that the middle class is not getting any direct benefit? This is also a fact that the poor know that nothing great is happening for them, it is visible in the votes of those 42 crore people who cast their votes.  People voted for this government  They did not vote for the BJP party. 22 crore people did not vote for it. 42 crore people did not vote for it. There are a lot of poor people in India, so their number did not come much. It has remained mostly an urban party and the urban middle class.  It is crazy that the rich are definitely benefiting. What happens when the rich benefit is that the middle class does not benefit. But if the poor benefit, then the middle class can benefit because the middle class invests money in the share market.  The middle class invests in mutual funds, the middle class invests in all these things, the middle class which is the Shany middle class benefits from the actual income of the poor, the assets which are sitting in the default setting are sitting on rent, are sitting on rental properties  Because when the children of poor people, even the poor class, do well, then they come to the cities and live in homes, so the oppressive effect that comes from the bottom of the pyramid, tragedies come up and this happens very easily but its pace slows down.  If it is there then what happens to 5 kg rice, that 5 kg grain You have given it to them, you have given it to them, what does it matter to them, then they are not that hungry to come to the city and work hard, so I feel that in this way of providing employment, are we giving it to them for free, are we giving it for free grains and the funny thing is that how much would 5 kg of grains cost, you tell me, 50 Rs 00, 50 Rs per kg grain is being given free and the stove to cook it costs more than 000 Rs so the person who can afford the stove  yes brother it is 1100 then take that food grains also because you are giving food grains to 80 crore people it should be that in tribal areas those who are cooking on wood and still don't have cylinders they should get food grains but everyone should get food grains  If you are getting the grain, if you are giving it, then if you reduce the rate of the cylinder by Rs. 100 then there is no need to give the grain, the grain is rotting anyway, you have to buy the grain at MSP, so this is a huge mess in the policies.  and to fix it  There is a need for this and its solution is not like there is a lot of opposition, it will have to be done sitting together because what they say is that they are giving five, we will give 10, this is their formula, let's do it into two, so if something is getting ruined  So you are talking about the choice cap of the opposition, then you are blaming the opposition as well, then what is the problem, if you say something to the ruling party then it seems that you are an opposition man, hey, look at the opposition as well, they have  Those who are saying that they are ready to do all this, it means someone is going haywire, what is ruining the boat, if they ruin the boat then they will ruin it greatly, then those are the policies of the opposition because you tell me friend, if everyone wants to eat, everyone should eat  If you will get it like this then the people who are working are fools, aren't they? There is wealth in contentment, it is the ultimate wealth. Stories like this are also told. Many times there is ultimate wealth in contentment, here you can get 5 kg like this.  I went home and found him, he found the card  If that is achieved, then these policies are questionable and will have to be done. The wealth is actually coming into the hands of a few people and wherever it is coming, the parties with 10 to 100 crores at the middle level are running away from the country.  If it is there then it does not look like wealth anywhere. It means that you are understanding that India is growing but Indians are not growing because the government will give you the GDP figure of 8.3 but you are feeling 8.3. Check this in your life, there is a simple way of doing this.  I will tell you people to check their policies, you should make your net worth, what is your net worth, all your assets minus the liabilities, okay, bank FD, demat, property, some people say don't believe in the house you live in, but  That is mostly for your personal finance, you can also consider your house, right, where you live, whatever your net worth is, say, if it is ₹1, will it become 9 next year, brothers and sisters, or will it become 105, this is the question, if inflation Seven  and it is not 107 then you are becoming poor, if it becomes 108 then you are some wait late, your growth is not very great, you have to understand this and the average growth which is happening in % and yours is not even 8 then you are below average  If you also look at this, there is a lot of need in policies for this government to pull up its socks. I hope they do something like this in the budget because this allocation, that allocation, basically I am not questioning this, I am not questioning the intentions of this government. I say that all governments have good intentions. I also say that there is no talent, there is lack of ideas and there are no intellectuals who can come and tell them to do this because everything has a spillover effect and higher order effect.  It happens if you don't check it, do n't give it food, that is also not a solution, even if you give it, there is no benefit, so these governors are not that easy and the effects are not visible as such and no great policy is visible, if the same policy  curry out  If you did not implement this policy out of the box, then the problem is that you are creating assistance for 3 crore people in housing in a place where there are no jobs. If you built houses for them and provided food there, then they will not go anywhere else. You have to look after the house, he will not go anywhere, you built a house for him there and gave him 5 kg rice or he will be very happy and then you are saying that our growth is not happening, so you have to take a  I can give a suggestion as to where to make the call, which I see, the government is not taking care of the urban poor, the poor in big cities, again it is the politics of vote bank, they did not get any seat in Mumbai area but in Delhi  I have come a lot but the politics that Aam Admi Party takes in Delhi is not suiting me. Otherwise, whatever you think of me as, I am from my heart. I am not saying that I am a great economist but I am a very practical person and you can understand my point.  If you understand then tell me about one of our brothers who left the village  Whoever comes to a big city should be taken care of or the one who is lying there enjoying himself, doing nothing, in every city, houses are built there, ration comes there, if you take care of the urban poor who is coming by taking his own risk to work  He is facing the hygiene conditions of his house, there is no system for the poor in urban housing, what kind of conditions do they live in, the situation in Delhi is very bad, Gurgaon is a little different city, there are no slums there, something else lives there  We have our own people here, but taking the example of Delhi and Mumbai, the people are stuck in slums. If the government brings a special scheme for them this time, they will take care of so many urban poor. See, the channel is small but someone or the other catches the idea. People see, make your own idea and celebrate it, do something for the urban poor who live in the top 50 cities of India and see how this person will also consume, the villager is not consuming anything, he goes to sleep with his own people  Ration is here, don't tell everyone like this  No, everybody never becomes anything but if you help the urban poor, help them in their studies, give them some incentives, the spillover effect in consumption will be better. This is the message, how did you like the idea, do let me know and share this thing that India's top 50  There are 100 cities, grab 100 cities, have special schemes for their urban poor, only for the urban poor across India, all this rural rural rural rural rule has been done for the vote bank, that now you BJP people will not even get votes, please the city people  They have voted for you, hold on to that vote bank. I am giving you an idea for the next 10 years of politics. This is your core vote bank. Take care of them as well. The middle class in every city is not crazy about you, they as well.  You will make me crazy, you will sweep, do not keep these, it will very quickly return the Rs. 00 investment you make on these by increasing it to Rs. 200 and give it to you very soon by increasing it to Rs. 200, so whatever you are doing there keep doing it, but don't do it too much, not this  That more location has been given there and the location which is running in the scheme, let it continue but bring a scheme here, tell me what kind of idea you people like and when these people will benefit, the middle class will benefit, this is what I am sure to say  It will be 100% possible, I will tell you how to do it, like and subscribe the channel, thank you very much"

    "title": "What Mistake Is Happening In Infrastructure Projects ？ [5xhKArqfMKk].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, through this video I want to make an appeal to the present dispensation authorities, the government, that please do not hurry up the infrastructure projects. We have seen recently that a roof of T One  There is a collab, yes, it is being said in it that Modi ji had ingratiated that one, this one is old and new, the discussion is not about one thing, it is about general things, Ayodhya temple is new, that one is not old, its roof is Atal Setu is also leaking, it was newly constructed and there are cracks there too. If you make a list like this, a list of 25 things has been made, then the main thing is that haste is the devil's work, we did it so hastily that we lost the quality.  We will have to talk, now it has been 10 years, some things have been shown hastily, we will have to talk about them and secondly, it is being said a lot about Rhodes that Nitin Gadkari ji should have been kept here only.  The general public is also a pensioner but I want to question this also. Hey, what are you talking about? This is a good thing. Do an audit of the good thing. Acquiring farmers' land everywhere, building roads everywhere, how much benefit is being gained from it?  There is an advantage in logistics. Manufacturing is not happening anywhere. Roads are being built everywhere. How many are needed? Take a look at the roads that you are building. With what free funds are you building them. Are you charging so much toll tax?  yes  Where should a person go? First of all, he should buy a car. If I want to buy a car worth Rs. 10 lakh, then I have to earn Rs. lakh for it because it will go in my tax. Then even a car worth Rs. 10 lakh has a lot of tax on it. GST is imposed on it. Then I have to pay its road tax, then on top of the road tax, I have to pay insurance, then on top of that I have to pay GST, then I have to pay petrol, I have to pay everything in it too, and then I have to pay toll tax to run it and toll tax is increased everywhere.  you go away  You keep on increasing, if you are doing roads by taking so much toll tax, then the condition of the roads will be so bad that you have forgotten the railways, the railways are getting damaged, there are so many collisions, they are looking like reel ministers and not railway ministers. Our Railway Minister is not a Reel Minister. He goes everywhere and makes reels. He is seen riding a motorcycle without a helmet. If he rides without a helmet, he gets issued a challan. But why was he not wearing a helmet?  When you wear it, you don't recognize that you are the Railway Minister. Why are you crying? Acting, getting out from under the train, having an accident, no conversation, no conversation, now the good strain has derailed inside Prayagraj, there is a shortage of staff, that Railway Board.  It is being said that the locomotives, the pilots who speak, the cars who drive the trains are so few and tired, these news are coming one after the other every day. I feel as if they used to be suppressed earlier or now no one is there.  Vaastu has gone bad, what has happened so much, problem of NEET exam everywhere, that paper leak, this paper leak, no one seems to be in control, some are not talking about the situation, talk about emergency, old, it used to be like this earlier.  Earlier, what used to happen earlier had marginalized those people, so check the same paper of yours, whether it is like it or not, what is the color of his paper, his paper also got 20 marks out of 100. You are also sitting there having failed, now he is not saying his number, so check your paper too, did he just check the paper and made you sit, but you are acting like this and brother, you are so afraid of speaking. First of all, it seems that their trollers will come and tell them something. No, why don't you tell them, because it is not there, they will be told what it is, why is there such a hurry in the inauguration, why are you in such a hurry to cut the ribbon, do you all have to complete the work?  No, cake also takes time. If you take it out too soon, it will become raw. It has to be done in a hurry only in March because code of conduct will be imposed. I have to show that I have done a lot of work. Now I have got five years to do it. Please go and repair it.  Do audit things in a better way and please tell the quality things because it is an embarrassment for our country, Delhi is the capital of our country, a rain came and a thunderbolt, what is below, what is this audit, who is running it, whose responsibility is it for how long?  How long will the government have authority today? I am sure that it can also be linked to Nehru ji that maybe if Nehru ji could have corrected something here then it would have been fine, otherwise the time will not pass by making statements because you will not be able to do anything for 5-10 years.  So you can pass the time, now the paper will be checked every day, it will happen every day, videos will be made every day and every day many people will say, hey hey, what is negative, brother, what is negative if it is the public's tax payer's money.  The Central Government spent Rs 22,000 crore in advertisement money in the last 10 years. They do not have money for Agniveer. Check this figure. I am telling you right, it is not just to brighten one face. Now people do not want to see that face. They are bored. 22000 crores have been given to you by the Central Government, all of you are sitting there as users, all the leaders from top to bottom, whatever you are doing, there is youtube3 for it in the newspaper.  Printing 222000 crores is like giving indirect bribe to Godi Media. Godi Media does not need funding from corporate. It does not need funding from normal advertising. It is given to them directly by the government. Now money is not going to come there either. Godi Media also needs funding.  It is going to seem that I am telling you that no one is watching and no money is going to come from here, so what Godi media people are hearing, brother, even your salary will become doubtful.  Whenever you come, you are the son of the country. Every time I will tell you that we are the people, we are the sons of this country, we are the owners of this country, everyone else is below the Parliament and whatever we have to say, whatever big posts we have in the Constitution, we are the people of India. Now we have to show our talent. Will you show your talent? I will see in the comment section. Now what difference will the comment section make? The country must have changed. Yes, it must have changed. The comment section must have changed. You people are not bots.  You are real people, you are not an IT cell person, if it is known then write genuinely what you people have to say, they put so much tax payer's money in Rs 22000 crore advertisement, we have made that thing that we put it in the advertisement and Cracks appear there and they break. Look at the sight of the Atal Setu. Who has done it because you are not paying attention to the quality? Haste is the devil's work. Easy ripe is sweet. Sir, the people of India have given 15 years of time. 10 years have passed and now a fresh mandate of five years has come. If work had been done properly in many things, then by now much better results would have been seen on education and health.  There is no expenditure. The promise of 6 rupees was made in the manifesto. They are not able to spend even 1 rupee of GDP. Oh no, even the old government has done what has happened to the old government. Do you know the public? Do it, spend it somewhere on education, somewhere on education you can see that those who are supposed to do research are fellow scholars, somewhere independent research is being done, somewhere else there is no money for them, because there, how will you get votes, you will get ration only if you vote.  By paying attention somewhere else, then do not pay attention to those things, the same thing in health sector because money is spent in health and education, effort is spent, the result shows after many years, not immediately, you will do the allocation today.  Why am I telling all these things, why is there relevance of these videos and such videos will be seen in future also because brothers and sisters, the budget is coming on 22nd July, what are your expectations from the budget, what for the middle class or the country?  If it can be improved then please write in the comment section who is responsible for the quality of the infrastructure project and whose is the accountability if the roof has collapsed and one unfortunate person has lost his life in that accident. Who is responsible? Tell the name. The minister immediately reaches there to make a reel but what is the benefit of it. Even if you come, it will be fine if you sit in your office and work, it will also be fine because who is responsible for the investigation from there too. Who is the contractor and when was it built? If things are falling due to rain then the water is not being drained either in the Ram temple or at the airport. The priests of the Ram temple are saying that there is no way for the water to drain out.  What came out  You are saying that this will be built for a thousand years, such a temple will be built, this will be built, it will be built like this, Nipendra Mishra ji is watching directly from the PMO, still this is the condition there, this is the condition there, so are they angry, what is this, what is this, what is happening, the paper is out.  It has been said that no one is of quality, just like that I have attempted all the papers, I have attempted all the questions, but if the answers are colourful, then the marks will be less. What is the use of attempting all the questions? Bridges are falling in Bihar.  Check how many have fallen, who is making it, who is taking the audit, are you in a hurry to make it, don't you make a brother, in India it is better to delay such things, instead of making a thing and breaking it, the whole thing becomes junk.  So brother, a thing of two years should be done in two and a half to three years, but it should be done well. Why is it happening so soon because elections will keep coming again and again, elections are coming in Haryana also in October and Madhya Pradesh, they are also coming in Maharashtra and Maharashtra.  If elections are being held in Haryana Cut the ribbon immediately, why do you have such things here too brother? You could have made it then, you had 5 years time, and if you don't make it then take marks only on the paper you attempted, don't do it wrong, then you will get more negative publicity, right now you are getting negative publicity.  You will have to face this now, where will you run away from this? 1975 Emergency was imposed on 25th June, hence this happened. Or will you link with Nehru ji or will you link with Manmohan Singh? Link with whom.  You will do it brother, with whom will you do it? Who is running the country for the last 10 years? Who will run it for the next 5 years? Why don't the trolls speak? Please write, you who come to troll those who are devotees, give the answer. No brother, give the answer or you are not getting this embarrassment.  So if you come and speak genuinely, we will accept that this is a problem, we are trying, we are also human children, mistakes happen and it is okay. Actually everyone is biological, no one is divine etc. because ever since the day that word has been spoken that I am not biologically divine, it seems to me that some divine power has ascended from above to show who is divine. Because I am also a little astrologer and I work a little in all these things and a little from the day I said that brother, I am not biological, I am not divine, it seems that a  Divine Shakti working in other wise, such relief never spread in such a short time in this country and if it did spread then it was hidden very well. I do n't know, you tell me. This video of June is being shot in June itself. In the month of June itself or in the last 45 days or ever since that word was uttered, see what is happening, how the RSS is scolding differently, first and foremost, we do not need RSS, the elections are over.  Let the elections be over, we do n't need RSS. We lost 15-20 seats in the last phase. In that case, instead of 240, 260 would have been considered respected. Then after breaking Nitish Kumar 's JDO, it would have become 272. He is still in the process of breaking it.  Will we try the mission, will Operation Lotus work? Okay, they will see, we are watching well and it is good if even after doing this, 272 272, by doing these things, I will get these things.  What I don't understand is that with the number of MPs in Parliament, what is happening outside, how can the water falling from the roof be stopped? Yes, the news coming out can definitely be stopped, but now brother, there are so many YouTube4 journalists, every person has a citizen journalist.  There is mobile and technology, what was there earlier, people are not able to understand, now people are reading, they want to watch the video, there is a person in the video, he is speaking, there are youtube1, 200, 500 comments, now this video will also be watched by thousands of people, two thousand people.  We will see and you will also have to say something and you will say, Oh brother, absolutely Guruji, you are speaking very well, you are right, if you have to answer this then there will be someone to read it, this is not our managed IT cell, there are no butts.  This is Godi media, this is not real content, real people, real issues, real things, so please spread this and make it reach people and this is the issue and the last one was 10 times 10 years old, it was easy for what ever reasons.  Now if it is not easy then you have to do a job, it is a job which is given by the public, they get a salary, don't they all get the same salary as the fearsome politicians, ministers, MPs, they don't get the tax payer's money, so just ask the tax payer. Now the budget is going to come in the coming time, you will also get this much pension in the budget, one day become MP, pension is pension, fun is fun, it is like Shubham Gaur's fun, I will have fun once, become MLA once.  MP  It's fun, I take two pensions from Tet too, I take fun from here too, I take fun twice, thrice, I take pension thrice, it's fun, I cut off Agniveer's pension, it's fun, I cut off Agniveer's job, it's fun, farmers  Let me bring fun on the road, let me narrate its story, make it clear to him, on the contrary, it is fun, it is fun, this kind of fun will not work anymore because who will not let you live in fun, brothers and sisters, who are we, you and me? What am I? Write in the comment section. We are the Sovan of India. We mean the people. Sovan means master, we are the master and we treat our servants, be it the chief servant or a very small servant, with respect, not by insulting them like Om Birla. Yes, Deependra says to ji, there is no need to tell me, not like this, he still requests with folded hands, please drive better, you have been made to sit, you get a salary for this.  You don't become this reel minister of work, you become a railway minister, you work less on reels, everyone comes to become your YouTube, leave the work of YouTube to us, do real work, if you do real work, it will be visible in 10 days, 15 days.  In 20 days and nine months, we will clap it. Whenever we see some good work, we will clap it, but brother, whatever inauguration you did, the one below Pragati Maidan stays there everywhere.  The problem is that nothing was executed properly and if you follow them too much then they will throw you back and answer that you and I were saying that it will take six more months, you were in a hurry, hence you cannot even crack down on anyone because they  Maybe after turning around, show the documentation or show something else that pressure was put on me, otherwise do this everywhere, does Kejriwal ji know how to take action? If others don't, then do it friend. BJP will have to change, may God forbid BJP rule for 500 years, may God bless it for 500 years in the next year, but performance will have to be shown, it is not possible that the work will be done by just praying or will the performance be done by force.  You will have to rule for 500 years, rule for 5000 years, there is no problem, now they say that this mehendi has not even been removed, it is visible that they have just come after voting for him.  It takes 100 days to get out, right? It's been 30 days now, at least keep this in mind, as long as it's still a fresh matter, where has that 100 day plan gone, what are you doing with 150 days? We are sitting here, the menu card will come, 10 years from now, what do we say, the starter was the main course, so the main course is about to come, the public is waiting for the show, something good is about to come, they will clap, ok.  If it doesn't happen, we will tell about it. Okay, and we will discuss about what can be good. Whoever comes to power, it will remain like this for him. We will not become fans. Even if he becomes very great, we will only clap. We will not become devotees of humans.  One should not become a devotee, to become a devotee, we have many Gods and East in our Sanatan, we will remain devotees of them, do not become devotees of humans, that is the message, thank you very much, like the channel, subscribe and please share.  Take it and also tell us your opinion. What is your opinion in this? Thank you very much."

    "title": "Which Rasoiya Will You Choose ？ [vKfJAVrx1-g].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today I will ask you a question, you will be entertained, you will also learn and have fun and there is no special party or connection with anyone, first I am giving a disclaimer, this thing is fine, there are two types of mads.  If you don't do this, then the woman will be the kitchen, let's do it, okay, for the sake of example, there are two types of kitchens, you tell me which one you like more. A cook, that is, a cook who works in someone's house, okay, now one cook is an old cook.  is it yours or the old one  He has been a cook for many years now, what does he do? He takes your 1 liter milk and every day he fills his 200 ml cup and drinks it and adds 200 ml water to it and boils it. This is our cook. A is fine. Let's catch the second one. B. Okay. The second one is a cook. He is new and has not much experience. He talks very well. It's okay and he talks sweetly. And he doesn't steal. But he is interested in taking his photos all the time. It's a relief. It's okay.  And is Rahat interested in looking at the mobile or is Rahat doing this? In order to do this, every day when he calls for milk, he pours out 1 liter of 200 ml and if it spills, he also gets scared. He also adds water to the 200 ml. What did he do, he was an expert, he comes, took out the glass, mixed it with 200 ml of water, okay, first, second, we will increase the degree of difficulty and will keep telling things, don't answer so quickly, don't answer so quickly. Okay, so I told you the first one, I told you the second one, now what's in it, if you see that note, only milk is falling, milk is falling in the stove too, there is a block in the stove too, if the vessel is also running then the milk is gone. Give pulses but he is not a thief, he is not a thief, let's add a third one also, there can be such people who come brother, first of all they drink 200 ml, it is clear, after that they have to see the photo also, to pass the time and Even if negligent people come out, they drink 200 and milk out 200 and then if they want to get 400 ml of water, then this is also the third category. Now if I combine these three categories of people with politics, they are in every party. You have also seen that elections will come.  So earlier also there will be changes, there are three types of people, there are three types of people and every person will make his brother do something, see, now there is a mix of them, some have more of something, some have more of something.  There is something more in someone, now you have to select from these cooks only, look separately, the best cook is the one who neither boils milk nor steals, keeps cleanliness and is a stickler, you don't have a choice between these three.  There is mix and match among these three, it is not like that people catch hold of And you see such people, they are completely corrupt, that is, they are caught. They have no intelligence and are also eggs. You will find many such people in the government system, you will find them in political parties, I have made the match interesting, now tell me, now everyone is on side in this.  We will sit with him, he can run your house also, so are you asking to take a thief, it means that you have come to know, Guruji, your agenda is A, no, mine is not that easy, you will not know, although I am openly telling you that I am my  Agenda: I have to create a scene for the public, I have to remove only the politicians who have come unnecessarily, I have to bring that milk cook, the one who will neither drink milk nor will he churn the milk, I have to bring him and I have to call out everyone.  This is the one who drinks this boil, the whole world is like this, people are like this, where do they exit, I am the only such person, tell me, then you are the one who will go to the Rajya Sabha, where will you go to the Lok Sabha  You should do good things. Just by talking good things, a little less has been done. Brothers, just by talking good things, it has not worked, but by just talking good things, something more should be done, so today I want to give a hint to you, I want to tell you.  I want to request, please, I will not say more than 20 to 25 from my country and I am this kitchen, I am also a good one, but right now I am Jagan, I do not want to come myself because even by staying outside, you can have more influence. Independence MP, we can accept anyone but he is standing, I do n't think he will stand but it will be like this, if he is good and you think he is not in the category of these three chefs, then we have to select him 20 to 25 This is the hope that I can become a voice. Adv, you are a woman MP and a very smart woman and someone from your party is involved in the story. Ladies, don't open your mouth to reduce wrongdoing because it is a party.  You are not a good woman leader, that's why I tell women, I will make a video in this film to empower women through reservation, there is no education of Meena, women are very complaining, these facts have not been mentioned, so that topic will be discussed later.  This will become like the hypocrisy of women, which has kept us too much in politics. Whether it is men or women, we will not talk about gender there, it has become independence which has its own language and 20 25 Why I I am saying this because in the times to come, this is what will happen, if not this time then next time, the Khichdi wala made here, you know less, okay maybe if he doesn't have it then he can take 20 to 25 countries to such a place. Because they will be honest only because they are social and do not know anyone, they will have a commitment, they can question anyone at any time across everything, it is like different parties and ideologies have been formed, when the opportunity comes, someone will never be honest.  You can also ask questions, you can do this, you can tell, you can clip this to someone at any time and you can do that to someone at any time and by clipping today, you can hold accountable tomorrow that clipping was done on this thing but Brother  I voted for the party. Yes, I like the ideology of the party, so I will not ask questions from the party. Hey brother, your wife also asks questions, don't you take the marriage fair from your husband, it is not the story of your life, but she says that you have done wrong, husband.  He also says that this should be done right, this should be done like this, then why can't you say it at home because when this is not being said because everyone is dare, then how did you like this video, which one will you do, all three are bad, it is like a surety.  Jhansi is more, third one is more  It is absolutely fine to not select them, but then you will have to make a choice between those two. Now a corrupt man is bad, a negligent man is bad, this is what you have to see. There is a driver who can sleep. You are sitting in the car and you are sleeping.  He may even die due to an accident. Pro does not steal petrol. The other driver is a smart driver. He will not sleep. The car runs smoothly but sometimes he steals petrol and is late. It is okay that sometimes he wastes money in repairing the car. Sometimes he washes the car for Rs. 300.  500 is taken from now onwards. Look at this plot. So we need a good driver, who drives the car well, is neither negligent nor steals, but then the salary is too much, he does not want to pay the salary, this also happens.  ₹ 15000 is late, ₹ 6000 is late by stealing, one late is ₹ 22000, then the man says he will steal 6000, if it is 15 then it will be 21, this is very difficult in real life.  In this note on this, we still have to go, still we have to go to a place where we also need responsibility, where we also need honesty, because sometimes what good responsibility is, there is some other agenda, where foolishness is visible, there is honesty.  It looks like it means it is very complicated, okay it is not a straight way choice, if it was a straight way choice, then why would there be so much discussion, then we would have done it, if only black and white are black.  And it is not white, if the thing is black and white then it is not because what is intellectual is what I want to make of the channel, the subscribers are called intellectuals, people are not ashamed of what they say in what they do or what they say, okay, you are yours.  He calls you an intellectual, why can't you say something like this, intellectuals are not needed, we do n't need such people in the country, who are intelligent and talk good things, who will lift up other fellow citizens also, Jain or discourse will be of this level only.  Foolish liberty will happen that outsiders will see how bawdy they have asked, what are they discussing, the quality of debate is the same quality of country and the world is also monitoring it from Indians and Indians also need every rational voice.  Also, this kind of voice which is my voice, I am telling you, I did not see it much, that's why I definitely got one, otherwise my channels were running, I was enjoying the rest, what was the problem with me, but my  I felt this is a vacuum. Somebody needs you. Comment. India News, you discuss this. Please tell us about this matter. This is how we should discuss. If you like it, please share. It is a request with folded hands. Subscribe, you increase it. Okay, message needs you.  B Jeevan Tu D Larger Audience because as in this I am telling you to change the whole thing at your own level, we do not have to go out and make noise to anyone.  It is a scaffold, we have to see what it is because these kitchens, they will all paint themselves that there is no one better than us and this other one is useless, but what is the problem that they all come in mix and match. And we will have to think very carefully and take a decision or else we will have to create new kitchens which do not belong here like this. Please share, like, thank you."

    "title": "Who Is Setting The Narrative And Occupying Mindspace ？ Episode 02 [6T-aE_8ej5c].en",
    "content": "Hello friends episode 2 today's topic is setting the narrative and living on board convection and empathy I am addressing the middle class a narrative is set inside our social space who sets it the normal general public doesn't know but it is set  We are going to do this, it is set up above so that you discuss that thing only because it used to happen in school, we are a nation of essay writers, okay, if we are given a topic about what is there in life, then our essay writing is done.  The one gets triggered, the CO will say that it is not the right time to show it, it is bald, there is no time, he pierced anything, left it like this, did anything like this, everyone got attracted to it, this is called narrative, I will tell you some things where the middle class tells useless narratives.  I enter into some examples, I will first give an example of the farmer, what does the middle class have to do with the farmer, no, for the farmer then we have to say, did the farmer ask you for help, does the farmer need you, no, poor farmer, take care of yourself, middle class, your children are set  You are getting promoted, I will tell you what agendas can be there in future This farmer is doing this extra fertilizer for the poor people, benefit of the poor, the plate of the poor, the poor are definitely benefiting, the country has definitely benefited, we will move forward, rest of the book, you can understand this as an example and when he is shouting  And its effect is being felt on the player and he is singing that India is winning, the middle class people are eating popcorn in the drawing room and he is singing that I am winning, it is nothing, yours is naive, yes, middle class. When kids used to play games in their childhood, there used to be some games and some small kids used to go there, they used to think that friend, now the elder people used to think that he will spoil the games, his raw eyes will not get spoilt due to the spices and he used to enjoy it a lot  Chotu is fine, he does n't know, neither it is happening around him nor his dhaba is happening, if you go to a video game parlor, where there are video games, nowadays when everyone plays on mobile, there are stations, there are coins in it.  If he used to put it, he could make a small child sit on the motorcycle without even paying any coin  He will keep doing this and it seems that it is working while he has no connection. There will be connection only when he puts in money like this. These are our conditions. They have to be made aware. I have to tell you guys, my viewers, how can you ride a cycle without it?  He has put it in and is feeling very happy, there is no need to be happy, he gets down from the motorcycle and plays the game by putting coins in and then he goes live, well this happens Guruji, yes, so you have to come and tell this to someone, not on social media Even the news channel people will not tell that I am saying 25 years in the last 25 years so that many parties do this, otherwise if I say 9 years, 10 years then people will give something or I will selectively hold him for 10 years.  I will take you any speech of Independence Day of the last 25 years, you can find it randomly by rounding up any Prime Minister's speech, what has been talked about in it, poor people of the country, farmers, drivers, city, anything, alumni, lovers, his time took less than that of a tabla because he  She was younger than me, but the middle class is growing and has become very large now. And it will move further, someone is talking about their aspirations, mentioning my name and the biggest fool is asking what is in this, do you know their pain, so when the reservation is late and the farmer gets the job, then the farmer gets it because the reservation is less.  Caste up to less than that and farmers also have caste but I am standing with you, I am saying this again with my hand in my hand, right now if the farmer is poor then if he is a Soni wala then also he will get reservation and  If he is not there in the caste then also he will get it in some other place because he is not even in the creamy layer. Yes, then you are losing your job, not your child's. We still have to talk to you people, you have to see that if you want the welfare of the country then  We will have to discuss a little bit about politics and in the bigger picture, we will have to fine tune the discussion. We talk a lot about a lot of different things, but for example, there is an actress, Alia Bhatt ji. I will tell you through her example. Once, I told her a story. Karanjhar has asked a story, he does n't know the name of the president etc. in his GK but please increase his knowledge, you tell me where is it right  This rest in her life, no, this middle class password has come, you don't even know this, you know everything, where have you reached, Alia Bhatt ji must be very successful in life and all those girls who want to become something  Chetan also wants Jagan, middle class boys who comment a lot on all these things, hey brother, Alia Bhatt has even got married, has a child, now she has even appeared in a Hollywood movie, and you can ask her GK from you.  It is not good at all, you are understanding where and what I am talking about, politicians play games, they set the rules of the game themselves and the game is played by the public, you have to set the rules of this game yourself and if the politicians have to dance then, brothers and sisters Can we do this because I am defining the syllabus of my upcoming episodes and I am not talking about them because what have we done, we have said that these two are late or they are politicians or the people whom we vote for  I am late with two big thirds so we say I like this I like this  no it is wich is ok but I want to ask you do you like this do you like this do you like everything about it ask your heart or do you reject everything about it ask your heart think a little no this is the only good thing about it Yes, this thing is very good, this thing is not good but what can they do in it, I mean there is this thing bad in it wich I don't accept this thing is a little good but if it is so good then I am not going to go with it, this is my thinking and  This can also be the reverse, defending on which side is of, I am here, without taking the name of any political party, without doing anything about anyone, I have explained in such a wonderful way, in Guruji's way, without making any noise, without applying any meaningless emotions because  Here, when you understand this thing, let the emotions cool down comfortably. The one who thinks has seen what is happening, what is important, is it not necessary to tell this person that this thing which is wrong should be corrected and we consider it wrong  and we consider it right, doesn't this person also have the right to feedback  That brother, let us correct this a little bit, this is the opinion of most of the people, people have just made it black and white without any other discussion and one more thing if you catch the politicians, if you look at India's external policy, defense policy, financial policy, whatever our  Finance is more, it has been going on for the last 40 years, nothing like this has happened, they just keep changing the details here, so it is not that we feel that it is very different, it is not different, if someone gives electricity, free water, electricity and all this then it is useless.  I am building a pond on the story and money is being invested in it, so someone finds out about the money because he is a robber after making promises, so you have to understand this, I will explain it to you in a simple and sweet way and you should try to understand it. Okay, write down what is important in your life. The toxicity of your job is affecting your life. What can a politician do about it? I am just rude, so what can a politician do about it? What power can the government have? This is what I will talk about further. what can they do because the poor middle class he doesn't know at all, he thinks that my life is isolated, I do n't tell you anything, your life is not going well, your job is not going well, your marriage expenses are too high  Your money is not being returned, financial issues are happening, there is struggle, yes what can a politician do, politicians say that LPG gas is more and petrol is less, this is all I have heard, oh I don't want it, there are private member bills, we will discuss them and talk more  We will tell you what a politician can do, what he should do, how will he do it, and we will make him aware through tweets, through this video, through the channel, and we, the middle class, are very low hanging fruit, there will be no expenditure, such laws  Parliament has the power to pass such a law which costs Rs 50,000 crores, it takes a lot of effort but to pass such a law which gets votes and no one is against it and a tabla benefits, then the politicians can do it by doing laptops.  I felt this is a dream situation but a politician  And I will create that situation in the middle of this channel, there is no negativity, no noise, no fun, they are shouting so much in the parliament, they are shouting rudely, all the parties, okay, you have turned the school debate into a fish market. And the way they talk in the parliament, now they are also like actors, means they want to show that they are watching from our constitution, whereas if they were calm, then both sides would be agreeing on some points, very easy points of the middle class  If they are there then keep speaking, keep discussing other things, keep fighting, keep doing everything with each other, we will not stop you but give this one hour, one hour or two hours to this middle class, no matter why, and this is our request to them with folded hands.  Pass it, it will be good for them, there are many hanging fruits and it is not that it is my extremely original history, I will not even say that it is such a history which was delivered in this parliament, then that too was passed and then everyone became silent  went because right now  The uproar went back here, the uproar over other things happened and now elections are about to come, so it will keep happening, there are two-three things of that kind, which are very good, that long country will continue, clarity will continue, things on different topics will be given to you people.  I will keep understanding, thank you, very match"

    "title": "Who Is Winning In Madhya Pradesh And Rajasthan Elections  ？ [iB2uv4dxSFo].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, today we will discuss that Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh are going to be very good elections and the atmosphere is not at all one-sided which if it happens then enjoy the excitement. If your result is clear that it is winning then there is no fun in the match. We are having fun, this is our independent channel, it is okay if someone wins, but we have to enjoy the match, okay, it is not like that with anyone, there is a lot of love, okay, we will see what development is happening in both and both.  What am I into?  If you are enjoying that thing, then tell me if you are enjoying Madhya Pradesh, first let's talk about Madhya Pradesh, it is fine, Shivraj ji has been the Chief Minister in Madhya Pradesh for so many years, it is fine, the public has elected him last.  Time is a bit MLA, MLA had to be shifted here and there, but now the Chief Minister has not declared that is the one, it is okay, which has been there for so many years, second thing, you have used your veterans and this will be I think seen in Rajasthan also.  And let us analyze a little on this. You have put a veteran leader and Minister MP in contesting the MLA elections. So what is the relief coming from this? And this affects 2024 and also makes India's politics a reality in the future and I am also giving a hint.  That MP is a lam post election, lam post election has happened, do you understand what happens that is also a lam post, someone is my lam post, I am the leader whom you love, so I  I will also erect a lamp post and if you make him win then there is nothing in MP. If there is something in MLA, then they were told that you are such a mattress and a leader, then brother, go and win your MLA election, otherwise if someone asks, let the MP contest the MLA election. In the Government of India, a minister contesting the election of MLA is a demotion in a way, but it is being shown and it can also be set that brother, if you lose the election, then brother you  You were not worth anything, you were not a hero, so how much stake do you have? You did not see the leader under tension, who is the top National General Secretary, who is a big leader and he himself is speaking. Kailash Vishwa Vargiya ji is speaking himself, my friend.  I was not fighting, friend, if you made me fight then this is something which is interesting happening and I like this because I like this approach of the ruling party which is here that brother, it's different, it's not like that.  He should do something different like Dhoni, give the ball to Jogendra in the final of the last World Cup match, he makes it interesting, it does not make politics humiliating, this is off shock and off key politics, it is Chanakya type, it has links even to military Suzu. Okay, if you see the knowledge and you like it, now whoever is called Chanakya of India says that my name is also an incidental first name, we share it, okay, so there is something inside the name May B too.  If there is a measurement, then of course it can be any person with my name, which is my name, okay, first name, which is mine, do you know, I hope everyone knows my first name, I have just named the channel something else here. But I hope you know my first name, okay, this is the first name of many famous people and the translation of this my first name is limitless, there is no limit, now there is no limit in what, but you can do that, okay, very good, very  good strategy  According to me, this is a very good strategy, okay, and the next opponent who is fighting is my own, seeing his confidence level, I am getting excited, that means you will also bat, you will play 50 overs this time.  And it seems like this and I am having a lot of fun. One thing is that Shivraj ji has become a little na-ho. It seems to me that the meaning of chatu kata may not be the correct word but four or seven times CM.  Now when I tell you about Rajasthan, you will understand what hint I was giving about this thing. It's okay because there are no words about one thing, instead of saying much, my channel is for intelligent people and for an intelligent person, a hint is enough.  So from that alone you will understand, now coming to Rajasthan, it is tight here, Madhya Pradesh is tight, okay Rajasthan, which was always a flip flop, earlier this party, next year this party has been a trend, so in that, this is open and shut election.  To become  It should have been like they say, ladies' kitty party or something happens once in this house, once in this house, once in this house, something happens like this, then it should be set that now the next one, then after that, and so on. Rajasthan's result used to be going on like this for so many years but this time it cannot be told because they themselves say that many people can snatch defeat out of Jaws of Victory. It seems like the list is not coming out which ones.  wally end  Here I would like to speak, I would like to praise, I will show a little astrology and here I would like to praise a lady whose name is Vasundhara Raje Dabang Bhai, I enjoyed the body language and it is okay to do that, you do not find it anywhere else in India, now like  She is saying and saying that Bhaiya, I am not Yadur ji, Karnataka, understand that this is Rajasthan, the attitude of the Maharani is a different thing, maybe there is another Maharani too.  It is fine now but SN astrologer Neurol is telling me that you guys find out the date of birth of Vasundhara ji, all these eight number ones are neither difficult nor possible to suppress, defeat or compel them. My video of one number eight is very good.  If it is a super hit, then suddenly I was also not aware what is madam's birthday and I was like, this attitude is this attitude with others, so how can this happen? Ga Ga tells the date, tells the date of birthday and then aa se oh tata tina ho gaya mine I said astrology works is fine astrology works always it works fine people keep saying anything to it anyway look at the personality yes it was fun and  It is not there as I had told earlier, it is not there in Madhya Pradesh, it is there four times, or Dignity Grace, and what kind of story is here, the next party which is in power, I told you that it changes every year.  If it was there then there is no praise of him in it, but here that page is stuck, the list is not coming out, who will contest the MLA election, who will decide, Jaipur will decide what is the list or Delhi will decide, it has become interesting and this Indian  This is the high point of democracy, this is what I wanted, I had made videos earlier also, I had said that the problem in Indian democracy is that democracy is very good but the political parties are not there.  This is not democracy, this is democracy, this is what I want my country to be, that with the political parties there are people, they will do it like this, they will do it like that, why are you telling me, according to us, Rajasthan is like this, somewhere or the other there is something in it. So the camel will sit in Rajasthan also, the camel is famous somewhere, so if it sits on some force, then something or the other will happen, but whatever is interesting to us, as an audience, as public, as Indians, if  We are not from Rajasthan, if we were from Rajasthan, we would have had more emotions. Now if we are not going to go to Rajasthan and vote, but we are as Indians, as Indians, we have to see what is happening, now the party has also changed, now as if one  Jyoti Mirdha ji was in Congress for so long, her family has a lot of influence in Nagaur district, now she has joined BJP, so this party is changing, now she is leaving from there, now I don't understand a thing about the leaders.  to my  What does it mean to be yourself from within? Have you lived with someone for so many years? Now how come you are praised by others. It is like you are married with someone. And then you are like that I have been divorced. Which is? Okay, but on painful thing, as soon as you divorce like this, there is a period of pain and there is a period of pain. It means that a man divorces today and gets married tomorrow. Such people are of no use, I don't understand.  This is what we public need to learn from politicians. We are not condemning any politician or any politician. We need to teach the public that look brother, this is how it happens, why are we doing so much and if we go there and vote, then on what basis is the vote being done?  What is happening on the basis of caste, what is happening on the leader, what is happening on the intention, what is happening on what, ultimately whose loyalty is to be given to whom, what is to be done by the party, what is to be done by the leader because you are the leader, because we saw. Seen it in Madhya Pradesh, before that, seen it in Karnataka and other places. Vote for it, it goes here. Now what to do. There is comedy in Maharashtra, so it is not known who is in opposition. There is no opposition. Do you understand?  Baa, there is comedy happening with the public, he voted for this one, he went here, then he cast his name for this one, then he did that, beyond that, make a movie, otherwise that Malamaal weekly type ko movie will be made, meaning that Priyadarshan type that.  joe movies  It is made by Paresh Rawal or any welcome type or which is not this kind of comedy, situational comedy that is going here, the public is not understanding anything and whereas Mumbai of Maharashtra India is Mumbai, you know the financial capital of India.  You see how industrial and progressive India is, who according to you is coming to Rajasthan and who according to you is coming to Madhya Pradesh, I am saying touch and go, I feel like this. Both  Will the place be decided independently or will there be a party or something, that is probably what I am feeling, right now I am not feeling such a clear cut thing and when it is said that the problem is stuck, the problem is stuck and by doing this, Hindi newspapers and  Hindi channel people neither do these entangled elections nor do they enjoy covering them, analyzing them and understanding them and this is the beauty, it is like some people have not opened their cards, the rest are all counted.  Sitting like this, this one is mine, this one is mine, but those people in the middle 152 are fine, who can go anywhere, any way, this is democracy and democracy is the joy of others. I told that there is still someone somewhere inside the political parties.  Who has a backbone and whenever it is understood that she is a woman, then more respect increases, a lot of respect increases just because of the fact that she is there, I can hold on to her, this is her and  Ultimately, the public has to decide. Yes, it is not that simple, the public is not there. The good thing is that smart people are there. They also see the signals on daily basis, where they are going. Decisions will always be taken. This also helps the public to learn decision making capability. We will also get to learn whether ego is everything and if ego is everything then what is the result of it, will our life be destroyed at one time after drinking such a sip of our blood?  After getting the work done, something can be done. The smart people observe politics in this way. To grow in their life, those who are very open minded and keep making noise, they do not learn anything. Now we have to stop that.  What will be the next step? What will be the next step for Delhi? Will Jaipur decide the list? Will Delhi decide the list? Meetings are held as usual, I am not very extremely fund of news channels and all.  But many times the clippings that happen come on social media like if someone is getting down from the car, she is wearing a saree and how someone is looking, someone is getting down from the car and what kind of body language he is having, what calculations are going on, what is happening.  This is going to be a mystery thriller type, if you enjoy it this way and watch it this way, it can be very entertaining and this situation comes once in five years, so this is the time for the next five. Kumbh Mela of democracy is better than Kumbh Mela, not so many people come to Kumbh Mela, here it is 100 crores out of 140, so last time 61.5 crores had voted, this time  I think I think 80-90 crore people will vote, nothing can be bigger than this, so in the next seven months we have to enjoy, don't take stress and whatever is coming to you is happening.  You have to see what you feel, what do you want, don't write beyond that because it is going to happen, but it may happen according to you, you want this one to win but you feel that this brother is winning or this one is winning.  Whoever is giving competition, then write down what is going on according to you, then according to that, then we will see further when the elections will be held, now what are the exit polls, which are those polls? Opinion polls have not come, then those polls will come.  all that  Come, it is a matter of great joy and keep observing everyone, everyone will now know everyone's true character, whoever it is, because see, everyone keeps a mask, not only politicians, they keep it in homes too, mother too, father too, you too, boss too, but when the times of  When stress comes or time of reckoning comes, then that mask is removed, this is the time to see everyone's real face, after this it will not be seen again, so now everyone is removing it from everyone's face in such a way that it is actually behind.  What is there, see everything, make your notes and learn yours and also learn an art that how to put on the mask, how to remove it, how to see through the mask, when you learn these things then please share and like.  The channel does not have to take stress, the thing has to be understood like if political science is a subject then it does not mean that one has to become a politician, taking political science it helps us in understanding what is.  Happening around us it helps us understand that this is how it is happening, this is how it will happen in the future, how I can benefit from this and how I can see myself, what is the writing on the wall, where is the country going, how do I see myself  By what position can I get away from all these things in life and live my life, will this system continue like this, okay then please share, thank you very much."

    "title": "Who Is Winning In Maharashtra Elections ？ [6ID2lbPLm94].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, who is winning Maharashtra elections, let's talk about Maharashtra elections which are going to happen now when this video will be released and it will be very interesting the next day. Let me tell you right away that this and that is not so easy but still I will stick my  Neck out and predict and try to predict something and then on 23rd we will see how the result is, so let's start, first of all there is so much confusion in Maharashtra, two factions have become one.  By doing Maha Vikas Aghada Maha Maha, the confusion is fine, on one side we have our Uddhav Thackeray ji, it is fine by imposing UBT, on the other side, our Sharad Pawar ji and Congress people are one and here we know BJP, NCP and Sinde ji, those three are fine here.  If there are three more here, then who is winning? So before the Haryana elections, Maha Vikas Aghadi, which includes the group with Uddhav Bal Thackeray, the group with Uddhav ji, Congress and Sharad Pawar ji, they definitely had an edge, but Haryana's  Due to the overturned elections, doubts are created on everyone that Amit Shah ji can do something suddenly, if this happens then what is the status now, the wishes are different depending on what is your wish.  For example, in Haryana, even if someone's wish happens, everyone goes according to their wishes and the commentary also goes wrong. In Haryana, it was seen that many people were coming to the meetings of Congress and not to those of BJP.  were staying We came to know that when there is a silent voter and he does not go anywhere, he goes to his own country, but mine and the target of Haryana people have not been achieved yet and now there are elections, so there is a very close fight between three different factions, but  I do n't see BJP rising much in this election, I will try to tell that if Mahavikas Aghadi has won a clear cut, suggest that they have won cleanly, they have 288 MLAs, total will be 145, then then  What is the matter that they have reached 160, 170, 180. Okay, then there is no problem, but what is the job of BJP to close it? BJP is like to emerge as the single largest party because it is fighting close to 160 seats.  If we are fighting the most, then even if the strike rate decreases, the chances are still very high. Otherwise, if the result is completely opposite, then something else can also be seen, but what Chief?  BJP's minister will be BJ, currently four candidates are visible from BJP's side, Devendra Farnabus is fine, Sinde ji is his own assistant chief minister and from Ajit Pawar, we are hearing that brother, he will not be a king maker but will become a king.  So there are three from one side and from their side Uddhav Thackeray ji has said that they have also said among themselves that if ours gets the maximum seats then they will make it.  There is not so much fight here, the stakes of dyspareunia are there in Mumbai and Uddhav Thackeray ji said that we will not do this in Dharava, we will not do this there, we will not do that, from him we also heard from Ajit Pawar ji that the last time is 2019.  There was a meeting in which Adani ji was also there, when issues were being raised in the government formation, Sharad Pawar ji was also there, Ajit ji was also there and they all told that Adani ji also has a role.  So one thing for me, if I look at the questions in IM, what are the questions, if you go into [ __ ] etc., then set the toli by netting, if someone has attempted that, brother, this cannot be possible, if this is so, then what are the options?  So I feel that no matter how the situation arises, the main purpose will be that Uddhav Thackeray ji should not be allowed to become the Chief Minister. Whatever may be the result, whichever way the result may come, the condition of BJP is becoming the same. Its condition in Maharashtra is similar to that in Bihar, although it is a big party there but it is not able to come to power on its own nor is it able to make the Chief Minister and I see the same thing being repeated here, so I feel that the first thing is that even Devendra Fadnavis is not  Will become the Chief Minister? First, I made names of four ministers and told them who could be there. I said that no matter what the result is, Uddhav Thackeray ji should not be allowed to become the Chief Minister. Now, I don't know that they are being elected among themselves.  Is it or all these are mixed, that's why I did not make many videos earlier, on this people were saying Sir, make Maharashtra, you had made Haryana because now it seems that there is a lot of match fixing, many times I jokingly say that the status  Whose video should I make? BJP is intoxicated, Congress is unconscious. BJP is intoxicated. Do you agree with this and Congress is unconscious? Congress feels like it can surrender 10, 12, 15 seats. Some such happiness is here.  It has been explained in this way in Haryana that there are some people in Congress, I am not talking about Congress, the top leader, Rahul Gandhi ji, is not surrendering, but at the bottom, it is not known to whom they give seats to him and  He keeps checking that yes, he will lose this election, if he does n't put in much effort, then 10 because many times, if there is more incentive in losing the election, then what will he do after winning, sometimes this also happens, so I think Sharad Pawar  Who  His party is waging a tough fight with all its might and will also give a tough fight to Uddhav Thackeray. Congress is standing weak in the tough fight, because whatever election this is, you will believe it till now, whatever is there, it will win 15 to 20 seats.  The whole system has to be in the middle, which will weigh the scales. I don't think that any one faction will take 200 seats and the other will be reduced to 88. The matter here has to be such that whoever comes will get 155 seats.  135 There has to be a similar system of 15-20 seats. Now the problem in that is that BJP 's problem is that they will have to depend on Shinde ji and Ajit Panwar, but their aim will be that if one of them depends on them.  One has to be dependent and they get the choice, I am batting mostly for BJP, then I can become their Chief Minister and they can call the shots, for example if  BJP 's minimum target should be that if they are fighting on 160 seats then if their 100 seats come in three digits then they should emerge as a clear cut winner or even if they have come with 100 seats then they are 8, 10, 11, then always your small party or someone else.  There will be independent class who do not belong to any of these six names, so if BJP hits 110, 111, then if Sinde ji's  If 35 come, let's say 30 come, then if they come close to 144, then who will not be more of a nuisance, Ajit Pawar or something like this in front of Ajit Pawar, even if Sinde comes less or comes with his, then it will not matter.  No, because we have seen that 1015 MLAs can be removed easily and when 2025 comes, we have seen how they were done, those issues are no more, people say that morality is no more, people.  People are also not judging on morality, these days people say yes, break it, do whatever you want to do, beyond that these people are saying that there is no issue, it is not there, like in Haryana they were thinking that there will be some issue of wrestler and that of ladies.  In any practical way, when there is a vote, we have seen that there is nothing, Ladli Brahmin Yojana, whatever has been put in place, Ladla Bhau, Ladli Brahmin and the utensils and all this that is being distributed, it is making a lot of difference.  What is coming from the ground, you people who are from Maharashtra, tell me which way do you see the election going. There are many people who dislike BJP and Eknath Sinde and Ajit Panwar, they are very vocal and those who are vocal are not.  They are heard more, this was also happening in Haryana, whoever was criticizing was vocal and the rest were watching them because now see, in the elections also the same thing was done here that if one is there then it is safe, although the Prime Minister's  Speak  It is very unfortunate that the Prime Minister has to say like this, one is safe, is Rahul Gandhi fake or what does it mean, what has he made up, that means as one is the top leader, everyone should be kept safe. Whom are you trying to unite? You also unite here, you are their Prime Minister and no such Prime Minister has ever done this in the entire independent India and we let this thing get away because we like, accept Hindutva as BJP and but it.  Sometimes  It should be said that no, this much opening up and saying 'butt will be cut' was too much for Maharashtra, that's why I had to make another coin that the one from UP will be cut, that is, it will be cut, that is, it will literally be cut, I do n't know what will happen to BJP by making so much noise.  They are doing all the same things, it is okay to scare and there is fun in scaring, isn't it? Actually, votes go that way and people want free seeds, which Congress used to do, they used to say while distributing 'Rewari', I want to address that here.  Those who talk about Congress like this, distribute it for free to the middle class audience, brother, they say the same, BJP people distribute it, so both are no different, no one's heart is beating for the middle class, for which my core audience and what I am.  When I make videos, there is a helplessness like that of a middle class person, if someone comes and wants to go anywhere, the same happened last time also, it can happen even today that if Ajit Pawar has 20 MLAs.  If he comes and has 1015 MLAs, he can go to his uncle and say, 'Brother, make me the CM and he will also make me the CM. People with Mahavikas are saying that it is okay, the age is long, BJP is not coming to power, you are 15 20 MLAs. You become the Chief Minister or something like this can happen, although it is tough to go because there were cases etc. going on against him, but clean cheat has been given in the cases, but even the clean cheat is not known who.  It is given along with it that subject to conditions, this can also happen, if Sinde ji also jumps, if she is made the CM, then it also appears to her that if I have brought 40 MLAs, then I will become the CM because I  I was a CM earlier also and if you will not make me the CM, then Uddhav Thackeray ji's offer has come that Eknath ji should come back, even if he keeps his party separate, please become our CM, then BJP has to see if BJP.  If BJP's seats fall below 90, then the matter seems to be complicated. I don't see BJP winning any of the seats in this election, which means I don't see the government winning even on B. If such a situation has been created then it is an advantage.  In a way, it seems that if the opposition plays its cards well, then either BJP wins 110 seats on its own or some magic happens and then it becomes clean because then among them  Taking out something from MLS 10 122 By the way, you have reached 120 anyway, if you want to touch the figure of 144 then you can also say that Cinde ji, you go where you want to go and if you don't go, then you will get the same pieces and  The work will be done only with Ajit Pawar. We will tell Ajit Pawar not to consider himself a hero. If we work with Shande ji then the choice will increase but as soon as his seats are below 90. So they don't have a choice, then Eknath Shiji and Ajit Pawar ji's will work, so I am using it the most, as they say, I have to put something in, so I am thinking that only Eknath Sinde ji will continue me like this.  It seems that now he will become CM with BJP or he can become CM by going to Maha Vikas vehicle, anything can happen, once a place can go from here to here, then what is there in returning home that we felt like it was a mistake. happened and we will and let's  If you make me the CM then it will be seen if it can happen then I am looking at the highest probability of becoming the CM and I can you know I call me Humble Pie, it is very fun to do it in English, it is okay in Haryana too.  It seemed as if the world would win. What was different about me? Although I used to say in every video that the fun will come only when there will be a close match. While doing the close match, he hit so many sixes and fours in the 19th over. Congress got them beaten and that's it, they became the other wise. Haryana elections are still very close. 48 seats are of BJP, 37 are of Congress and all three were independents who later supported BJP, but out of 48, brothers and sisters, six less.  If there were six more Congress seats then there were 43 Congress seats and out of six, they lost by 32 seats. Congress would have lost by 32 votes, not by 32 seats.  Have you ever heard that if someone had got people to vote even in the street behind one house, he would have won 32 votes because a lot of people had collected. A lot of money is going on in Maharashtra elections. A lot of money is going on in Maharashtra elections. Some of the real estate after Maharashtra elections.  It would be good if anyone wins because, it would be better for a particular person to win than a particular person, so I am mine, my wish and mine is that of Eknath Sinde ji, if you say that brother, you win this, he wins.  Then when the results will come on 23rd, we will see what happens to Devendra Fadnavis. One more thing is that whether he will not become the CM or not, it is my speculative thing that I feel that maybe Amit Shah ji might not want him because he should be made the Deputy CM.  It was also a thing that till date we have never heard that someone remains the CM and then becomes the Deputy CM and even if he becomes the party's leader, then it means that if 110 seats are 105 110  If BJP goes above 100 from 115 seats and if BJP's CM is not made then BJP workers will be very angry and rested. Okay and then if he is made in it then it will be difficult for the top leadership to answer that you are surrendering but.  If BJP's performance is low, it is seen going below 90 85 80 or below, then it can be said that you have not performed well in the exam, brother, it is a compulsion to come to power.  So brother Eknath Sinde ji or anyone else will have to be made like this, what is the choice because if it is like Eknath Sinde ji is like to become Nitish Kumar of Bihar, you can also see the meaning of Nitish Kumar, he becomes CM by taking 40-45 some MLAs. Every time, whoever Nitish will be with because there is the same shortage there, there is the same shortage in Bihar that there is something of 120 21 MLAs, my my  If I think about the cut off then everyone does not come with 7080 in it, then where Nitish goes with 45, he becomes there, then sometimes with less you are better, then I see Shinde ji becoming. How is Nitish Kumar personally? What is he, what kind of person is he?  Those who are our people of Maharashtra will tell us in the comment section how do you like this thing. The scheme that they have done has helped many people on the ground because many people like me.  I do consultation and work etc. PSU bankers are very worried. I don't sleep for last three months in Maharashtra. Money keeps increasing till 11 pm. It is fine there, that is, so much work has been done, that is why the elections were also delayed there because of release.  BJP is benefiting from this and now you can see that elections will be won and fought in the same way. Earlier they used to say that they distributed Revdi there, now they distributed Revdi there, now all this is the same.  Will take 1500, take 2100, now we will increase it to this much, the middle class will work and pay taxes and the politicians will keep coming to power by giving money to all the poor, then at least the middle class does not need to become cheer leaders of BJP.  In vain and the work of Congress is also the same, now all the politicians are alike, whatever the Congressmen write in their manifesto, like what they wrote in Haryana, they will give like this or whatever they say.  BJP tells stories from the stage, BJP does that, BJP gives that in actual, yes, okay, you are saying this, take it, you are saying this, just take that in between, this religion is in danger, this religion is in danger, that one, everything.  They keep going on amongst themselves that nothing is in danger, no, the Constitution is in danger, everyone knows that religion is in danger, yes, but they keep saying and normally people are not too enamored by that too, nowadays even they are tired, so that's it.  Now this one will work, then some more syllabus will be known, these then some more syllabus will be known, now if the politicians are only working on this one, then after the elections in Maharashtra, they will pick up the pace of the economy because there has been nothing for the last 10 months.  This is happening in Maharashtra only preparations are being made, first there were those elections in Lok Sabha, the condition of BJP and both its parties was very bad, but then they continued with their 'Laadli Bahana'.  The focus which was on the economy has been removed because Maharashtra is in election mode since last six months. Last I am not in the last six seven months, take seven eight months. Maharashtra is in election mode, so now whatever government is formed, now do that work.  If it starts then that is good news for it. Real estate is very affected when a government is not working properly, the focus should be somewhere else, now it will be better, what are the activities there? I will keep bringing things on Sango Real Estate on my separate channel. If you are not a subscriber of Sango Real Estate which is my pure real estate channel, then please bring it to me from Sango Real Estate. Subscribe there you will get opportunities and things coming. You will definitely enjoy watching. Thank you very much. If you have not subscribed to the channel then please subscribe and  There is a request to everyone who is watching this video to add one subscriber as soon as possible so that the figure of 50000 can be touched quickly. Right now we have come within striking distance before the election results of Maharashtra.  You can hit till 50000, this will be my target, every subscriber who increases should increase it. Videos are very good, political ones are also coming latest. Whatever issues are there, they are also coming and some of my old special videos are also coming. One half told me, 'This is old, first show me brother, you are the one who has watched Suryavansham 1.5 crore times, I have such wonderful videos on Zee Cinema, the world.'  The one who is giving so much solace is facing difficulty in revising it by seeing it again. This is very wrong. What is this book of ours? The books of very good knowledge are always quoted, don't you wish for the results?  don't do karma  Do your work, do n't wish for the fruit, the same thing over and over again, I have shown one half of mine to many people who are old, this is not running out of content, petrol does not run out here, but there are many revisions too.  You have to teach the seventh chapter, then it's 12th, forget the seventh, it's the final exam, then do it again, these are the take aways and the most interesting thing is that every video has a relevance and the message.  Many a times, the same content changes with time and this is very beautiful. I will close by telling you one thing, like if you read a very beautiful book, then when you were young, what did you read in 242 years and what take away did you take from it and  You have done the same thing in your life, after 40 years, the same book, the same author, the same content hits you in a different way and that is with me, this is not a very high level content, everyone's desi ghee of mine is not digested.  So it will be fun, some videos will keep coming in between, okay, we listen to the old songs too and the chains of my heart are still heard by Kishore, they were heard earlier also, new ones also come, very new ones also come, so one  It will be like a buffet so that to digest my political content, like many times a person needs some salad and salad, so that it remains clean in the stomach, then that content is necessary because that content.  With whatever is happening in our life and we should keep the focus on our own life, you will get a better understanding, it will be absolutely pure. If we focus 100% on politics then a negativity becomes the default setting because like you Modi ji.  If you say something like this then people become sad. If you give good praise to someone else or do it to someone else then that's that thing in it like the whistle of a pressure cooker. The videos tell you to calm down then come and then consume it.  I am having a lot of fun. My request is, in the comment section, if you increase one subscriber, write plus one. If you increase two, write plus two. I am not requesting more than that, brother, increase it by one or two, increase it within the family. Tell me friend, consume this, tell the content to your friends, friend, please add, okay, so that till the elections, it will be a lot of fun in 50000, 50000, it will be a lot of fun, okay after that. You become a very serious player. If you are a little below youtube1, it seems that it means you will not be able to become the CM. In 50 seat Maharashtra, even the one with 40 seats can become the CM. To me, you people, you see, now this result will come on 23rd. Whoever has written before 22nd and if it is correct then please tell me because look, there are only 5-6 players, we cannot become more than that, I am from Congress, so perhaps I don't see becoming CM, brother, I don't know, Congress is doing something. Congress doesn't look like that if it does too much, I always feel that it performs like South Africa, okay fours and sixes in the end like you saw in India's World Cup final, I see Congress like this because somewhere or the other  So they have some or the other match fixing, whether you look at the result of Maharashtra, sorry, Madhya Pradesh, look at Rajasthan, look at Haryana, they do not seem to be putting any effort into me, at some places, at the last moment, something like this happens, they slow down the car.  like in formula one Don't slow down a bit and someone goes ahead and then say oh, this was such a mess, this was so fast, this was so, nothing happens to them, so that's why I feel Congress is tough, although it is fighting on the maximum number of seats.  I think on 103 etc, Uddhav Thackeray ji can become CM if he becomes CM and Devendra Fernway is there and Eknath Sinde and Ajit Pawar are outside chances too. They are saying that I will go with 20 MLAs, now that.  One thing is the noise, after this election either Ajit Pawar's party will end or Sharad Pawar's party will end, one of them will end, one of these two will have to be thanked, whose will it be, analyze us 23  We will do it in November because it is possible that if the power clear cut goes towards BJP and Ajit Pawar takes away this title with 10 MLAs, then the MLAs of Sharad Pawar group will run towards Ajit Pawar because no one has been away from power for so many years.  Ca n't stay and Ajit Pawar's MLAs can also run away. On Sharad Pawar's side, how is it depending on the situation because when there are 202 MLAs, it is easy to run away. Okay, it is also easy to run away. Sent somewhere in a resort in a single bus, in a small plane.  It has been sent, okay, these tasks will also be seen to be done, it will all be comedy and fun, so let's see because I am not seeing a clear cut, earlier there was a time that this car which was MVA, which was ours, was clearly visible ahead. However, there are still a lot of YouTubers who are showing that BJP should lose but it is feeling like déjà vu. Those exact same stories were heard in Haryana elections also, but now every big public is also there and everyone is, right brother you?  BJP cannot be attacked like this because RSS people go to every house day and night and they also narrate their stories well and the same has to be played on 2-4 percent vote bank. You should see that there is an impact in the voting percentage also. And Maharashtra also has to be studied, there is no one Maharashtra, there is Maratha region, there is Vidarbha region, there is Mumbai region, there is upper and lower state, it is a very big state, people do not know how many places there are, people from outside know the names of five and six from Maharashtra.  Okay, but Maharashtra is a very big place, where is the fight so tight and the results of the elections are very different between 2 to 5000 votes and 2 to 5000 votes are actually in a fight because they have fielded a dummy candidate. Everyone is cutting amongst themselves too. There are insecurities among themselves too. There are insecurities among Shiv Sinda and Shiv Sena Sinde group. There are insecurities that BJP may not come as many as us, perhaps we may become less and if we do not win there then there is a lot of competition among them and no one else can go anywhere.  It's just that BJP and Congress may not sit together and form a party, otherwise if Congress and BJP unite then they will definitely win. Whatever results will come in this one is fine, other than that, there is someone else somewhere else. Can it go? Is this thing and how will it go? What will go? We will see and money and business and business interest will drive this because Gujarat lobby and Maharashtra lobby have also been played. There is Mumbai's old money which is Bombay wala which is now used by those businessmen.  I do n't take the name because now the name is taken publicly only of our dear Gautam Andani ji, so everyone takes it as if yes, he is on the other side, on the other side too, on the other side too, because this one, this one is also powerful. These are the old ones, Mahara of Maharashtra also used to speak of Bombay, Gujarat always felt for so many years that Bombay did not come to us when the partition took place, so this one is Gujarat lobby and this one is also going on, let's see the best. We will analyze person win and 23rd. If you feel like doing it live then we will do it live if you want because I like it very much. If you want to do live etc. then tell me what will happen on that day. That day will be Saturday.  It will be a bit tough for us because we do some things but still we will try to do live on the election results. If the only thing is to reach 50000 subscribers, there are still five days, there is only one day, you have to increase only one subscriber, you have to increase so many people.  Will listen to the video 10 155 Hajj people listen to the video Minimum on an average becomes more Many times if you increase it by just one then our government will become 000 people so try whatever you can  Please increase it, please write in the comment section. I want to increase it by subscribing like this. Ok, thank you very much."

    "title": "Why All Indians Shoud Thank Deputy CM Of Rajasthan？ [5gJeGzH4-a0].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, this is a very important video, watch it completely because you will understand politics very well from this, there will be many takeaways from it, the whole country, we all Indians, all of us, we should thank Rajasthan Deputy CM Premchand Bairwa ji of Rajasthan who is the Deputy CM of Bharatiya Janata Party. Clapping for the deputy CM of the popular government in Rajasthan, first of all he will tell what the clapping is for, okay it is not in the government's jam, actually clapping has to be done, though it is a bit like that but still clapping is required because he is a very clean hearted man.  You do not find such politician brothers and sisters, when you see a politician it seems that he will talk in a roundabout way, will be erudite, will be politically correct, so he is a very clean hearted person but this is all the praise, now the next thing is the take away and the people who talk about it  If anyone knows what happened then it is very good, otherwise I will tell you in brief that the son of the Deputy CM, who is not even 18 years old, is driving an open jeep, making reels without wearing a seat belt and police escort is going behind, it is against the law  the whole glory of  It is a minor driving the car without a license and there is a police escort behind him. Take away one, is this the police, is it the police of India, especially in BJP ruled states like it has happened in Rajasthan, we have seen in Orissa that soldiers are beaten up  Is it just this or is it the protection of the law? The law is being violated in front of you and you are skirting it. A CA or an employee dies while working, an HDFC employee pays tax and brothers and sisters, this is done with the tax payers money.  The work is going on and he is saying, thank you Modi Ji, you made me the deputy CM so that my son can drive like this. I am surprised. I am surprised. This is Modi Ji's dialogue. I have just moved him. I say this is nothing of mine, Modi ji gets surprised at everything, he always says in his own words, if you look at his speech, he always says like this, somewhere or the other I am surprised, you are not surprised at these things, Modi ji  Modi ji is saying thank you by taking your name. He is saying thank you because you have given thanks to such low IQ people.  He is made to sit here and they shut up their tongue saying that okay if something happened then they can keep quiet, he is saying that he himself is the transport minister, deputy CM of Rajasthan and he is saying that what happened in this is okay, what happened in this is okay brothers. Sisters you tell me this then the Porsche case Pune case was also fine what happened he is driving here the police is doing the scam brothers sisters and now there will be a twist in the story now you people in the twist of this story because some people got irritated Why are you bringing Modi ji, you are against the BJP, you are a Congressman, the Congress MLA, who is a Congress leader, his son was also sitting next to him in the car, so brothers and sisters, the take away from this is that Congress is also friends with the BJP and you are in the family.  You are getting separated in the family, some like Modi ji, some like BJP, some are not saying anything, friendship has been made in this country, whether friendship has broken in the homes or not, you tell me there is tension among the relatives, people argue in the house, Miya  Even the wife thinks that you are like this, these days it happens in weddings that you are a devotee, meaning it is a promo or NT Modi If both of them get separated then the marriage will not happen by doing this and see, the people of Rajasthan have to turn the tables in 5 years, then this friendship is complete, only then no one will make much noise there and the Congress leader too has said the name of Bhardwaj ji in the interview You have to melt their burden, you will see a lot of videos because I should put them all here, the ABP news person is asking good questions, ABP people also deserve credit, whoever believes in whatever, is asking good questions, yes, nothing wrong happened  The car was like this, it was a vintage car, drive it, anyone can drive your car and now he is roaming around buying a Defender, people are making memes of it, the kids of these politicians are cutting so many glasses and unemployment is increasing so much here, you are shameless politician  Ho, you can loot the country if you want to. Okay, whatever you want to do, if you want to loot, do it, make a reel of it, why are you rubbing salt in the wounds and crazy people even comment on this, oh what is he driving, I am not driving this car But I come back again for the third take  Oh, what is this police of our country, it is there to give trauma to the common man that when the common man goes to lodge a complaint in the Orissa case at night, they do something to him that after seeing that one case, the person says that something should happen to me. If I go and get beaten up by the police, they will put me in jail and they are busy serving these people, then who is at fault in this, who should be insulted the most in this entire episode, whose fault is it of Modi ji, Modi ji  His only fault is that he has filled his entire army with such people who will now embarrass him. This idealist speaking class of the deputy CM should not be held, he should be dismissed. Vasundhara Raje was a strong leader, she would have run Rajasthan well by selecting everyone properly.  There was a lot of insecurity among leaders. Modi ji has insecurity. Some people have brains, some are a bit arrogant, some have their own kind of personality, I don't like all of them. That is why he said with so much honesty that Modi ji, thank you for making me his deputy. My son was made CM  If he will cut glasses and loot, then this is now an embarrassment to Modi ji, I do n't know who has the courage, but it is not entirely Modi ji's fault, it is not Modi ji's fault, there are leaders of both Congress and BJP, Congress leader will also defend it  He is doing this to Bedgi and it happened like that, okay you have made so many friends, what will happen to his career as well, we will see, okay is it the deputy CM's fault, yes it is his fault as well that he did not spoil his child like this because on s The rule is that if you are driving without a license, then father will be caught. Father was arrested in the Porsche case or not. It was the Pune Porsche case. Okay, whatever happened, it is all a mistake, but whose mistake is the biggest? It is the police's mistake.  What is happening in front of them should be prevented, the law binder will say, friend, don't do this, don't make a reel wheel, don't do this, call the father there, the Deputy CM, your son is doing this and it will be revealed in public, this  I am not feeling right and don't let it go, but still whose mistake is it the biggest, it is yours, brothers and sisters.  And mine is of our people, we the sovereign, we are the masters of this country, the politicians are our servants and the police is in the grip of politicians, the police beats the army, the soldiers and does not give justice to any normal man and they are slaves of the politicians  Like we see, politicians are supposed to be under us, but we dare to perform their aarti, we say that they have done Khamma Gan to everyone, by doing this we live in such a fear that if we say anything to Modi ji, now this is how it is to live in Haryana Many discussions were going on, there was someone, there was an elderly woman, so what is Modi's fault in this, brother, the leader is very good, it is an amazing thing, what is our fault, I will link it to the Haryana elections later, separate videos will come, but this video  It was very important brother, it is the fault of the public, what do the public have to do, the public has to get politicized in a massive way, I too, brothers and sisters, used to think a year or four years ago, why do we have to come into politics, but brother, now there is no way to survive in this country, they have made the syllabus like this what was it before, we used to eat and drink something outside Elections used to happen every 5 years, some things were good, some were bad, sometimes happy, sometimes sad, life was going on, but BJP did not leave the country like this, they said, son, all of you come into politics, if we talk about politics then what should we do  Yes, we all want to become politicians. Am I also a politician? If I talk about politics, I speak ill of some people, speak good of others, and from now on start influencing votes also, depending on what you like. Here I am I am not saying that you have to be anti-Congress or pro-BJP, it is your intelligence, discretion and consciousness, but start tightening them, I will tell you what we have to do, BJP, Congress, these are the main parties of the country, democracy has to be put in them. They are not allowed to do devotion, is the BJP president not getting elected, are they waiting for 20th October, will Sanjay Joshi become the president, what will happen, we will see further, you see that there are two parties in Britain, even in the US there are only two there  He does not go around taking 50 people from one party to another but he has a party inside him  There is a lot of democracy, if somebody talks nonsense, he is removed and the best person emerges from him and if there is democracy in both the parties, the filth that is there in both the parties, in terms of mind, behavior, thinking, that is there in both the parties, this  If we make it clear ourselves then only the good leaders should come to the top, then brother, after that sometimes this one comes, sometimes that one comes, it will not be bad for the country if anyone comes as per his wish, but here all the leaders who never  There is no need to go anywhere for 20 years, 25 years. Talking about the next 2047, a program for 15 years is set and an army of all idiots and if you talk to them, it feels like if you tell this to their son, then you are speaking against papa ji and you cannot tell him, why? We cannot say this. We have to save democracy within the parties. There is no democracy in any political party. Look at Trin Nul Congress, look at BJP, everywhere one leader has taken hold and done it everywhere. Even inside Congress, we know that the family rules.  But at least you can find his name there  Let us see, we have seen in Haryana also, there is some sulking, appeasing, protesting, so if some spark of democracy is visible in all the parties, I would say it is visible in Congress, but that too is very less, there is no praise, it is not passing clean. There is no cheating going on but it is very important to bring a dissenting voice into the party. In BJP, no one has the courage to speak. No one has the strength. Yes, it is very good. Everyone is having a lot of fun. Everyone is making money because of Haryana elections.  We are waiting for the results, in that everyone is drawing swords like this and then after Maharashtra, you will see what will happen, I hope it will be okay, if they do something then RSS is there too, if they want to put Sanjay Joshi 's name  Many people are feeling the heat because of the Gujarat lobby, the Gujarat lobby and beyond this, now we will have to openly discuss what is happening with many things, which I myself see, this was my opinion three-four years ago  It was there even 2 years ago but it is changing because of the new Facts are getting merged, this is what I tell you people, as if some things change, you need to change the facts and we have made such people sit on the post of deputy CM, you see, if I ask you today who is the chief minister of Gujarat  I don't know, just tell you people without mistaking it and write whether I knew it or not without mistaking it and you do n't need to get angry over it, meaning you do n't need to feel bad that you do n't know the name of the CM of Gujarat because he  Brother, he is not seen doing anything, then how would he know the name. Everyone has been made to sit idle like this, Vasundhara Raje, Shivraj Singh Chauhan is sitting idle, you don't know what is happening under compulsion, and those who came out of the Congress, Hemant Vishwa Sharma, got them even more infuriated.  The moral of the BJP workers is so low these days and there are a lot of smart people in the BJP too, why wouldn't they be, friend, I myself know so many people who are very smart but they are so drunk that they cannot be seen, poor thing, and all of them are  You made people sit in your place, brother, when you are an idiot then one thing you should not do is so stupid that you don't even know that you are an idiot  At least shut your tongue, who will put a mike in your mouth and tell you to get out, you know if something happens then sit with an upset stomach for two days, no news lasts for more than two days in India brother, if something happens somewhere, go underground  Who will ask, the security will not let you come inside the house, tell them that the minister has an upset stomach, by then some other news will come in 48 hours, the media will go somewhere else, they have so much staff, they will keep playing hide and seek outside, but Bhai Saheb, this is openly his  It means that these politicians think the public is fool and if the public too does not raise an uproar then the public is fool according to me brother, misuse of police, misuse of law, different laws for them for everything, different laws for the common man, the common man is scared.  Wherever you go, you should not see the face of the police. You are wearing the seat belt. You have the vehicle papers. You were driving at the correct speed. Whatever it was, the police will stop you. Show your power, show your attitude like this, like this and  Whereas it has been made against him that even if someone says something  If I am not doing any mistake then don't stop anyone like that, if you see something is wrong then don't just go on like this, this is a very very very important thing, call out this nonsense, no matter whose it is, unfortunately the army of idiots is more visible inside the BJP because  All of them left because no entrance test was taken. Now, in order to increase the subscriber base, I make up any theory that appeals to the masses. People with mass appeal also come to me to present item numbers because on me here  I do one thing that not many people can understand and in order to increase their subscribers everyone will abuse me in the same way, if they don't abuse then they will write such comments that decent people will abuse like if I say this to someone, those people  Like many people say that Modi ji is like this, Rahul ji is like this, then why does Modi ji say this, he deserves it, why not, friend, he is my prime minister, he deserves it, why will I not, otherwise many will write Rahul ji, why not Rahul  yes Priyanka ji Arvind Kejriwal ji everybody is happy Why ca n't you tell us in a civilized manner, it is the same thing that if you say anything against Modi ji then people who speak indecent language against Modi ji will come in the comment section, then they will scold you and filter you, I don't want such supporters.  There is no such thing as anti-anyone here, I am interested in the dialogue that is taking place, I am not interested in the controversy, whatever is there is important, who is saying what is important, all the leaders should have a basis, I said that these leaders  There should also be an Aadhaar, but it should be known that brother, see, the heart beats for the boy, it is a good thing, the people of Haryana and Rajasthan beats for their boy, witch is a very good thing, okay, I don't call this nepotism, but you are spoiling the law and order  We will not follow the order and then what are you showing, what are you showing that the children of politicians can do anything and look at the condition of the police, the worst condition is of the police, now I see this happening in the coming time that  I don't know if people would even want to join because unfortunately the way is police  The image is being created in the country that now whether one will be able to marry this person or not, what will happen, this is happening, there was a time when my heart used to beat a lot, I used to feel sympathy that so what if the friend has become a policeman  I mean it does n't matter what their life is, nobody police is supposed to be there, who will protect the law and all that, he used to do this but now if you ask an average man, a policeman should check his survey that brother, the police leadership is in senior positions, do you think  You don't feel from within that you should get respect in this country. You are on default setting, on default setting, without any effort till someone does that and they are the ones who create problems in some department or organisation everywhere. But what has happened to the police?  That we cannot expect any good behavior from the police and every big person has written such words which even I feel are strong words, I have written in the comment section, which I had said last time, I again ask that to the police  What feeling does one get after seeing this  Bhai had written that I feel disgusted, it is really a strong and bad word but then people are using it, it means they are like, there is one called do n't like, there is one called dislike, there is one called not interested, there is one that hates.  If we have reached this level, then is there no need for police reforms in this country? I mean if someone takes the data of police that the British police which were again Indians were more trained or the police of today, then in my opinion there is not much difference.  You won't see it, the job of the police is like this, they just scold and beat him, oh friend, why should a law abiding citizen be afraid, why should he hate, he should say that yes, soldiers, what mistakes do not happen in the army, those in the army  They are employees, they do not have any special doings, they too have some because if there is an army of 12, 14, 15 lakhs, then there will be something somewhere but in the default setting, on seeing a soldier, love and respect comes in the heart and it feels like that our soldier brother what am I to do  I can or I get such a feeling, a good feeling, why doesn't this come in the police, some percentage of this should come, let's say for the army, if it is 80 or 90 out of 100, then it will be less for the police, but in the police, it was almost zero.  want to give I want to ask very clearly to the audience, everyone is educated, I am a guruji, I should not be judgmental, I am interested in raising issues, police brother, someone is watching us, these are someone's children, you are doing a very good job According to me, but if you are in any organisation, don't you feel that you are supposed to be duty bound to increase that element of respect by working, I am sure lots of people are doing this, but it comes on social media, no, it is like this, a  It is not two, some good news should be seen coming, bad news is also coming, well now we cannot stop all the bad news but some good news should also be coming, see, is there any PR in this police, there is no PR of the police  If someone is doing something for the image of the police, then reforms are needed in that, I am guiding you all, write in the comment section your opinion about the police on a scale of 10. On a scale of 10, where does zero mean a lot?  It is a bad opinion of 10 means brother, I do n't know which kind of police we see, like the one in America, ok you have your hands down and they are scared, the criminals are scared, if we believe that kind, then it could be a crime.  There might be some in that too, I don't have any personal experience there, it's okay but let's imagine that she looks big to us, well dressed up, fat equipment, good way of speaking, there are videos inside the US, if the policeman stops her like this, then the guy is sitting inside with a camera like this  Put his message or I card, which means a citizen can ask whether you are a policeman or not, show me your I card, suppose to show that yes I am so and so, anyone can do anything by wearing the uniform, that is the process and  So much  There is clarity among the people there and they don't start fighting, how did you ask for it, come out, I will beat you with sticks and show it properly, I tell the paper, ok show me this show, ok my lawyer told this, they also know the law, us citizen gets what he deserves  will show him the papers, ok, it's not over here, someone stops someone, someone gives it to someone, instead of showing the card, he shows something else, someone is looking at something else, what has happened to my status, friend, what has happened to my status, many times I tell the police I say, I am saying this with great intimacy that brother what is this, we are all shocked, such a leader has done this to the police, the police is busy in flattering the leader, the whole culture is such that if we make you then this  People of the community will say taata teena, make me also Modi ji, you made me, I too have had my share of the glory, so he is a good man brother, he is a deputy CM by nature, but he deserves to be in a constitutional post, that is also sure, by the way, he is clean at heart.  That we too can enjoy  Modi ji, it is because of you that we got the chance, otherwise what chance would we have got, you should have made Vasundhara ji, Vasundhara ji knows every inch of us, Vasundhara ji did not have to make us anything while she was there  If something had to happen, Vasundhara ji would have tightened the administration and made people good, she knows it because she is the class monitor of Rajasthan, she knows who has what talent in BJP, it is like this here  He becomes chief minister for one and a half years and runs away six months before the elections. Now even Modi does not greet him on stage. Who is this CM? Do you know his name? Write in the comment section. Elections are about to come, interesting times are about to come, fights are about to come.  Don't do politics in your homes, these BJP and Congress boys have moved around in the same car, there is no need to fight in their circle, and whoever is in Congress today, may be in BJP tomorrow, whoever is in BJP today, may be in Congress tomorrow, so when  These leaders do not belong to anyone, then why are they Why are you becoming one who is loyal, you should be loyal to your parents, be loyal to your wife, be loyal to the flood, I hope the Rajasthani people also understand a little, please you are Rajasthanis, wake up and take out your pride, Rajputana is such an old kingdom, at least do something of your own  Take out your pride, whom do you make, what is the law for you, then either say this, Rajasthan, it does not matter to us, the road is open, someone can drive it, then pass a law in the assembly that brother, children of ministers below 18 years of age can drive because  His skill set is much better and he deserves it and the escort will not allow him to speed too much, his children can drive, your children will drive toy cars, their children will drive real cars, who knows, Maranadu sahab's child is coming  So clear the road brother please, you are common people, friend, these people think of themselves as kings, the king died many years ago, still that pillar of the village man is there, why is this kind of system going on there, why is it going on everywhere  why so much respect  This is happening, I say that this should be made an issue on the social media, we will not make them leaders because the Congress is also evolved, Congress will also put pressure on speaking but what do we care, this is the fact that if you genuinely want to do good for yourself and want to keep it with you  You want power as an individual consent citizen, only then you will not sing praises, you will belittle wherever you get a chance, here both Congress are also the same because their leader's son is also there, so let's see who does what among the two and if everyone remains silent  Then the public should not remain silent, the public should not remain silent, they should not remain silent at all, like the channel, subscribe, share, give your opinion, having no opinion is not a choice, do not have an opinion, become a politician, we will not discuss politics  Now we will become a politician, so which politician will join which party, no one will join any party, then even independents do not contest, I will not contest the elections, then you will not contest the elections either, you are not even joining any party, then how Politician, anybody who practices politics is a politician, they happen in homes and offices too, office politics, home politics, mother-in-law-daughter-in-law politics, so now we have to play this politics as well, we have to have a complete opinion, he is a leader, he is forced labour, everyone is forced labour, he is a thief  He did it like this, you are singing their praises and if you say with more force that it is useless, it is useless, someone will come to Congress, what is this, abuse this one too, then this one too is useless and tell them about Congress  Tell him to remove this leader, you look too closely at the party, I will only speak if you have, in my 100 episodes I had also told you about my idol Ji, we should never hate a party, all political parties are idol Ji and they need and democracy needs political parties and  One should not criticize political idols and political parties too much, common people can choose any politician, if I like BJP then there is someone from BJP in BJP, I am something  I will not even say that I like Congress, if someone betrays Congress then I will not say anything, I just say that if you like BJP and I am telling you that I like BJP 's idol ji, I like Congress's idol ji also but BJP  Those who are ruining BJP by liking their idol Ji and BJP, they will have to be called out, I say it again and again, if you like cricket, you are a fan of cricket, you like the Indian cricket team to win, then why should you  Be a fan of individual players, if they are not performing then take it out. Indian cricket team is more important and a particular player is more important. Bumrah is bowling very well but if Bumrah gets a leg injury or there is something wrong with his hands and legs  If the bowling is not good then brother you were a very good player, you bowled very well, you got that player out well in the World Cup, this is what you did brother, Jai Ram ji, that's enough, thank you very much, now give someone else a chance  That is supposed to be the process, you tell him that you did it but for how long can you suffer, if you are not performing then we have to reward the performers, those who are showing their low IQ status verbally, every person  By his speaking for 510 minutes it becomes clear how much intelligence he has, so brother why are you making these people sit, this is what you have, this is the talent, I am 100% sure that the people of Rajasthan are very intelligent, some people among them are super intelligent.  There are many Maha Intelligent people in BJP already but the very fact that you make such people, these are the ones who get trolled because any person who has got his own mind and attitude and that too not all  They will listen, they will become Vasundhara Raje type, they will have Maharani type attitude and they have that attitude because there is something inside them, they are sitting with a brain, I am saying make Vasundhara Raje the president  Friend, make Sanjay Joshi the president of BJP or Vasundhra Raje the president of BJP, there should be a strong president who will take cognizance of the party and say that yes, the party is falling into the abyss, if they take this bullet and go away, then BJP will not come to power for 30 years, does India want that BJP  I don't think so it's a good thing if we look at Congress for 10 years then we will see how the last 8 or 10 years go by. No one gets so much power, it would be better if Congress just makes it Congress now.  They are straightforward, they walk a bit, they talk to each other and the Congress people are well set up, okay, so do you want that with BJP also, 25 years should disappear, make the party so weak, put so many fools in it  I think that all the intelligent people should disappear from politics, whoever thinks himself to be an intellectual, thinks himself to be intelligent and there are many people, even I think so, we have to play politics and this is politics, today BJP is good, tomorrow Congress is good, Congress's something good  Something good about BJP, the foolish people of BJP, these foolish leaders, the foolish leaders of Congress, the foolish leaders of TMC, what do we care, once you praised TMC in the parliament, I liked it after hearing it, then even if it happens to Kolkata, you praised there too.  I did it, now why do you foolish girl, if you do useless work there then you will be called useless there, this is what is called using your mind, have independent thinking, don't use neutral words, neutral is a wrong word, you cannot be neutral and you should not be  Neutral, you have to take a side, you have to take someone's side according to the issue, but what do people think that if you say that I have nothing in Congress and I have nothing in BJP, and I am neutral, these are weak people brother  Congress is very good, BJP is also very good, but here Congress has done a bad job. They tried to remove some of the problems in Karnataka. Congress worked for 14 hours in Bangalore, it is a stupid work. They are doing this more because they are spread out.  now brother if six vegetables are cooked then one  If one person has cooked vegetables and another has cooked five vegetables, then there is a higher chance that out of the five vegetables, some vegetable will be made bad and when that person cooking the vegetables also makes a mistake, then he will also be told that your cooking was not done well today, and then he will do this  Everything will keep changing and you should become free just like these people have freed you, the children of BJP leaders are with the children of Congress leaders and they are fooling the public, the public has polarized them in their homes.  People don't talk in shops, this is how business dealings happen these days. Well, I will not buy a car from you because you like the BJP. I am from Congress. I will not come to your hotel to eat food because those people are scared of you.  I should tell them my view point that what is in my mind because they feel that we will be judged, brother I am also a working man, I also know this, I also understand, hey, we like your channel so much, we watch other channels so well  You talk about how nice this or that person is but you should stay away from politics because in politics, I will not give anything to the person whom you consider your darling.  If I say 'yes' then everything of mine becomes zero, which is giving you benefit in life, this politics has poisoned you, politics is so important that I am a good writer of a 150 page book, you will enjoy on page number 43.  It did not come, you learned a lot in the rest of the pages, there was still a lot to learn, so you tear the book and throw it away, unsubscribe, you did not enjoy it, and in whose name, in whose name, in the name of Modi ji, in the name of BJP, in the name of Hindutva, in the name of Rahul ji But in whose name do the Congress leave it and what good have they done to you, their sons are driving the vehicles, making vehicles and doing mischief, what benefit are you getting, why are you fighting for them, at least we should be like me  If this all happens in India, these politicians will not know where to go. You are seeing their condition, what is happening in Haryana, they are not allowed to enter, what have you done, what have you done, people have lost their breath, they will start fearing even in politics.  Politicians are now called politicians  Also, his mouth will open on Rao Inderjit ji, I will make it on the person from Haryana also, what should I do, I am an MP, there is filth here, what should I do, I have given the government a lesson, then why is he coming to ask for votes, then why is he coming to ask for votes now Nothing is in your control, if nothing is in your control then why are you coming for vote seeking, if you have not done anything, but the public has to ask this, then whose blame is it, it is the public's, so I hope you liked this video You guys please like, share and subscribe to the channel, thank you."

    "title": "Why Do You Detest Politicians ？ Episode 1 [reJNFSHHK9k].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, the episode will not be number one, in the beginning I will give two in the disclaimer in the starting episode, after that I will not give it, you all will understand, neither I the devotees nor anyone else, it is okay, you will know because rice is not necessary for all the food. To see it raw, I will probably tell it to the audience in three-four days because people don't think that he will talk about anything intellectual, so the story is like this, that one will do it, it will be explained to you in the best way, so today's topic is that you hate politicians.  why do Why don't you like, why don't you like politicians in general? My audience is this middle class. I am addressing them, so why don't you like them? We will discuss what should be done and what should be done.  But I will tell him exactly, humble, the biggest thing is that we politicians are majority, if you talk in general, then Jains are detected from the middle class and then it is seen in the comments that these politicians are like this. Politicians have been poisoned, this is how it happens, the country will be clouded by the politicians, it is the politicians who change the country, but you want to be the one to whom the politicians give tests, the government is not talking about UPSC, take all the government jobs, government  There is a politician who is hated by everyone, he has become a government employee, madam, first of all, second thing, we talk to the politicians in such a way that you know how they speak, but to understand the pain, to understand empathy, to understand the people. Understand the problems of people, that they have the capability and abilities, no one in the society has that much, be it a doctor, be it a 19 year old, be it a corporate, be it a government employee or be it no one's, because they have to understand their pain and get votes for it and if they understand then  Otherwise, you cannot become popular in any politician. Let me tell you that they have extreme patience and preservation. You should not get irritated now by praising them so quickly. What should we do, I don't want such an audience, Jim himself is not patient and again not like this because this channel is either you are already ready or you will become one. If you want to meet any politician, you want to meet any politician in your local or  You can easily go and get it, you will have to stand in a queue, you will have to go through some procedure, but people are afraid to take their leave by bus but they are afraid to go to the politician and apply. This is a fact in India. Yes, one.  There is a middle class which has never met a politician, that is why this is why I am being what I do, concentration of politicians is also and I am very involved in politics in some way and D in other way. Okay, so I have to learn from them also, you also have to learn. I will tell you the inside story, episodes will be made, I will bring you people to one place, how to understand this game, first of all we will have to hate it, hatred is a very strong emotion and Be it normal, first of all, the politicians understand you very well and want to understand you very well, whereas the general public does not want to understand what it is, they just hate, hate or some narrative is going on, they want to go and do something about it, they do n't want to show it, friend. What is this creature of Indian Politician 2023? What is the game? How is it? Okay, so first of all, we will not have to hate, tell me one more thing, Politician's Unlikely Other Authors Profession Doctor Engineer Government Job As your  Experience increases, will they even get a Lok Sabha ticket, will they not get it, this is the situation in the party, they have to start from zero every time, if an election is lost then it will be lost, there are different types of topics in it, there are more issues of public transportation in it. At the society level, it is a matter of saying that at the individual level, I channel it, there is another reason for you people to hate them and not to sleep in their mother's house, that the middle class needs a secured life.  If you lose your job, you will see this politics or it is a very seeker's life - to drive out, to create noise, to go here and there, to hold rallies, to take photos, to meet people, to understand pain and suffering, and then whether you get votes, whether you get tickets, whether you get tickets, whether you win or not, then you get a lot of money -  They go a lot, you know, they spend a lot of money, you know who will kiss, it is not very favorable to me, what is the meaning of the offer of politics, taking something in life which is not yours, yes yes, plucking flowers in the public park early in the morning for worship.  is he  This is a good thing to give to your girlfriend, to put it on your own head or to listen to the story just like it used to be for someone who goes by train, buys a ticket for a 5 year old child, etc., sorry, etc. No, no, the politician does this.  Hey, the politician does it anyway, who am I to defend it? Like the public, you are the politician, every person in India is not aware of it, there is no line, there is no story, there is no story, there is some jugaad ( jugadwell) to get the heat.  Committee cost, you gave me something, I will give you something, so as long as the public wants something or the other, this kind of shortcut will remain like this. Why is there so much hatred in it? Is there any government officer in your family, so much corruption within the corporate sector?  Whoever is doing less for Lal ji, there is corruption there too, cement stones fall on the site, they show 100 dead, so he is talking about it in private, corruption in India is not like it is government, it is related to that.  There is corruption in everything, there is corruption even in the house. If a woman is hiding money from her husband, and conscious calorie is for the welfare of my children because this husband will give it to his parents, that is also corruption. Hiding the money, but what?  Have you heard the story behind what you are doing? Have you ever told yourself that I am doing it for the good of this person or everyone else does it? What is the difference in doing this? So you see that it is okay that I do so much and then their  Name Judgment  Got up because she is thirty-one, whose husband earns ₹ 1 lakh and gives her 30-35 thousand for household expenses. Out of 30, 35, 5-7000, her power is that much, her personality is that much, her budget is that much.  It is true that here more zeros are added to the budget, so that is an instant of corruption, this is a human India, neither do they get more opportunities, so it is not considered corruption.  Corruption should be reduced, but it is being reduced, don't make noise about it only on these people, so this much expenditure is definitely incurred on water, so first of all, my request will be the first episode because if we start from this point.  Will you say that this is only dirty, this is dirty only dirty, then many people, this suits a lot, politicians have the bill, you are the same politician, people love politics, so they can't come over the entry barrier. Adwise, even an illiterate person can become a barbarian. Anyone who has passed 5th or 10th class has to give IT exam. To become anything else, you need a degree certificate. To become a politician, you do not need one. So, when there are entry barriers, anyone can become one.  It is a fact that we can pamper you for all the elections. Sorry for the Rajya Sabha for the Lok Sabha, when there will be security for the Lok Sabha Assembly, if not, then we will win.  If you can pamper then still people do not go because it has been made dirty and who made it and shoots whom, what is inside it is that they are not less than you, here this will happen, that will happen, this will happen by WhatsApp and  By doing this you will cry till this point, you will not reach the story, there is no need to cry here, the colors change after seeing what is happening next, you will get clarity on this thing very well, I will leave this one, tell me how did you like it.  thank you very match"

    "title": "Why Indians Are Not Happy ？ ｜ Happiness Index Report Poor Ranking [cBUc-_Hb9Pw].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, it is a very important topic, why Indians are not happy? Now the happiness index report has come again. Of course, there will not be many headlines because there are many other headlines, but once again Nataraj calls himself a champion and is stuck at the same number. So one way to react is that this is nonsense, it's just that they are all jealous of us, so how can Pakistan be ahead of us, we are ahead of Pakistan on 108. Hey, this is a nonsense report, this is one way to react, the other is to do a little introspection and try to tell some reasons due to which according to me, Indians are not happy. Tell me how much you agree and if you give that advice, follow it.  If you do this then perhaps the happiness index of the country can increase if you share this video with 10 fellow Indians, 10 all, 10 with 10, 10 with 10  With 10, there will be some percentage increase in happiness, this is my guarantee, okay, nowadays there is a lot of marketing brand running with my guarantee, we also follow those who are the biggest salesman, then it is better to follow them at number 126.  India is the fifth largest economy and is about to become the third largest, so why are we so far behind in the numbers here because if you look at the per capita GDP, it will be only this much, first of all, take this low self.  We travel with esteem that any political party politician comes and caresses our ego a little that now this has happened, now the respect has increased, now this has happened, if this has happened then it is only in him that he is ours, that is why we need the world. What is being seen in the world, this is the biggest recipe to stay away from happiness, we are born in our belief systems, our parents are running with funds, they are running with formulas, all that is flop, they need.  To change in 2024 Now there is no anchor with those funds The world moves That's why there is unhappiness Because there is a largest disconnect Plus one reason of unhappiness And this is that only an unhappy person can be controlled Happy person does not listen to anyone His  Look around, you will find someone who is half happy. Look at the small children running from here to there, running from there to there, they are happy.  They do not come under control and when they are given control, they control them until the parents make them like them, that is, factory settings which are human beings, all human beings are not Indians, all human beings are factory settings which God has given, no happiness. But until the screwdriver and this happens, do not leave China behind by doing so much work, Narayan Murthy should work for 70 hours. You are giving lions worth Rs. 230 crores to your grandson so that he does not work.  We have to do this, this is the problem, all our leaders are actors, if they are leaders, then you are elder, it is the elder's fault. When brothers and sisters fight, if brothers fight, then they are elder, so it should be the elder's fault. Why not the happiness index?  While discussing if the infrastructure has been made good, then the infrastructure has been made good, but happiness, mental mental happiness, what is happening about it, one more reason, now I will tell you that in our country, as long as free seeds are given to the farmers. That old pension will go, elections are fought on this basis, I will increase it by this much brother, you tell me, the person who takes money from free fund and can never be happy with his hard work because life expectancy is increasing in India and work is decreasing. In India, people are decreasing as a percentage of population. Despite the demographic dividend, there is nothing to do at 50. At 55, there is nothing to do. At 60, there is nothing to do and will live.  85 For 90 years, for 30 years we will keep discussing Mann Ki Baat and tea, will we just sit and take it out, will he take it out, will he do it, will the equation become like this or will it happen like this, is this unhappiness, is n't it?  You see in your house, of all those who are listening, who brings the most unhappiness in your house? Youngsters never bring unhappiness, those who have parted hair, or those who have it like me or those who  You are going on that path, this is the source of unhappiness, waste and waste do not let you live, if you don't get a job, if you get a job, it does n't seem good, if you get married, you are not doing well, according to us, you are not doing it, you are not doing this, brother, do this.  It was not fun. Your marriage is over. Your sister did not say Namaste. It is not fun. We are not being respected. There is no respect in our marriage. If you come to India then you will see that now. We are at the bottom in the unhappiness index of India. If you look at India too, if you look at South, North, here, there, if you look into it, you will realize that there is a lot of unhappiness in North India, yet it is mature and better.  Wherever I am giving hints again and again that unhappiness means fear, fear is unhappiness because no one can live in fear, this is our unique case, this is what is happening in the country these days.  The majority is afraid of the minority, so no one should be afraid, nor should the minority be. In a democracy, which is our constitution and which is our system, our system has been there for so many years, in fact no one should be afraid, this is the guarantee of the government.  That all the citizens will remain equal but here everyone is afraid, when the majority is afraid then the minority is automatically afraid or if it is afraid then we  Everyone also becomes afraid. Everyone is afraid only when there is fear. Can anyone remain happy within the fear? You tell me and fear is the fear of the mind, it is the fear created by force and then it is also a trade to some society, to some country, to some community.  If you want to ruin someone today, teach him to hate anything, then what is the point now, all his energy will go towards that hate, where will he work and unless a man works, he will not earn money, he will be happy.  Ca n't live, look at GDP per capita, that is your happiness index. Why is GDP per capita less? People are doing odd jobs and earning odd money. Real estate look at where it has gone. How expensive are they becoming in the stock market, still GDP is higher.  But the capita does not seem to be a rocket because half of the country does not work at 70-80. This is a woman so will not work. This is an elderly person so will not work. This is a child so will not work. They are preparing for the exam.  That's why he won't do it, he's not enjoying the work, that's why he won't do it, if he's not getting work here, then Lat Saab won't go there, that's why he won't work, everyone has 15,000 reasons for not working, see how many exams they prepare for in 20 to 35 years. Where will the GDP per capita come from? Where will happiness come from? Which person can be happy while preparing for the exam? Tell me, no, I will get a job one day. One such person happened after failing in 12th.  12th failure comes and wastes 5 crores, no, he was a poor man, that Varun Grover one was made, see the one which was released later, the reality of life, the movie, the fact is that it is a recipe in India, many people in India like it.  The advantage is that by keeping you unhappy, a parent will tell you, ' Yes, these are dark things. Brother, mother-in-law can never tolerate the happiness of her daughter-in-law, because mother-in-law herself was never happy, because mother-in-law is also sometimes a daughter-in-law.  This system has been going on for a long time, many people come to my consultation, what is the problem with them, yes, he is our son, he is a very cool Maula, he is not serious at all, this is very I say madam, this is the purpose of our life, yours  So life will be successful if one's children are relaxed, happy and enjoying life. Then what else is the purpose? How will we push back China? Then yes, we have to push China back. We are born Indians, we are born in China.  If it is okay to push back, then start keeping all the names like this. A hero has been born who will defeat China. Now he will work for 80 hours and by 2090, we will push China back. Is the country going to push China back? Does China have its own interests?  The situation is going on in England, those who ruled over us are wandering in depression, the addicted public is fine, then the region is its biggest, this yearning and this yearning, the politicians, brothers and sisters, will not let it end, yours should not let this happen.  Go as it is, you can do whatever it takes, why are you treating us like this? People here don't understand this one thing, people say that when your big leaders say no, I work so many hours, they destroy everyone because they An average Indian man works, when he goes to buy vegetables, that is also work, making the child do homework, that is also work, taking parents to the hospital, that is also work, he is stuck in traffic.  there is work too and this  They are big leaders, they are top leaders, neither do they get stuck in traffic, nor do they bring vegetables, nor do they take their parents anywhere, nor do they do anything, and then they eat bread by crying that we have left the family, so we will eat bread there too.  They will eat even the bread of their work and then they will do the same to you, then they say that there is no happiness and they say leave happiness, we have to take the country forward, what is the country, what is the 35 crore Indian family and the country, if the family is not happy then what is the external country?  Agency is some external thing, will you serve Ma Bharti? Who is Ma Bharti? Ma Bharti is a woman of India, empower her, women empowerment, but middle class women do not work everywhere. What they call art is just for show.  Brother, I have made this here, I have made this here, then something happened, interrupt, interrupt, interrupt, tell me, now we will have to move ahead, save my daughter, educate my daughter, then in front of that, very nice daughter.  Save your daughter, educate yourself, what is it now? If your daughter has studied, now where will she do something? Where is the job done? What are the rules and regulations that suit her? Where are you able to do it? If you are able to do it then tell me India within your US.  Female work participation is complete, there are 50 but exactly 100 people, so it is almost equal, Pakistan has more than us, Bangladesh has more than us, why don't you take out these numbers, are you comparing us with Pakistan, Pakistan is hey.  Brother, there will be such a failed student in economy, I agree, but that failed student is also ahead of us in many things. Will you open your eyes or not? Or will you say this? No, no, I was better in Maths than him in Science, so brother, you are better in English.  If you are coming short then accept that somewhere your numbers are short, accept that somewhere your numbers are less, why are they less, address it, then the first way is in Pakistan, no one fights for their politicians there.  There are also political parties, elections are held, it is their mutual relationship, but it is not like that, this one is like this, this one is like this, this one is like this, it is not like this, it will not be this much, but not as much as us, here you have against anyone, hey, tell me one thing tomorrow.  There should be some system, it is okay if I have the proof of voting. I have voted for this party and now I can show my vote and we can only cast one vote. Now, after showing my vote, can I speak against it? brother you will make a bonfire  Many people say, you are against this, you are against that, hey brothers, you can't open your mouth against someone, ca n't you say this after voting for someone, it can be bad or because of that, you can't go to accountability daily, brothers and sisters, when the exam is in school.  When we used to study in India, I don't know what they say nowadays, but there used to be unit test, then the course exam, then the half yearly exam, then the final exam. There were tests many times, or it used to be that we would meet only after a year.  Only after 5 years or in between, no one will say anything, no one will ask, brother, don't ask about it. As long as we common citizens keep fighting for politicians, we cannot be happy in this country. We do not stand for any politician.  You have to take your own, see who you want to see. You came into politics, you have to seek votes from every politician whenever someone collides with you. If anyone collides, tell him, tell him what did you do for me, neither did you build a road there nor did he build it there.  Nothing has gone, hey, what is the use of me being there, I do n't go there otherwise it is the benefit of the country, you live in the country, tell me what have you done to me, this way it will be selfish, oh this is what all the people want this stupid narrative.  You make politicians such that politicians run away in fear when they come to the public and say no, what about me, yes, I got a job, no, what happened to me, no, what about health care, why are school fees high, why are school fees high?  please tell me  If he builds infrastructure then why does n't he charge toll tax and lives are lost, brother, where you build one thing, tell me one thing, listen, you are the contractor of the country, those who need work, the country needs roads and this money is earned by the public through hard work and then you pay taxes. Beyond that you also take toll tax, if you buy a car, then you take road tax of the car, you take GST, then you take all the charges on it, a car worth Rs 10 lakh is taxed at Rs 25 lakh because of the taxes, you will drive that car on petrol, beyond that you  There are taxes, then some contractor comes and makes something from all those taxes. So, I made it, I made it. Did you bring your uncle's money? Have you invested your uncle's money or uncle's money? Brother, this village itself is an agency.  We selected because we had to do business, you were sitting idle, there was nothing to do, you became a leader in life, now you go and tenders are passed. In the system, if a contractor takes something and makes something, then how much should we praise him because this  He was being cheered again and again, he was not able to do that, he was the one who looted the money, flog him, remove him from the power, but why should we keep performing Aarti for just one person, he will say that I have made him an IM, some will say that I have made him an IT, some will say.  If you tell me to do this, even the British will come and say, 'Hey, we built your railways, we built your bridges, we built this bridge, half of the British laws are still burning, they will also take credit in the future, I built this college, yes, I built this Shimla'  I had built Mussoorie, I had built this particular city, Kodai Canal, we had built this, he too should come and take the credit, before that and those who had come before, say yes, Taj Mahal, we had built this, this one had built you, you are earning so much money from Taj Mahal.  Yes, who made it, why are you giving importance to them, these people will keep coming and claiming, be angry with them, be constantly unhappy with them and be happy in your personal life, people will be named by them.  They became fans by clapping, Hey, these film stars come, I am his fan, I am his fan, I am his fan, South India has more craze for North Indians, Bollywood has become a little less lucky athletes, something keeps fighting among themselves, Prabhas's movie release. With this, Shahrukh's stingy Salaar has become yours, mine is useless, why brother, is the money going into your account, whether it is Dinky's and his or Salar's, they are earning their own money, you bastard.  You are fighting over them, you do the same thing in politics, earlier you used to do it in this, now you do the same thing in this, now IPL will come, you have become a fan of RCB, you have become a fan of that, hey brother, how can you take it?  Whatever this nonsense comes, say that we are not happy with you, no, but we have done so much, say that there is still nothing, Dil Maange More, but we have removed that article, this has been removed, which B has been removed, a little bit has been removed, tell the whole thing also. But that one has been made very good, it is a good thing but now make more, make the other one also, make two more which are left, make those too, make them there and make them here too, we are nothing but that train will come there, I am a train, not Ahmedabad Mumbai travel.  If I do, then why are you making me a hero, not for me, but for you too, the railway station will be built here, it will be built here after 18 years, not happy, not happy, I am not happy, behave like the poor, the poor of India are still a little happy.  It is the middle class that is causing the most unhappiness and even more so as uncle ji, it is the people above 50 years of age who are the most unhappy because half of them do not have a clean stomach. There is one more reason for the stomach.  It is not clear in the morning, say, I am having sex with yes. Politics, this is that the stomach is not cleared, it will cause constipation unless they have a similar program, sexual dysfunction and other reasons which again.  Because of this stress, a lot of men are facing sexual dysfunctional issues and instead of addressing them by going through sexology, all the people in their life, especially when they reach senior positions, will say, neither will I do it myself, nor will I be able to do it myself, nor will you.  I will allow you to do. Are you wondering what things will I allow you to do? This is also the biggest problem of unhappiness, but no one discusses this and does not even make an issue of it. Why not sexual health? Makes an issue but now people are coming like this, they are not even family members, there is no alternative, go to the entire state, all of them are unmarried, if the upper and lower ones go left and right, then who will talk about intelligence, wisdom and consciousness?  One is awakening, if you look everywhere, you are seeing the same thing and the same thing is being talked about. Hey brother, when you talk about these things which are not connected with life and do not give happiness, then there will be only unhappiness because the nonsense of superfish literature.  They are talking about this, we have got this event done, yes, we have got this event done, yes, which event is this, it just happened in Delhi, G 20, we have got this done, this is the kitty patti of big countries, like women play in the upper middle class or today.  Today in your house, today in your house, your time came, you did it, so what happened, and if you have to eat so much bread of the event, then Neeta and Bajni should eat it, organized such a grand ceremony worth Rs. 1245 crores, he said  I got the event organized, I got the event organized, so tax payer's money was spent, people came, ate and went to the gym, then what did it mean, the meaning was that you take mileage of everything, friend, the meaning of very many things now.  Brother, I want to tell you about the clock and the politician has to account that the clock will strike 12 and then he will take the credit. Understand my point, it is a clock. Time keeps moving like this in the clock. 24 is completed in 12 hours and then again again. 12 hours 24 hours When it strikes 12, they say look, it's 12:00, look, and when it strikes 6:00, someone like us asks, it's 6:00, is it your negative publicity? Well, won't it be 6:00?  Are you crazy? It's 600 o'clock, so what is their fault or what is our fault? It was 12:00 o'clock, so what was your greatness? So something was about to strike, it was about to be 12 o'clock, something had to happen, something had to happen and it was good and it happened, so you took clapping in it, so why don't you let me flog the thing which was negative, no, don't speak like this.  There is an army of trolls, they tell me everything, that's why in astrology one has to wear red like this. Do you know whose color red is? It is the color of Mars. Wearing this t-shirt like this gives courage, otherwise I would have to wear red just a few days ago.  Now! I made some videos, the channel is getting very good appreciation, you do n't have the courage to take my name, why do I have to take the Paramvir affair, do I have to take it in this, without taking name, you are not able to understand and without taking name, you  If you are not able to understand then you are a stupid butch and nothing can happen to stupid children like that. Well, it means that if you are not able to understand these things then brother, this is the problem. You have made Badru Rashid.  One  You are turning towards the man and then asking, isn't this true, Badr Rashid, this is Dhruv Rathi, he is Badr Rashid, hey Dhruv Rathi, he is not my friend, I don't like him anyway, but brother, he is also Badru Rashid.  No, it's okay, it doesn't mean that if that person does anything, if someone is doing these things, such actions will happen throughout the day, the girlfriend will walk on whatsapp-web and go away, she will have a heart break, she will be afraid of money, she will become interested in money.  fear bad health We deal with all these fears, they come to us in our life but when we live in constant fear, in constant fear and this fear which is not even real, is not even connected to our life, then if you look at it like this  No, I don't know what is happening in India with mobile phones and when you roam around in them, you go out, now after listening to this video, you go out, okay, you go out after listening to this video, look, it is such a beautiful and lovely country, nothing is happening.  Enjoy, eat food with love  Talk with love, the way things are done in the streets, do everything nicely, but everyone has seen this content and on the contrary, they get angry like this, then people have become like this and relatives, shoot friends, friendship gets broken 100 times.  There has been so much discrimination and fighting in the relatives due to political idol ji. Which one will you be happy with, brother? Why have you taken the contract? You can do whatever anyone wants, friend, that is the big one.  GDP is growing at 6 per cent, anyone will do the same, Tom Dick and Harry but this may happen in his affair, this may happen, this may happen, see, in 101 years, our country will become that, okay wise, these are the things that everyone understands.  Will start coming in, but before that, the atmosphere of fear is being exploited a lot, so brother, there can be no happiness on that day, India is happiness, earlier also India was like this, oh even earlier also the buses were crazy, they were useless, even today all are like this.  They are like this and will remain like this in the future also because it is a simple thing, if any new person wants to come into politics, you see what happens to him, after 2012, no new party has been formed in that party, the old leaders leave their party.  He makes a political party, does not speak, starts up with Green New Idol ji, eat that, you will have to join these parties, all these programs are similar, so you may get a little detached, Indians bhai, do it for you and that.  Many times it is said that like they used to do in Rajasthan, even today Rajasthani people like me, once this, once this, once this, once this is fine, in Haryana, although earlier it was 10 and 10, now look, I don't know what will be the result. In many states one does not even use one's mind. In Kerala perhaps one does not use one's mind. There is an exception there too. Karnataka too is probably like this. Okay, there are many states in which one does not even use one's brain. Okay, they are like this, they are like this, they are like this.  it works fine then that  There are other such idol statuses, again it is because of ideo ji, but the fact is that constant constant fear, constant engagement where you have, you are made to think, inflation is listening to you and is destroying the happiness of India.  I am fine because those who talk about inflation are bundles of LPG cylinders, no one knows economics, no leader knows, I have reduced the price of your LPG, above this  They are sitting with so much economics, OK, LPG, they think that by reducing the number of LPG cylinders, inflation will reduce or they have done so. Inflation is also aspirational and the one who is hurting the most is whoever is the Prime Minister, be it the Chief Minister or the leader of any political party.  Whoever wants to be a Finance Minister, he does not talk about school fees because poor people study in government schools and no one talks about the middle class.  Who has never received anything before, nor has anyone asked now, is this like Abdullah, Abdullah is crazy in a foreign marriage, this is a saying, it is okay, like him, we keep roaming everywhere by force, yes, we are with you, hey, is anyone giving you anything, are you?  You simply ask what is there for me nothing then don't waste my time go thank you very much no no but we will do it like this the country will be done ok what should we do how many lakhs are these  People are leaving behind, those with money are leaving, they are becoming fed up. Now when these rich people will go away, the country will remain like this. Whoever gets a good position goes out like this. Even today, India has had so many years of independence.  How many years have passed since it was 70 77 years? The biggest achievement is to go out of India. Leaving the country is considered to be the biggest achievement. Canada's is yours, UK's is yours, US is yours.  It's like Australia is going to Australia, Australia is considered an achievement, so when you are in this situation, then what happiness are you looking for here when leaving the country is considered the biggest achievement. This is the truth of the middle class, isn't it? Otherwise, tell me, when leaving the country seems to be the biggest achievement, brothers and sisters, then what are you talking about, why this question is not being asked, why are people leaving the country, some are coming and some are coming, how many?  How many are coming and how many are going? Tell me the data. Tell me the data of the last 10 years and 15 years. If there is no census then it is okay with you. In 140 years there has always been a census. In 140 years there has always been a census. Now three months of 2024 have passed in this country.  There will be 25, how many we are, it is not officially known and while how much data can be collected today in statistics, then what about happiness index?  What will you do when you don't know whether the numbers you are sitting with are real numbers or fake numbers? People look at the GDP figures like this and say, \"Dude, it doesn't seem so close to you, as it happens many times, no child, how many numbers do you have?\"  Hey 92, it sounds like 92, otherwise it should also make sense. Man, what kind of negativity are you creating? Hey brother, look at the rise of real estate, rise of stock market, rise of GDP, rise of consumption of coal. Kanjampatti has been consuming, now I will make it absolutely technical like Akshay Srivastava makes a video, I will have to make one and a half like that to tell that brother is not matching and Nana Bhai, if you want to cheat, then do it properly so that you can also read and write.  If you get trapped, then how are you considering this casual tie to be an imitation? It has to be like that if this is to be done then it should be done, it is not adding up and that is just adding up.  Friend, take out 3-4 months and then once June comes, make it 4th June. Somehow, it will be seen after 4th June, so if some people do such 4th June, then brother, where will happiness come from? There should not be any contract for the general public, which will  You have to vote, vote, don't be so worried, you can vote only once, there is division within every family as to whether I will vote for this, I will vote for this, earlier people used to unite locality wise, colony wise, district wise that this is the state, so vote here.  Will he do this? Now the division of politics has reached the family level, so when division has come within the family, then brother, do n't give so much importance to politics, friend, don't break your friendship on politics because I am talking about this, I am talking about that, everyone is crazy. All are 192, some are 19, some are 20, some are 19 here, some are 20 there, some are 19 there, there are 20, all are like this, all are just like that.  Don't give them so much importance, treat them like a servant because they are your servants. It is very good if they are treated like servants and speak to them about your genuine issues so that they speak. Talk about mental health. About sexual health, I started doing middle class middle class youtube4 I believe that it is not about the fact that the subscribers are not 10 crores, nothing happens with it.  If the system has to be removed, it is a big balloon and there are so many needles, it is about the vibes that what the public is thinking and every leader, remember one thing, no matter which party you belong to, if you are a politician and at any level, then there are a lot of things.  Leaders are intelligent. I am not questioning their intelligence in the sense that how they can know you and manipulate the situation, I am not speaking for your good in that sense.  For this, there is a baavali booji for you, they are not bad, how should we remain in power, how should we tell the stories and keep telling and how should we remain good? Bhalo is a Haryanvi word, I hope you guys will be able to do it in Hindi or someone can do it in English, Haryanvi fellow, Haryanvi.  It is okay that we keep it for the good of the public, read anything Tuntuna, read Jhunjhuna, this one is crying, give this, give this, Ghana is crying, Ghana is crying.  If you slap me then he is crying more then it is okay and the rest of us all remained sitting in devotion like this, this is how it happened, it felt very good, this was a wonderful function, what is Band Baaja Baaraat, what is Band Baaja Baaraat, the country, should it be like this, brothers and sisters?  If you praise the band, praise the bell, then Nita Ambani ji is a topper student. The way she performs functions, no one in the world can do the same. Those whom she calls, no big presidents call.  If we could bring them all together under one stage, then he became the biggest one, he did this function, he did that function, here it happened like this, there it happened like that, earlier there were less singers, now more singers have come, this is the only difference, so these bands waja All the politicians in the wedding procession are there who are only interested in the function and can be used only in speaking. In every system, communication skills are very important but they say that you are only interested in happy words, speak in Haryana.  Rahe to sukhi bata ki kab tak khilaoge That is the message All are the same Don't fight over them If you keep fighting over them You will be unhappy You will be unhappy You are the country The Smollett unit of family is the Smollett unit of society and society is country  A country is not a tree or plant, it is a country, its citizens are okay, so the citizens live in a family.  Families are not happy than the country can't be happy. This is the message. Subscribe to the channel. Do share this video. Do share. You will see people while walking, in the bus, you will see them at the airport, you will see them at the park, you will see the whole half, you will see half of them somewhere.  From somewhere this realization will come that I need to detach every time you are in this video and at the end of it you feel like putting some strong message that you  Why is he speaking like this, check check, why is he so close, he is so close to his brother, he is so close to his mother, he is so close to his father, he is so close to us, he is his own too, if there is so much pain then why should there be so much pain against any political party?  If someone says that you feel that if my father speaks against my father, then there is something going on that you can't be happy, it's okay, you will be happy but you will not get happiness. Concentrate on your family. What is happening in this?  Your personal life, work hard on yourself, don't work hard for the political parties, don't become there for free, look at this thing, if they are giving you lakhs of rupees per month, which is given to many people, then their IT sales people are getting lakhs of rupees. Then your karma is done, then I will not be judgmental, then come again and troll, do the opposite, write straight, write ideally, morally, ethically, in my opinion, this is a wrong thing.  Not a business or profession which will give you happiness in life but still I can tell that the sinner is doing this for his stomach, he is giving money to write something, so come on, this is a different thing.  So that is but it is made for free and you are sitting for free. If you are sitting for free then brother, you will not be happy then please share and like. Thank you very much."

    "title": "Why Middle Class Is The Most Suffering Class ？ [eFpSulFqQm4].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, there is a video on who is the most neglected section in India, it is a very important video, there is also a video from the point of view of elections, I need your support, my core audience is the most neglected and unhappy section, which has no one, maybe only God  Apart from this there is no one else in this country who belongs to this class and that is the Indian middle class and I will prove this point, you tell me whether I have succeeded in proving this point as a social engineer, social scientist, social observer or not in this modern 21st century  There are no such thinkers. When you go into history, you get to hear about 17-18 big names in 16th standard. But nowadays there is no one. Everybody is trying to destroy someone forcefully or bring him down. Everyone's polls are separated. Listen carefully to what I am going to tell you. My core audience is the poor. They are not the most neglected. They all belong to the poor. And this stress which is coming in the middle class is the reason why I consider them the most unhappy and the most disenchanted.  I will say a lot of disillusionment, there is a proof of that in our country and it is visible and now I will prove it in the next four to five minutes, you can stop and pause the video at that time and write in the comment section what I have been able to prove.  My point is not that we know that our country has been in the chains of slavery for 800 thousand years, some say of the British 250 years, some say before that as well, I also say that it was a slave for 800-1000 years, but when we were slaves and we were oppressed  Someone used to oppress us or some other power was the ruler and we were slaves, even then we did not lose the zest for life, the proof of which was the increase in our population, people's desire to have kids, desire to get married, the institution of marriage, this thing became common in the middle class.  Now it is coming to an end, so if I think that the suffering of an average citizen in enslaved India was 50 out of 100, let's take a figure that he was insulted and humiliated.  We did not have rights, we did not have freedom, but there was an external force which controlled the country. It was a nuisance to the life of an individual due to which he felt oppressed and was unhappy and we were called slaves. Today slavery is controlled by the  The institutions, the country is free, which is a huge achievement. Democracy is a bigger achievement than that. I am able to make such videos. There is freedom of speech, freedom of rights and we have everything. The constitution is a great thing, but not Despinay. I don't want to get married.  No, I don't want to have children and this thing is increasing, this thing is increasing because there is so much slavery that if the index was 50 to 100 then these people have come to 80 to 90, they knew that they were slaves when  We were slaves, India was not independent before 15 August 1947, we knew that we were slaves, but now in 2024 we are free from democracy, but slavery is towards jobs, towards bosses and they have power  And this is a deep video, it can be long, but you have to understand that any deep and good thing cannot be told in 5 minutes by keeping a gun on a ray like this, O shorts, which is a small channel for those who are satisfied, who want to tell deep things.  I understand and if anybody in the society understands this and propagates it, I will try to tell the solutions as well and first of all let the problem be diagnosed whether there is a problem or not, each A B C party, three parties, if we take A for Apple  B for ball, C for cat, okay, A, B, C are all parties, all of them are poor farmers, poor farmers, poor farmers, poor farmers, hey, who is a farmer, who is not producing children, who is poor, earlier I used to say lower class, people used to feel pain.  So I will just say poor, simply poor, now whichever definition of poor you like, you can make your own, who is poor, today the poor will catch hold of any boy, get it done sir, you get it done, if it is happening then who is refusing, any poor person is refusing No farmer is refusing, no one is refusing from these sections, there is no dissolution of their life  I have the passion that I should get money, I should get some resources, something good should happen to me, he even has tantrums with the politicians, no one knows where the poor will cast their vote in this election, if you know then you tell me the vote of pan India middle class  But still you have a rough idea that yes, it is going to be put, there is no leverage at all, the middle class, the elderly people of the middle class are forcibly becoming leader, nothing is going well for their children, they are asking about your welfare, oh, forget it, he is not a hard worker Look at them, how hard working they are. Get impressed by praising the hard work of someone who is hard working. What has happened to your children? You are not a fool. Neither are you able to do a job, nor are you able to understand the job, if you are able to seem good then you cannot get married.  If you are getting married, you are not having kids, you are a conventional person, who has normal jest for life, what is the biggest thing in life, brothers and sisters, what is the biggest thing in life, somebody will say something or the other but the biggest thing is in life life it itself life it itself then life comes on its own  When a boy, girl, man, woman, male, female, man, woman come together and produce that life further, if the DNA of your brothers and sisters does not go forward, then the matter is over. DNA, we say, our body is destructible but our DNA is not destructible.  There is a DNA propagator and there is a middle class which is this, that Kizmuri, you know what has happened to the world, when they used to kidnap and take everyone to the slave country, burn everyone, kill everyone alive, then no one asked that friend of this country  How did I bring it Guruji, how should we produce children in a slave country, no one asked then, then someone will come, today's that was animality, now intelligence, conscience and consciousness has awakened, that is why now we have to give birth to a new child on earth, you know If it is, the carbon fruit is equivalent to cutting down 10 lakh trees. So what does this generation want to show, these stupid fools with their stupid ideas, many gurus have also gone, acharyas say that there is nothing wrong in saying something to yourself, there is a problem in saying the wrong thing to yourself  Someone may say something to you, someone may say how many inches your chest has, someone may call himself an Acharya, someone like us  Guruji said that anyone can adopt self style, someone can come and adopt it but you are not there, but beyond what is being said, there will definitely be a discussion on what is the quality of the thing, so anyone can say anything to himself, it's okay.  Everyone does branding according to their own way, it is okay, it is capitalism at the end of it, but what do you want to say that we will be the last generation who will spread our wealth in this world, we will not produce more so that No, I mean any man who is not producing children, for him, does he not use AC, does he not travel in ships, trains, cars, does he not have a carbon footprint, does he dispose his waste like that  There is nothing in renewable energy, sir, there is nothing, changing clothes everyday or not having children is beyond your capacity, you do not have the strength to do so because you have become slaves of your lifestyle and you know that we have not become poor, poor.  Lifestyle not a slave, in the house of a poor man broom comes your broom and mop utensils which  No one comes to her house, to do this she works in her house herself, she is not a slave, what more should I insult the middle class, if you say that friend you are middle class, you are middle class  I tell you that you cannot take leave for five months, forget six months, even six days. All these maids take leave for six months and go away, they are not worried that they will not get the job again, you take a break, a subtle sabbatical, a subtle woman who is listening to me She cannot bear a child because she knows that nothing will happen again, so she says that if I do not want to have children then I will not even get married because if I get married then probably my mother-in-law will say that she will do this, this has become a problem of the middle class  The most stressed is the middle class. The middle class needs to come out and tell these politicians. As I was saying in the manifesto, it will not cost money that they should give us freedom from some institutions so that our jobs are protected and we can work. be protected and so  This is such a sucking job, and on top of that, there is the stressful job, and the parents too, you kids who are listening to me today who are in their 20s or 30s, your parents also used to work, they too  I was middle class, ask them if I had ever used so many eloquent words in my life, was it like this, GI was not working, children were not growing, work was not getting done, a child, a man used to easily buy a house in his job, a car and a bike were also available  Schools also used to be ruined the most, like I have different channels, I have a political channel, but I also tell you about other things, I talk about jobs, I talk about mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, I talk about real estate I am my guru, I talk about astrology in simple astrology, everything is linked, I tell you that today the biggest expenses for the middle class are children 's education and second is rent or buying real estate and this  Both of them are linked to real estate because when real estate is so expensive to buy then rent  It increases and when that land increases, the school will also grow on that land and the proprietor will also earn money. If you open a new school today anywhere for 15 acres, 20 acres, sorry, 15 crore per acre, 25 crore per acre, 40 crore per acre, now the school owner will charge fees on that land.  Neither the salary of the teachers is very good nor the education is good, the fees are high- end and there is no job placement anywhere, so the middle class today is neither able to buy a house nor is able to buy one, those who have bought a house are not able to get married and have children because these expenses are fixed.  Those who had planned to have two children are having one; those who could not muster the courage to have one are not even getting married now. This is the situation here, the government will have to step in, education will have to be capped, brother.  If in this city, the government officials get the same HRA, then the government should give the same children education allowance to the government officials. The government has a benchmark, the government gives it to the government officials. The fee should be the same.  It should not be too much or else if the allowance is increased then it will increase  The government cannot, no one should come because why would it increase it because the government employees are middle class, you are paying fees to the middle class government employees, giving allowances 00 two 00 and the fees of the children are charged in big cities 177000 18000 200  There is so much mismatch, why can't you put a cap on it? First of all, at least put a cap on the school fees. If you want to give subsidy, give subsidy. These government schools have been opened for poor children and the biggest  This is a scam type thing that reservation is kept even in big schools, this is the worst thing that has been done, because of this either the schools are expensive or they are government schools, in between there is what is called a five star hotel or brother it is a completely dhaba ready  There is one star, two star, three star, four star school in the middle of the education system, there are no schools, either they will suck everything here and when it comes to school, this is what happens with the middle class, if I don't give good education to my child then  There is no good education anyway, it costs more money  Good education is already missing, it is missing from this country and with that education no one is reaching anywhere, so this disillusionment that has happened in the middle class is saying why do the children go but the politicians do not pay attention to this Because the vote bank is not that large, the vote bank is of the farmers, the vote bank is of the poor, what do they call the tribal vote bank, the vote bank is of those living in small areas, gather them all together and see how much their contribution is to the GDP.  And I add chilli to the middle class, listen carefully, you have to chant slogans anyway, why don't you get angry and sit and take 5 thousand oaths from them, this is what I am saying, this is the A B C E part, there is no free electricity,  There is free water, there is no LPG cylinder, even today in our country if you reduce the price of LPG cylinder by 100 then it is a big thing, it is a great thing, you have done a great job, it does not matter to the poor, he drinks so much liquor in Rs.  The only difference is that if it is reduced then the poor man will get the money that his wife was saving Because for many years LPG cylinders were not used in India because there was no money, India was poor, that was because most of the women were dirty men, I will consider men as dirty, when it comes to women's rights, he will drink his liquor  He would smoke bidi, he would smoke cigarette, he would smoke everything but he was not ready to give the cylinder to his wife, so that idea was very good that he would install it for free, once the woman gets used to it then she will pay for it herself otherwise she will have to pay for it on wood  Why did she make it, why did her health deteriorate, that he used to enjoy whatever was left of Rs. 000, that man was not poor, that enjoyment was so much, the man used to say that wherever a woman will get happiness, remove that thing, now that is an ad that comes from the movie  First of all, who is he, our Akshay Kumar, that you don't have money to put sanitary pads for your Bhabhi, Rs. 10 and this is for smoking cigarettes, there comes an ad to save people from menstruation, so he is behind that, who is a  The thought is that yes, it is like this with men, they will blow their cigarettes on his pad  There will be no money for this because where he has to die, where the woman has to die, it is up to her to get herself treated as she wants, get that done and do that here, then many people from politics will come to appeal to these people  No, we should do this like this, okay do that, but who is asking the middle class, it is they who are bringing the taxes, the politicians come here, I gave this, I did it like this, now it has become like this, this tax is on the middle class only. Look, the definition is the same for lower class, poor, middle class and above. The one who does n't pay tax is poor. Simple thing is that poor don't pay tax. If you pay tax then you are middle class. I have told you a very simple definition, now there is no confusion.  It won't matter who my audience is, my audience is every person who you don't want to listen to, it feels good, it awakens your intellect, conscience and consciousness, it is fun too, listen, no one will drive you away but at least my heart beats for those who are in this  He is paying tax in the country, whether it is Rs.  He is paying in crores because it is the same middle class which is paying the tax because always in history across all countries, everywhere middle class only has given the tax, you cannot tax the lower class, you can pay indirect taxes like GST, PST, food and that too  One pays tax indirectly but the direct taxes are those which are said that you pay your tax, this happens only with the middle class, so when you are paying the middle class, you cannot demand any service, you are paying money, brother, free lunches  You do not have to win in everything, you have to pay taxes also, you do not know how to get angry, you do not know how to get angry, no one is coming and giving you even lip service, no party is giving you any service, whom should I vote for here  Should I tell you that my channel is not for influencing anyone's votes, my channel is here to raise issues because the other issue that is being raised, justice has to be given to them, who do you have to give justice to, again to the same poor people  We have to provide justice to the poor, we have not finished justice yet In 1971, the slogan was 'Garibi Hatao', they say 'Garibi Hatao', they say 'Garibi Hatao', and I say 'Garibi Hatao', very good, you won the election. Now 2024 has come, friend. Even in 1971, poverty was being eradicated, but this poverty of India will never be eradicated, what does it mean?  So then he came as a leader in 71, against poverty, how many years have passed since 71, it has been 52 years, for 52 years poverty is not going away at all, brother it is not going away, so whenever it will go away, it will go away, talk about those whose poverty has already gone away because  Whoever has removed his position has done so on his own. All the middle class people here, go back one generation or two generations, you too were poor in this country. The entire country was poor and when the country became independent, it became rich.  Who was it except a handful of people, everyone was poor, so those who have become middle class today were also poor but they worked hard, they reached here, this is their thing, no, we will do it only for the people at the bottom, so brother I have a request Whichever Government forms the next government or comes into power Leave the middle class alone, stop engaging with the middle class, there is nothing for you, let the middle class do what it is doing, things will happen automatically for it, in the registry line  One should not have to pay anything anywhere, one should not have to be sad anywhere, the person who has tax should at least carry it on his chest, Green, Red, Blue, Purple, Yellow, something like, brother, I should pay this much tax, one lakh tax payers should have something that this  A tax payer should have some such card that he has paid tax for so many years and he should be respected somewhere or the other because if you start doing this then your poor section will get angry which is already running from air to air.  also travels who is poor because if he does not pay tax then tell me poor people do not travel in ships, so the entry to the ships is there, so tell me the one who pays the highest taxes is First of all the board will do it, why should you have any problem, tell anyone, yes it has been made, we have given the criteria to everyone  First, he will go to the ship and the brother who does not pay tax at all because he should remove some card and system, the one who does not pay tax at all, does not pay at all, then he should at least look at the ship area, if he does it at a normal place then I know he will be lashed.  They will say, I know about such poor people, but a poor man has no business in catching a plane, even a poor man can catch a plane, well, tickets for Rs. 14000, 18000, foreign countries, foreign travel too, at least give some respect to the tax people, friend  Give respect somewhere, give it somewhere, give it at some place that yes you are a tax payer, you are contributing towards the country and whoever is doing more today, if you pay Rs 10 crore tax or Rs 0 tax or Rs 10 lakh tax  Whether you pay Rs 20000 or Rs 1 lakh tax, it makes no difference. It is not that you will get the merit because you worked so hard, you earned it like this through digital income, you get this award. No, you are an honest tax payer. Come on, let us all respect honest tax payers.  We do it brother, where is that reward, you are not able to build the road, we also know that there are potholes, there is not much cleanliness anywhere, there is fighting everywhere, middle class today, what is middle class, if you go to a government school So you are not middle class. It is a matter of disgrace to educate your child in a government school or to get treatment in a government hospital. It means you have not arrived in India. You are poor. So when the middle class neither uses the services of government hospital nor use government schools.  Do n't do anything by standing in the ration line to take free ration, then the government comes into the life of the middle class only as a tax collector and what is this, this is the relationship that you do the work, I will take the tax, okay and you pay this much tax  They will take it and then push you towards inflation, the rest is according to your own demands of life, if you do not produce children in future then the middle class will be finished and a new middle class will be born which was the lower class for many years and who were used to it  This habit of getting things will not leave her when she becomes middle class and  When it is not released then they will catch hold of the politician and tell him that Bhaiya you give it to us, we are used to it, then the middle class will benefit but if this happens then 25 more years will pass. Do you want that you have to wait for 25 years or right now here in 2024  Elections are coming, put it in the manifesto that my child will get education only in private school and the private school will not charge more fees than this, I want these things like this and if I pay so much tax then why should my ticket be at the lesser rate of that tax  No, why is my ticket not reserved? If I pay so much tax, why is there no reservation for the tax payers? Why is there no reservation? If a person pays one crore tax, then why doesn't his car come out first? If he gets respect somewhere,  Why don't you say that Bhaiya whoever has paid tax more than one crore, suppose it is 10 lakh or whatever figure you put, I am saying this, now you will say that who is the middle class who pays one crore, I am including the rich as well. I am telling the middle class why don't you do this  They say that if you are paying tax above this level, then this much toll tax of yours is waived or you will get this much recharge of toll tax, to say anything because our country is even dying for respect, this middle class has no respect.  Are you getting lip service, I am saying, even if it is a lie, make some promise to the middle class, the situation has become so bad, brothers and sisters, no one is even making any promises to the middle class, middle class is standing in line, Jai Ho to this  Middle class, will you stop saying Jai Ho to any political party? Can you show your displeasure? If you want to vote, go and vote for anyone, A B C, the rest if you go down then D, okay, which place is that in Tamil Nadu, D A I D  Or D, whoever wants to do it on A, want to do it on B, want to do it on C, want to do it on D, want to do it on T, want to do it on S, whatever you want to do, do it, press the button, who is stopping you, you are sitting with the same vote, only one  You can press the button, okay, but don't be so happy, why are you being happy for anyone, what are you getting from Sanu's menu, this, this,  In this way you are teaching us to be selfish, because here all the poor are selfish, all the rich are selfish, what will happen if you become a little selfish, what problem will you face, I want the middle class to have this feeling that they are being short Changed and taken for granted If you keep applauding your groups, I am saying, I am saying, no political party is asking about the middle class, there is a vacuum, another party has to come only to cater for the urban middle class of big cities  Class A party was looking like this, tell me this, realize that middle class is like this, these people are also poor, very poor, deep down, free electricity, free water, this mohalla clinic and all this, all this also became theirs, there is no one like your middle class Everyone of the middle class keeps pretending as if I have taken the contract of the country and I have taken that responsibility, so are you getting anything? Just becoming jealous of the poor will not let you get anything in life, just getting  The jealousy of the rich will not take you anywhere, you will have to open your mouth, tell the people through messaging that what did I get, they said I built a road there, it was built for everyone, I built a building there, it was built for everyone, I made a religious place  Everyone should be made special for me, is it special for me, is it special for my child, do I need a special visa, do I get any special entry anywhere, is it dedicated for me, if you take something from someone and give it to them then it is middle class  You need to wake up is the message, subscribe to the channel, like it, thank you very much and there is a request in the comment section, please write well, write openly and such videos will keep coming, thank you for awakening the wisdom and consciousness of your middle class  you very much"

    "title": "Why Over Emphasis On Delhi Politics Is Detrimental？ [9HrHtXd_Qh0].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, again there will be a deep topic, you people have to understand what the poet is trying to say. How Delhi voters and Delhi politics is affecting the country. Whatever elections we have seen since 2000, we have seen a pattern that in the Delhi assembly, the people of Delhi go in this direction.  And the Lok Sabha goes in this direction. The people of Delhi consider themselves very smart and it is okay but now the story has changed and because of this the country is being affected a lot. Why is it happening? What is it happening?  Let me tell you that it is a small party, I will call it small because among all the parties, it is the youngest party. I am not saying that its vote bank and it is the least, it is also a very national party, that too is fine but what is the negative.  This has happened and in this I will put more fault on the media people than on some people of Delhi that Delhi has been made the house of Bigg Boss, Delhi is a small Delhi, brother of 2.25 crores, Mumbai is also in competition with you, they call MMR, which one is okay with it? Kolkata also has a lot of population, what is left is your statehood and all these are all those stories, okay this has been done, Mohalla Clinic, free electricity, free water, Jharkhand is consuming the most footage, it is much more important than what happens in Delhi.  Everything is set in the same way, most money in Delhi, most influence in Delhi, most rich in Delhi, Delhi should not be given so much footage to national media and lazy media, all these are inside Noida. You give office suits, tell me, if India is a country of 145-150 crores, then if the population of Delhi is less than 2, then the area is very less, nothing is fine, but if we talk about population, then if the population is less than 2, then it is less than 2.  So brother, give him 5 per cent footage in the national media, give him 10 per cent footage. Here, after consuming so much footage, he is a leader and his thinking is that he is an idol. Now, which party do I belong to? Let's not change each of them, sometimes you belong to him, sometimes you belong to him, we are deceived, it's okay, sometimes I look like this, sometimes I look like that, I have to tell everything to everyone, what is happening, I am telling you the situation with my eyes, brother, now I will speak.  It is made in Punjab, yes, it is a good thing, it is made in Punjab, God forbid it is made in the whole country, who are we, but I am saying that you are writing the paper, you have given more weightage to it, go to other places as well.  yes you are doing politics to me  I know, but there is so much trouble here because what is it, whatever is happening in Delhi, even the people from foreign countries all get interested. According to me, now I am going to say something very strong, I am a brother from Delhi.  Just settle whose side you are on. You are riding two boats. Delhiites means the one from outside the house. You are like the one in Govinda's picture. Now I can say that I am not from Delhi, I am from Gurugram.  of boats  You are taking a ride, you are enjoying this also, my chit is also my pat, my father's watt will be charged now, in these terms of negativity, tell me by being from one side in the Lok Sabha, whatever happens to it, I am not saying which side, but which side.  That should be in the thought process because if whatever decision you take, the Delhi assembly which was formed and was not an assembly as soon as it was born, there is no state here, it is an assembly, it has come through amendment and can also go away through amendment, then it can again become MCD.  You will go to MCD elections, you will have so much footage, don't consume so much footage, everyone has become a worker, all this and all that, because press conferences are being held here, do it every day, this is the reporter, who will go to Orissa, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh in summer?  There are so many issues happening in the North East of the country, who will go to Noda's office? Hello friends, all the journalists of these news channels have also become YouTubers because they also released that friend, this is what we have done. Telling stories: You see how many news channels come here, I am a journalist, neither do I claim to be one today nor have I ever been one, but what is the difference between them and us, we too sit and narrate stories, they also narrate some stories which are like tableaus.  And what appears closer is easier to cover due to their lethargy. I will call such a system as a system. Delhi is a system, this is politics, everything here means the infrastructure is better since the time of Sheila Dikshit. He had come for the Commonwealth Games, what happened at the age of 15, after that they gave this water connection, gave this electricity, gave this, gave all these, they started becoming MPs from the North East, you changed the politics and demography, otherwise you  What is it, we can't come to Delhi, is India one country, so anyone can come and go, yes, we understand, we understand, everyone understands, that is why the real estate of Gurgaon is increasing so much, it is very beneficial for us, the people of Gurgaon.  Of  There is a lot of benefit for this and call me, hey brother, come, everything is free, come brother, come, everything is free here, hey, the schools have just been reprimanded, for how long will you eat bread after showing those 10 schools where you have not done good, you come and see. Which schools is this Supreme Court reprimanding, where the schools are dirty? Hey, in the government school, I owe you all a video of mine on the Indian Education System. Hey friend, the bathrooms are well done, it is good, this is the best education, wouldn't it be a good job? so don't think  Your IT is gone, a little, IM is gone, Stanford is gone, Harvard is gone, some have not become great, yes, it is the right of every child to be given a good environment, whether in a government school or in a private one, the condition of private schools is so bad.  What has happened is that their fees have been capped like this means your builder floor is worth 8 crores but the one with 8 crores wants metro and free electricity and free water and he wants less bus fare and he also wants school fees.  That's how a private school will become good. If you put such a cap on its fees, where will you get good teachers? No, even after taking high fees, the school teachers do not give good teachers. This is also a fact, but they will not give at all by taking less, this is also a fact.  The fact is that some rich man wants to send his family somewhere, if he has done so, then this is a big class fight going on and he is getting a lot of weightage. There is a place for every person in democracy. I am not questioning him.  I am saying that brother, why are you getting the footage? You should not get so much. Don't deserve it. There are as many Delhiites as you, whatever your issues are, all are demand programmes, brother, no Delhiite is poor, here in Delhi even the poor are not poor, there are no issues.  You don't have any issues, you don't deserve to be featured in the national media, the one who lives in Delhi, whose Voter ID is from Delhi, whose Aadhaar is from Delhi, whose address is from Delhi, that brother is Lat Saheb, this is a fact.  Does anyone like or dislike you, you are from Delhi, none of your issues are important, there are facts to cover anywhere, it is such a big country, it is so important, well, this topper student party also suits them many times to deflect. Because there are so many issues going on in the country, now if someone goes there, then these media people also have to be kept busy and you people also have to be kept busy, you mean not this party, you people are fine, you have to be kept busy.  just theirs  Keep crying, he will say something, he will say something, today he came, today he left, today only then put him in jail, that is why the text was Dr. Visionary that all the focus has come on this, all the focus has come on this, this democracy is in danger, isn't it?  This is why this is happening, there is so much noise about Hemant Saro, no brother, those tribals can also tell his story, they can also tell theirs, why are they not discussing it, does anyone know anything about his case?  wouldn't know  Which land was there and what else, I don't know, atrocities did not happen there, that's nothing, who is happening to them here, what is the politics happening there, how many votes will come there, who will be lazy, or I am brushing all the journalists in the same paint.  Why don't you come with real scoops Why don't you come with real stories Consume Delhi's story S Subscriber I am telling you all S viewer I am telling you even if you stop consuming Delhi's story you have nothing to do with it  Chutku is a mayor level system and their cry is going on, let me tell you that councilor level elections are held in any small town, they have the same cry that people of this level only need to be given weightage, Rohtak, Rohtak is very big.  Is it a city, take Rohtak, take any other city, where these elections are held, politics has fallen in them, but in any case, the head of politics has fallen even at the national level.  It is falling but I am saying that this one is at the lowest level, it is the opposite of direct speaking, if I say it, then it is not a feminist, but what is the opposite of feminist, it will be that if I use the word of ladies, then  That it is not you, you, I, I, now you will speak like this, I am not so politically correct, I do not want votes and it is not like this, when a husband comes to the house, then your mother did this, just like you.  Tell me, your sister did this, it is not like this, this is that level, that is the level, there is no productivity, there is no mother-in-law in the house, sister-in-law used to watch serials in tutu, these people have done this in tutu and their vows have been fulfilled.  And the whole thing is like this, in the list of Prime Ministers, who becomes the Prime Minister of the state, their younger leader is at 5th place, brother, how come you are the elder one, who is the top leader, his percentage is higher, then the second one is coming in the list. on foot  He keeps on coming, his also comes, come on, he is a big leader, big party, big leader, footage should be found, no one is getting it, so where did the third number come from, basically, what is happening today that it is something like this  What is going on, whether it is a picture or someone, is it footage, whose footage is it, how much of the same leaders, according to the actual work they are doing, we will never know what happens in Orissa, how is the leader there, good or bad, we have Andhra Pradesh.  It's a big province, not his idea.  Hey, we are Indians, if we are from Haryana, if someone is from Rajasthan, if someone is from Punjab, someone is from Gujarat, UP, then what is this conflict happening in Delhi, is it more important or should we know what is happening in Kerala? In Tamil Nadu, we just know that someone said something against religion, we just know that someone there said something like that, the rest is not known where the level of debate is taking, this is a very important level of debate which This is according to me, if this story of LG Velji continues, then you keep crying, friend, either abolish their assembly or give them statehood, friend, the capital of the country cannot be a state, no, our two crores here, brother, let it be two crores 10  Be it crores, be it 25 crores, you will pick it up, so much work will be done here, so much political activity will be done there that it will be difficult to handle that international image. Now today you must be feeling that today you are my devotee.  Will you please make some of mine right now, that was going on, that party was being bought, whose money did I eat today, please tell me, people write different things in the comment section every day, but man, it is a problem to pick up these media channels and go somewhere else.  If you should send everyone, you found cheap offices here in Noida, now all your studios are there, caught the car from there and crossed, he came, how do you feel, how do you feel, today he has a meeting, today he felt that he has gone there.  these are today  In that city, today in this city, today this, today this inside, this is your level off, that is, out of the 150 crore people of India, we have caught 2 crore people whose life is as good as the life. Medical facilities are not available to the people of Delhi today, they have always been the highest.  Listen, you people of Delhi, rest of the people will not know, there is pollution in Delhi, there is pollution in Delhi, otherwise the people of Delhi would become immortal. Life expectancy of 75-76 years of Delhi is the highest in the country.  An average Delhiite lives the longest in India, his life span is the longest, then your quality of life is the best in the whole of India, so why should you be discussed, Delhiites, you grow crops, you do such great work where there is struggle.  You are like a common man living in a metropolitan city, the only struggle is that I moved from one place to another, I went to my job by hanging from the metro, today I went by hanging from the bus, these are the issues, just made my ticket free today.  Will be free on Rakshabandhan day, this happened today CCTV cameras were installed today, today they got damaged, this is what happened, those flyovers have been built, all your obstacles have been built, everyone lives here, all the power is here, everything is here, it means if the merit list of all the police comes out, where is the police that is the most bright?  Where are they resourceful, where are they all from Delhi, they are number one in all your parameters and now we keep talking about you people, sometimes Bihar Suppal District, sometimes your Ara Ballia Munger, sometimes your Basti.  Samastipur or this, we will not know which district is it. What is happening in Dantewada, Dantewada, Dantewada also happens, Di Ha Ji, Ha Ji, what is happening in Tezpur, what is happening in your Dibgarh, what is happening in Manipur, only Manipur.  If you are sitting with all the GKs, then yes of Manipur, yes of Imphal, tell me another city after Imphal, Dimapur would not even be known to you, if asked about Tripura at 99 then it would be Agartala.  Apart from this, you do n't know anything. Okay, if I ask you about Nagaland, then apart from Kohima, you don't know any other city. You know Arunachal, Itanagar. Yes, only Itanagar is known, what else is happening there. Assam is such a big state. No, I don't know anything about there.  I don't know everything about Delhi, I know about Delhi like this, yes, now she said, that leader has gone here, he has left this party, he is a minister, just eat all that footage, I am feeling pain today, so I feel like leaving. What have we done, stop using Delhi's content, stop consuming it, every day in the press conference, their leader said like this, today he said like this, I will only say that someone is useless, Delhi's politics is useless, now you will say, the people of Delhi are very angry.  I know it will happen to the people of Delhi, I know it, but if you understand the feeling of Guruji, what is the one feeling that brother, don't give so much weightage, you are sitting with two seven MPs, the world is sitting with a lot of things from where 48 MPs is. Maharashtra is coming in Maharashtra, if I ask you then Mumbai Pune Nagpur and tell me further city, no Aurangabad Latu, don't know where it is, do you know how big Maharashtra is, no, Vidarbha region is there, which districts come in which region, what is there?  -What issues are happening there? Have you ever wondered how six parties are formed in Maharashtra? Part A Part B NCP Sharad Pawar NCP Ajit Pawar Shiv Sena Sinde Group Shiv Sena  Uddhav Thackeray, rest of BJP and Congress are there, there are six and apart from that, if you count the parties then there will be six more parties and sporadic parties, what is its politics there, how is it for the country because Mumbai is the financial capital, what is there now? We should know what is happening in Maharashtra, so much GST comes out of Tamil Nadu, we should know what is happening in Tamil Nadu, we don't know about Anna DM 's DM and anything else, there are 2500 parties there.  Also, what is happening in Telangana, where is all this footage of the country, then Delhi has eaten up all the provinces of India on one side and Delhi on the other side because the news channel is here, the news channels have to be called out, brother, we will not listen to you only today.  On this day, I am telling you one more good thing to all the people who are my subscribers, I am telling you an opportunity to start a channel like mine, in any province, any language is yours, if it is vernacular language, then more.  It will be a hit. Any language is your Marathi, Malayalam, your Malayalam is Tamil, whatever it is, take out the politics of your local area. You will do a better job at journalism than anything else and people will watch. You can keep English subtitles. You can keep this. Or you can generally speak in your own language, you can also make two channels, now I will also try, I will also start speaking a little bit in English so that is the ultimate.  If English is typed then the audience of South can make some sense out of it that yes what is happening in the South should know what is happening in North the East should know what is happening in North North should know what is happening in East  Don't know, don't know, let me ask you, what happens in Bengal? So in Bengal, yes darling, maybe it comes in Bengal, Kolkata is the capital and where is Ascenso?  Which is 24 Parganas, you will not be able to tell the five cents of any province, everyone knows about Delhi, everyone knows about Delhi, Chandni Shou, why is this brother, why do you know, what is Delhi contributing like this, you tell me, other than being the capital, not here. This is how it happens, you are doing your own thing, aren't you? There is no water of your own in Delhi, there is no food of your own in Delhi, there is no electricity of your own in Delhi, Delhi is dependent on everybody else, just stop there.  It's okay that we reach here and then do some more stuff like this, free electricity, free water, free mohalla clinic, free, everything is free and free brother, free work is done by the free one, ok, free work is done by the free one and call me.  Then see the ultimate demography of all the presidents here and those who are contesting the elections, what will happen, otherwise are you against them? If this happens, then look at the condition of those provinces in which everyone has to come here and work. They have to do it, why do people have to come from there? Some journalist should go beyond that too, it's all as easy as do this here, do this, do this, do it like this, so I was a little anxious, normally I am a little  I try to make positive videos but I will leave you all with the positive end that this boycott is enough, my friend, not listening to you is now a test for the people of Delhi because this is also against the people of Delhi.  A little bit has been made, if you watch the video, it is not about politics, the people of Delhi are riding on two names, the one outside the house is fine, it is like two, do n't get trapped in two timings, brother, people of Delhi, stay on one side. I am giving advice, I am giving friendly advice, he could be from any side, look at his intelligence, earlier I used to call him intelligence that we will do it there brother in Haryana first.  They used to say that big elections are small elections but now the time has come that if not then this environment will become very toxic, even more than pollution. Life is 76 years, if you want to live for 86 years, then follow my advice and be on one side.  It also has to be clear, how can you be so confused? 7 and 646 or 64, what was the score? I'm like, do you guys know that one way here, one way here, one way here?  On the one hand, when you do this, you too will be taken for granted. You don't know who is your minister, who is resigning, who is your Chief Minister, who is running now, what is happening to you, you only know what is happening to you.  It will not work for you because you had set out to become a big star, so the people of Delhi will check now, I will also check in future also, I have some constituencies and some areas of some states where I will keep an eye on the results of the elections. If you want to know, I want.  I am also keeping an eye on you, see the population of the country will be 543 after voting everywhere and we will know the result but there are some things in it like many people have not followed the state election of Rajasthan that six MPs are sitting MPs.  If he contested for MLA and lost three, it means if the MP does not win the MLA election, that means some seats become interesting because they tell the direction of the country as to where the matter will go. There is one such seat in our Haryana. Rohtak and the key opens from there, there is some secret in every state of that state where the key to power opens from there, so it may be just one seat but it reveals many patterns like this.  There are seats in other states also, just as we can discuss them if you want, in your state and I want that now all the people who want to think at a higher level at the thought process level and talk intelligently, except this political Apart from the idea, I would also like, brothers and sisters, please write in the comment section, tell me which is the seat in your state, that the state is this, yes, this is the seat and because of this, it will be very interesting to see who wins on  That seat please write in comment section like and subscribe the channel share thank you very much"

    "title": "Why Taxes Are High In India？ ｜  What Should We Do To Reduce Them ？ [BJ-2IhfmFkU].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, White Tax are Hi Inner Country, we will discuss it well, okay in this I will tell my own theory and I do not think this theory has ever been told on any platform, I have not read the story but heard the story, you guys tell me that it is completely original.  Then first praise the original and then if the plagiarism seems fine or understandable or agree to it, then tell me. I would also like to share all this with you guys and for that, I have started a telegram group.  I have given the link in the comment area, please join, so that such polls can be conducted there so that the content creators can know about their status, whether I am becoming a big Guruji in my life or I am doing something.  I am fine because the date is very important, it is not like it is going on one side, it is fun for you, it is okay to see, it is more than the tax, the middle class is traveling in India, we all know, okay, this is something new  It is not a thing, why is it more, can there be some agenda behind it because the political party is not talking about reducing it, because if it reduces it then it will be shown that the party is special and that the leaders are with special rich people. And the vote bank of the poor will go away, is it just lipstick because this is first order thinking, so first order thinking seems to be that brother, if someone says reduce the tax, then it is for the middle class or the rich because the people.  middle class  I don't even know the definition of 'The one who pays tax is middle class', it does n't give test in lower class, so if you are middle class then people consider you rich and if you are paying tax then you are rich because all rich and poor are also relative.  Is n't this also a problem and you are working for Rs 15 lakh, you are working for Rs 20 lakh, 25 lakh in a year, so you are middle class, people are taking urine from the top 10%. Hey question, people have messed up, what do you understand?  I have taken this middle class video for the first time on YouTube, after that many people copied the content but now it is a good thing, I am proud of it from my other channel for 2 years, if you have not subscribed then please do so.  People know that I was the one who brought it on YouTube, even the big YouTubers did it and the good thing is that he came up with one word, what is the biggest problem, people think that it is India from here to here, so it is like No brother, this is middle class, what you think is top class, maybe this is the tip of the nail, it is not so much, middle is the end of this caste and this saree, on these terms of income, people would have distributed it evenly because 60 thousand 70 thousand 80  The person who earns a thousand does n't want to consider himself to be lower class because he speaks good English, wears smart clothes, his mobile is late, his father has been an officer, he has been there and he thinks that he would be middle class. I also have a wife who is no less, I also have two children, okay, but I will get it, that is wrong, okay, so let's talk about tax, what could be the reason for higher tax, this is the first thinking, is this the reason?  It is possible that if I keep taxes high in the country then people will not want to pay taxes and if they do not want to pay taxes then the country will remain black and there will be a parallel economy and the politicians and people in power of black economy will drain the corn.  are  Whether you are taking it out through a tanker or you have built a pipeline, it is not known because the entire transaction of the white economy is known, the funding that is given to the political party is fine after making it so that its data will go to this data.  Only then will we know if you are understanding, there must be some reforms, otherwise keeping this high tax is beneficial for the politicians because if they do lower taxes, then the blacks in the country will be reduced, but if the blacks are reduced then the quality will be reduced.  What is the benefit of life and you have to make it an election issue of 2024. Brother of the middle class, we need the slab below which the party will lower and put in its manifesto, we will vote for that. Some have made this free, some have made that free.  The middle class is not getting the benefit of Rs. 250, your taxis are going, now big people are coming to make arguments in this, so I am also making you people like the intellectuals. Hey, the interaction tax is also very high, even the poor are also poor.  So the tax that pays on my phone is indirect tax and you can see the direct taxes which are there, they are equal but the middle class brother is paying directly as well as indirectly. The poor have to buy Parle ji worth ₹ 2. So it is not considered as tax but the middle class takes ₹ 20 worth of tax, eats ₹ 200 worth of biscuits and pays tax on whatever it does, first of all you understand that it is a land. A builder Bhai Saheb went to a land and bought the land, then the government took the money for the registry, then this Bhai Saheb said that there will be a change in the language, he will pay the money for it, then he started building a house on it, then he gave external development charge, then internal development charge, then he  It was made, then GST was given, then GST is given on everything, if GST is to be deducted from you and after that when this customer booked this flat by saying 'Musaddilal' and took it, then when he booked the flight.  So, all the taxes were taken from the builder, so ultimately it was the government, not the common man, so the builder will take his own profit margin, he will take it from everyone, after that brother, when he got it registered, he goes to the tehsil and then he is paying eight percent.  The builder takes the full listed plate, we pay the sir tax, after that the circle rate is the same, so he has done it, if after 4 years he also sends the flat to me, then I am paying the history money again. Government to Government, the price of this flat has not been more than what it was in 20 years. Is it government class? Where will it go baby? I give you clarity. Hey brother, the next party has gone, the next one is like this, so its cap is his head, his cap is his head, his cap is his.  What is happening is that whose big party is headed by this person, she is roaming around to find a place there, many people of Delhi do not want to take it, how will they pay it, first of all, there is Capital Gen Tax up to ₹ 2 crores.  He is adjusted, there is property in the form of two names, that is on top of two properties, so many people can be adjusted in the same way, you are getting brother-in-law force, you buy nonsense builder floor in Gurgaon, where people do not have immunities, there is nothing, then Someone said, brother, you had to come here and live like this in a normal colony, in a normal sector where dogs sit in front, so I am late in my Delhi, why are you coming in the middle of the road, why is this great happening?  Everything is there, look at Gurgaon and Saree Party. Ultimate party is in power, someone has to come, alliance has not come, one N has come in 10, 209 sarees will come whenever they say that because what happens is, one party will reduce one party to reduce it.  If you give pulses then the other party will give it itself, these bikes are gone, we are for the rich, why should I write for the poor man, we can force everyone like this, middle class is middle class, whether it is from Bengaluru or Chennai.  Be it Hyderabad or Delhi's Jai Gurgaon 's chair, Lucknow's Jai Jaipur's story, it may be the story of any state, Chandigarh Mohali, any small middle class needs you, adopt less and say, hello hello political party, your manifesto is being made, we are giving it to you. We are the middle class, when the corporate tax rate goes up to 25%, then do I, you and I pay 30% tax, 32% tax, but the government 40% because if someone pays this much tax, then he is a  Now from this comes my second theory, charge so much tax that some people leave, you tell me this Hello friends, I am doing it Hello friends, I can do this even by sitting in Dubai, this chair which is this story is also a tick power.  Is anyone doing it in Germany also? One of my brothers is doing 12th. Hello friends, do that story also, many people can go for whom I am not doing anything physical here, I will make a video on that too. Despite so the match was made high. this can go friend  Tell me, if your corporates employ you, then tax them more, if you tax them by Rs. 20, then the employment will be flooded. Show big, Hajj brother-in-law too, Nanny correlation between decreasing of corporate tax of Aa. If you reduce the tax of the company, then the bottom lines will increase.  The market will increase, I can make money from there also, I am also an investor, I am invisible in business, it is good for your economy, I am this  No, I'm not a corporate person, don't do that here, let's pay less for the corporates, I am a corporate person and should reduce taxes, should pay 25 to 15% of the corporate pay, forgive the startups and do everything, but I should also reduce ours.  Don't need this problem, if you like, if you subscribe, it will be made, then quantity will be visible. Made a video, tell a philosophy, but you gave this pulse, tax in India, need you less Dr.  Please listen to this video Those who should cry are not force de politicians We have to enter in the manifesto What we will enter in the manifesto will be the syllabus of politics Politicians are very simple Kya aate hain bole hai bhai yeh hum karenge koi se sare bole bate  Okay, we will do this, then they do the same in the future and then they say, we did this and you vote for it on its basic basis, then brother, if your agenda has not entered here, brothers, sisters, family.  Know if it is not said then it is okay then you are not a family, you are my family, am I in the family and every person's family should be different, I think there will be some people for whom family is everything but it is a simple thing, friends, every political party.  A is the apple one, B is the bye one and C is the cat one. Take any party. Which parties are there from ABC? Neither will I take names nor will I love anyone nor will I be sad or angry with anyone. i attack  I will make it very polite and with love that we have to do what is our public's agenda. If people are happy with you, will they double their income? If you take a contract and do it brother, then I will double its income, not 10 times, but 100 times, brother. What about me?  If not what is mine, then thinking in the country's big, middle class is not less in the country's big, thinking in the country's politicians, leaders and all this we sit on is less than gold if our  If the country becomes short of gold, then we will keep thinking only this, then how will we do less business, how will we earn money, if you are short, every person in his family will become selfish, then how will the country run, it will run very well, every person will take care of his family.  Keep it, increase the GDP of your family and India 's GDP will flood. Your personal gain cannot cause harm to the country. No, I don't like it. Poor man, poor poor, he is worth nothing, he is enjoying himself, he is being a raw cat in India. 60% of the population has been checked. What is the meaning of cutting raw? Those people of Haryana will know and for the sake of them, we have to cut them more thorns, make them do all this more, give them diesel also, give them this too, give them that too, give them this too.  You are taking two sips from the window, you farmers love the land very much, but the land will go to Dwarka Expressway and the bananas will go to the bike, then there is no love for good crores, there is no relief for it, first of all this is [ __ ] and block of this farmer's Hajj.  You work out, my ancestors were also farmers, it is not that I have come from Switzerland, that is the capital list, if you follow me then I am saying that I am a farmer, what is a farmer and if you yourself do farming then yes, go and do farming for 5 days.  I also take photographs, if not I will give that too, so I am a farmer, fellow farmer, Sterling, me, a fellow Indian, who should not be taken to task, this is disguised employment, two people should be reduced, six people should be read, the tax is being sung that  He is an employee, he is not an employee, he should be expelled from India and also in the future, the agriculture doctor who came was demonetization, I want to give a lot of clarity on this too and if you listen to that clarity, you will understand it yourself.  The party is not for anyone special, brother, this is Guruji, the story from him will be that he is calling someone bawdy, ask Baahubali, something has to be reduced, we will not support him, we will tell what is happening.  First of all, if we give courage to the politicians to say no to anyone, then no one will do it, then the farmers will also do whatever they want by doing it in such a way that farmers are committing suicide, many doctors are also committing suicide. Data taken, government employees are also committing suicide, husbands are also committing suicide, there is a population in it, the suicide rate is as high as yours, if I look at the suicide rate according to profession, I think it is as high as the film stars and these TV stars.  They commit suicide according to the rate of how many there are and how many have committed suicide, so perhaps they are doing it the most, so give them some subsidy to TV stars and give to film stars that your brother, you commit suicide a lot.  Moreover, you are in great trouble, our heart is beating, do it like this, why not say, maybe it is okay to go to Rajya Sabha, but right now I don't want to go to Lok Sabha, so I will talk like this because someone has to do it, oh brother, if we all are poor.  were there  The poor had to be taken care of a lot, now the poor are not so many now that they have come here, they too have to be taken care of, you will keep taking care of them only, the one who will be taken care of, will become the country, your taxes are so bad, you people will leave you and go away.  Leaving the statistics, the next video will be Hi, we have to reduce taxes but even after this height access, if you brothers and sisters want to know that there are many benefits of living in the country and no one has given those benefits and as per the default setting  benefits benefits of nature  God of Nature, if it has any fire power, then I will tell you that, so please, if you want to know that, you are enjoying, then please write in the comment area, 'I want you to look at me, this is very practical and  It is realistic and our country has to get rid of these positive, negative and motivation demotivation issues and become realistic. All the countries that have gone ahead, we have to take our country forward, we sir are the only ones.  Don't do outsourcing, take yourself forward, we are the country and we have to tell our leaders in this manifesto, do n't make anything for me at home, when mom cooks food, she asks, \"No, yes, you will eat carrot air, okay, what about you?\"  There is nothing for me uncle, there is nothing for me, then the government is you and Mahi, neither when you come to the house with something, something for everyone, then if there are two children, three children, wife, family members or earlier there was a joint family.  When Grandfather used to bring it, everybody should be bitten, don't break it in such a way that brother, these are Nannu's only things, it's okay, it's the same thing, Ramphal's things are fine, brother, it's okay, it's okay to ask for greetings in the evening.  Brother, he is very fine, he will fix it, so when it happens in families too, it is not that it does not happen, crying is the only relief in those families where the father is the father and what is that affair, if the boy is crying, then stop crying.  Times Cry in front of you; Roll on Twitter; Roll on Facebook; Roll on WhatsApp; Roll on YouTube; Anda ka I do with you; look at us too; look at these brothers; look at them too; put our number on us too; our children also got something on the story.  Give us something, I will give you something, you take reservation, you take free electricity, you do it like this, you buy cylinders, you don't know the story, give more subsidy on pesticides, fertilizers and we will keep pouring poison in your stomach, the village will be poisoned.  in first  He used to say, brother, this is the wheat of every house, brother, this is the wheat of this place, I am the only one who is fat, this is what I have put on myself these days in my own house, this is what I am telling you as a fact, it is becoming poisonous, please tell the government.  Don't do this to everyone because the cheaper you make it, the uncle will give more when he is not paying for it, when he will study to pay back, then how much should be put forward on agricultural research etc. which also no one tells, otherwise it is not the institute.  Keep the ICC place open, keep the ICC place open, you farmers do not reach there and look at their salaries, look at the three-three-four-four-five-five lakh pensions of the intestines, what do they do, they give us a handful of pulses, there are a lot of pulses in India.  There was higher yield 200-300 years ago, how farming was practiced at that time, it is very important for us, please spread awareness."

    "title": "Will Karnataka Reservation In Private Jobs Derail Bangalore Story ？ [eEA38KE1k5s].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, I will talk about Karnataka, not Bangalore, from Bangalore. News is coming from Karnataka about the reservation in the private. I will always try to discuss it. My aim is always to talk beyond the normal discussion. I will call this a perfect example for Congress people.  Finally, those who were a little weak students have learned it, but now they have also learned it, brothers and sisters, they call it headlines management, what do they say headlines?  Management and from whom have these people learned, you will tell me that whenever the headline does not suit you, create another one, what was not suiting, which case got folded, which corruption allegations were being made, what was going on, now it is all about this.  Now no one will talk about it, it happened here, it is on hold, so it is not so, they told the companies and are making noise, oh man, stop, stop, stop, the same thing happened in Haryana many years ago, although he is not in the headline management.  It happened because there was no headline of that kind, it could be about farmers, now things become old, so the chronology goes back and forth, in that there was a person with a job of less than Rs. 300, here he was not even with a job of Rs. 00. He said that even at the manager level, it will be cut like this, see, they do not pass the law of the land, but once this is removed, even BJP will not oppose because if anything like this comes out then the opposition will be raised. State can't, everyone knows what nonsense is happening, what a good story Bangalore has, what a good startup culture it has, how many enterprises do you want to post private posts in it, how much will it generate, so how many people will be there, more than 10, more than 100?  So this is a lot of work, every government, every party is capable of doing it. To save your life, whenever something like this comes, just remove it immediately and in this way my  It seems that every political party has now learned why the topper party has taught me, by the way, let me tell you that the topper party has taught me, the rest of the people learn slowly, so each of them keeps 10 to 12 such things in their pocket somewhere.  If it is going to happen, then they will remove it, or doing it is nothing, being in Havana is nothing because everyone knows it, but you will discuss, brothers and sisters, everything else will be done in a few days, two to four more days, then kitchen gas will come in the budget, budget, union budget. Of  Price is such that people have forgotten what was being said in Bangalore in Karnataka, otherwise look, they are happy to lose. Make a video like us. Hey, this is how it will happen in Bangalore. Real estate of Bangalore will go down, then Gurgaon will go up because everyone will come to Gurgaon.  You can take advantage, however, I am a Guruji man, what can be taken, who can take advantage, that too, I leak the paper, everywhere in the system, whatever things are seen and told through digital medium, there is a lot of agenda and benefits in it.  We have to do higher order thinking, what I want my audience to do is that brother, do n't panic in everything, the first thing will be a very strange thing, it will not be normal, but an issue will be made and the next person cannot say anything.  Can't say it is a compulsion, like Nitish Kumar ji is against Nitish Kumar, he can't speak against his Chief Minister Bihar, how many bridges should be broken because if he comes in opposition then the opposition people don't say anything except Modi ji. And if this government says that he is his friend, then no one says anything. One bridge worth Rs. 1700 crores has gone, I don't know how many, eight or nine bridges have fallen in the month of June, in which districts have they fallen, nothing has been left behind, no district has been left behind, I think it is fine.  And by the way, there is no money for Agniveer, all his bridges will be worth 15000 crores, so many bridges, each one becomes worth 1800-2000 crores, so you also tell, is this headline management? You will see such ideas in the future also in many state governments where the locals are not able to create jobs because of this, no government is able to do it. Brother, you speak to the central government, it is okay, you speak to Modi ji, okay you are the state.  This is your government, you can do magic, the whole state of Karnataka is being run by Congress, you have some magic band, knock knock knock, do whatever you have to do, show it, its so easy.  No, it is not because there are some mistakes of the society and also of the people in this, I will tell them in future videos but no government can come and say that beyond a time, beyond a point is not within our control, we can only create a little eco system.  You ca n't do anything more than that, rest you have to give jobs and work to each other. Today I tell you about jobs and work in a practical way, as if I too have to hire someone, I don't want to hire him because it is better to explain it to him, tell him it yourself.  hee  Do this, I am telling you this practical thing for the children too, why are there no jobs? There are no jobs everywhere, no one is ready to give, no one is willing to give two or four children, they are ready to pay double the salary to one child, ready to support three idiots. No, this is a fact and calling the children who are coming now as idiots is a very bad thing, but if they are not skilled and are not worth anything then they will not get employment and one person will have to do the work of two people.  It will be given, the trains come out, that is why the country is running, the work is being done, it is possible for one bus to pay the salary of two, the work of three can be done and the bus is also waiting, okay 84 or 84 hours.  This is what is talked about here and not in Bangalore, that's why it is said that the one who collides with Shahna, give him a little more, give him a little more and make him do the work of three people, two people, one and a half people, two people.  If you pay salaries to do the work of three people, then one also feels exploited. Even the companies do not have the choice and cannot hire three or four more people. Train them, hire them, then fire them. This is a complete process of one year, first train them and then  First check, then his performance is not good, then hire him, there will be issues of jobs, unless the skill set is good, the education system is also not good and the program as per the demand of the people is not good. Mentally, a lot of things like this will come, people will discuss, nothing much will come out, just watch the news somehow for four-five days, any bad news will come for four-five-six days, you will control it somehow and after that  Then if any other news comes then they will just forget it, this is the management going on, by Pauli, All Over India, look somewhere, there is no news which remains for 96 hours, normally in 48 hours, sometimes in the past, in the last seven months. 10 times, Anant Ambani ji's pre- wedding and wedding have come, whatever happens anywhere, all the media there, whatever happens, leave the issue there, now this has come out and now the country and puja windows, most of the people, who will discuss when you are in danger on something?  So how many people are there who want to go to Bangalore for a job, they will get totally stressed, 'Is this my job going away and everyone likes it', they will get stressed once someone talks about it.  So these are the kind of issues that are raised to divert you from the real issues again and again, what are the real issues of life, health, school fees, rising property prices, corruption in exams through which papers are leaked or wrong people are selected. These selection procedures of government jobs are happening, all these are real issues, but many times even the opposition people cannot raise these real issues because everyone 's program is like this, there people like me should come and people like you end up saying this.  It's okay to leave, it's not happening, remove the incident of Sawan, tell me what was happening with your corruption, friend, it's okay, yes, do it, very good, very good, tell me what was happening with corruption, but what is that with Kadi? For the people, if the CM says something good then they start liking it, then attention gets diverted from corruption, only those people will raise questions, right, if corruption is happening inside Gurgaon. Something went wrong in the management, as it was heard, it is okay, something went on and an inquiry was also held, so it is the problem of the people of Gurgaon, what will the people of Bangalore do for that, O people of Gurgaon, what is happening to you, so just let the people of Gurgaon know. Give a lollipop to someone, if they agree to something then their attention will go there, that's it, then the politician is the one who used to treat small children like mom and dad, the mouth is crying.  I gave another lollipop, gave this toy, gave a rattle and we become happy with such rattles but we are not children and these are not parents and this is not the time, we have to come to the point again and again and  We have to talk about the same thing, we have to talk about the same thing, why did this happen, why did this not happen? No, why did this pot not break like this, why did this happen, why did this happen, what is the reason, then it is very important to talk about this and when we keep discussing the same issue again and again. not going down  Will give and will ask again and again like I had made a full case that brother, it is okay, you caught him and this happened and he got it written like this and this happened, that happened, the system manager will not go after drinking alcohol, why don't you check the vehicles?  We used to wonder how fast a car can go, how fast are the cars running without any connection, why are there so many cars from outside, no, no, we can't do this, you can't do anything, then that, then we are again waiting for.  Again, some spoiled boy will do this after drinking alcohol at night. And again come and blame the rich and blame the person. Then people will continue to be like this. System mayor or Pune man. I had told three-four things in that video. If you guys watched the video.  If you haven't seen it then definitely go and see it, even if the practical things do n't happen in the future, this thing is very important but no one will talk about it because the headline changes, the headlines change, the headlines change.  Management is there, read the newspaper anytime, read this, look at the issues carefully and see what happened to them because the headlines will be managed very well. When the World Cup comes, the World Cup will be published in it within four days, because in 365 days, such news will be published. I am searching for 100 issues in a year so that I can make all the real issues disappear from your life. This is my job.  Age is a politician and the news channel keeps getting involved in it. Look at him. Anant Ambani ji has got up and got down. Now Amitabh Bachchan has come. Now he is taking photographs. Is Aishwarya Rai ji not with him? Is she coming separately?  Is there a rift in the Bachchan family, just keep making it like this, all yes, the Bachchan family should be known, there is a rift, no, the mother-in-law gets along with the daughter-in-law, we don't know, what difference does it make in our lives, what is the relation between Jai ji and Aishwarya ji? What difference does it make to us? Those things that make a difference to us, make a video like Agniveer sir gets 800 views, and here you can write the name of any thing and write its dark truth, brother, anyone gets 50000 views.  And he was saying that our podcast on Agniveer was so good and my guests had come and we had done so well, these comments were so good, very good podcast and very good comments, the questions were very good, my questions were very good.  The answers were good and the comments were even better. These were even better. But brother, only so many people have to know. Okay, but if Malaika Roda ji walks the dog, she will get 50 lakh views. Okay, so this is the truth of the country, so as we  We consume what we think and then mislead us or I always hit the dialogue, okay, in our country it is difficult to convince, it is easy to mislead and mislead people, so the easy task is done more by those like us who come to convince.  Everyone will try to question our agenda, whose agenda are you, are you of Congress, are you of BJP, are you not of Aam Aadmi Party, are you not of these three now? Whenever a party is unable to give an answer and cannot come up with any reasoning and answers to the questions, then tell the person asking the questions that we do not need any foreign power among the foreign powers, we have enough of our own raita spread in India.  And I don't need anyone else. Which song is that? What's my name? There is a song by Katari Nath ji. So we don't need anyone else. Brother, we have a lot of our own, we have spread it a lot and every time there is something.  It is the best example, I like it happens in the family badly, there are 500 issues in the family, there are child issues, this is trauma, so and so, and as if the daughter-in-law  All will not come on that, after its arrival, we became like this, other wise, we were like this, we are together, it is very easy, it is very easy for a state, a people, a particular community and caste and a particular religion and a particular country and a country man.  To Blame It On Some Buddy Else Because Then Every Buddy Is Okay Or Not This Is How The Heavy Powers Made It Happen In This Election External forces and this narrative runs in many countries as well. The fact is that the forces are so heavy. I may not deny the external forces but their effectiveness is at 01 but will be shown at 80. Because other wise, brother, we are going to reach the moon, okay astronaut, till the moon, nothing, friend, nothing B.B. Very very smart, how are they doing headline management? Very worried about them and there is no need to pay much attention to them, they will come, nothing will happen, this will happen, vehicles will be confiscated, electrical vehicles will come, this policy will come, that policy will come, then again nothing, then again nothing, headline management is at the state level.  50 to 100 news have to be published in such a state to mislead people so that they do not lose attention and even from that Delhi level, I have to give 100 out of 100. 50-60 happens just like India won the World Cup, no one can manufacture it, if it happens, then some good things will definitely happen, then somewhere, something will break down, just like something happens to trains, you can do something to them too.  If they can't do it, then they just concentrate from here, concentrate from there, concentrate here. If there is some accident in the train, then there is no Reel Minister, sorry, Rail Minister, not a reel, although they make more reels, that Rail Minister is going on the back of a motorcycle. He was not issued a challan without a helmet. Someone tell me, why did you not wear a helmet? If you had worn a helmet, how would you have clicked the photo of Rail Minister, sorry, he is a Railway Minister. How would you have known that sometimes he will enter under the train, sometimes he will enter above it, brother.  He is a very good Railway Minister. Wherever there are accidents, he goes under the train and checks. He does this and people become very happy with the fact that he used to come. Tell me when at that time.  Have you ever seen an accident in a train? Have you ever seen a railway minister sitting on the back of a motorcycle? And you are like Headlines Management Hey, what is this friend? What is behind the train? The job of the Railway Minister is that if an accident happens, then behind the motorcycle.  I went by sitting, it is a good one, that one was not coming at all, isn't it, why were there no trains before? It's amazing, friend, whatever you say, there were no people before, that is, if someone comes, open your tap with such water.  And when the water does not come, they say, why is your grandmother crying? She used to come with pots and pots in the village 50 years ago. Do you know anything? Water did not come, no one came, so what happened after filling the bucket in the morning and why not from so many three parties?  It comes like this friend, I am not kidding, we are becoming such a country, the thing that worries me most about this country is that our IQ is ending, our logic and logic are ending, take IQ and fools.  so far ahead  It has been done so far, it has been done so far and it is visible everywhere because a wise man says, 'How can I go? And all the fools have gathered fools and have elected me everywhere. You are fooling everyone.' Vote Yes, I have voted, I have also voted, I have also voted, not all are fools, but many are fools, and that Shana man, what does he think that I am Shana, that is why I am silent, the biggest problem is that many times many people  They say, hey friend, Guru ji, you make your own people, don't you tell everyone what you see, what you see, they already know Guru ji, it is right and rest of the idiots will understand otherwise the logic is very good to keep quiet that they will not know anything.  You know, you should not tell them and do something to the fools. This is the problem. When the voice of fools is made public so much, then people also start becoming fools and then the whole country becomes fool.  If you become irritated and leave the country, then the whole country will be made up of fools. Do you want this? This is what is happening. I am also telling you that what you are hearing is happening. If you do not raise your voice, then you know this.  There are many bad things and I will tell you one more example of bad things, if it is not controlled, many people say, and if you want to control these things, then as an example, you should buy property, you should do this.  You should invest, don't buy property, your wife will run away with you. If you wanted a video on this, then you would have written something. It would sound very stupid to some people, but many people would think that you are right. Section 490 49 has come, now the new one has come, another code of conduct has been imposed.  Hai Bharat Naya Samhita BNS Doosra Aaye 86 87 Hai Maybe, If you want to check the video then tell me because I am ready to make even on every Behede dialogue, not because you are my core.  The audience is a fool, only if you are with me, the fool will run away, but you have to become a loud speaker around you, so that this stupidity and stupidity does not happen within your 200, 500 meter radius, every single person can outweigh 400 fools, the ratio is this.  We should have that many loans because if the number of fools increases so much and they talk, then they will manage everything in the country like this.  Have heard the stories, yes, give it to the Canadians, give it there, give it reservation, give it in private, it is right, if you give it to the government, the Supreme Court will say that it is not allowed, give it to the private people, the private people are saying that we can do business with difficulty.  You are running, give reservation here, whoever is worthy, in private, the job is merit based, for all you know, all the links are already ready, I don't know, there are few outsiders.  If anyone has done the census yet then please spread these things, thank you very much."

    "title": "Women Reservation Bill ｜ Deep Dive Analysis [HDqmELaEniA].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, recently Women's Reservation Bill is a topic of discussion, we will discuss it, we will do some hair order thinking, I don't think that someone must have made this video like this, this is my completely original thought process and you all share it if you enjoy.  If you want more fun in this thing then write below friend, we have not seen this thing like this, this is the lack of Guruji, this is the essence of any Guruji, whatever books and old books of Guruji are yours, you have 100 perspective and  Situation between axis is very, very feasible and possible, that thing and showing you one aspect of it like N says right here, here, look at it like this, because right now everyone is seeing it like this, I am saying this from the middle of this video. Now I am going to do it like this and see this thing, if it is on D face, it is a very good thing, this new personalization is happening, so reservation, now I do it in such a way that I remove the new but reservation.  Let's catch it, okay, so reservation is being linked to empowerment, now it is new here today, but earlier the rest were from that time, did they get empowerment through reservation and if it is done, then it should be banded, if it is done then how many years does it take? Date is one aspect secondary in happening, there is a deep secret behind it, now I do not think that the conspiracy will be of any one particular party because it has always been there, all the fairies supported it, but thinking says that if the atmosphere is right now  This was being created and had already happened and a party would be successful to create this environment and that environment is right according to me that there should not be much nepotism in politics, it is okay and brother, all the people should not be from the same family.  There should not be dynasty politics and by doing this it has become a narrative in a way, the public also likes it and it has become nepotism and it is fine by doing it this way but this new bill that has come will increase it because of the Raj Bill.  discover tu fear  Parent's When they are fighting D Election IT Bill Not B against D New IT Bill B with D Men only How many NPS are there in Lok Sabha Who have come directly on their own She is not anyone's daughter She is not anyone's wife  There is no political link at home, they have very few women in this Lok Sabha, which comes out to be a figure of 15%, the world's average is 26% of its women MPs within Asia.  The average of India is 21%, if it is less than that then it is less but you have to rely one think, do we give reservation to women, to become a pilot, to become a pilot, to our Hindustan, India, do we not have anything in India which came after getting the license?  Our girls learn flying, they have the same jobs as men do and it is a matter of happiness in India, without reservation, without any support from the government, without support from the society, because you would not even know about this thing, many people in the world.  Indian Female Pilot Female Pilot Lady Pilot Female Pilots Women Pilots Are Maximum Ratio Vision Percentage Vice This is a very good thing and here there is no support from the story Individuals are made by paying a lot of money It is not like that that does not have to bear the expenses so the capability of women is not affected  He is not even doubting, but by doing this, instead of getting any benefit, I am telling you that this has happened at the level of MP and not at the level of Panchayat.  So a lot is going on with both of them, you all know it but we all also know that the official song, talk to us sometime, whether it is in your relatives or in the friend circle or you yourself, then you yourself write in the comment area.  They do n't have anything to do, only their husbands, father-in-law or sons take them everywhere. She was a good person. You had come to the Panchayat in which Neena Gupta was the Sarpanch and in this Raghuveer Yadav is also misguided and there is a term in it as well.  their Its term is also Sarpanch husband, MLA husband, Councilor husband, what are these words? Now a days, there are councilors, there are municipal corporations, there is a chairperson, they have been given reservation, being a woman, I do n't know the meaning of the outer layer, it belongs to God and is a rubber stamp.  In their official meetings, husband or father or in-laws come and they say officers should talk to us, as per law the officer can say you please get out, right.  D One Eye Bill Talk Tu Butt, you cannot even do it, because brother, I do not know anything. Daughter-in-law and niece [music] There are so many relationships in a relationship. Women have to do with one of them. Earlier, if there was one A because he had made so much noise that one of the families will give him a position in the party but in the government, he will not get a position.  you will get more like this  If you don't get it then you will be busy in the issue of women's reservation. The girl who will stand in the Malay reservation will be the girl who will stand. The lady who will stand will be from this political family and will be a powerful one. This reservation bill is not some walking lady like this.  The story that if the reservation bill was passed, now I can also be a politician and I can aspire to become an MP, it is from their relatives only, so what is the benefit and the ladies have shown which one is theirs in such a way that if the gender  When there is an attack on someone, he is irresponsible and party line, he opens his mouth. We have just seen that recently, the mouth of those who have to open the most has not opened at all. If not, then they should open their mouths. Tell me, empowerment.  How will it be, whose MP will it be? You have made him the MP, it has become his, but how will it be, I ca n't do it, but tell me one thing, I am telling you such a deep and easy thing and with this only you will know about this Hari.  political party So she gives only to whomever she has to give, so who is to stop her, you give 50% to women, give to 100, it is your choice, right, you do not take permission from anyone, it is not necessary to pass any doctorate, now Trinamool  Congress is our Mamta ji, please check this IM note, 37.8% of them are already ready, they had it, where did they get the quota from, they distributed their tickets to the women and the women won.  So here, divide the rest of the party also, now your mother does not want to divide because you think that if Har Jayaye, Har Jayaye, then in date, it is not capable and no if, it is not capable in up, so A should be less, I am MP and Ma. Everyone should be like this. Everyone should be like this. Then do 50% and then why do reservation here? Story: Money, power, power, women and let me tell you one more thing. Compliant behavior should be done in life and where control is to be increased and women should be promoted.  Do this, women are very loyal and compliant, the rest is also not a matter, mother is also a caste, you have caste in the Parliament, now I want to ask all of you, brothers and sisters, whatever you write in the comment area, there are 78 women NPS in the Parliament, I am very aware.  I am a human being, I read a lot and understand. I am a person who makes notes. How many female umpires' names come from your mind, it comes suddenly. You are right, so one minister is our Nirmala ji, she will come because she is the Finance Minister. Maybe I said something wrong, I am sorry, okay, Mahua Mishra ji says that she is a very dynamic leader, no one can call her like that, I don't know, whoever follows p4 even a little, knows the P of politics, then Mahua means ji.  Knows that hatred is only a spec, it does not mean that you agree with them or not, your ideology may or may not be with them, but it is not like this on the face, this is how it is, I am telling mine, this is how it happens from inside, nor am I telling it personally, if it happens to you, then you also tell.  Don't go on ideology that why did you say this, I love her, she said this from the front, so no no, don't look at such philosophy from within, I am going on telling the name, it is okay, it is okay, Badal ji, she was earlier a minister.  And Akali belongs to it and their presence is also a relief that yes, by doing this, Ranjit Ranjan is also an MP by doing this, he is from Bihar, he comes from the city, he is fine and whose name does it, we know Hema Malini, but if you say this, then we have  Some?  Haven't you heard of her doing something? Okay, tell me more Jai Bahadur ji, we know that she too is inside the Rajya Sabha, she says something, gets angry, raises issues, okay, okay, tell me more and the Rajya Sabha people don't count. I think it was 25 in Rajya Sabha, it is less, it is 78 in Lok Sabha, we know Supriya Suleji, yes, she is Pawar ji's daughter, okay and she is also sometimes some intelligent thing, well, I have heard about her sometimes.  MP on Tweet and tell me more and tell me, those who have done physical presence or their presentations, will you Google it or are you very good in GK, then you will be able to tell some more names, I will tell you by thinking loudly, the rest is nothing less, finger on your lips.  Contribution is nothing, just that one is someone's something, there is something else there, see, there is no appraisal report of MP Ma, like a corporate, this is not a promotion for you, no master has given him or her, who is we or us?  Ortega, we only know you after the next five years, so what are you doing, we do n't know anything about you and on what basis you were selected, because you were a woman, there was reservation, so you were selected, see this, I am using it as an example.  I am still telling you that if those who have not understood what I am hinting at, if Ma wants to hire me as an engineer, then it is okay for a company and if the company has to run in the best way, then if I say there that  50%  There will be men, 50% will be women, it will be equal and if I pass the rule on this then why is this an odd rule because the reason for this is that in the flower of engineers, I am 10 times 9 times more female, so when I select the best.  If I do, the chances are more that I will be among the best of men because they are more in number. If there are 1000 male engineers and 200 female engineers in the market, then out of 1200, if I  If I have to select and out of those 200 I will select 50 women and out of 800 I will select 50 men then there are a lot of chances that the 50 selected out of 200 are far behind many of those 800 people and I have done the best.  Do not select engineers, the normal method would be that if there are 200 engineers and there are 800 i.e. 1000 male engineers.  Normally, with probability, good engineers will emerge from this group only. If the ratio is 1:5, then for every five good male engineers, only one good female engineer will be found. This is a normal probability. This can be changed a little up or down because this is the reason for politics.  If the political woman does not want to connect with the political family, then if there are a thousand women in politics late in Kabul and the bridge of men is 10,000, then  10 We have nothing to do with gender, we want to like capable people. Okay, if we want to bring capable people in the Parliament, then people who are irrespective of gender will come. Okay, this country had a woman Prime Minister 60 years ago. That has not happened yet in America.  It is not that 60 years ago, it is not the case here that the ministers have turned out to be so domineering, so now it means Mayawati ji was there, Jayalalitha ji was there, okay, there is our Mamata Banerjee, before that there was also Uma Bharti ji and  Tell me, female, I am speaking, I remember you, so it's okay, how about you, there is no such thing in politics, there is no muscle, there is a very respectable female leader of ours, Sushma Swaraj ji means one of the best spoken and means an ideal like you politician.  She said that she was an ideal woman politician and had the knowledge, manner of speaking and address, the base feeling emanating from her and the journalism awareness level, so we need 50% women in it.  Whether 70 have come or only 15 have come, neither has it been good for those who have come nor has it been good for those they are bringing, it is better to say this on this D message, if you are against them then I said not you.  If you want reservation percentage to improve, otherwise it is not big, if there is improvement, then band it, for how many years will you do it, the meaning of women will come now, that is, women in India means 10-15 years.  It is a different matter that when this bill is going to be implemented, it is not known because there is a link with the censor, that is, there is not even a vote in the 2024 elections. This is just a masala right now. Now if it is not coming in 2024, then after that elections will be held only in 2019, which means you are not enjoying the scene of such a hung parliament. Mostly it is fine, so it is not coming in 2024 because.  Sensex is not the same till then, we don't know what will happen next, when will it happen, how will it happen, so now one more thing tick tick tick tick tick but practical, when for you it is not paying at Sarpanch level, it is not paying at Municipal level.  If he is not doing it at councilor level then no one will do it in future also, this is back door entry for men, back door entry for men and I have even seen in the cases of Sarpanch and his husband.  Father and son have committed some fraud and this has also happened to the Gajagiri woman because brother, the signature is hers, the name is hers, the order is hers, wherever whatever has to be done, there is expenditure and water, whatever less then what is this?  Their exploitation of empowerment of women is if she is genuinely independent like Smriti Irani ji is like Mahua Mishra ji, independence is okay, independence means adopting some fear, it is okay if someone wants to come and say let's go.  I can't stand but it is of reservation so now my wife will do it but support will be put in my name and inside that canvas lion's photo is also of a man and a small photo of a woman is going to cast the actual vote and they will say brother.  You are giving this actual to Netaji but this madam is his madam, that relation can be any, it can be that of wife, it can be of daughter, it can be son, it can be cheating, it is okay but she is voting for him and everyone else.  Do you know and tomorrow when she becomes MP and when people come to listen to those problems, they will come to her husband, father and father-in-law only, Honey's question is where to vote from here, how to do it, what is the dynamic?  Where is it to open my mouth, to boast, I am just a puppet, what I am saying is a very superficial thing, it is not necessary to pay so much attention, it is a good thing if you have passed, it is okay, if you have passed then it is a good thing.  But again I did not understand the logic of 33%, the same note is 50%, there are 20 sisters and 25 sisters, 15, so it has been made 33%, yes, it has also been made, now it should be like this among OBCs also, so much is needed, that is a separate relief.  This is also the reason why I am talking about reservation within reservation, that is, we will make all these things so complicated that it will not be of any benefit to anyone, but if we make that an issue, then time will be spent in the discussion, which will be very good.  Be it big or small, if less is good then it means the result should also be shown. How is the result? There is back door entry in one family and if there is 7 or 8 constituencies in it, then in one the woman will become the wife of the one who runs his dominance in the area. If you want to take advantage of her, then only the woman from this house will stand up. Even if you make someone else stand, she still has a fight with the man, she is not with the woman, still she is the daughter of the leader on the mattress.  The daughter-in- law is pampering the daughter-in-law and the daughter-in-law. If someone stands at her level, then it is a man 's world, let it be accepted. It is a good thing to think about. This will be a topic of discussion again, but we should understand that in practice, it is not such a great thing.  If it has happened, then it is okay. There is no point in doing this further by making it a subject of much discussion because it was so easy that it was passed because there was no one against it, not so much, then no, it was not passed earlier.  It could have been because people were so practical, people knew that there was no corporation in it, so I hope this is a different perspective, you understood the meaning, I liked it, write in the comment section, I will keep coming with such independent opinion analysis and this is definitely the case.  Otherwise, there will be a lot of such things coming in the future which are just clapping, clapping and then it will seem like a very good factor, no, there is no such thing as a good factor, there is no problem.  Things should come on merit and it should be on merit. Many people say that cricket team is okay, it is male's, female's or they say in tennis, there are men, there are women, tennis players, their pay is cheque, there is money, it should be equal.  Because man and woman are equal. Hey brother, more people come to men's cricket matches, more tickets are sold, more advertisements are received, then you will get a share of it. If female cricket or female tennis players are not able to attract you. Number of people in the date, then money will be given accordingly. If any female singer is very famous and her concert is Fool House Rahat, then it is Irrespective of email. If there is any male singer, he brings less than them from football, then I will get it to the female singer. Why logic does not work everywhere? This syndrome of equalization is destroying relationships in families too. Here parents are also busy in equalizing two brothers, let the sisters or brothers and sisters be equal.  If we have to do it then he becomes equal, many things may not be equal, power or different because that story is playing him out like this and even if you make him equal, he does not become equal because he does not accept this, this is also a factor.  She becomes the President, no one accepts her, she is female, neither does he accept her, nor does he listen to her, this is also a fact because if you want to become a leader in politics then you need dominance and that one right now, just because you are on the seat.  He will sit, nothing happens with that, he doesn't agree, what will you eat, made a resolution, made me sit, then he doesn't say Namaste, then this is also a problem, you also need to be discussed along with true things, I hope you guys are enjoying it, very good feedback.  Subscribers are also increasing and if you can increase it, we will become a good voice by the election season. I am providing such a channel to you people who are interested in the common people.  There is middle class, there is no platform because whoever comes, no one comes with independent opinion and perhaps there is independence in making any claim from one video of anyone, but if you watch 15, 20, 25 videos of anyone, then you will know.  Which one is it okay? So I hope you guys are checking my Independence Day by now. If not then write in the comment area. Okay, my party changes in every video. Caste is defending on D.  Message ok tell me which party of mine is in this video thank you very match"

    "content": "Hello friends, I am making this video, another number for friends, the one who does germination. Hello friends, it is okay for Dhruv Rathi ji. While reviewing the picture of Jawan, he has put some data, son. I am in the mood to make any video.  Because my subscribers have asked a lot of questions that Sir, what is your take on this? If you say it like this, then first of all, before I pick it up, I want to tell a general thing to brother Dhruv Rathi ji also.  If the message is received somehow or you send it to him or someone close to him will be sent here too, the message will be that the tone and tenor are very bad, you bring down the moral self-esteem and the bill of the people of this country.  If there is right or wrong, then there is nothing right or wrong, so it penetrated inside the families. Mother was a great narcissist. There was something wrong with someone's father. Grandfather definitely knew that there was something wrong. Due to his capacity, he can also find out many things in the families.  Too  But still, if you want to live, then I will tell you the fact check and that method, but I am telling you what is their standard. I have to write an essay like that of a seventh class child. Earlier, I had to write it, but nowadays I have to do Google and got hold of that book, one paragraph of it.  An essay has been made of this, this has been made of this, it is also a product of the Indian Education System, since the first day, not in 2000, I am not that either, but that tone train is such a relief, that is why this is another reason for insulting.  What I tell you is that we have to stay here in our country, what I have said is a pending video, you have no moral writing to say, you have gone away, neither your country has been destroyed nor yours has left you, nor did you like it nor anyone else.  When I went to Karan, I went away, now you have fixed the daily greetings friends, if I were to tell you about this place, then tell the Germans, tell them what is your M, because I am telling you because many of ours have  people go out and they stay  They are very happy, they have left behind their families rather than the country. One day I will make a video about this. It is okay that people care more about their relatives, parents or church people than the country. They leave their environment and do not know the country. You do not know how to read the country.  Here in the country, people are living very happily, whose relations are good, whose families are fine, some people think that there are many people living in love, but when you have gone like you and have to tell your subscribers, that is why they have to read. Because there are 1 crore plus subscribers, many times they say Guruji, you are sitting on ₹ 11000, that ₹ 1 crore is like a brother, this is a lot, it is a big balloon to deflate the subscribers, there is nothing in this message, whatever caste it is, it will go away and will reach the last.  Time also asked them about astrology, then I told something because what would have happened is that you have kept a team, there is no original content, there is no original, I also prove it.  From the example, MIG-21 is 60 years old, so many have been crushed, so many pilots have died by doing this, give it color but Basanti picture was also made, that Hello Hello Hello, there are many reasons for this, it may be the pilot's fault, it may be the power, it may be the fault of the servicing.  There is power, there can be bird hits, there can be weather, there is no use of aviation now, no data has been extracted from the story, brother, there is an accident rate, how many hours are there in that army or air force?  She flies in it, what is the rate of plane crush per 10000 hours, it is now Indian on normal and Force IT has no problem in one and you have given three years to various reasons and today an organization does it constantly for flight safety and you  COMPARE IT WITH THE REST OF THE AIR FORCES Your F 35 is not being crushed What is not happening Is the F 35 being crushed Germany  Don't these things happen in other places? By doing data on a bus, picture it in absolute sense. Hey brother, the plane that was in some force's service for 60 years was the one that used to fly. It is like Maruti 800 only used to run. If in the 90s it was a proposal then it was the only one that used to fly. Whatever accidents happen to passenger cars, they will happen to Maruti only because Maruti is running, now there will be no accidents to Maruti because there are 25 types of them, tell me son which account.  By which you are debasing the country and trying to lower the Armed Forces, please do justice to it, brother, if you compare it with the Jawan picture, it was said in Jawan that what is the shortcoming of the imported weapon in the one which has been imported?  Which weapon has come now? Tell me its name. Now inside it, it goes like this. This is how it will be in the weapon. Firecrackers are made inside Shiva Kashi. Do you know the firecrackers which are made for Diwali?  Firecrackers are not that dangerous because children are burning sparklers, pomegranates are being burnt in homes, how many people have died due to fire hazards there too, in Sivakasi and I am telling the name of the place here, real lamination, real ordnance, real reduction.  If you are going on then brother, he is also a professional hazard, isn't it? How many electricians are there in our government system, who have been martyred in the line of duty while doing their jobs? I will martyr any man for the country.  He is doing less, he is doing it in any capacity, let's go, you professionals are also a thing, give everyone's numbers, you say that so many soldiers have been martyred in rallies inside Kashmir in the last 30 years, then give something.  Something this country is constantly producing this break people, I am less and they fight every time you come, this is your system is less, during Covid, we may have even saved lives in one incident.  Something like this had happened in the hospital, this is a country of 144 crores, every day there is news of so much disappointment, by doing the same thing every day you make it the same, friend, video five of yours, you have kept that jamure, take it out and again and again-  It has been shown like this, brother, that the report is that even the people with arms can do that with your weapons, if a country has become self-reliant, doing something of its own, there is something in it, then how can it be that the same weapon takes everything.  sitting at the border  But all the same 47 Lakes are running, only one 47 Lake is running behind the states. The story is that in any other situation, if someone is trying to develop a weapon on his own, then if any report comes forward and there is any deficiency in it, then it will be shown.  Amen, keep buying from outside, now LCM is being made, Tejas is being made, if something is being made inside your country, then keep talking about that too, its radar is being made so good, the rest of the things are being made that are in progress.  Keep saying crackers, this is useless to you, this is useless to you, that is good, then whose language are you speaking? Coming from my community, I am also ashamed of myself. Normally, such things should not be made in brotherhood, but normally. When it is a matter of caste in the country, then there is no meaning of brotherhood because you have married outside while sitting outside. The person with Guru element in the block, what I call myself as a person, does not even suit me much personally.  Go to the level, but brother, you come every day and become personal. Is every Indian disappointed? You are flat, that too from garbage information, because you are an information, it will be the same thing, not Ashwatthama Maa Gaya Na Nai Elephant, it is okay, that too, Nah Haathi.  By not hiding what has been programmed, you will want to cry, it has happened, neither could he have said that much, tell me the information, it has not come in full, tell me anything in totality, don't tell me that much.  This is how it happened, this came and made this and then made the next one and those who say that this is to tell the truth Dhruv Rathi, that's why people troll, people are devotion, now like in my video, some of the first ones have ever called me a Congressman.  Before that, someone was saying 'you', someone was saying 'lifts', one was saying 'devotion' to a person, 'I will make you patriotism' and someone else was saying something about 'patriotism', if you consider that person as your country then brother, then this is your problem, we are patriotism now. desi mother did you tell someone  Even if you take it, it is your interpretation, not mine, but now he does not say it, now why do you make it personal like this, brother, why do you explain it in such a personal way, when you apply chilli to so many Indians, the devotees do not have the knowledge, no one even knows.  Tell me, so many kills there, so many kills, so many kills, so many kills, there must be something to the operation recipe, there must be something to the operation recipe, this is military aviation, this is not a fan flying, we are having fun here. You sat down like a Boeing, you went from here to Frankfurt Airport, we took off in Montreal, you took off in Ritas and nothing is happening, you have less to program, this is a fighter plane and you will be involved in their training as well as in learning.  Will be there and will be there at the time of fight too. Abhinandan ji's plane went away and when it was shot, before shooting he shot brother. If there is a fight, then you will have to die. You will have to die, wo n't you? He entered from 21 inside the formation, who did you belong to and why?  When there is no knowledge, the things which have no place inside, that super previous, whenever I watch you on my channel, there is no need to show anything to talk about data, Indian says, the story has been written, show it, just do the report like this.  If you show it then everything will be right. Now I will get up with the help of those things and I will also get up and do counter data. Data data data will play. Hey brother, everything is true, everything is lie, they have some agenda which is always dravna and's.  That's the biggest problem  I feel that brother, you have left the country, Ram Ram, personal life is fine, you improve your family, it is fine, become a national global citizen, it is a very good thing, we will settle it among ourselves here, I am living in Gurugram and I have the right to live here and  To create a ruckus and get angry that the government is flooded, you sit outside, yes, this is your bad, this is bad, his is bad, whose one is good, then tell me which one do you want, then it will be good, he caught that one, that is good.  And Information: Look at our children, especially those who are above 35 years of age, they have the realization of what is happening in their life because life itself teaches them that if you push them in life till 35 years, then you will have no agenda.  But for these new kids, my duty has been to make this video here, it has not made a big impression and this is very correct, he said that, he said it right, he did it like this, he did it like that, he did it like that  This is how it happened, you don't have to spread so much despair and those of my subscribers who are listening, please counter these videos also, it is not about everything inside, but it happened there, it happened from oxygen, hey brother, listen, tell me one thing. Google your can, Canada's health system is collapsing, ca n't you live your life, you are sad, they have done that system too, look at the situation in America, what happened in the comedy, what is the condition of these first world countries of yours? India happened  Style Recovered here in India, I do n't know what was predicted for 144 crores, what would happen, okay, it was very great, a lot more could have gone wrong, many will fight for the license and now those who are moving forward, my world is getting chilly.  But what I am saying is that the world is getting chilly, that is what we understand now. What do you think about the Prime Minister of Canada, are you from here or the citizenship? Can anyone tell that this is Dhruv Rathi's citizenship from Germany?  Is it from India or is it from India now? If it is from India then why should I talk about things here and there and brother, if you are not from India then you are speaking on this basis because from inside every Indian who has gone out feels guilty.  It feels good to know many people that yes, right now there is no trouble going on here and it is good that we have been taken out, it is good that this is a relief from the oppression of those who are like us here, sometimes the mood is good.  Even if it never happens then your Twitter  We write on our own leadership, politicians will say that we write, you write on the public's Ganesh, but it is our moral right, brother, we are sitting in the middle of this, hello friends, now I am also from the digital platform, hello friends. How to do that also, I will make a video for you guys, one day it is still pending, I remind you every time, you guys tell me why I have to stay here and I will not play the game of patriotism in it, why not, it is our country, it is there.  hee  Our country is love, we should stay but I will tell you the practical thing, why should we not go out, why should we remain blind, you will see that all the practical things are layout and your decision will be stay in India bill be match butter decision making but that is me.  I will tell the video for you guys but I have a request that this is Dhruv Rathi's tone and his body language. You see this in this body language. Come, I also do something.  But in the story, there is no chilli taste in any Indian, it is good, it is big, there is a way of speaking, it is like this, by doing it like this, and then friends, and this is known, this is known from within, and this is how Indians do with their mother.  I am not a political activist of any party, I am a registered member and there is no DBA from my side, she is not mine, but she still feels like she is in love with me, everything is fine.  it's been yours Hey, this did not happen to you, you had already programmed it, caste has happened in 47, where you are sitting, the program has already been done there, there are so many countries and what will happen in the next 15 years in that country, you yourself can see the show wherever you are sitting.  Yes, and then you will come back again, idiot, it is okay and you will come here, then you will say here for some 15 years, what contribution have you made, Shiva, they will say, it is bad, it is bad, it is bad like this, it is bad like that.  By saying all this is bad, you do not contribute to anything beyond this, the report has come like this, hey brother, many things are bad, many things are also good, but the tone and tenor is there, if the tone is 24 hours, if in our country or in our house or  Keep track of what is going on in your personal life, if you keep track of this then life will end and when many things are going good, what is his, the biggest thing is tone entertainer, he is absolutely conditioning and he has one in every video.  If it happens in a person, it is understood that there is some emotion or something wrong, he is the one who is constantly your content creator, he is the one who picks up this bad thing like this, I do it like this and tell him, if the thing is not going to be fixed by this, then please subscribe. Write in the comment area and share it on your group and things will be fine, there is a way to point out mistakes in things, that sir, you are busy in defeating everyone, well and moral and self esteem.  The attack on Indians is in the way of you, you are continuous and you have made a soldier worth one crore. That is also a matter of concern because it will go from one dead to three and then what is that one? It is a self-inflicted disease. Nothing can happen to us, it is like this, that negative talk is not right at this time. I hope the audience will support you in this matter and will message me. You must have seen it from the middle of my video 19 20  21 video delhi take life's plane to a destination where s citizens they know what is happening they know what is good what is bad and be they can in our mind's tree you improve things and observe other negativity and a bitterness bitterness frustration today  The element of 'n country' is very high in us, it is already high, there are many reasons for it and these people only reduce the gee in it today.  That any man, if he wants to feel something good in peace, then he comes and talks about it and lives in the experiment, if one of us comes, then only we will go to the match, my only thing is that live a normal life in between, don't force macho too unnecessarily.  And it should not be in the middle, do less business and move forward slowly. This is my athlete flag. I hope you guys will support. Like."

    "content": "Hello friends, recently I watched a video, I will also tell you what impression I got from it. You guys also participate that that impression is a little right and I will also give a guidance and advice about it. If you find it right then tell me. This is regarding the  Youth, okay, so that was the setting of the video. They are showing that there is a boy in North India. There is a setting where there is a senior police officer and that boy stands up and says that I will try to do this in this video.  If I give the link in the comment section so that it becomes more clear what he has said, he has said that a lot of drugs are being managed and when the children are so angry, he is saying that here four-five university children are sitting in some auditorium. I will put the link here and in the comment section of this video or in the description, you can watch this video, if it is ok, then if we children can access drugs so easily, like we take toffee, then the police can access it.  Why can't she do this? This is a big question in the society. This one is a big question in the society. I have seen how logical he is talking and the same child, meaning he is from the university, is saying that man, this issue of drugs is going on, so this  My follow up discussion is because I am not directly linked with very young people in my consultation and advisory etc. I do not normally operate at the 181 level.  The level above 30 is fine. Consultancy, marriage business, real estate and other consultation, I do marital consultation, astrology or whatever. How many of you are in this age group or do you have children and you are seeing this phenomenon.  That drug use is becoming normal in many big places in India. Is this true? I am asking you people and if this is true because I just started checking a little and got my feedback.  I have come up many times but it is very important to talk to the public and write in the comment section. If you live in a big city, then according to me, you should not send your child to any other city, especially if a college or school is average, the college is also average.  This is because it is becoming so dangerous that some people told me that there are some famous top colleges, I do not want to raise controversy here by saying that I should tell their branding, what does it start with and what they say there.  So the situation is like this, you told me, Guru ji, the situation is like this that here, if you do not take it, you are thrown out of the league. He says that here children get only three-three-four hours of sleep.  And it is being said that they are making their living by consuming all this and they say that they are preparing for the corporate life and then they also fit in the corporate culture so well that they do not even sleep till 1010-111 o'clock.  to work  They have a habit of 'And that shows through their eyes that they have become drug addicts but they are also performers, that is, this is an amazing thing, they are not like that, that is, they are doing it exactly like that, but in a different way, even useless puns, intelligent sharp alert.  Looks like they are earning good money and are still doing this work. And since this aspect of theirs is right then they don't pay much attention to this drug aspect. Sometimes even I don't understand that when a child is someone's  Intoxication  And if he does n't wake up after getting drunk, doesn't work, is destroying his life, then the concern of the parents is that his health is down or he is not doing anything because if you accept this, then I am taking the thing of order thinking, if a child  He is doing a good job, is studying in college, is making presentations, is working hard, is sleeping less, is earning a lot of money, is doing all the work, the relationship is also fine, he is not even complaining about it.  There is no aggressive behavior, the behavior is also normal, there is no complaint coming from anywhere but he is taking drugs, everything else is fine for him but if he is taking drugs and the wrong one is doing it, then is it not a matter of concern because at some point of  There will be some or the other incident in terms of time, body will give up and then he is getting burnt out, then there is that stress, depression, mental health, these children are not like that, this is not something immediate for the society, one by one.  So you saw that the angle is that a man is a loser and he has not achieved anything in his life and he will be addicted to drugs. Now he was a loser earlier also by getting addicted to drugs and if he becomes a loser then he becomes like this in the society and in the family.  The whole public thinks that he is a separate category but this category is becoming separate and the ease of coming in the society is not a difficulty and after watching the video of that child it seems that he himself  is speaking  That it is being received like toffee, so quickly, how will they take cognizance, how will it happen, what is your logic on this, will the politicians focus on this? No, where will the votes be received, where will the votes be received, then this is not even being discussed.  No, this is not a priority, play on reservation, before that we used to play on religion, then we will play on reservation, then in between we will also play on economy. When will this youth play on drugs? When will there be discussion about drugs, then at which place?  Where is it prevented in the cities? Please see it in the comment section because you people are real people, you also talk to people, you have children, you can be children yourself, you can be that college student, is this about drug menace?  What is the level? Are boys doing it? Are girls also doing it? Is it increasing? How much is it high or is it normal or very low? I am not worried. From the testing I have done I feel that the rice is ripe but raw.  That there is a need for tension in this, so a lot of menace is spreading. It was once in the big cities, it was among the rich, now it is within the middle class and it is coming here too. This used to happen many times and I am very fond of the middle class. I am a class specialist, today I am telling you a secret for the middle class, make a note of it somewhere and if it touches your heart then it will make you feel wow. What is the curse of the middle class? The children of the middle class are getting spoiled. If they were not spoiled earlier then it would be more but if.  get worse  So I don't know how to improve and I operate on every band width between ultra pure to ultra ultra rich, I am fine, the children of the rich know how to improve by spoiling and they all get screwed and when a middle class child goes to a rich person.  If something goes wrong with a friend, then that rich friend will get spoiled and will even get into the business of taxing his family. This is a big secret. If you knew, then write down, otherwise, today you have come to know about this.  to the child  I have to tell you that son, daughter, your group knows everything because they know how to recover, they know the value of money and they have a lot of banking, they will get all the experience after gaining experience, you will not be able to get out of a middle class. I am also a relationship expert, today one person is feeling like giving out the secret and the other is also feeling like giving out the secret. Sometimes the mood changes, the emotions become such that one has to do some good for the society, the rich boy or  A girl's heart breaks. Do you understand heartbreak? The boy has left the girl and gone away, he has become a middle class boy. The girl's heart breaks, he is unable to connect and goes into depression. The rich do not have these problems.  If not this then that and someone else is right, if not you then someone else is right and if not then someone else is right and if not then someone else is right Their funds are a little straighter, it is better I am not saying that it does not happen to anyone but I did not say about probability.  it's a game  Your son or daughter is vulnerable if you are middle class because you have not done things that connect your heart, do not do addictive things, your children do not even know what a game is, in other families, the rich families have already done the work, they know and the parents have guidance.  Everyone also knows and when a child does some work like this, I am not saying that wrong things should be done but parents have a big role, so middle class you cannot afford that your child follows the wrong path.  go you don't have anything  You Master Dinanath Chaun, you have earned respect, if you have not earned money, sometimes you have to laugh a little, you also have to make fun of me, don't paint me as a devil, I am talking for the greater good, it is a big issue, keep your children like this a little. That child, you are my most precious thing, you stay with me and if for some reason you are going to that city, then I will also go or mom will go, mom, there is no point in living with dad. Father, he is not going to deteriorate now, he is 50 years old, he is not going to deteriorate, he will manage his bread too. Stay with your boy, stay with the girl, go to their city a little beyond them, which is the city where there is a good college to live there?  There are many parents who live in Kota with their children and the children of those whose parents live in Kota are more selected. I am telling you today that I don't know how much data I have collected. Normally, it is not my habit to tell so much in one go, I tell things in a different way in workshops, webinars, here in Kharcha Paaniwali, I am telling it openly because I felt that this is a big issue. And  You people should promote this thing in the same way that brother, these are activities, we have to tell these things but there is a fear that if we tell about a friend, if we tell the police, then this will also go, that will also go, there will be enmity with me and this much is common.  yes  If it is a work like toffee, then this is the biggest problem, how to stop it, not only many people, many children, I have seen them telling parents, parents say, you don't take it, so you just keep quiet son, don't take it, don't study, but someone is confused.  Don't put fear in, there is so much fear and if you look at that fear logically then it seems absolutely right that you had gone there to study, there these works are done in your company, you have taken the contract to fix those works, whereas there is a system which is there.  It is state, he also did not take it Now if you go there and complain about someone, you don't know what will happen to you. I am telling you a practical thing because there will be safety issues. If you complain, then that whole act will be imposed, so this is a big thing.  It is a matter of concern that on top of that you will be boycotted that he is a man with a grudge, he had trapped us last time, it will be difficult for you to stay there if you live in a hostel, in any hostel or somewhere outside, this work is done.  are happening there  If you are not doing it, then it is a simple thing that brother, you have to be careful about where you are studying because you are not getting a job after the college you are studying in, but these are the jobs being done there, it is better than this at a place like this.  Study where these jobs are not happening or stay with your parents because still there are no jobs. I am telling you this in a practical way and which colleges have the highest stress.  there is a lot of studying, a lot  There are presentations, there are projects, there is the system of CGPA, so and so is bullying and the whole crowd there is doing it and sometimes what happens when the whole crowd is doing yours and the so called decent children are also doing it because I have released that there is no such image that  The drug dealer is taking drugs and is doing wrong things. He is a goon type of kid in the movies. Even the most respectable kids are talking politely. Good morning.  Yes Good Evening Guru ji, Namaskar and they are also doing drugs, now what will you do with them, either they are caught taking drugs or someone complains, only then will you come to know that the child is taking drugs. Otherwise, the children don't even know about it.  So the elder is also a very polite child, but his health is also deteriorating, he is also getting addicted and these corporate people who come for my job also, I have a lot of hold on them, they are saying that friend from that college.  From that college, it is called HiFi College, they say that all the students are coming from here and they tell them that they are ready to work at 11 o'clock at night but they are not able to come at 10 o'clock because their whole cycle is wasted in the college.  There is discipline and they will show a lot of energy from within, they will also show absence and they are also intelligent, that is why this is a big problem in the society today, people have caught their heads, are they also intelligent and vomit energy?  They show up on time and normal people do n't live the way they live. Now how to sync the work with them? How can the boss sit with them at 11 o'clock? This generation is coming saying we will sit late boss we will. Joy Chanda and  The boss is saying that I have a wife and I have to go home. If you people have such a habit, then this is a live issue which I have raised. Through this channel, I am practical about all such things."

    "content": "Hello friends, fun topic, learn this thing about time, I will tell you one, two, three, four things about time, try to understand them well, we say good time, bad time, bad time is going on, good time is going on, so you have to see that  I will tell you one bad thing about good times and I will tell you one good thing about bad times. The bad thing about good times is that it will end, it will not last forever and the good thing about bad times is that it will also end. Keep this thing in mind First of all, second thing, when times are going bad, you are not feeling good, when basically what are bad times is that what you want is not happening or you are not being made to feel good or you are being scolded or life is not going according to you.  I am not able to do this, this is what we call bad time, what else is a bad time, brother, the challenge is more, the fun is less, when the fun becomes more, have seen the picture, the girlfriend is also there, the boss is also happy, money is also coming, parents are also Aarti.  taking off  If you are looking sexy and in demand and everything is good then they will call it good time, what will happen in bad time, people talk to you in a selfish manner, you are not able to take any revenge from anyone, people go away after listening to you, no one listens to you.  No one is respecting you, you are not getting money, you have to do hard work, you are facing hurdles, your stomach is not well, your health is not well or there are troubles around you, so spend all your time on this. You have to learn one more thing in this that whenever you consider it to be a so-called bad time, then the person who is misbehaving with you may be going through such a time that the person may want to get away.  Maybe doing all that, his time is going on like this, you too must have spent such a time in your life that you did something and nothing happened to you, now if you sneeze, you get whipped and there was a time that you don't know.  What all did you do to get away and then you grow up and many people have those memories. Hey, we used to do like this then and now it happens like this, so it's all a cycle in this and like the rule I mentioned in the beginning is the same rule.  If it is not always applicable, then whatever nonsense it is giving today or is giving to the world, you will observe it for a long time, which we are not able to do many times because the boss changes, so nowadays it is the era of social media. By following you, we will give you a chance to give peace to your soul. Just like Karan Arjun will come, in the same way, he is a dirty boss who has troubled you a lot, follow him too, you will get a lion and a quarter lion further, you will get the news, sooner or later it will reach your ears like ghee and sugar.  But it is a very loose kind of life that I have to wait for him when something happens in his life but if you want to do it then it will happen then it is okay but sometimes one has to wait for a long time for all these things and in short time.  I am some  If it doesn't happen, then you think that nothing bad will happen to him, no, because every ill-mannered person is not only the biggest enemy of the world, but his own enemy because the world probably has to stay with him for one hour, two hours, six hours, three hours, but he  If you have to stay with yourself for 24 hours, then those who spread Misbil are spreading Misbil in the world. Whoever has, is giving only what he has, so look at his heart, he has to stay with you for 24 hours and feel pity on him, treat him like this, hey.  You have to live with yourself for so long, you have to live with yourself like this, then you end up contracting some disease or the other, it's okay that sooner or later the blood boils a lot and somehow it becomes thick.  Is n't it, if you boil it too much, then in the same way their blood gets thickened, cholesterol gets absorbed and it gets programmed, okay then you should feel better if your boss is shouting at you and making you feel bad, then you will see that you have made a mistake and have a heart attack.  side  If he is going, then you do not need to be sad that he shouted, you need to be surprised, even if you go to him half an innocent time and tell him, Sir, I have made a mistake, I am useless, I am a scoundrel, I am an idiot, why are you taking punishment, then he will say.  I punished you, Sir, what did you give me? If you scream, you have manufactured it in your body. To manufacture it, you have to take some hormones at level at body level at stress level.  Dopamine Rotten Heart Hoot Artery Footry Hit seven or eight English words like this and speak on it, then your blood will become thick, then cholesterol will increase, then you Vijay Sethupathi used to act like this, you will become like this, do this twice like this, your boss will understand.  You will say how can I do it like this, I do n't know what will happen, nothing will happen, there is victory over fear, maybe thank you, maybe I will become your favorite friend, I have told many people who were angry with me at some point in their life.  Now maybe they also follow my videos. Being happy after watching this video of mine has changed a lot in myself. It is okay to take revenge from many people in life, then Jannali starts laughing after seeing you. I also know that after watching my videos, I am very happy.  Many people do not sleep. I have this feeling. So, am I a Guruji type of person and I live only in the spirit of revenge? No, no, it is not that I live for that, but those are the side effects, like they say, Colette benefits.  to do some work Okay, so you can do it like this also because I am the only one who tells the YouTuber like one had life in it, someone had another one, which was Sridevi's movie Chaalbaaz, there are two sisters, Hema Malini's was Sita, Geeta and its own.  Who is Ram and Shyam by Dilip Kumar? Well, it always happens that one is tortured and one is like that, so we do the same, so we should know both the things in life and we should have definition of bad and right time, when your time.  not a little  Things are going bad, you have to calm down, but don't have that helplessness in you, don't do anything more, learn things and be quiet and wait, wait. Whatever time we put in effort in learning new things in bad times, that is what is good for us. Time becomes the basis, I have seen many people breaking down at bad times, why like a donkey they keep trying things, try try again, such things are like divine creations and after doing that, they become innocent and Say something against them, there is an army to flog 1.5 crore people, but in just one line, they damage so much of the society that brother, you have to do your coaching, do it comfortably, no need to motivate him so much.  If someone gets demotivated because he has failed three-four times, now he is not worthy of it. Why are you motivating him? No, he will learn something and then when you because many people get so broken that the right time comes.  Then they don't do anything, all their time becomes bad, then that right good time has come, now they do n't know what is the good time because they do n't have any conscience, intelligence, consciousness, they do n't know how to wake them up, now they have no basis.  How to enjoy the good times, how to monetize, the pot is broken, Kamla is broken, both were weak, that means she is broken, there used to be an ad on Doordarshan, they used to use dialogues in it like this, although it was an ad for family planning and it has nothing to do with it. no but inside  I felt like telling me that you don't have to break, you have to ripen, Matki, if you are raw, you don't have to break in bad times, yes, you are vulnerable, but you have to ripen, keep ripening, you are getting that heat, no one is listening to bad times.  I am not agreeing with you, yours is not working, keep observing that it will come, I will not say this, my time will come, my time will come, sing, my time will come, sing, there is no need to sing, stay silent and when your time starts, then  Say, my time has started, your time has started and don't wait whether it will not come, he will come, maybe he will come, how many people will you tell, my time will come, they will look like a loser, keep quiet, if your time is not running then you have no right to be a hero.  Quiet finger on your lips, there is no need to sing any song, there is no need for any motivation, there is no ya, my time will come, my time will come, one day will come, all that said, no one will come, quiet, learn, learn, see how the world works, see how  Relationships Work See How Money Works See How People Are Genuinely Not What You Want Them To Be See Who Can Help You How You Can Progress Ahead in Life See The Changing Trends Happening in Life Be a Keen Observer of Trends Around You What is Happening and That  The pain will end from within, just like on the day of Sade Sati, my Sango, video on simple astrology, the time of year and a half will come.  Brother, it comes for many people, it comes for many in their 20s, it also comes in their 30s, it breaks, wants to teach, the time comes, sometimes a few things come, then those times will come, but in those times, you have to learn things and mature.  And whatever you have done at that time will become a great stepping stone or call it the big one from where you can jump. Many times in life, if you have to jump over a big pit, then if you see a pit, you will have to go back.  Now when you are going back, you are not going back, you will come running, bring momentum and jump, now no one should tell you no, if you start running while standing there, if you jump, you will not be killed, if you have to come back, then stay behind tactically.  You will have to come, don't forget the strategy, people lose the war in small battles in life for tactical advantage, small advantages in life, short term advantage. You should never lose the war. Battles keep going on. Lost, won, small. Here and there, no one is on the same level. It's okay to win in the war. Do n't let the moral go low. Motivation is not there at times. You Have to Just Hang There Nothing to Get Motivated You Have to Just Be There Just Be There It was told in the beginning that the good thing in bad times will pass and in more good times When good times are going, don't jump. Do n't think that it will last forever. You should always be. Do such actions in good times that when bad times come, you will not have many enemies. You will be fine because when bad times come, you will have made so many enemies.  And if you have not got friends or well-wishers, then he will remain more misbehavior and many people do the same. Okay, so I hope you have understood this thing. Share, like, subscribe to the channel in the comment section Tegra Group.  You will get it also, you can join it for webinars and other information.

    "title": "क्या  बुरी नजर  होती है ？  Does Anything Like Evil Eye Exist [ifI3isMACIQ].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, is there any evil eye or evil eye thing? Let's discuss it a bit. I was getting a lot of questions, so I feel like giving some clarity on this. By the way, I also have an exclusive Astro channel, if you guys liked that.  If you haven't subscribed then please subscribe. Sango Saral Astrology explains things very easily and simply. Once you understand it, let's discuss it. First of all, you can pause the video right here and write that I believe this or you can say that this is all nonsense, then your system must be fitting somewhere. What do I have to say, is it there, I will tell you, okay, it is said that evil has come to my notice, it has come to my notice, this has come to my notice.  If I have noticed some progress, if I feel like this, then I am going to tell you an aspect about it. Okay, what is this, it is something like this because it is talked about a lot in India, this is also done in ours, if you all agree, then quickly.  all write that this i  If I agree, then M.A.N.T., write it down like this and it is nonsense, otherwise nothing like this happens, so that at the end, I would like to say that yes brother, how many people were there and then on which side the vote will sit, then it was fun to tell in the end.  Did n't understand, ok, seemed logical, did n't seem to make sense, ok, so this is a very interesting topic. Let's start with the black tilak. You must have seen it. Ok, and that glance was applied, the glance is not taken off, the glance is taken off, let's do something like this. Anti turned the chilli We know all these things that one has to rotate clockwise, but what is this, who feels it, if it feels, then the first thing is what happens and if it happens then what is visible, it is about what ever happens, just a little force will be applied to anyone. Because it will be very high order and abstract in explaining, for now we will leave aside whether something like this happens or not before answering, but whatever happens in life, it happens within us.  If  If you are listening to me right now, then you are hearing some sound which is coming into your ears somewhere and there is some system inside which is processing and explaining it to you. If you are looking at me, you are not having an out of body experience.  If something is happening then you are seeing it inside, somewhere inside you are thinking that something is not happening outside, you cannot say outside that something is happening, everything is happening inside, so if this something is happening or not.  is not important what It is actually important what happens inside, first you should understand this deep thing because most of the focus is on this thing that it is like this, I have been noticed, brother, this one has been noticed, he has been noticed, don't do this, do n't say like this, you have been noticed.  Don't do this, you will get noticed, this will happen, so this is the only discussion, so you see that Virat Kohli is there, he is hitting sixes and fours, he is winning matches, he is getting noticed, so many people are eyeing the enemy country.  since  If you kill it means the ship is flying, there is no need for a missile, just drop it out of sight, by doing it like this, all the people of the country are keeping an eye, by doing this, and that ship is not falling, you are keeping an eye, so many people are keeping an eye, Travis  The head was not out, it was 4743 in the final, we had this much vision, 144 crores, it seemed that we were hitting, we are so many, they are 144 crores, so if this happens, then why is this not used, I mean, you understand.  what to tell  I am not saying yet that this does not happen, but I am also saying this with a practical example that friend, his picture has become a hit, Pathan picture has become a hit, take a look, hey Jawan has also become a hit, take a look, I don't know.  To be a dinky yes, it was hit this time, it was hit this time, it was not hit this time, this is an escape, now it means one thing, so I would like to tell that, but if it is absolutely nothing, then I would like to tell in this thing, hold one word.  You  I will tell you the English word focus. If you are focused in life, then you cannot be noticed. If you are not doing any work to humiliate others or to tease them for the sake of pleasure, and are doing your own thing, then you are doing the same.  But the focus is to show someone its success, for example, if you are getting it installed, you are getting it installed in the sense that you are playing that thing with a secure mind set that today I have a car.  I am showing it to you so that you can understand me and don't think like this, I have nothing, people are match at times, father and mother, it is okay that we have become something, we have become something and they keep showing it to everyone, so give.  They are coming from a weak mind set and only such people get the so-called evil eye, perhaps there is nothing in the air, but they themselves are in the air and that air goes away. If they show off to the people, then they are said to be evil eye.  are you understand  I am successful in explaining my point, I am trying very hard, okay, you are understanding that there is nothing in actual, but what the person says, I have caught my eye, now are they creators or am I something, if I am in my  There is a lot of knowledge, it is real, if it is genuine, then it will not be visible, but if it is from Shobha ji, it is the foam of Superficial, it is the foam of Lassi, then brother, it will turn into a mustache as soon as you drink it, it is like air, otherwise it will go away.  At any time, my entire self-esteem depends on how many subscribers I have, how many likes I have, I am not trolled, I am praised, there are many very sensitive creators, tell them something and other big creators.  There are also those who are so insecure, who have their eyes set on me, I will make a video even beyond them, that is, those who are sitting with 2.5 crore to 3 crore subscribers and say something to them.  If you give then the [ __ ] send a notice, that's what they look at, here are those like us who say, listen brother, just like I speak on this channel, you are not rich, who speaks like this, I feel very ashamed to speak like this, Diplomat, you are rich.  No, now you decide the definition of rich, I am not going to tell you the bank balance, you may not consider yourself rich, maybe you have only 00 and you consider yourself rich, then you are rich, then rich people are here on this channel. ok on this channel  Those people are the ones who are curious, they should come, those people are welcome who are ready to break their belief system every day, today I was thinking this brother, yesterday I broke it, today I broke it, tomorrow again something new comes, then if nothing comes then do this after defining so much. If you are like this, then someone comes and says something to you and you think, maybe he must have said the right thing, maybe something will happen. In such an approach, these people do not notice such people.  who is inside  There are people who are boastful and who also say this thing again and again, don't do it like that and you will get evil eyes, don't do it like that and you will get evil eyes, so today I am telling you about that evil eye because you say that you deserve it.  You don't just do it, you wear good clothes and wear nice glasses and by doing this you walk in style, whether you are on a bike or a car or beyond, then when you have this feeling from inside that actually I don't deserve it.  No  Yes, it has come by chance and even if it doesn't affect me, it will affect me because if you feel that you don't deserve it, what ever you have got or you are doing it to tease others, sometimes it happens that inheritance is received from someone.  If your father-in-law becomes a barman at your wedding or you get something like that, if you are using that thing to tease others, then some such program will come to you from outside that all that throne will be yours.  If it is not solid, then you have to understand this basic thing. Now let me explain it in simple astrology, there are also astrology aspects in it, because the channels are different, we will have to keep them separate, that is the thought process of astrology. Inside, does anyone sit with such a position that he looks like a brother because he has said many times that he is a match and when you are a match, I hope you understand this word called Mach, it's not.  Haryanvi word is ok if you understand then please write in comment section Many times lack of some times one you behave in a way that it is bound to make others jealous of you why others become jealous of you because they feel that what you gut is you Don't Deserve Like: People are not jealous of Virat Kohli because he works so hard. People are not jealous of Sachin Tendulkar. Some may be but mostly.  It doesn't happen because even we feel that Lata Mangeshkar ji was such a top singer of ours, okay, no one was ever jealous of her, Lata di means she was like, she deserves everything, she is like so talented, you see where these factors of jealousy come from.  So always remember this factor that whatever you are there you should be very confident some times if you feel you don't deserve such a feeling can also come.  Instead of being insecure, be humble, be humble to people and many others, you must have seen that like you have seen Amitabh Bachchan ji, his nature does not become like this, he is the hero superstar in the picture, doing everything, you have seen Rajnikanth, Rajnikanth ji will look at you. Tell me, Rajinikanth ji is comfortable, one hair is not visible in the movie, it becomes completely different and it is not visible to him, because in real life he says, man, what does this mean?  This is how he walks, this is how he talks, this is how he lives and talks, if you don't make eye contact, if you don't see someone then it doesn't depend on that person, only your conduct, your thought process, what is happening in your mind, where are you going in life.  There are many people who think that the monkey has found a lump of turmeric, he is considering himself a grocer, there is a saying, many people behave like this and then they behave like this, then the whole world.  You start focusing beyond that every time and then that insecurity in other things which gives you basically what is world focus. If you are focused on your work, achieving anything, reaching anywhere, nothing is going to happen but when you focus on your work.  But there is no focus and somehow we get the world's focus on ourselves by doing some such behavior then now you have attracted her, now call her Nazar, speak evil eye, speak English, she will move you.  Then whatever was happening to you in your life was good, it was not happening because you had great talent, it was happening because of many things, now those things start getting messed up because basically your focus.  There is no and the world's focus is on you, then they say performance like there is some or the other anxiety like for example you must have given paper in childhood, everyone has given exams, whoever is listening, what happens in exams.  Isn't it true that many a times one gets invigilated? Okay, someone is a teacher, she too is getting bored, sometimes a child is writing, she stands on her head and comes and starts seeing what the elders are reading.  Those who become conscious are those eyes and the educated person who knows everything, who is also good at writing, he is not bothered that she is judging me and but many people become uncomfortable, he is of doubtful type. Some?  I don't know why she is looking at me, she is looking at me the same way, no matter who is writing what answer, sometimes this happens, sometimes when we look at a man, it is as if you are going somewhere and That person is looking at you like this, either you are looking very beautiful to him or he resembles someone or he is thinking that he has seen this before somewhere, should I go and talk to him or not or do something and you are uncomfortable.  You become like why are you watching now?  You will start getting this look, man, today people were watching it a lot, oh they were watching a lot, so sometimes we are prepared women or someone else, that is how every man is prepared, this is how he wants to write and sound, now believe me,  If I am making a video, then don't I want more people to watch it, more people to praise it, normal, that is the desire, now if more people watch it, it means that if it is not noticed here, then how can it be noticed somewhere else because if I think that my video in your mind  Deserves views my video deserves likes and good comments and I am working hard and I deserve it to phir nazar nahi hai other wise sab jahath nazar hi nazar hai to i hope ya abs tract things are such topics if you understand  And if you want to bring notes on different things like this, then there is no need to worry, if you bring notes on different things then from any point of view, as long as the focus is on yourself, what do you know and how much?  It comes and you don't become a useless hero Hiralal in front of others and they do n't show it to anyone that they see me like this, see me like that, if they have to see it for advertisement, if they have to show it for marketing sales, then it is coming from a conscious.  But when you say something for the market, if I say, let's say I am the number one clarity giver, then I say for my marketing, I do not say to make anyone jealous, then whatever  The energy comes or I feel it or the armor I have, it is different, but if I invite someone in the same way, I speak the same way, then there is a difference between the two things. In marketing, everything will be told through my soap.  It will be best if you take a bath, if you take a bath with shampoo, then it will be like this, if you apply this, your hair will grow like this, it has to be done by someone who comes and does it for himself, but he should understand these things, I hope in this video.  Not 100%, but maybe 50, 60, 70, but if I am successful in giving you some message, then definitely write, then I will look forward for others too. Yes, Guruji, this is a very good thing.  You have succeeded in something, from next time I will not be afraid that I will get noticed. Mummy, people say a lot that they will get noticed. This will happen because women say more that women have insecurity.  There are also issues of self-esteem and it always happens that we don't deserve it, it will come to light or someone will notice our money, this is it, friend, give a statement of your bank account.  No one is saying it to show off, but it means forcefully, you can spend Rs. 100 and show yourself poor for Rs. or else I can't spend, it varies from person to person, so there is no need to worry, live a natural life, be comfortable. live life  The energy in living life should be such that I do not want to irritate anyone, I have my own value, I have to add to the world, the whole world is my friend and like move ahead, there should be a feeling of positivity. When you live with such a feeling, you will  No one will be able to harm you and when you feel down a lot, then I tell you about it on Astro channel, but here too, what I have given you till now is rock salt, give it a bucket for two to four days. When you are getting such a feeling because you yourself have seen that energy, you can tell why you are coughing like this, tell me why you are coughing like this, something like this comes, okay, that means someone from inside is saying, don't talk nonsense. These people probably don't deserve it, so if you deserve it, then please tell me. Yes, if I tell you, it's okay, then take a bath, you will feel lighter and better, and the moment you feel lighter, it means you are in this zone.  It's just nothing but see everything in your brain. Everything happens here. People say that there are ghosts. Yes, there are ghosts here and there. Many people have ghosts. We ourselves are ghosts. Okay, there is nothing inside and outside. Outside, the world is going on as it goes. Everything is going according to size here, even science fails and everything is fine inside, so you can feel a little relaxed with some of those things, so if you feel like this anytime.  So two-three days in a month, put half a handful of rock salt and take a bath. Immediately you will feel nice. I told that thing also and somewhere else I am not talking about superstition and in the name of everyone, it does not happen, it does not happen, I told it in the simple form of grandparents.  I speak stories, people speak astrology, you are taking me to astrology, you are not scientific, yes no, what is it, then it is the story of grandparents, now it is the story of grandparents, stories of maternal grandparents. Sleeping fairy tale is either fun or sleepy, this is it, this is astrology, it will make you enjoy, it will make you sleep, life will be good every day, if we can live in that zone which no one ever tells in childhood, now a days, no one tells it, everyone is busy in their mobiles. But there used to be a time, visualize it. If you have heard it, then it would have been fun. It would have been fun to listen to some stories. Ha, it was fun. Ha, it is the same, it is the same, it is astrology. Those who want to learn astrology like that, like the stories of their grandparents.  Like  Prove it, show it by prediction, it is scientific, Dhruv Rathi has said, he had shown it to me Wikipedia Dhruv Rathi 8th Class Essay They are like this, now such people have so many subscribers, then my subscribers will enjoy, there will be fun in life, full life.  You will go willingly, when you come to know that once you turn 25 or 40, you realize that nothing can be gained in life by acquiring this essay type information. By knowing this knowledge that Oh Peru's  Capital is Lima, Pingyang is of North Korea, Sofia is of Bulgaria, you know everything, where have you reached then, you know all the dates, you know this, you know what happened there then, when it happened there, you know it was like this, you know  Do you know that Nizam was there during the independence of India, he was so miser and he was so big, all this is what people are consuming on social media, brother, knowing all this is not going to get you anywhere.  You will have to learn abstract things, no one is talking about those things, I am trying to do them, how do you guys feel, do these things and you will enjoy it, okay and if you have any other questions like this, you can ask innocent ones too.  Sharma Without shyness, you will get complete clarity about the things that your parents say and have been saying at home and you people have problem in understanding or doing those things, that is, why they don't do like this on Tuesdays, these women will tell you everything. menstrual  Guru ji, why should we not go to the temple on a bicycle, tell me, this is wrong, I want to go, we are being discriminated against, hey, you are not being discriminated against, madam, it is okay, no, we have to go there, this is wrong in the constitution.

    "title": "जानें Middle Class का नया दर्द  ｜ How To Deal With It ？ [jeOQAg-DPMM].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, fresh, best topic, new pain of middle class, watch the video till the end, I am emerging as a middle class specialist, I do n't know where I am taking my journey and every time originality comes, someone copies it, you will also copy this.  But then I am getting recognition from my subscribers. So let's start today's topic that what new pain has come to the middle class till some trend gets converted into data and data in the market.  By the time it is published, the story has already been played out. Those who are people with Guru element, are analysts, observe well, when the trend is being formed, it is being formed only after 10 to 20 to 30 years, the market is not known.  Then they come up with what I tell you, the articles are published after three to four to six months in the newspaper and on social media, because then they start appearing, so what is this new pain, you, my audience of the middle class.  And the pain is that the lower class is no longer respectful and subservient, this trend of course has not started from yesterday, it has already started, it is at a different level in every city. If you are in small towns of UP, then that trend is still there.  It has not started that much, it has played out further in big cities, depending on the place, you, my audience is Pan India audience, including South India audience and I would like to speak a little bit.  In English Also For The Benefit Of My South Indian Audience Also What I Am Trying To Tell Through This Video Is That This Trend Of The Middle Class Which Was Pampered In A Way That They Could Afford Lot Of Services From The Lower Class And The Lower Class Use  To be like this, sir, by doing like this, madam, by doing like this, yes, it will be done, this thing is coming to an end, this is  Reducing, you look at the attitude of the maid, you look at the drivers, you look at the car cleaners, you look at the ready people, you look at anyone, now we will not enter into whether it is good or bad or whatever is happening is happening in the country because  Now I would like to address those classes in this and also tell them what should be done. First of all, you guys are identifying this trend by letting us know the one born before 1975, the first born from 1972 and the one who is born after.  And one thing is that those who are now in their 90's and 2000's, those who are in their 90's and 2000's are not broken from within because they are earning less money than their parents are earning.  They are relatively rich, they have assets, they have a house, a car, this is their attitude and it is okay, the woman has been married for 35 years, her husband has a good house, she has not earned money herself.  She also wants to stay in that attitude with the maid but she can't stay, the maid runs away, the maid says don't do the work with you, they will say kamati kaam bhalo taka kamati kaam bhalo taka, means less work, good money, we will get from Dinks, double income, no kids.  There madam doesn't have time, she leaves the house from behind, turns on the AC with ease, drinks water from the fridge with ease from behind, maybe even drinks juice juice, okay? She left the house, that woman does not want to work, with such a woman who is sitting like this, by doing this, you did not impose her from below, bend down a little, do a little work, she takes so much money, you got two days leave, deduct your money, this trend should change.  It is gone now, mothers, sisters and wives are not listening, they do this, please men, if they are listening then give them some counsel, they will not be there, that broom will not be used, in the future, days will come like this in 5 years, which is the typical middle class, which is upper class.  There is no middle class, in fact it has become lower middle class type, they will not be able to afford this maid on daily basis, but it will never happen that you will do the holiday maid completely, but you will give it to the future as the alternate day is coming. In the next two to three years, you will be able to afford half of all the medicines and you will say, come on an alternative, why is there a need to use it every day? Yes, we do dirty things, Chhota.  There is no child, this story is also going to be played out, I am only telling about the pain of the middle class, the trend that I see changing in the big cities is becoming more burning, the maid is more happy working in the houses of tenants.  Because the tenant does not even sweep and mop that much, it remains rotten and if you are a landlady, then deductions are going to be made, your house is worth Rs 20 crores, 18 crores 10 crores, because brother, do you know the rates in Delhi? In Gurgaon, the rates are for 2.25 lakh yards, so assume here that the house is of 400 yards, which is completely yours, then if you assume it is worth 10 12 14 crores, then the one whose house is worth 10 12 14 crores. Maybe he has not bought it, he bought it long ago, maybe it was worth 20 lakhs, 40 lakhs, 50 lakhs, but if it is this much, then the attitude has come but it is there. Middle class because there is no cash flow. Now you say, the one who has assets worth Rs. 12 crores is middle class. Yes, this is a new definition which I would like. Big users have different definitions from me, the definition itself keeps changing.  So Guruji, I am one, you will copy my content so many times that you yourself will feel ashamed, now you have raised the figure of Rs 40,000, people have raised the figure of one lakh, you have raised the same like this, you middle class, now think new. Guruji, you live in a house worth Rs 12 crores, are you middle class, don't have cash flow, do n't have cash, don't buy a base of Rs 12 crores, don't buy Rs 10 crores worth Rs 12 crores, still go in metro, so now you have to buy maid.  You think that I don't know what I am, I don't respect you, I am very happy working for a young couple who are staying on rent, she comes as she does and goes away, this is a matter of pain.  Will you tell your car washer that you didn't wash the cloth properly or you will wash it from inside and then leave and take 00, I will take the person to whom the car has to go. You will not put the cloth on a car which is not supposed to go. Which are the cars of the elders because the way they want to shine their car by bullying and you are not good in saying that this is all there is, brother, for Rs 500, you are worth ₹ 5000000 400 Hajj when that  Only when you become middle class will he be your slave. Lower class is not anyone's slave. Middle class is everyone's slave. The kind of answers you throw at your maid, you cannot throw the same answers at your boss in the office. Hey, those guys are yours. And so on.  We are educated, we are comparing us, many such comments come, we are comparing us, what happens by speaking English, the situation changes a little, English.  If you cut too much then what can't you do? And my boss and you are also slaves. The day they become rich, they too will become slaves. Today's attitude is because it is a game of demand and supply. Now what is middle class? Whatever definition is given below. Those who are coming above, when they are increasing more, then these people below are decreasing. If those below are decreasing, then their demand programs will increase. They will have a choice home to work for because. All their work is manual and time consuming so they can't do this much work only there is no maid who can work in 40 houses she just can work because she has to sleep for five six hours sweep and mop her house only she has to eat  She has to make the same and the children also have to be raised by the same, so she has got the physical energy also and whatever house is there, she has to go from one house to the other house, to the third house, to the fourth house.  That also takes time, so she can do this much work only and she has a choice, it is this much, she always has a choice, so you can't be a hero Pako on every, be it English or Hindi, you can't become much of a hero Hiralal beyond that.  You ca n't become a chari but you have a choice, you don't have a choice and once they have a network, the lower class of maids have a network among themselves, once you are left behind in that, right?  That so and so, house number 10000 or flat number 10000, makes a lot of noise, madam, no one will know about that madam, hey madam, you only make noises and then no one will go to her, no one will come, by doing this, I will take 8000, hey.  You are crazy, you paid 4000 rupees, you chit-chat a lot, it is not your choice, no one comes, I have to show it by acting.  Man, sit down to give a little chilli to the middle class so that they come to their senses, especially the previous generation, the young generation is very very intelligent. They know what is happening brother. The person who was born after 1995 does not know this.  Everyone knows, friend, he is not becoming that much of a hero, he is becoming the old man, he is feeling rich, hey brother, you are not rich, the man living in a house worth Rs 10 crore is not rich because the house in which he lives.  No matter what it is, if Rs 10 crore is in the account then it is a different matter, the expenses are not borne by you, so why do you take such a baddie under which you have to operate a coal mine by becoming a mine miner to put it under you. If they enter inside and vomit and come out like this, you should make your bed at least this high or make it this high. Why do you make it like this? Why do you keep so much furniture in the house that you have to move it every day?  you can make furniture too  Neither should it be easily cleaned from below, why do you keep the cleats? If you have spread so much filth in the house yourself, then you will have to wake up. This is the subject of pain for the middle class, there is a new pain, someone like you will come in the trend. Do n't go to the driver, this is all servant nature. No, you will release that he is releasing that friend, like I am telling you by example that those who eat your momos, you go to the ready, normally the children of middle class are the ones who earn most of the momos.  He is selling momos and he is earning more money than you. Is this a fact? Otherwise tell me and many more videos have also been made about it. Nowadays how much do you earn and 25 30 how much do you earn? I earn only five, okay you earn only five. Then we come to know that he earns for five days and he earns for 25, 30, 40 months, then you all must have seen all those small things, but that is the truth of life, also that is how.  It is happening so the middle class needs to wake up to this new reality. Do not deviate from the lower class stories like you heard in foreign countries. Everyone is equal. There is no discrimination. Discrimination reduces automatically. Human beings want discrimination, it is not that there is no discrimination.  They were very good people, they stopped it, this is the rule of law, this is bound to happen, now as the country progresses, there will be more progress for the people below, then this feeling of slavery from inside. All of them used to know this attitude too, everyone will come to do their own work, do something and consider the next person as a human being's child, they will work as per the money, earlier the work which used to be done in Rs 000, will now be done in Rs 4. They used to be there at 6:30, the ones at 6:30 will be there at 10, your electrician and plumber have to beg to call and come, either do your urban clap directly or do all these things so that they can come again.  Give that GST, give this, do those two tricks, then you will get that professionalism. Tolerate other wise tantrums. So this is the idea that this is going to happen. Be alive to this possibility. Don't be bitter. Try to earn more money so that you stay and have that.  Advantages and Staying in a Big House Which You Own and Which is Like 51 Curses Doesn't Make You Rich the Cash  Flow and the Thought Process Will Only Make You Rich Every Month What You Get in Your Bank What is Your Liquid Money That Will Only Define Your Social Status and Amir Bhi Ban Jao Bhi Matlab It Dozen Gives You Any Right These Days And That Is  A Something Good Which is Happening in the Society and Good for the Country Also This is the progress of the country that if in this country  50 crore people used to live like this in slavery, even after getting independence, now they have stopped doing so and their children live like this. Yes, what is the work, it will take time, I cannot come now, no, I will not come tomorrow, I will get only this much money.  No, that's not all, it is okay to not do it, then get it done by someone else or make a maid. When you throw us, we too would be respected. Madam, we go to someone else's house, you cannot say like this, you make me work hard, we also start hearing these questions.  if it is done Don't seek now and it is going to take two-three years, the video has just been made, the article will come in four months, in one year the world will also know the pattern, if you people are also watching, then you will only have to change yourselves, the middle class just change others.  Wise you will be bitter, children will not agree, earlier husband used to get angry on the maid of children, now she does n't even take that, daughter-in-law doesn't even take it. Hi, what happened because mother-in-law also sometimes  Daughter-in- law, what happened to you, nobody takes it, no one will take it, give it back and cry, the one who cannot give it back, then the one who gives it back is the one, I will give you my clarity on this thing always in future also.  I will keep giving, it will be fun, listen, watch, enjoy, share and this is a phenomenon, accept it, this is what the trends are, which is started data, will come later and  If you first change yourself then you will be happy. What is the point of M Channel? Spreading happiness, giving clarity, keeping it practical and not spreading any negativity, so respect whatever is happening, it is happening. Learn to respect all the people. People who are not as fortunate. Okay and this is good for the country is it good not please tell me and this phenomenon is happening not happening do you agree  With What Ever I Said Please Write in the Comment Section Share Like Thank You Very Much"

    "title": "हद कर दी  @ShriPrashant आपने इस बार तो  ｜ Such Content Needs To Be Questioned [8rPRgX5d9YE].en",
    "content": "Hello friends, this video is being made because a video short of Acharya Prashant ji has come, I will try to get you to see the link in the comment section so that there is a reference to contact, it will take only a minute to watch that video, but anyway I will tell you  yes, what is he saying in this video and I am talking about this topic, friend, you have crossed all limits, Acharya Prashant ji, you have crossed all limits this time, when we got busy with the elections, we got a free run from there because every  I used to make a video in 15-20 days and keep checking it. Now I felt that this is your small channel, nothing happens with it. No matter how big the balloon becomes, the needle is enough to take out the air from it, so I then use that needle.  I am working because the balloon has again spread a lot. That video, if you have any desire, you are married, you are a bachelor, you have a child or not, you are old or young, of any community, religion, caste, colour, anywhere you come from, it will hurt you.  This is my claim, I am in pain that is why I am making it, you tell me whether I am making it right or not He deserves the video because he will get a free run, no, in that video Acharya Prashant ji is saying that he was travelling by plane and a couple was sitting behind him and their child was crying and he was telling him  The child is crying like an animal and I am being tortured, that is me, they are not able to sleep, friend, why are you calling a human child an animal and if someone is crying, so what if the child is crying  So what kind of Guru are you that if you have such a thing, I say that a self-styled Guruji is becoming a reality, I say that within a radius of 10-15 meters of me, if any person or his child is crying, then he will become silent, tell me.  I will make you quiet for a minute or two; it may be the reason, it may be the pain of life; in two minutes that child was crying, so you just had to tell him to do wall salwa; if the child cannot do it, then you will act; the child copies him a little  He was big and had grown teeth so we would give him something to eat. As soon as he ate biscuits and chewed something he would jump into the air.  From here the pressure gets released, this is the reason for most children crying, but how do you know, you follow a big science, astrology is a nonsense thing, right, you are an old  Books, knowledge of other things, there is so much knowledge that it keeps dripping, 15000 videos have been made in 12500 videos, in each one they are shaming the same person, if they give birth to a child then where will they read Gita, where will they do some great work  I mean reading a book has become a great thing, if it is such a great thing then you have made 14-15000 videos of them, I know a lot of them, they must be watching it too and they have such an army of 5.5 crores that they are the number one YouTubers of India.  So you must have seen that the troll army will come together like this, it's absolutely fine, I know I too am doing the work of throwing stones at the beehive, but many times you have to do this that you tell me why you have a playlist  Why do n't you make 10, 20, 30 videos of the knowledge of Gita Ji?  If you have the capability to make 15000 videos, then you can make 10, 20, 30 also. Chapter number one, shloka number one, the meaning of its knowledge is this, we understand this, finish the work understanding this, the world will come and see itself, the work is finished, you have read it again and again  If you have read it, then you have understood it. Friend, this is narcissism, spiritual narcissism or narcissism of knowledge that I have read four old books. If those books are so popular and great, then make an app of it and let the public read it.  Why doesn't our country become super successful yet? Hey, you don't want to read, you read it well and then where will you go? I have read it, I myself do not condemn those books or that knowledge at all, I have read it myself, knowledge comes out from it, yes but then 2024  It will be explained as per the instructions, I will read four books, or you don't know anything, you don't know anything, either tell me directly, friend, we also sell courses, we also send courses, we also send workshops, we also send webinars, we also send knowledge  but coming into it this  It doesn't happen that when your gym is open you start body shaming everyone, hey, your belly is protruding, this tyre is like this brother, he is lifting the load, his legs are lifting it, what problem are you having, it is happening after eating his father's food  He wants to die, why are you body shaming him so much, you can tell him that hello friend, if you in case you require a gym, I have got this gym, this is the address, this is my membership fee, do it like this friend, you all are bitter about India  There are a lot of bitter people in India, they have become bitter magnets, bitter and frustration magnets because a lot of people are not getting jobs, it's a fact that a lot of people are not getting married, a lot of people are having relationship issues.  There are so many people in it that I ask why are you doing the job, those are his videos, why do you watch them now because brother he has 1.5 crore subscribers, there is a theory going around that although his videos get only 1.5 to 2 lakh views, they don't even get 1 percent of the views.  It's a different matter that it happens to me many times How can it become crores because if it is one and a half crores then brother the views should also be visible, this Chutku channel of mine also gets 26, 27, 27000 subscribers, I get 203 thousand views, which means there is some match, now I am sitting with 27000 subscribers  And if the views come in 25-30 ratio, then he will say who is 27,000 brother, if you get only 100 views, their 1.5 crore views are coming in the same ratio, if you see, one and a half to two lakh views come, then what is the percentage  It is less than % and still the message will be challenged, how much strength is there in the message, it is not there, it is necessary to question more than how many people it reached, do not give birth to these children, job is not a big thing, do some big work and big work  What does it mean, joining with you and promoting you and selling books worth Rs. 100 is that a big job, isn't it? I do this because I want to expand the organization, not you, we have a very big purpose, we want to expand the earth.  We have to save the earth for whom do we have to save it, the earth will save itself, we just have to save ourselves, save our minds and do practical things in our lives, it will happen like this friend, this is right, we should not talk about global warming  What do you want? When a child is born, 10 lakh trees are cut down. What kind of calculation is this? If 10 lakh trees are cut down because a child is born, then if this happens, then there are 800 crore people in the world, so 800 crore people will be benefited by 10 lakh trees.  If you multiply it then either the earth will become a jungle, everything will be destroyed, the earth will become a jungle, you leave any garden unattended for four months and see what happens, who is there to maintain the jungle, all this very high-fi talk to control the whole world  She will do it and all the men will feel that you are saying the right thing, it is something like this, mother at home, get up in the Brahma muhurta, get up in the morning, do your work like this, you should eat food like this, oh brother, you can do whatever you want after drinking nectar  did not come in 80 and 90 years  Everybody will go away, no matter how much knowledge you impart to anyone, but if you are a Guruji, some glow should emanate from your face, instead of frustration I say that if anyone is within my 10-15 meter radius, I say that you are watching my video, my webinars, workshops  I can stop the crying of your life, I have the power to silence a child who is crying inside, tell me what is there in you, then tell me practical things and take you all to knowledge  You are taking me to that knowledge, what will happen next? It is like you come there, this has become a cult thing, it's just a cult, just because no one gets knowledge from parents at home, they don't get a job, they don't get married sexually.  Starwak, if sexual emotions are awakening in you, then it is a very dirty thing, animals do this, so since when did animals become bad, this is physical pleasure, such extreme words, so much body shaming, calling sex dirty, calling masturbation dirty, and this porn  ko pon ko extra woh kar bhaiya  hey hey, try it and get rid of it. I am not saying that you should see it everyday, but putting so much guilt in everything that you saw something, something happened, what should you do next, grow a beard, put your hair back like this, apply gel, and now wear suit and boots.  Wear it for a while, first wear that one, now wear this one, then come and conquer every stage, then you will get a degree from IIT IM which lakhs of people have done till now, go and weave it, what do you do now, after that get a government job  If you catch hold of it and then let it go, then this is the biggest claim in India for a government job, not that if you leave a government job then it is a big sacrifice that, hey brother, it was a job so I let it go, no, I didn't understand it, it does n't matter how much bread I ate from it  If any man will take it, I will leave it, okay, hey you are in IIT, hey the IIT guy doesn't know wall salwa, he doesn't know that there is pressure in the ears, yes, when the plane takes off, where is the differential pressure, the air wave gets trapped, take the old knowledge  But Oh my God, the youth are realizing what all is going to happen  it is there but what can I say to them also like pied paper someone will take the rat like a rat will go behind it will take it down the hill what will you do then tell me there is no one to say anything, no one to stop, no one to interrupt and then straight down now  The first comment of the troll army to me is, what have you uprooted in your life? It is not necessary to uproot anything in life, although I have uprooted a lot, but still why should I tell, I am saying my knowledge, my, whatever I say is mine.  My logic, my face, the light of my face, my comfort, comment on this or comment beyond this, frustration comes and the bitterness increases on hearing this, or I am pouring cold water on the useless pan that I have kept heated, which was a very normal thing in our life, very normal  Things like growing up, studying, getting a job, getting married, having kids, getting a house, travelling, struggling and dying, have made this thing such that, oh this is a very trivial thing, today I am predicting that after 5 years, 7 years, doing this would be an extraordinary thing.  It will happen, keep doing what you are doing because you will become the minority.  All this intelligence, wisdom, consciousness, you will see left unmarried, divorced again, divorce, unmarried bachelor, some wisdom, wisdom, consciousness, you will not find any normal man already, if you are listening to me at the age of 253, then you should know that after 5 years, the 25 year old becomes 30.  30 will go to 35 look at your left and right if you do five jobs a normal job goes to hell I also know that jobs are going to hell in marriage too children are there in that too and so people say that if it had gone to hell  So why do we have to do it, oh brother it is sustainable, it will give purpose, whatever is there in life, life is meaningless, no one tells us this, these books, religion, spiritualism are also a way of giving meaning to life, there is no great meaning when there is too much science  You will understand that you will gain a lot of knowledge, you will gain a lot of knowledge, then in reality it will feel like this but we do not do it so that life can be sustained, otherwise it will not make any difference even if the population of this earth is halved  It should be doubled, I am not able to see any difference, it seems that some resources will be available, this will happen, this is just a way for people to stop each other's progress by saying that we have already destroyed you, so called we will not let you do this because right now we have to destroy the earth  We have to save the earth the earth will save itself this is the message we should not be so worried we have to bring an old wisdom in everything vedanta vedanta vedanta this is a startup please tell that you are from an IIT and people like you are from IIT  People do good startups, you have chosen this startup, it's nothing but a startup, it is a good startup, why wear this mask brother, tell me, this is our startup, we have 5.5 crore followers, we do this work, do it like this, why are you all being so shameful  Why are these bitter people being forced to reach somewhere, their subscriber, their follower, whether he comes back at 38, 39, 40, will he come to me only, it will come to people like us only, but yes it will come after 8-10 years, then after 8-10 years, brothers and sisters  we also have 5  There will be crores of subscribers but then why is it not happening right now, why not, he has not yet got disillusioned there nor has he reached there after getting disillusioned from everywhere, now when he gets disillusioned from there too, then he will come to know that friend,  It becomes known like there is a story of Buddha that he returns back to his home, Siddhartha was like a prince, so he returns back to his home after six years and he comes to his home to beg after doing alms, then his wife is there, she asks  He was asked, brother, why did you go there? He would say, I had gone for knowledge. OK, so he would say, knowledge could not be got at home, it could not be got at home. He would say, yes, it could be got there. Then he would say, why did you go there? He would say, it would be known after going there.  I got to know about it there, so this happens with many people that you will get to know about it, so like me, I am already telling you about many things, you will get to know about it by roaming around, then you guys should watch the interview of Randeep Hooda ji or Vivek  Intellectual Randeep Hooda ji is ours, he is a film star from Haryana and he is openly saying that friend you should have done it earlier  karna hai bya boo balak balk chahiye why do you want to discover he can still go through that thing at 47 48 49 what ever his age is around 48 40 because he looks young he is rich he has the money his body is also fit thik  If it is there then they will still pull off, they will still reset the meter, but brother, the rest of the people get finished, by 47-48 the whole body will become weak, where are you people waiting, where will you find someone, so please, please  Please spread this thing a little and don't fall for the question that the person who is giving the knowledge, which knowledge will bring happiness, what will you do with the happiness, then something will happen, hey, at the age of 80, one should ride a car and a bicycle, I will ask how many children should girls have  The same is not happening with our new women, go and scare them that what is the benefit of doing this, there is nothing better than giving birth to a child in this world, I am telling you this, do something  How much rocket technology you do, how many books you read, how much that you do, oh this Acharya Prashant ji which society will you serve, that society will not exist, Nannu's father, Nannu's mother is the society whose example you take of Nannu as I say Rohit  yes that is their nu if there will be no nun then from where will the happiness come what happiness, hey look a child is a form of God so as a child is, I will tell us some things about that also in detail but at this point of time I  I want you all to call out this nonsense, my subscribers, if you feel like this, then write in the comment section and share this video because it is possible that you are married, it is possible that you are living a normal life and  I am not conflicting with what he is saying but if he has said that because marriage has its own challenges, everybody knows, I am also a relationship consultant, when these things come into it, then all men will face this and if they had not done this, it would have been better not to do it.  there are many many issues if you go beyond them Sometimes if you want a webinar workshop or a long one-hour video or a long live on youtube2, then someone puts it up, although so many photos are dangerous, the drinkers will still drink, but if there is someone else who talks contrary, then I get troubled by their tone and tenor  It is the most common in the way it is trivialized, if you want to make someone slim then you cannot body shame him, tell him calmly that friend you weigh so much that you are unable to play like this, otherwise do it like this so forcefully because people like us  Isn't it brother, I have also been a bachelor, it's not like I got married as soon as I was born, I have been a bachelor for many years and I am married too, so brother I have seen both sides, well, those who haven't seen the other side can come and see the other side  If you open your mouth so much, we won't let you open it, long live the married people, okay the married people will speak again, just like they say, they chant slogans, Jai to all the married people, Jai to all the people with children, they will not say anything, what would a bachelor say, some great work done by being married  Otherwise being a bachelor is not a great thing, you name four bachelors and this one did a great job  He did it, he did it, he did it, the bird flew, this flew, that flew, okay brother, if 1000 people have done great work in this world, if you write their names in history, then 970 were married and only 30 were bachelors, you can try it somewhere  Pick up the president of any place, pick up a scientist from somewhere, pick up a philosopher, pick up a guru, pick up whichever actor you want, pick up from any place, pick up from any stream, pick up from politics, pick up from leadership, pick up a king, you can pick up actors. You can pick any professionals, doctors, Hajj were top people, they were married at 97, brothers and sisters, how long will you keep eating bread by taking the names of those 30 bachelors, just because Indian politics has become like this, I am telling you in Indian politics also, we need a person  Now I have said that there is no choice, both of them are such, the choice will come, it will come, if it does not come today, it will come at some time, make it in America, make it a stick, the whole family is needed in America  Because America knows what we have done to our country. At least our leader's family should be seen. The British or anywhere else, they know the importance of family in the western world because we don't know because our family is on our head.  When this goes away and everything comes to an end then you will remember your family, friends, family is the ultimate thing, brothers and sisters, you can change your country, you can change your citizenship, you can change your religion, but you cannot change your family, the biggest thing in this world  Family is the biggest thing of all because it cannot be changed. What is bigger than something that cannot be changed. People are changing their gender these days. In western countries, a man becomes a woman and a woman becomes a man.  Do you know what kind of system is going on where, a person can change his religion like this, you know it takes 15 minutes to change religion, you know the citizenship gets changed, brothers and sisters of the country get changed till the border, I know one  I met a man whose surname was Roy and he told me that his grandfather had seen three countries in his life time and used to call them home  The address of the house did not change, the address of the house remained the same, earlier it was Hindustan before independence, then it became Pakistan and then after 71 it became Bangladesh, so that person kept living in the same house throughout his life, the country does not have a postal address of three  I have seen the times changing, so I am saying that we have to promote one family at the top, family first, there is a big problem because people have made nepotism so dirty in politics, that is why all these families are coming into politics Structure of the family: Hey, the smallest unit of the country and the society is the family. Something is made from the family only, like there are cells in our body, everything else is made from the cells. At the bottom of our body are the cells. If you go into any structure below that, then  Atoms and electrons move to that level, similarly there is a family in the society, if some structure of the family breaks down, then the society will collapse and those who put any other thing above the family are taking you in the wrong direction. Remember how many people agree with this theory then write in the comment section whatever you feel, write and I know who you are Are you will also define what views you also have, so what do we care, the normal man in the family, poor guy, he can't even open his tongue because he is under so much pressure, these people who are standing, they have a lot of energy, friend, they can do anything  They will come and say anything, then they will say that I am leaving with my bag, bye bye tata, you will take the bag and go, I cannot go anywhere, it is okay, I cannot go anywhere so soon, so I can take the bag here. So I picked up the bag from here, said something, went there, said something, went somewhere, said something and then the roti of this thing as well, it is amazing, it is amazing or it is amazing, wow, wow, okay, please share it, it is very important, you should fulfill your duty, subscribe to the channel If I give you a little hint about my idol Ji, I want to change the way India thinks. I don't want the ideology of any political party. I belong to anyone. If my idol is Ji, then what will be the name of my party? If I ever launch it, then the family will come in  All the family people get together, family people, family party, okay, tell me what should be the name of the party, it should have family in it, the name is okay, family first, no one did it, it became clear during Covid that who anyone belonged to was not anyone, it was just family, family  It could not even happen, at many times unfortunately I came to know that bhaiya is family, no one comes, hey remember that time, bhaiya is our own, it was Dharmendra's movie, our own people are some baba, some guruji, some acharya, some leader, some  An actor is nothing, it's all nonsense, someone will take your votes, sell some copies, donate Rs. 100 to an organization, you will get calls for donations every day, hey brother, it's nothing, it's your family, there is no one above this and whoever is as he is, he should make him better.  I stop it, father is not good, children are not good, wife is not good, this is not it brother, keep yourself in setting up, put all your energy in awakening the intellect, conscience and consciousness and in listening to the hypocritical lectures of these politicians of the entire public, it is okay  You spend time listening to them, give half of that time to your family, life is heaven for us  Nasato hami nasato which one is it, this is it, heaven is in the family only no one else, just spend 40 50 percent of the time that you keep wasting on your own family, please share and like this video and take the family forward so that everyone can Jai to the married ones, Jai to all those who have children and we will cheer loudly who will cheer for you, no one will cheer for you, we only have to cheer for ourselves so let's cheer loudly and we will celebrate this, why should we do it brother, we don't go and shame the bachelors that you are not married  I am not worthy of anything, you could not be with you munna and what happened, there is nothing wrong, we do not feel ashamed or married people, we are sensitive friend, I did not get married, the other person did not get married, it was not his wish, it is no problem, it is not a big deal but All of you have gathered here and you will shame the married people that we live the life of animals, our children are animals and we cry and do this, we will not let this happen brother, this does not happen, no no no, it is wrong, it is wrong, wrong.  it is just wrong  You are not doing any big work. You are not doing any big work. What is the biggest work in life? To have children. The day everyone will come to know this, then it will be benefited the most. It will be good if you go to another 40 years and then you will go to that place.  It seems that fertility and its issues are there and ask the women who do not want to have children and they want to have children, how much pain it is because people like you have gone here and there and then they go and get that treatment, it is a very painful treatment and that  The lady still takes it because she wants to become a mother because at some point of time she realizes that bhaiya the ultimate is creating a life so if this thing is known in 2425 years then what is the problem, why do people do it this way and not others  It is said that if it is a good thing then stop speaking ill of it, so you go around giving your lectures on global warming and other things on every third video, if you follow Nannu then I will come to save Nannu and me  Leave all your channels and all your business  That if I have to do this work then I will do it, inflate the balloon every day, my needle is ready, spread it every day, whoever uploads the video every day, you have 45 crores, now how many will be 10 crores, I will keep sucking the needle every day with my 27000 brothers and sisters, ok, today you made the video  Today this indecency happened, take this counter video, reaction video, this reaction video, why, otherwise no one has the courage because brother you are sitting with so much, your organization is running, it is running in an organized way, there are people of yours and those who work in their organization.  You are doing it, right? Now you will say that I am misleading them. I am not forming my own organisation, nor am I asking them to join me. I am a capitalist man; I do not have any organisation. I do not give anything for free, I make no useless claims.  If I did, I would not have asked you to join me, but brother, you see, it has been six months, 10, 12 months, if you have become bitter, no one wants to sit with you, you cannot smile, do you call the people who cry animals or think  So brother, look who are you after?  Now you have to see that I will disillusion you if last time also I had made a video once and after that you had stopped talking to me, I felt very relieved by that because actually I too have to be taken somewhere else in life, I too have to be taken here  There is no need to get into trouble everyday, nobody wants it, it's okay but brother, if such videos of yours are made again then you should take care of it, treating the child like this does not suit a person like you, who is educated, running such an organization and a speaker of such old knowledge and those who  People have also heard it till now, like this video, share it and spread it to people, if you like the content of the channel then please subscribe to the channel, thank you very much"
