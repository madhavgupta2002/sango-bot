Hello friends, parents have a complaint that their kids don't listen or obey, so this video is for all parents because this is a common complaint that as soon as the remaining kids turn into teens, these kids who are between 13, 14 to 25 or  This video is for the parents of the children who are between 27-28 years of age and please share this video with your family members so that this video will definitely do good to the society. So whenever you have a complaint that your children don't listen to you, then please share this video with your family members.  You have to introspect as to why they don't listen, there is a big reason for this which I have observed that there is less evolution of parents in the life of children, which is because as they say, they don't let evolution happen, what you have to do is that  The child is not listening to you, how deeply have you gone into the matter and how much glory have you declared yourself to be in the eyes of the child, do you know about Artificial Intelligence, do you know about mobiles? Do you know about all these things? Do you know that on these Ullu app and these apps like Alt Balaji, kids watch some weird stuff. You have to go to their level to know that.  You have your father, you have your mother, they know everything, whatever you know, they know everything and the way I can give you insights on those things that you feel you have a lot of knowledge about, no one else can give it to you in that way.  I can, you will have to work hard for this, I told him, father said that the movie Mohabbatein is not working, the Amitabh Bachchan one is not working, father said that tradition and such traditional system will end in 2024, then parents will have to figure out, what English word should I use Even the English word is not coming out, even the Hindi word is not coming out, it means they have to tell them that brother we know you very very much and we will discuss, we will not bulldoze, we will talk logically. go ahead and if you don't know it does n't matter you can explain it to us  Yes, we are the fools, we should become intelligent, when this conversation will happen between the two, then this generation which has built walls, does not listen at all, there can be no matter more sad than this that your son, your daughter does not listen to you.  Are you listening to the talks of a foolish boy or girl in some peer group or have you made one of your own that your father is not even aware of, for example, your children are ahead in some technology like mobiles or apps but you have to ask them that what is your problem  Do you have knowledge of technology, are you earning money from this, how can you earn money, no, if you are not going to earn money, then why are you wasting time, tell me how can you earn money, do you know this art or something else or this  You have got the app and now you are playing drum 11 so this is not intelligent that father does not know drum 11 and you do not know how to make a team so in all those things now whoever is in 40, 50 or even 60 people They will have to enter once, see what is this scandal in which our people are involved Bring the child's mobile phone and without invading his privacy, ask him which apps he uses, I also have to pass my time, I also see what he is doing and discuss it with him, tell him whether he knows about the stock market or not  How will your son invest money in future, teach him, tell him to evolve and here people like me are helping us through our platinum membership, I had also made that dialogue and joke video that Duggal sahab, Duggal sahab, I am making it  You will become Duggal sahab, who was Kader Khan's character, he used to become something every day, only then will you get the respect of the next generation that father knows everything, father knows everything, mother also knows everything, knows all the things, how do you know this Even if you may not have complete knowledge of everything, keep knowledge up to a certain level inside so that this generation does not declare you a fool because what are parents, I have just said that no, this is bad, no, you remain busy with the mobile the whole day  I keep on saying this isn't a dialogue, what do I do with my mobile all day  And if it is so hot, what should he do? Tell me, any child should study the whole day, prepare for exams, do puja the whole day, exercise the whole day, go out the whole day, he cannot go out in this much heat, what should he do brother? This is from mobile because we earn money from mobile, money can be earned from mobile, money can be earned through this, so first learn yourself, earn yourself, get information yourself, what about children, children will always follow what you do, they will not  Follow what you preach them, reels are being watched on reels themselves, many have not set any mark in any investment, I do n't know what is demat, what are shares, what are investments, what are the different asset classes, I have done something about this myself  This is done in the following manner and from 13 to 25 years of age, the child keeps watching where the father is and keeps comparing and then as his circle expands, the child's boy and girl's circle, then through his and every friend, he also gets to know about their parents.  He makes the merit list of his parents and never speaks about it  As parents say, look at Sharmaji's son, look at Rohit, how well he is doing, look at Neha, how well she speaks English, look he is going to dance, what a personality he has, children don't turn around and say look at their father too Look at their mother as well and what is your personality but the day the kids start talking like this, the parents will not understand where to go. I am not telling this to the kids but to teach them, I am telling the parents that I am the only  It gives guidance to parents to improve because if you improve yourself, the children will automatically improve. They have come out of your own production factory all the time. I don't know whether they did not climb the stairs of the temple like they show in the movies. And even if you have got up there, accept it, okay, from there you are saying sarcastically like this, do not link it anywhere, nowadays people are very touchy, they used to show many things in old pictures, even then the way you guide it  He will behave according to the social conditioning in which he is kept  If it goes there then it will be your own child, from your own production factory, he is sitting with your jeans, then you don't know how to sing or your wife doesn't know how to sing, you do n't have a voice in your body, music is never far away in your family  If it is so then it will be very difficult to become Kishore D and Lata Mangeshkar. I am not saying that you cannot become one, but you can still become one, but you have to see how much effort it will take. So don't keep giving that sense of disrespect to the kids, that is the message.  It is very high, you did not get any marks, this is not what happened to you, how many would you have got, your child is made from your genes only, so the maximum peak of intelligence of both of you, if a connection is made because if there is a sister among two brothers, then there is a sister among brothers and sisters  There is also a difference in intelligence, both are from the same category, so it depends on who got how many and which ones, so you see how talented your wife is and how many you are, then why tell her this again and again  yes brother but parents also like son and daughter it together we will you no cross  Hurdles and see what how it works, if you win, you will win together, if you lose, you cannot get selected in anything or cannot do anything, then it is temporary, then something or the other will happen, something or the other will happen, your father is with you, your mother is with you  we are together and we will end it, instead of that I left her completely saying that you perform and what to do, I am not telling you, you just read it, hey you are not reading, nothing is happening further, something else will have to be done then whatever he understands a little bit  People come from here and there, they do some things, some 22-22 year old children come to me, Guruji tell me what to do, we will tell Guruji, if you are doing something then I can help you, I told you what to do, your father will tell you, mother.  I will tell you or the people from where you studied will tell you, ask them, go and ask the production factory of which you are a product, what should I do, they do not know, this is the only problem, so what should we tell you, what do we call a fish Tell us how to fly, how do we know whether you are a fish or a bird, do your parents know? What are you, the bird will be made to fly, the fish will be carved, the leopard will be made to run, no we will come to you, then you recognize whether we are fish, cheetah or this, or a sad cheetah who doesn't want to run, brother, this is the problem with parents You know, yes, you are a cheetah, you are running, if you want to run faster then you can be helped in that, if you are a bird, you want to fly higher then apply the knowledge of Bunole theorem, the principle of aerodynamics, like us  The consultant can tell you to fly higher, can tell you to conserve your energy, we can help here, we cannot turn a fish into a bird, okay, and we cannot turn a bird into a cheetah, and because this is the problem that parents and many others are facing  What time has it happened that the fish is getting married to a leopard and they have to make an ego that brother you do it like this when two people are doctor parents then it is natural for the child to become a doctor and he should become one, whether he has interest or not, there may not be much interest  So any  It can be awakened in anything and who said that only interesting things have to be done in life, become a doctor even if you are not interested in anything, then become one and work on other things which are of interest to you, at least you have become worthy of sitting at the cash box mother  -Father has a nursing home because it requires a doctor's degree, don't do it, don't do the operation, if not then what will happen like this then this will happen, people get into moral issues, you have filled someone's vacancy, hey brother, these things  The middle class shows hypocrisy, it makes me laugh at times, the things which are happening easily in your life, no, but what is the problem, many people are government servants, many people are in corporate, so being in corporate and government job  So you cannot do any good for the child, you cannot say that if I am at this position in a government job then my child will get a job and it will start from this position, he has to give his exams and struggle again, this is the problem that has come up  There are a lot of things I try to give clarity on, sometimes I fish  I do not claim to make anyone a cheetah. We deal with those cheetahs that are already there. If you want to run faster then we can help you. I always tell you that we are voltage amplifiers. You should have the current and the voltage should be your own.  It can be increased brother, 140 volts can be made into 220 volts, it used to be reduced earlier, so that is just the same, your zero cannot be awakened, okay so you understand this, there will be a workshop info group in the comment section.
