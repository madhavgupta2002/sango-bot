Hello friends this is a very important topic if you are middle class and you are a parent, then now I am seeing a lot of mistakes which Indian middle class is doing which is creating inner conflict among the children in my consultation, please watch this video on this  Neither such story has been made nor such topic has been discussed, please my request is to watch it completely, watch it comfortably and please share it, this has become a common problem of all middle class and understand it carefully, the middle class has very good power  It feels good, money feels very good, respect feels very good but this is inside, it feels good from inside and how are you doing this conflict, tell them the way parents feel and that's the same dear children that you brother become this story in life and  To get to the top position, become something else, own your money, tell your story, reach a good power position in life, get respect, your name will become famous, they are constantly pushing the child, teaching abacus to small children, giving Taekwondo classes, some music extravaganza Activity, English speaking should be good, French should also be known, marks should also be good, academics should also be good, personality should also be good, this is going to be a very good video, I am stopping in the middle again and I will also tell you the take away that what is the wrong thing to do by doing all this, I will also tell you that  I will not leave you like this, they are doing all these things because I am just doing Sohan So's, someone is doing it, someone in the society is doing it, his child is doing something, yours is also going and doing it, they are pushing it a lot  Yes, make life such for children that life is not a journey, it's about the destination, the story that you have to convey is not about enjoyment when you are doing something, learning it, then there is no enjoyment in it in itself, the story has to be conveyed and  Whenever you push the child so much, then what happens, it is not that he will come to the next position, it is also not that the child will excel in everything because brother there are so many children, everybody can not do well everywhere, so in that painting, people  I have acquired knowledge because what I am telling you is the latest, tell me this story book  I have not published any article, so whatever article you have published, you have also seen that if the child is not there then we have to motivate him as well and this is the conflict that is happening when that child has seen you, you have to motivate the child You don't look like a winner, if you are living an ordinary life then it is possible that when he asks a question or he feels there is some contradiction in it, then you tell him that money is not everything in life, we have to convey some other story, then you start telling him alam balam, this thing is for the children  The biggest confusion has been that you want to make your name famous through the child, the child never asked you back and the children who are watching, I don't know if they are seeing by mistake, by the way the child asked that hey why do I want to make your name famous, you want to make your name famous  Don't make your name famous, dad or mom, and if your name is already famous then why is there a need to make it more famous, okay now everyone cannot keep the name Hrithik Roshan, Rajesh Roshan and Rakesh Roshan, but just like that  What does it mean to glorify one's name? I want to ask you, what is the name of the father of our president? How many people know the practical of life that maybe you may not even be able to make your name shine by becoming the President of the Bank. There is a surname; surname is of the world; name means the full name; now your name is Sharma, your son is Sharma, so now Rohit Sharma has taken all the Sharmas  Name Roshan: Whatever the father's name is, it should be Roshan, right? So tell me the name of Rohit Sharma's father, Indian cricket captain, tell me what is his exact name? What is the name of Virat Kohli's father, he has brought fame to him, but you can't abuse him, right? Virat Kohli, his name is Kohli, I do n't know how many there are in the world, you must have heard the name of Kohli, what is his father's name, now I don't even know his name, so we have to get out of all these things, what is happening to the middle class a lot due to this When they fail a little, they give these feelings to their kids that friend injustice has been done to you, the system is not fair and tell me you don't want the child's confidence to drop, by this mistake you are creating overconfident, unlikeable and title confused kids Brother, you are facing a lot of injustice in school If you did not pass in the debate, you were very good, something new happened to you, if your marks did not come good here, then the teacher is bad, this thing is also parenting because that story, no story, water food is not brought down at all  They want to give the feeling of championship whereas the child should not do this, what should you people do I will tell him the thing, first of all the middle class should be given funda sanskar and motivation pilani, definitely ban the top of your children. Don't teach the second thing, if according to the middle class housewife, I am telling you that being a housewife is not a good thing, then brother, do something yourself, show the children that they can earn money themselves because the biggest problem of the people today is not a job  So business is between 10000 crore things which bill not fall in job because you no report you anybody nobody give your salary between not fall in a business also because no initial investment happening there is no risk of loss of capital whoever becomes a part of economy  If it is happening then the parents themselves will have to prove it by doing it. If further, a middle class father, you say that the job is not good, then brother, show it to your child and if you cannot do it then where will the child get the tax, this is the biggest problem  Rakhi is from the middle class who thinks that what we can't drink is one thing, our incomplete story of one minute glass of parents keeps going on like I, we won't do it or how will it ever happen that you won't do it  But he started saying, why are you putting so much pressure on him, what extra is this, hey, I had sent him to abacus class, I had sent him to swimming class, I had sent him to taekwondo class, I had sent him to singing class, now you should become something great, right Hrithik Roshan  I am not becoming it brother, I am not becoming it, any of your top actors, be it Ranbir Kapoor, Ranveer Singh, whoever they are, they are not becoming it, no matter how many classes you send me to, do whatever you want with him, I am not becoming it, and you will put forced stupidity in it and send me confidence.  confidence it self has go no meaning and a fool can do it Confident, you are a big fool but you are very confident and everybody is laughing at your confidence saying, hey, why are you so confident, then being confident itself has no meaning, you people have to realise that confidence, bill not take you anywhere, be confident in it yourself  Not something, this forceful way of showing off your attitude to kids which you guys keep elevated, stop it, become normal and make them normal and then sit and discuss over tea that yes, what can we do in the competitive world  who are the hanging fruits, which are the bypasses, where can we go where there is no crowd, which is the place where success is almost guaranteed and there is no failure because that system itself is such that one cannot fail in it and  There is no competition, this is a practical discussion to be held with parents towards this, if you would like me to make a video further or I have a Baby Naz Workshop C Plant further, I hope you guys understood any major difference that  You are making mistakes and giving contradictions. On one hand you want something from them which is your inner desire but it is not possible for them to do that. Then you give them an escape route that it happened like this and what are you making a product in return? It is a confusing product, it should not be a Shakti message, please write in the comment section, join and share it, it is your parents' group, it is a family group, but you should share this, middle class needs you should be apolitical, if the one who is a mother from inside needs money  If you want power, then you need to be very clear and you should just be on top of the text, then in between there is this moralistic thing, then this one is going on, do a little nature, this is also okay, so do n't get confused, you have to get on top of this.  Climb on this, if you want to climb on this, climb on this, if you don't want to climb on anyone, don't walk on anyone, but don't create conflict with this child, how should you live your life, do you ever want to live it here, then whoever asks if you will go on this, then you lived like this why don't you read this then you don't even answer  It is not that good, this is also good, then why are you confused, why do you want to become so great in the eyes of your children, why can't you tell this, son, who were we, hey, the parents did not do anything great, at least for Something happened to you, now let's see, nowadays chances are less because competition has increased so much that it becomes like this, two of us, you and Jal and you, son, so I did not get any job, I was not interested in any  There was no like it but let's see now what to do brother people are not truthful date this need of other vice there is so much pressure on the children that I don't know what to do what did father do great do it on time for father  It was easy, there was no competition, poor children were not even there in it, give it in the competition, you have access to a good school, you have access to some books and tuition, today everyone is playing field at every level in their mobile 200 300 400 ₹500 If a child spends Rs. 1000 on mobile phone then  If he wants to fart then brother he can learn free basera knowledge from this for 18-18 hours and the story can also go ahead, unfortunately their numbers are very high, so their success rate per thousand per article is very low but this D number is lion number  So hi they will go to all your middle class vacancies and then father will come and say see his job is done, what tuition did he take, he said this what did we do for you, we did this like this children and having very much time I want you to release the pressure  But d middle class kids, I am on this mission that middle class children are not at fault, now for them there are different games, different fields, different thought process, change the syllabus in these, this syllabus has become someone else's.  It is there but you will say that no, we only know how to play games, jobs, government jobs, these kind of corporate jobs, this is our education, so we will have to learn something else, that learning is beyond the scope of a small video but I will take it on a journey  I am on a mission, you join me and you  You can join the Infob Winner Group.
