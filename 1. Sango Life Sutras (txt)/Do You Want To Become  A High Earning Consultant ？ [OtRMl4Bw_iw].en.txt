Or do you think that I am not enjoying it at all? Okay, I want you to be rich, talk to me about people because this is a blue ocean opportunity in India till date we are only ready to pay money to the doctor, I have a stomach ache that brother, you  Are you ready to take it for consultation or give it to a lawyer in exchange or are you keeping an unworthy child, are you ready to give him tuition to Master ji? Apart from these three, we want everything for free. Want for free but it is cloudy I am saying this No people are not going to waste and where they are wanting you to people out Think people are experienced about it and they can think aloud with them and their experts and advice  Why will this field do well for you today, that your closest relative cannot give you the right advice because he is connected with you, your parents are connected with you, your brothers and sisters are connected with you.  If they know you then there is prejudice. Secondly, what is that? They also have some reaction of their own. They advise him to buy a house, to buy far away, to buy alone. As if the parents think that he is a boy, if he gets a separate house bought for him then Nehra.  Will be separated, then who will be the head of our old age, then his advice is never good in date because it is retirement of a neutral party and this is the next generation, understand this.  It has been observed that whoever comes for consultation these days has any kind of confusion, a lot of people between 21 to 35 years of age come for consultation. If you are interested in check career or for that then do it in a group. If you want to do consultation then do it.  There are members of my group who are starting to do it and they are doing it at a very low fee, which is less than my fee, so there are people from my tax group and we are now starting the consultation immediately.  For this, if you want to take it which is very low, which is my rate, it is Career Growth and Navigating in Corporate, the one thing you have to navigate is the career graph, go here, go there, go up, go left, job shift.  What has to be done or not has to be done, if many are not divided, then I have done this one separately, but I am saying the rest, brother, I want to make you only, so if you become for whatever you want to become, then it is a journey, now in how many days will I become that, six together.  made in a month  You can shade it in some other way so that content will always be there in the image, you can add so much content in your life by paying a very low fee in a particular way that you can then squeeze 100 times out of it, from outside it will remain a constant content. Now I am not doing it for one person, I am doing it for thousands, so I am putting in the same amount of effort, that is why I have kept the fees low, but the quality of its content is very high and all the people are connected.  Those who have taken platinum membership, please tell me how was your experience. It is just like that. Genuinely, tell me, you are enjoying it and you will get a lot of variety in the future. How can I study, which I have given here for free.  After studying, how will more studies come in the future, okay, that is also a free way to learn, but you should think that if you are getting so much for free, then you must be getting something extra at the price, okay where you are.  What is Can Connect D.M? The people coming forward will be so smart and time wise that because of the outsourcing of thinking, the decision making was normally the same in 1980, the caste in the family was to think and do this and that is no longer the case.  This has been happening in many families as well. Earlier, they used to talk about the elders first and now they say whether there is any personal benefit to them in the advice of the elders. It seems like this. Maybe it used to happen earlier also, it is not like this, earlier the elder used to give advice, he also had something to do with it, but it was not considered to be so at face value. If father said it, then he just said it. It is okay if mother said it.  Now it is not so, so that is why she is thinking that it is the new generation, okay then the same thoughts, the requirement of third party has increased a lot, which has nothing to do with you, in terms of emotional baggage, she genuinely  Without getting bogged down in emotions, without feeling that much pain, he can give you a good advice, so if you people want to learn the way to buy that advice, now you have understood that retirement is absolutely true, the right thing is being said in this way.  The thing is happening with us, we are taking consultation, so my 45 minutes consultation is equal to you give more years of me Platina membership, so in two years I will give you  I will give Shikha, I will tell and the interaction that will happen is more than 45 minutes, but still someone has to take it, brother, I have a lot of money and I have to do something quickly, so I am a rich person because rich people waste time.  He doesn't do it, he says, do it for 45 minutes, 1 hour, it's for them, now they come and say again that no, I am for the rich people, it is not even politically correct for the poor, that we are yours.  thinking of  They were like this because wherever money is involved, you fall there and you fall there. If you do anything with money, then understand that to do good things in life, you have to give good morning message that in doing smile bill less free smile. What do you say, there is no money, it seems brother, to feel happy from within, everything in life should be set, if something happens in life, hospital is money for life, money for a ride is money, driver's money is live Jhingalala.  Even if the children do not become anything, it is still a jugaad to pay the school fees. When your life is set in the right way, then brothers and sisters, you have smiled, otherwise the smile has not come. By the way, by doing this, you are standing like this, right?  That smile has come, it is a genuine smile, so the real happiness in life, brother, comes from money, there is nothing to tell, I tell you many times, everything becomes possible, mother is not afraid, very well written in the aarti of Lakshmi Mata Ji. if it has happened  It is very good to do a side gig. It is a very good idea to have a side hustle. You can be anything, you can be a retired man, you can be a housewife, you can be a corporate, you can be anything. Once you get the template, you will not have to do consultation. How consultation is done, how it is taught to you, then you superimpose your skill set on it and it becomes your template, date it, then you do something, why is it so?  There is no stupid person who does not know anything and who has not seen anything. If you are 21-25 years old, it is a different matter if you are 30 years old, but if you are older, you have seen something and understood it, then your capability of imparting and  We give free knowledge in every nook and corner in India, brother, it is not that we do not want to give it, the only thing is that I am just telling it as a means of monetizing it. From the middle of this video, I have learned it very well.
