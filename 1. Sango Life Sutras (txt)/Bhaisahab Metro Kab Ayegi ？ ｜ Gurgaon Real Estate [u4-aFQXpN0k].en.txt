Hello friends, I have brought an interesting topic. Will metro come to Gurgaon and when will this metro come or brother, metro will come here, I mean what is the relation between Gurgaon and metro, there is a lot of comparison between Gurgaon and Noida and Greater Noida.  When there is talk of metro in Delhi, then Gurgaon has been haunting on this stomach. And many people have a feeling that Khan Metro will come, brother, that matter will come, many projects also go in between or the metro will come, this is the form of metro, so a  If I draw a route line then the thing gets erased on it too but I bring a 360 Babu of real estate, today I am going to tell you about the number one real estate clarity and speed, if someone gets hurt on this then this injury has no other option  we have to tell them something unique and interesting and the teacher should have the courage to listen to the students as well, otherwise if such things are not told, they will be heard properly, 75 someone will tell me this thing, I think  The one to explain is that this discussion has happened sometime, okay, on YouTube sometime  It did not happen but still I don't think so I don't think any major matter will come to Gurgaon nor do the people here need these two types of people, do n't forget friendship, do you do something in the evening, it's nothing like that, I don't have any such hobby no it is okay so listen carefully there is the population of Gurgaon mode start the population they do not need metro as much as they need metro people from Delhi who are coming to Gurgaon they need it they ask more because that which is not even there He doesn't even know whether it has any dryness or sorrow, what are its benefits, what are its disadvantages, this is a boiled party, that the children and this is a classic example, he built a golf course on the road, you got to know some story in some bill of golf course Now it is not right to go to a more advanced place, okay you come home and stand in this queue, it does not have the charm of Delhi, I stand in queue here, do not value time, keep standing but get down, after getting down then look carefully at the next market connectivity, if I go then I  It seems that here DPR will keep playing the game of DPR, it is not known whether it will come or not and if it comes then how important it will be and which  This is a very rich area where the flight itself costs 3-4 crores, how much should one go in the metro, the customs people will release it, even in New Delhi it costs 8-10 crores, someone in Delhi has to leave this and buy it, it is yours.  So it is done, it means if you actually sell it then you will be called coriander otherwise the fan of yours, you want metro and you also want less bus fare in Delhi, it is not there here, whatever you have, I know a little about class and  It will become a versus but okay still listen to your point then understand it carefully and deeply if you live in a posh Indian society I am telling you Palam of Gurgaon worth three to four crores then what do you want that your exact society  You would not want the gate of the metro stations and if you want then the rate will fall and not increase for example if you take the bill for me then I wish that Taaron ji's house is in Mumbai and some luxurious metro station or something should be built in front of his house.  If it goes up from there, then its value will increase or decrease, meaning the more  If it is worth 300 crores then it will go 40 kilometres ahead, here I will tell you about the actress Dimple, so that exaggeration has to be used many times, sometimes it is of heroic sentiment, sometimes it is thought that it is of heroic sentiment, sometimes something had to be added so that the audience  Could understand from the notes exam clear meaning of Mouni that the importance being given to the metro in Gurgaon, it is a big player in narrating further here is another psychology that I will tell you you are buying a flat, you are buying a property which will get 2  In 3, 4, 5 years, when you will be living for 20, 30, 40, 50 years, then do you want to see yourself hanging on the metro even after 40 years or 30 years? I am talking to people of whom I may not be able to afford right now, I don't want a car, I don't want it  A soft disorder don't want a bigger aspirations on Kargil Chowk so on our channel poetry decision making and if you want to buy a flat worth 23 crores then don't ask about metro  Today is the time of this video to ask about metro, tell me in the comment section that if this flashlight is worth lakhs then the question of metro should be asked that I am buying a property worth 80 lakhs then I will ask the question of metro or for one and a half crore  If I live in a metro area then one should not buy property above this level. People say that we will buy it, how will our children manage, but do you want to know about such families, will the child stay with you, will he also be rich, will you be rich?  ho can we get a car can we get a driver who can take us everywhere I will also show videos on this I will also do the maths calculations and I will tell you that it is very important and fold incline with one two three friends and two  Three relatives and Vijendra's family and have a driver and it should be shared on cost basis, it is more important that many people will come here to talk about pollution and environment, everyone likes to listen to these things, there is also discussion over tea looks good okay it's practical Let's do it in our life, okay, this is pollution, so don't buy anything, don't buy it ever, okay now what is this time, what are these points and taxi drivers, the photos that we got to see, people will drive 60km between Delhi-Gurgaon  If it will run at this speed, then it is possible that it is said here and run this metro there, do not spend on metro, run hotspot, then first spread it to 2025, then do it by showing DPRO DP of friends, it will come by 2006, 2025, as the time has come,  The thing is, it takes â‚¹2 crore per kilometer, it takes 45 crore kilometer, you people can make a roundabout and that is also running, okay if we do this then its 19 year old age will come in 2036  First I said that big people will go and then they will do it by 2030, so I am telling you this thing that nothing will happen by my wishing and telling, this topic was important that this is happening, I will just ask you on this  Yes, the metro is coming, the metro is coming, it is okay to say this only when the metro bus moves ahead and according to me it is not that important, I will repeat it again, good for the villagers because that gentry is different, the child here who is here at the end of today, this  There is a huge difference, I want to make a video of Delhi versus horses because till date that was an item, it did not happen because it always happens by doing Gurgaon versus Noida, they say David versus Noida, he said that you will make Delhi less than Gurgaon, okay, you have so much audacity, okay  So should I make this Delhi vs Gurgaon, please write this Vyavasth ji below, okay, if you want this Jio, then I will not show anyone below in that, I am telling you first, I will tell you such a great winner, I will tell this Atal expats who mind  There is a difference at the state level, here the movement from this side of the New Delhi, South Delhi, from here we go to Powder village, then it is called difficulty in mindset, it is called time value for money or if I go among friends, then I will reach first, how will I take reports on that Then how do I get down from here and this will lead to the west and wait  If I do it, it will take me so much time, so can't I go to the overall set that we cannot go on our own, so this award test and population of course Delhi's Mac is beneficial brother, here in 2022 Naipaul population is mother 2 crore 20  If there are lakhs then unfortunately what works in Delhi needs not be replicated in Gurgaon also, notes are required in Gurgaon, okay, Gurgaon is actually very open from Delhi, if you see, area wise, deputy wise and population wise, see the accounts there, then here  Maybe there is no need eight at no point of time let me make it clear that all these things should not come or beam but how much Viber will I take and we have seen okay how much ridership it is running, its ridership calculations and figures are not people  Even before we could show it with colour, some people were with husband destructor, so we don't know why they are not going because of comedy or they themselves don't want to go or something else, they want transport system in public transportation system  It is not the government, these buses are not even stitched very well, brother, I ca n't even sit in them, this is a worry, this power, this is low rise, the public wants something else, are you from Gurgaon, this thing which I want in Ontario identifying with 16, what have I stopped  Because to take it, it is okay, talk to thousands of people that brother do you want to walk, what is the matter, you don't want to walk, nothing was happening, this also needs to be true, I know about this, you can also read the code on the video that those who want to walk, do not want to walk  He will not say anything, he will give her a little girl but when he goes to leave, it is okay and I am not everything for him, so brother, when it will be ready then see how many are going, how many are left right now, look at them, otherwise it will be ready It will be built sooner or later but as per the real estate, it has too much weightage at that time, Singh cannot give it to me that yes, if the metro comes then it will be something very great and Smile Edit will be somewhere a kilometer away and it will not touch me  The situation where I was not touched was my turn off by tour operators  Situation this only time will tell today slip permission questions and according to my mathematics how did you like this calculation and account please tell me, if you felt bad about it and secondly don't agree and diversity then please please right discord this season potter's this topic  Bringing and
