Hello friends, you must have heard a saying many times, okay listen to everyone and do what you want, okay, I am going to give a new perspective on this because it has been said a lot, heard a lot, you write yes if you have heard it by pausing here because it is very common  Yes, this is wrong, this is wrong, I will tell you why this is wrong, listen, you don't have to listen to everyone, I just say listen to everyone, do what your heart says, brother, the mind changes, listen very carefully, what do you want to listen to, now you will say, yes, yours too  You are listening, yes listen to me after thinking because influences are everywhere, whatever the human brain hears, whatever is put into it, the company you keep, the things you talk about, then the mind changes, it is very easy to say that your mind is different and  It is different to listen to this, so let's discuss about whom you want to listen to, including parents as well, relatives, friends as well as bosses, colleagues as well, influences as well, public figures, anybody, first of all, you should look at the person who is talking about Happiness is visible on his face  Are you relaxed, happy or not? For example, parents tell us to do a lot of things, we have to listen to them a lot, even if we don't have to listen, we should start with the parents first. Okay, parents always tell us to do this, this is not right, that is not right.  yes, okay, what should one listen to, when you are growing up, when you are 5, 10, 15 years old, then there is no choice, okay, and they are not even talking about such a high level thing, they are talking about security and safety, you have to listen to it  But like you have turned 18, you have become an adult and you are growing up 20, 25, 30, but parents don't stop harping on 35, 40. You have to see that your parents have been bitter in their life, only the acumen parents are bitter and happy.  Not only this, there are many who are not happy, we have to take a pinch of salt in listening to them and ask them that you have implemented this thing, you did a good thing, then why are you not happy?  You have to ask a straight forward question and if he genuinely says that son there was no one to teach us and we were wrong here, no one was to tell us, we did a lot and now I feel this is right, then you should listen to it if the parent accepts it  These are our mistakes. When I am talking about parents, then this is applicable for anyone who is telling us from a very higher pedestal that we did nothing wrong, our life was perfect and our situation was so bad.  Every person describes his situation as so bad that the child has no means to go out. Hey brother, when parents say that in 1960-70 our condition was bad, the condition of the whole country was bad, brother, it was not the condition of your parents, the whole society was equal.  So all the advantages and disadvantages are relative, competition is also relative. In 1960, early 70, if you just completed graduation and did anything from anywhere, it was good enough for you too. Landing a job somehow was a big deal in itself, passing 10th and 11th was a big deal, you know, being educated was a big deal, so whenever someone is telling you something, pay very close attention  If you listen to toxic people, if you listen to negative people, then your mind will become like that, you will not be able to do what you want, those who keep speaking negatively against the government, forcefully discuss a lot about politics, religion  All these things don't have any meaning about it. In our practical life, many things are private. You just have to go and press such a button. It takes one second. In elections, there is an assembly election, two Lok Sabha elections, and many places together.  It happens at different places at different times, meaning it takes 5 minutes to go, 5 minutes to come back, 5 seconds to stand in line for 15-10 minutes, press 5 seconds; a 20 minute thing which is done twice, how much people discuss about it in 5 years  that you will cross this, you will cross that hey  Keep quiet and you will know whom to target by looking at you, whatever you are listening to, it makes a lot of difference to you, you will not be able to do what you want, whether it is your investments or relationships, now if you listen to such people Whose world view is that a girl should stay at home and raise the children full time and should not work outside, in the society only men will work, if a woman works then how will the house run, means you have to take that responsibility as a man  We do n't want what women have been taking for so many years that she will give birth to the children but you should help out a little in the household affairs, evolve a bit, stay at home or whatever you do on Saturday and Sunday, then your world view will remain the same  You are not doing what your heart desires, you are doing what their heart desires, so whenever you are listening to me, if you listen to me then you will do what your heart desires, now you have to see with which quality of person you are associated  That is why it is said that why one talks about keeping company with good people, if this saying of yours was true that listen to everyone and do what you want  And if your mind is so protected, then there shouldn't be any issue of company, go out with anyone, talk to anyone, mingle with anyone all the time, then why do parents say that no, no, you won't get it from this one  He will not go along at all because they know that influence makes a difference and that influence works at home because many times, now I will tell you guys a very deep thing, there are two English words but understand those.  You are right, you should hear everybody an action based on that listening, so that listening thing is kept for many people and for those people who have done something in life and if they failed after doing it then it is a different matter if you did not do it  You may find that the defeated gambler also understands the game very well, he has not won but he knows when he should have left, okay so it is not like that, but don't talk to such people, most of the people are such that they have never done anything like a small  It's a 45 second long story, it was a camp, it's good for climbing a mountain  It was a very high mountain, okay, you can put it in any way you want, you can put Kanchan Changa, okay, as an example, there is a story, there was a man there, and whoever used to come to the camp site, that man used to come and say that there is a mountain up there, there is snow like this  you will fall like this and you will die, you are very he is like this, like that and it is not right at all, so people used to go away from there saying friend he is telling the truth, okay, but this went on for many days, okay, then a man reached there and he  I asked a simple question, have you ever been to a mountain? I said I have never been there, then how do you know what the path is like, that you will fall and die, when you have not been there yourself or if you have been there yourself then tell me that this  yes, this is a photograph, this is statistics, accordingly you should avoid doing this, we ourselves never ask anyone this question because this basic thing seems difficult to us, that how can we ask like this, whenever a person is telling something, ask him that  You have done it, you have tried it, what you are saying is not correct brother, if you are aware of your experience then things  Those who are in your awareness, you have seen you, interact more with those people who have seen you, time is very limited in life, spend this time with the right people, don't spend it with the wrong people, wrong people, whoever will come, they will come for a long time  There will be sweet talks, there will be alcohol, cigarettes, pakodas and tea, you will enjoy in the short term but after spending more time with such people, life will not seem to be going anywhere and then many children connect with me or some people say I don't know, clarity.  No, it is not like that, it is not like that, what is your company, like I am an astrologer but I tell people that without looking at your horoscope, your future can be known and all of you can become astrologers without having any knowledge of astrology, you can tell anyone's future  I want to tell you, find out his daily routine for the last one month, what time does he wake up, what does he do till night and with whom does he sit, tell me about those five people with whom you spend maximum time. and tell me some of their qualities that they are your future choose these five people very deliberately these five people  may be in the virtual space like may be I'm in the virtual space you need not you know a good book or books in general or good articles or something like this that can also be a person you're spending time with and then  You can choose some people physically, they need not necessarily be your extremely close friends, they may be sounding boards, the people you talk to, discuss, they tell you something like a financial advisor, someone is your mentor, this is the guru system of mentorship in India  It used to be like this earlier, many years ago Maculay had said in the British Parliament in 1800, something like 25 I think, that we have to destroy the education system of India if we want to control this country because this is such a good system in the country, there is a  There is a Guru and there are five to six students and they have one on one mentorship for their entire life and that Guru teaches them everything, not just one thing but everything, that means not just studies but the way of living.  The way of behavior is not in our control, if you could not do that, then more will come in these videos and more will come in the education system and beyond that I will not make any such video which makes you feel negativity or helplessness, I do not want to make you feel helpless at the end of any of my videos  I want to empower myself, this crying and whining is not in my personality, it's okay that this is not right, that is not right, fix that, fix everything, you are born, why don't you do it, government, such government, such government, even within the government  So these people wearing hard masks are roaming around, you become the government, okay you choose the government, no, we choose every time and every time someone turns out like this, hey bhaiya I also have many things in my hands to do, I will show you those videos  I will definitely make this video, how did you like this belief system, the belief systems that you have, you should always like the belief system crusher, every person has created a belief system, there will be only two things, that person will crush your belief system and take you towards a new awareness  it will take you to possibilities it will happen or Your belief system is its onslaught which is an attack on this thinking, it will become stronger by withstanding it, one of the two things will happen, you will say, no brother, the things you told me are very good but I did not like this one, so brother it is fine. Dispina that so your convene increased even more whatever it was of yours, there should definitely be an aim to expose yourself that also I think this is also the people in our country are very hesitant to express their thoughts and to listen to a new thought, they are scared For the fear of being judged, now I come and make videos, I have no fear of being judged, write whatever you want to write, whether your mind is fine or bad, some people write something or the other, many people write something or the other, okay, many people write something or the other.  You write very well, most of the people write well, okay, but my aim is not to get you to write well or bad, my aim is to come here and show you a torch, a light, and say that brother, these things are also like this, so whenever you listen, everyone has a colour  It is ok to do what your heart desires but at the moment you have to listen to everyone and then only do what their heart desires.  You don't have to listen to everyone, you have to be selective as to whom will I listen to brother, I will not listen to this one at all, I will not listen to you, why should I not listen to you because you keep crying always, if you yourself are not happy, you keep crying yourself, talks city  Your own relationships are not well, your health is not well, nothing is well with you, after listening to you I want to become like you, so you start saying this on your face, then those who come to give advice even in close relationships force you  They come to judge, they come, tell me uncle, I agree with everything you say, but it doesn't seem like you should be followed more, it means your mother will directly hear that you said this against brother-in-law, okay  If yes, then you can read the picture, there is risk in your daily life, some risk is fine, gradually you will get to know how this child is, this child is fine, then you will automatically start attracting good people, see this also  So in normal life we ​​have limited time, right people, hold on to it in your life and in everyone's life  These are fine people, those who are not close relatives are understanding it, look for a distant friend, a close friend is not understanding it, look for a distant friend, the father of a friend may be intelligent, you will find someone or the other, friend, this is India, it is not like that Many people are fine too, the question is how many people in your life are fine, have you kept such people in your life who have done something in life, I am not repeatedly saying that they are rich and successful, but they have done 10  Meet such people who have done things, who have done 20 businesses and not even one of them succeeded, such people will also help you a lot, but don't meet such people in whom life has not done anything, okay that is the big thing, thank you very much
