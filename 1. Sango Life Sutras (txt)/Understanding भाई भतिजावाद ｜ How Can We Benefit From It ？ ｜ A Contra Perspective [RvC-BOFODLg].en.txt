Hello friends, understanding nepotism can be good, interesting contract office, you will enjoy, belief system, it is crushing time, if you have a crush then make a new one, if not, then enjoy your old one, it is okay, this is the horse of middle class, nepotism, this time I hope you get this  Have you heard the word? If we talk about it in simple Hindi language, it is called nepotism. Like okay, and journalists are considered bad. I say it is not bad, it is natural, it is good. We get to learn a lot from it. And you should understand it carefully.  Ok and you tell me this word came in normal popular media when Kangana Ranaut ji said it in an interview of Karan Johar and when did nepotism start in general, so after this we left nepotism only in Bollywood or politics and kept it in both politics and Bollywood  I will also address them, I will also address life, I will try to understand you all very well and in the end you should write if you understand that nepotism is good, if I could not convince you, writing this is nonsense and there are other things where there is something like this  The problem is nepotism, when a farmer's son is doing something, they don't go there and say how he is getting such a great opportunity, you people just keep the fields and you know how to do the work of the farmer, our children don't know why they are involved in nepotism  You don't say after the matter is over, friend, the washerman's son is ironing the dhobi's clothes, you don't go there and say, hey, your father set up a shop, our son will not be able to do it, this is a big injustice, there is power, there is politics, address your problem to him as well  I will address all types of nepotism, but I want to tell you that if there is no system of nepotism in your life, then you will either remain poor or middle class, if you are poor, then you will become rich. What needs to be seen is that if someone has taken advantage of a less established person, then he will be called rich.  did it and his child can do that thing from where he is finishing or wherever he has reached, so there is growth, many people in the middle class believe in the system, start from the scratch, we also started from scratch So we started from scratch and reached here, now you will start from here with a crash  You have reached there because there is no way that you can do it from here and you consider this thing very good that you have become a government officer, have reached a very good position, but your child will have to give an exam and he will have to pass it, only then will he get your job  There is no benefit, yes this is not a good thing but a stupid thing, you have wasted 40 years of your life, there is no benefit to your family, now the middle class remains only middle class and keeps on grinding there, if you are becoming a lawyer  and you are Ram Jeth then your son will not start from a normal notary lawyer if you are a chartered accountant very high fee and your child is also becoming a chartered accountant only then will he start from where the father is there it  Ungood thing, now many people will say, hey this is nepotism, it should also be started separately, hey listen friend, listen to me carefully, people come in Bollywood as well, tell me one thing, if tomorrow I make a film in Bollywood for one of my children  My money, my money is wasted and you others are doing nepotism  Is there any complaint that the tax money should be spent, you are a fool who wants nepotism that your child has merit, my child does not have merit, your child is a very strong actor, my child is a very good actress but the money is being spent on me, my brother, if your  You become the hero in the wedding video, it costs one and a half to two lakh rupees, it is also okay there, if someone says that my make-up is good, I am looking more handsome, why are you involved in this, the video is my function, my money, my karma, what do you care?  People are facing problems, I want to ask that are other people facing problems, brother, is there any film producer who is after Karan Johar, his father is Yash Johar, who is he, where did he come from, his zero is zero, that means all the businesses  They are going to be there, instead of giving it to your children, you should give it to you because you are talented, your talented people will work as their servants, that talented boy or girl from IIT IIM will work as their servants, come to Gujarat, there is Ahmedabad, there is a Gujarati in Ahmedabad too  No students, go and check it, I will work and also tell them the truth that they go and do business  They know how to do it, what is there in Gujarati in Ahmedabad, why are they not giving quota to our people, why are our people not going, they don't create a ruckus, they do n't say it is nepotism, nepotism is a normal thing which is running our class system every  The father will do whatever arrangements he can, you tell me this, when you expect help from someone to promote me, then it is not nepotism because there is no blood relation, hey, promote and protect your blood, why can't the son of a king be a king, king  There will not be a king anywhere, it will keep going on like this, the son of a king is the king, our turn will not come, so become Chandra, take the power from Dhananand and make your secret dynasty, make Maurya dynasty, then you won't do that, give the system to Paka like this  We can say that there are nepotism beds everywhere, the government should close them down. You tell me there is a doctor, his nursing home is running very well, it is running very well in a small town, now his son has a degree from somewhere. Sometimes you get talent and you know that it's a challenge to take it forward  It's nothing, he did not pass the exam but now he will be the one to manage his hospital, you will go and say no, he has come after studying at AIIMS, doctor, now he is more talented in science, so do n't promote nepotism, give the reins of this hospital to him, oh what should I give him friend  Only my son will take over the reins, this one from AIIMS will become his servant, we will give him a salary of two lakh four lakh five lakh ten lakh, this is a fact, this is a lie, why are you people running away from this, Gulshan Kumar ji, late Gulshan Kumar  Yes, you all know [Music] the movie probably did not become a hit, big people said that it is nepotism, he does not know how to act, there was a brother who used to sell fruits at Ready, then there was a fruit shop, then he opened his shop in another way, he worked so hard brother earned money, do you know how much hard work Gulshan Kumar ji did, he told his brother come and stand up, the songs are ours, the shooting will happen, why did you face trouble, people did not do well, the movie did not do well, you gave your decision  No, I am not saying that if the son of a big actor becomes a hero  If he is there then you have to like him, you have to watch his movies, oh no, it's not good, don't watch him, if you do n't like our movies, it seems like nepotism, do n't watch it, then don't watch it, they want to enjoy his flops, those people also want to take static pleasure  No one is denying it but brother it is a private business and you go there again and again and this middle class is the biggest loser in it because they see merit everywhere and it does not run on the basis of merit, the world does not run on the basis of merit  Because along with merit, luck is also a thing because everyone's starting line is different, the day you understand that many times it happens that your child is very talented, very good but you are a poor man, he may have an alcoholic father.  He does nothing lifelong, his child turns out to be very talented and on the other hand, there is a very hardworking father and he has achieved something in life and his child is average, so his child will always be ahead of this child, now you say that this child's talent will be snatched  Give it to this child, hey brother, such a total collective family, there is no lack of effort, there is no lack of effort  His family photo, where should his father go, his father has wasted 40 years of his life, his father might be filling bananas at the petrol pump, he might have just sent them and who knows, he has established a huge business house, now his son is doing that.  And they are taking it forward and further their children, then how can you consider it bad and say that this person has less talent and you have more talent, so make him sit, it will be the father's addition, you have to understand in the total life, what has the father done or yours  The collective hard work of the family will be counted. If you reduce it like this then the family will progress in the coming time. Only when you say why not enjoy the job because there is no race again and again in the job, there is no benefit to your child anywhere.  You can reach there by earning money directly from somewhere, take some money, do it directly, there is no benefit to the child, then get these stuff where you can provide a platform to these kids, those people who do business, family, truth from outside in their partition, who Reduce it, establish it here in Delhi. Look, one generation built it, the second expanded it, the third expanded it further.  Now those people, you keep calling them nepotism, nepotism, they have benefited from it, their connections have become like this, you make these connections, now you can make them, many people of generation A are lagging behind and some people are moving generationally ahead.  Now their man wants that their so called talent should override this generational gap and take them ahead very quickly, that is not going to happen, this is what I am telling you, I am not going to do this, you have set up a pan-gappa (pani-puri) shop, you have set up a sweet shop next to it  If someone comes here to protect your business and you are convincing others not to expand, you are doing all your marketing, reducing your prices, doing all this, then it is now science and businessman you have to go further  Big Kitty you and cash you burn you can actually destroy new things this is what old business is doing and it gives it to actress now all these bhi.coms of yours are closing the cash as soon as goods come to the house take this  take that, reduce the rate, give a discount so that  Any normal person or new person who comes will fail because they have big pockets and they will capture the market and Denmark see till now the market will put the price on retirement so whoever has more cash to close it  If he is doing this then it is nepotism only, the whole business is in nepotism, that my business runs, my man's business runs, brother-nephew, this is the thing, this is the accounting, now whose father has been a politician for 40 years, inside whose house all this network is there  It is going on, all the fathers are involved, the children are involved, so they will get the inheritance, for sure, if you don't like it, don't vote for them, but do n't say that why is the politician's son becoming a politician, you have a problem with it, the son of a doctor is becoming a doctor  There is no problem in a farmer becoming a farmer, there is no problem in a washerman becoming a washerman, there is no problem, but there is a problem in this, now Arjun Tendulkar ji, the son of such a famous batsman of the world like Sachin Tendulkar ji, has come, go through this thing.  You will get nothing else, if not you will get skills, you will get training, why is he becoming a cricketer, why doesn't he become a bank manager, why doesn't he give the IAS exam, brother, what is it, friend, why do we have a problem with someone, whatever he is doing, every person will do the same, a normal person will do the same. Because middle class is such a thing where the child doesn't want to do what his father does because the father is such a loser type [Music] so his own people don't do anything for you, and now you have a problem with what others are doing that you also say yes it is nepotism of mine, tell me one thing, should I wish for my nephew and work for someone else, why brother, to me only my nephew is dearer, my child, I love my children and nephew to him, if you  You are saying that I will openly help him, I will do something, so what not, you are not allowing other talents to come and you are doing this for yours, and this list is full of talented people, still what is the problem, brother, my efforts are natural, why should you have a problem  If you are continuing like this then you will not let me come, I want someone who had shown his strength as an example in any family I am speaking as a person who did something against him and now he has reached, I have taken such a good example, friend, have a problem with Dhananand and replace him, then run your dynasty, then someone will come to replace you, then you will get a reply And he should remove it and you don't have to struggle and you should be made to sit, then say yes this is a very good appreciation of talent, if there is talent then laado, fight and do bano, it's okay and you cannot do it near the choice cap in the houses and there you can enjoy life and Here the actual lower class is not unhappy, they are actually harassed, they are actually not getting mocktails, the most crying and whining is being done by the middle class, who actually have choices, it is easy to collect something because they have education as well  There is awareness and resources too but they can reach this league but they are crying the most. Maybe they want to cry but they are doing their work quietly. They are busy, they are busy, you rickshaw puller, cart puller, washerman or these labourers below, no one will tell you what nepotism is happening, they understand, all these things are happening from here, now the wages of the labourers are being charged, no one comes and tells that  This nepotism is you making your child strong, you are a laborer, your child is a laborer, wow what fun it is, no one says this to you, so this was a different way of explaining nepotism, of understanding this, all those families who have hired a lawyer  He made his son a layer. You know what kind of system works in the judiciary, how many families who are controlling, they tell each other that if you want to break it, you do it and you know that if your father  If you are not a lawyer then you do n't know where to go and sit, how to go, how to do it and you have studied law in school, you have gone to college, everybody has taught you there, now what to do next, now you expect from someone  And your father will help you without any reason because you have talent because you have four children.  If your marks are higher in the law college, you are four marks ahead in the law college, then you become talented, the one who got four marks less, brother, his father is a lawyer since 30-40 years, so he has that advantage, instead of giving it to him, he should give it to you because your  To expect that four marks have been scored more is foolishness. I am saying that expecting this is against nature. Discussing something that is against normal human nature is foolishness. Nepotism is bad. What is the most you can do?  If you try to spoil their market, you will do this, but what benefit do you get from it, your movie will become a superhit, where brother, now there are some roles like that in the film world, that person with nepotism cannot do the role of Hathiram.  If there is no talent then they will bring him for that, where he has to just dance like this, when will he do it, let them decide who wants to invest whose money where, he cannot stop it, there is no need to cry but  Patience is needed because where that talent is less visible, there is talent hidden behind it, so respect the talent, at least you understand that okay there is less talent, but there was talent behind it, that is why it remained less talent  If it is in any generation then your old generation will be ruined, if the old generation did not work hard then you will get a chance, whatever he will not get, if someone in his family has worked then he will eat, someone eats by luck, someone eats by hard work, someone eats by luck Why should those who work hard for their living cry? If you want then work hard, shine your luck, then your next generation will do it. You guys got a lot of clarity in this, so please tell me, thank you.
