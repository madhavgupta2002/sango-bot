I did not say that I am the best for the extremely poor people who are living in poverty and cannot get food, clothes and shelter. I defined myself and told the audience that it is important to tell you because if you do not ball your trumpet  Nobody is going to ball it for you, this is the truth of life and brother, to do trumpet ball, you need something, it is not that easy, you try it yourself, it is easy from time to time because when I will tell you, when you say you are  Best this that and give people comments ask you okay friend this capital gen 2 will adjust in this will happen in this and sometime you get stuck and you say this to you every time I told myself number van real estate clarity call  If it is kept, then brother, there will have to be number van in all the aspects, you cannot say that brother, this is the browser, this is the project, this is the layout, this is Gurgaon, this is for this much, this is the discount of this much, no, no, brother, everything should be known. From the loss of Hindu divided families to what is the rate of registration, in Maharashtra registration is counted in the property price and it does not happen here in Gurgaon, you should also know about Abrol Nagar of Pathankot, when you talk about real estate of India, then India's  Real estate is India itself, then you are not talking about Gurgaon, nor about one place, then if you are talking about yourself then you are saying brother, I know everything roughly, I also know about Jabalpur, I want to take it behind Dina Cantt in Ranchi, You know about there also, you know about Pune also, you know about Viman Nagar also, you know about Kolkata Rajarhat also, you know at colony level in Dehradun, you are in Baba Dehradun then you also know about Prem Nagar that Prem Nagar is also here in Rajpur  The road is here, Clement Town is here, Ghadi Cantt is here, then you do n't leave it, you don't leave any city, you go to Jaipur  So in Jaipur you say brother will take it in Jagatpura, the one here will take it, which ones do they have different sectors, they have different those C people live separately, you will have to know about them all, when you say it once, you are the best  So the world itself makes you the best because every person will troll you, will ask questions, then if you have the passion, you actually feel ashamed that friend I said I was the best, then you will go and read it, the world itself will make you the best, see, you will call yourself the best from zero  The content is that you are sitting at zero in your eyes and you will think that the world will give you full happiness, you have to improve your wealth, let's reach 60% and 60% and you think that percent of people will make you realize that it is actually 60 and then you will get confident  It feels good to connect with people from the heart, Shahrukh Khan sings songs like this, I am not the best, I am not the best, that song of his, I am not afraid of dying, Badshah Badshah Badshah, Bollywood has become Aadar Vice, tell me from where did you get the name Badshah, where did you get it  Someone with a king from  There was not only the Badshah picture, there was a Badshah picture, like Vishwas, there was a strange picture, Aishwarya Rai too, it is very difficult to say that I am the best match teacher, but to say that I am not above the best recording of coordinates geometry or trigonometry or  Friend if you are of sixth or seventh class then tell me that you people can work in these days and Ram can do in this evening can do in this both working together will I be in this question hey you have to become the best in anything before saying this  It is not easy to speak like this, you are a history teacher, you come and say that I am a history teacher, so you are the best of the Mughals from 1526 to Babur 1556, who was 30 years old, I only know Humayun and Babur, that's all, I want to go further.  I did not go till Jahangir and I do not want to go further till Shahjahan. I want to say here that it is important for me to speak on the history of India after 1959 and if people get angry with you then it is a good thing that they should get angry about because a person is confident and happy.  He is coming and saying this, I am not him but whenever we want to work on something, we get irritated with such people but these are the people who come in the work, you are going to give food to someone, contractor, you are fine, build a house.  If it is there then you will ask, it is the best, it is second best, you want the best everywhere, so if someone is saying that I am the best, then how will you judge, first you have to build only one house, you should build the house and then you will judge you  The decision has to be taken beforehand, in the same way if you want to go to eat, you have to hire a cook, you have to hire a maid, you have to hire a cook, you have to hire a driver, then you have to have some confidence that I am a driver, I am like this, you will have to praise him a bit, that person is doubtful  What do you want, how am I the driver, let's take you once on the Delhi to Dehradun highway, the kids will go, if they are fine then it is best, it is good, you want such people, accidents can happen to anyone, even with the best of the best.  It may be possible but in this thing you should understand what the person is trying to say, you will have to raise your level and stay away from such people.  If you want to join yourself and someone is joining then you should not be jealous, you have to think from him that it should work, do you make it work because you have to see that there is big money in being above the average, there is no money to be in the average, it is very  I am telling you a big thing, a separate video will come on this in life, I will tell you separately about increasing the average of this, have you ever seen any big lecture taking place, if you are in a corporate or you are a government employee and in an auditorium  If I am here or even if you are in school somewhere then first someone will come with us today Mr. and Mrs. the car is like this there is an arrow in the pumpkin I am preparing that friend see this properly nothing should happen tell us we should also talk about this today  If I talk to you then you are making a preface everywhere for 20 minutes, it would be better if you just say it straight away, friend, best you are, I am a very knowledgeable person, there is a lot to say about this, listen to my knowledge, thoughts are the same because lot of people you know want you  No I can also live 50 achievements of my own 50  minute okay 153 okay so what does it mean, just tell it to you straight away why am I living that life, why am I living that life, I am not telling that I should be very fussy in this thing, just tell me straight away  Turram is in this thing and if the audience starts then first you will tell like this that I did this, I did that, then I became the best in such a game, then this happened, then that happened and those people are watching like this and when you tell about someone  The belief system breaks. Who are you? There is no one to tell you. If you understand the matter then do it. Your point is right then keep it up. But why is it hurting? It is hurting because something came from inside and shook you.  Now a doubt has been created, now your belief system might have broken, someone might have questioned your 35 years of existence that you were living a false life, so then you want to ask who are you, I am the one who gave you pain  di and doubted it, if you hear this then be happy and those who are happy or do something like this  The CDO is like that, don't be jealous of them, okay brother, I will finally tell you, listen carefully, my example, in India, the number one people do not give examples to the people, even the teachers do not give examples, anything has always been there in our Indian education system  For example, if it is understood by writing, then today I will tell you the difference between arrogance and cute confidence, then we will understand it carefully. Okay, there is a picture called Dirty Picture, okay, have you seen Vidya Balan's Dirty Picture? Okay, you haven't seen it.  So maybe show me the song which I am going to tell you about and there is one song called Jab Bhi Met in which Geet is there, Geet is there in Kareena Kapoor's song so when she says that the role of Silk Smitha ji that you are playing on screen and why is Vidya Balan looking arrogant?  It is like this, do it exactly like this, there is that pain in it and whenever Geet says, whenever I am not talking about my favourite screen personality because there is a difference in that also, okay, so in that scene, I used Kareena Kapoor ji  There is a song, maybe I am in it  So I am my favorite, so if someone is like self love, it is that you are comfortable about yourself, how are your hands, how is your face, how are your hair, how are you, are you comfortable with that, you have accepted yourself, this person has so much wisdom, so much intelligence  He grants me and is doing it to me and associate it with a child, a child has manners, that child will make a drawing of himself like this and say that Momin is so good, that one is very good, so more than that drawing, it is his ecstasy  The one who comes to show that to his, he gives happiness to the parents, seeing the excitement, I made it, a small child, like even a 10, 11, 12 year old child, some boy or girl makes something for the first time, okay and he is excited about it, right?  Very good, okay, so that confidence and those vibrations give happiness, but there is no need to judge it every time, look at the passion, friend, I am the best for you, I am also the best for you, this can also happen if you  If your budget of the movie is 25 crores, then brother Ayushmann Khurrana is the best hero for you, if you don't say that Salman is the best and Shahrukh is the best, Shahrukh Salman has to earn 100-200 crores, if your budget is 25 crores, then brother Ayushmann Khurrana is for himself  So Ayushmann Khurrana concentration is not going to you know Yash Raj and saying that Bhaiya 13 has a budget of 300 crores and I am the best hero, you can get no he is not saying date I am not and saying he is saying anything example ok so don't get  you know weird when you have to say same times and you see someone saying date okay see where it is coming from okay so yes one can be cutely confident and that can be said on the face like this okay rest of the people will be actually arrogant  That body language and even if you say it to her face, it is still cute, nothing, friend, you are an ass, I know son, tell me what I am saying.  Vodafone totally confident so there can be many spelling mistakes in writing it can also put pressure in writing so if it is very big then I will understand CC and arc I will be able to see it in the comment section I did not write all that friend I was thinking CC so I consider myself pretty confident this is because my feedback is in nine if you find it helpful my audience is okay so please type and respect wiself also should work becoming confident okay because this is what will attract people to you okay  And once people are groomed then life becomes interesting, this money, such brand, this is bound to happen, this is its fallout, okay, but life becomes more interesting for you and for the people who are getting associated with you, okay, so in life  One should enjoy, one should have fun, those who enjoyed, write, thank you.
