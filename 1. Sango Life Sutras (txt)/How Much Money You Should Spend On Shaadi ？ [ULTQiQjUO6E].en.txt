Hello friends this is a very good topic for the youth how much money should you spend in your own wedding I am telling this for the youth, a lot of money is spent in weddings in our country my audience is middle class and now why make this  I am going so that you can get clarity, otherwise you will keep roaming around in guilty feelings. First of all, you are getting married and there is talk of spending money, so it means you should have money, only then you will spend it, which means you earn.  So the boy must be earning, girls also earn a lot these days and everyone would have worked for four, five, six or seven years, there are savings, it is not that there are no savings, some may be less or more, then who should spend the money on the wedding, society should get clarity  I want to give you a message that I am a social observer as well. You can say in a way that I am a social reformer as well. This breed does not exist these days. It used to exist in the old times. Nowadays, everybody is a fashionista. So what reforms can you do for us? We will do it from our side.  it's personal my body my mind my money my mind our  People why you but still there is a need to tell, I am telling because there is peer pressure in the society, he also gave, they are also asking for it, it is like this, your parents may be poor, may be middle class or may be rich  There are only three categories or there will be parents and you are getting married, be very very clear about it, the answer is that you should not spend even a single rupee on your marriage, if possible, practically possible, then who will spend even a single rupee, your parents will get you married  It is the responsibility of the parents to take care of their children but they may not be able to fulfil it due to some reason. Many parents are unable to fulfil their responsibilities. Many are not even able to educate them. There are some people who are irresponsible and are not even able to feed them and  They give birth to children, that is what happens in the society, but don't do such things as per your wishes, do n't do such things as per your parents' money, your marriage doesn't last, can you call it India's number one marital  I am a counselor and I look into these issues. I put so much effort into marriage. In the four hour function there is nothing left for the honeymoon, so who should pay for the honeymoon? Ideally the parents should also pay for the honeymoon if they can afford it. Marriage is such a thing that the one who is getting married has to bear the expenses  This should not be done, society should make such a rule, relative should give the gift, parents should give, brother or sister should give, anyone should give the gift, maternal uncle, paternal uncle, whoever it is, now many people say, hey Guru Ji, we do not have such relatives who would give so much, then brother  There is no need to spend much on them, I am telling you this simple thing, I am speaking simply, there is no need to spend much on the wedding anyway, the first question is how much do you need to spend, but before that there is another question  How much has to be done, as little as possible, the marriage has to be done properly, in the terms that the rituals have to be followed, money has to be given to the fire pandit ji, I have seen people will even spend 50 lakh rupees in weddings but will definitely bargain with the pandit ji.  Bhaiya, whatever he said to Pandit ji, a little more than that Look, make them happy. Hey, you are also an astrologer. You are one, no problem. I will do the catering and I will do the rest. I am not saying this for buying a car, but I am saying, save as much money as you can in the marriage.  And you go towards buying a house, hey you take care of the house, that's why hey brother I will also breathe in the house, I also use air purifier and if you do n't get married, some people go into depression because of that, I also do it for them and for those whose marriage is not right  I also do the ongoing work, I work for everyone, I am a friend of everyone, I do 50 to 55 to 60 types of consultations and I am a friend of everyone, so you don't have to worry about my business many times  People write to me like this, what I am trying to say is that in your marriage, you should not feel pressured to spend money to help your parents, tell your parents that brother you cannot afford it, so you cut out certain things, or you should not do this  If you need to spend this much then  There is absolutely no need to spend a lot of money on the wedding just to please your parents and the benefits of spending less will start showing immediately after the wedding. When you have liquid cash and investments for you, you just start from plus Rs. lakh  In investments, in stocks, mutual funds, demat investment or starting from almost zero, I have seen people starting from negative, they invested everything, even maxed out the credit card and then all that is left is shoes, shoes, which means fights and quarrels, so I don't feel duty bound in that  You have to do it, you are getting a great shoot done for Rs. â‚¹ lakhs, the photographer took the money, hey, shooting can be done with a good mobile also, they are making movies like this, there should be a limit to such photo shoots, lehenga worth 2 lakhs to 3 lakhs  What money brother, look if there is a program like Mukesh Ambani ji's, then brother you can do 50 pre- weddings, there is no problem, there is plenty here and when they feel it is short then they just have to increase the tariff that from today brothers and sisters, Jio will have this much instead of this much  I'll give everything I want to give, okay  Don't compete with them, a little word of yours feels very bad to hear, your status is fine but it is made up, work according to that and do it in less than that, if it is that much then be done with that much, happiness will come, there will be peace in your life  Invite only those who are your well-wishers, who are your close people to the wedding, it is not that the marriage will last long by inviting thousands of people and it is a request to the boy's family, do not put pressure on the girl's family, who knows what they might do and a request to the girl's family  I don't know what we will do so that our daughter will be happy but it is not possible and sometimes the opposite is happening these days, the girl's family also thinks that no, it will be like this at your place, this is how our wedding will be and the reception will be at our place  For the people and for this brother, do one thing, whoever has to do it, we will do the reception as well, then we will do that much at least, then it is happening back to back, I am not awake the whole night, my child is unwell, this is his bad winter environment, then I have to go there Someone is interested in going on a honeymoon but is saying that there is a reception and after that we have to go to their house and then there  You have to take blessings for two days, the child will go back there, then you will go, then her brother will come to take him, by doing such fights you are ruining your body, ruining romance, ruining your marital life and you do n't know anything about it  The one who is going to give it to me, I am coming straight and telling you this, you are getting married, after marriage, you know what you have to do first, where you have to go and do it, all your mind is there, go there, get it done and do it, okay, this  Do not keep unnecessary expenses because you will come back and then it seems to him that just like a child does not feel like going to school after vacation, he feels like going to work and his wife will also feel like those nice clothes and things like that What did she look like, wearing that, with mehendi on, should I go to office or not, should I work, that intoxication just doesn't go away, and I do n't have money, I spent it all on food and the wedding, now how many times have I spent the money after watching the album  Now they will ask what is the expense in the album, it is just an expense  Everyone has 50 such fights in a wedding, a little here and a little there, brother-in-law, give the shoes, give the money in the shoes to brother-in-law, then he is dancing in front of the band, in front of the mare, keep giving it to him everywhere, now earlier they used to say one  One does not get married only once, many times it happens in such a way that they get married one more time, so it is not like that one gets married only once, one falls in love only once, now 2024 is coming, now anything can happen  It may be so, okay, so do n't get into this trap of marriage happening only once, everything happens only once, you get a job only once, then you change it, okay, then you are not able to have a child, many people have fallen in this trap Earlier also I had made a video on the issues of middle class that school fees and property should be pragmatic what I am saying I am not I am not going to spoil the sport I am not saying at all that you should go and do a court marriage I don't believe in court Marriage means if you have to go to court then go but get married according to the customs and wear your own clothes Wear good things, it's okay, but friend, that too can be done within a limit, meaning it's okay, there is no end to it, Gold ji, we have given so much, it's lying in the locker, we can't wear such big ones, okay sir, lehenga lehenga, I look at the girls  I am not very excited that I should just take 15 lakhs from my father and deposit it in the bank account, meaning that I will not get the money and will not get any rights in the property, so I will grab all your charms in these six hours and that's it.  My memories will remain, girls like this also live a great life, this should be told to their parents as well, their brothers as well, tell everyone that son, you will also get the property, my pragmatic this is our balance, it means we can spend this, now you tell me what to do, pre marital consultation  I have a very amazing course, I will put it in the comment section, brother of 770 talks about the same things and the wedding season will start soon, the weddings must be getting fixed now, so it is not like that if the wedding is happening in November  So you are going to find the boy a day before, you must be talking to him right now All of them can take this consultation, you can also see it in the channel's membership inside the comment section, if you want to buy Ala Cart then it can be seen there as well, in both the places, it is a two and a half hour long great workshop, whoever attends it,  Consultation is being charged for Rs. 1000, so if it is not applicable to you that you are getting married, then others are getting married, you can give them knowledge. My aim here is to make all the subscribers rich along with making them happy.  I do only two things, I make people rich and happy. Will you become rich by being happy or will you make others happy by becoming rich, that depends on you. So these are the issues, raise them, talk about them, do not spend money at all on your marriage, that is the end spread.  This message is do not spend as much as possible on your parents or not that your parents had spent so much on your studies so now I will not spend on your marriage, it was their duty on studies and it was their duty on marriage as well marry according to your faith, just say I am mine, not yours, and whoever  They do this and then they remain very unhappy. This is also a message and this is a message for the youngsters, please spread it among yourselves with great experience, wisdom and observation and lot of marital consultations done under my belt with lot of sincerity and sincerity at sorry and  Love Affection Sincere Your Faith Fully Sincere Whatever you want to say, I am telling you people by doing it accordingly that brother you should do this, no one will tell you, no one from the boy's side will tell you, don't do it to the girl's side, the girl's side will say how will I say it or they will think that I am fighting for money  I am saving the people of the society, those who spent all their money on the wedding, they will say that there should be at least this much, there will be humiliation, see what a grand program we had organized there, so there is pressure on everyone, there is pressure on the boy's family, there is pressure on the boy, there is pressure on the girl, everyone  But there is pressure that we do n't know what we should do, so remove this pressure, spend practically and after that I have seen the marriage function, which we call wedding, being discussed for three to four years after the marriage in the families by the boy's father  The father in law is discussing that I had given the money there, he did not even give it, and look at the girl, she does not respect me that much, even after shedding, it means you do not want any respect, why do you want respect brother, why did you spend money on marriage, why did you take it You guys have gone so far, who told you, what are you clapping for, don't spend any money, tell me bha, do it however you want, at least everyone will do the minimum, Pandit ji, Pandit ji is very important, right, the marriage alliance that is being made  The place where the wedding rounds are taking place, that is very important, Pandit ji, it is very important, rituals are very important, okay, look at everything else, yes you can do cost cutting and for the boy and the girl, brother I am telling you, listen carefully, India's number one  Clarity giver, in clear words, the one who has no tantrums will pay for the wedding, meaning like in a movie, the producer says that someone comes and the scenes will be shot on such and such a horse, now the producer will say that there is no budget for a horse, it will be fine if they do not have the budget for a horse.  If it is there then he will come on cycle as per the requested programmes are taking place, so who is its producer, the one who has produced it and the thought that it should be like this, in many weddings hydraulic lift is coming, another one is coming and then they are going like this, okay then  He is the first one, then he will plant lily flowers, marigold flowers will plant, there is money in everything, so whose idea is the lily flower, the one whose idea is it, he will give the money, tell me whether you are a boy or a girl, it does not matter whether it is a marigold flower or not.  I am the one becoming the flower here, it's okay, I will become the flower and you also pay for the lily flowers, father and mother, it's not going to happen like this, I am spending money uselessly here, it's okay, no, the boy's family's function will be this, that  It will happen, save as much as you can, it will be useful in your life, neither the jobs are secure, nor is there any idea about inflation, inflation is very high, noise shot, school fees will keep increasing, real estate is just like us, I mean rockets will keep setting something on fire  If it is not done then whatever money you save is your own money, it will be yours and the society will not get any money through this  You have to see the video and it is written in the comment section that what you have said is absolutely right. I am not giving you the option of agreeing or disagreeing here or not, I am absolutely requesting you to write. What you have said is absolutely right because the more you write, the more pressure you will face from the society.  It will be off that friend this expenditure has to be made, there will be many people who have spent it, they will feel bad, friend why was there no knowledge in our time, look at it when you wake up in the morning, this is the work of social reformers, when they will come they will tell us because society also needs that maturity, right According to me, the maturity to understand the message has already come in the society. Now I will try to talk about these things in different styles on different platforms. You people can post this on your family groups. But when I said that the youth should not do it, then I want parents also to not do anything useless, are we crazy, we are the ones who spend everything, no you are not crazy at all, you also should not spend everything, you should also save for your old age, who said that  Everything is available for expenditure but why are you imposing a demand program on the child? Your relations, your show-off, your pride, it's all right, you spend so much money in a 4-hour function, then later you have to listen to their issues, then for 60 days, 70 days you have to go to counselors like us, our fees are very high and  There is a big cry when we give it because we have already spent so much money there, now the fee is a small amount in front of that expense but there is a lot of pressure while giving it, so why not spend less on the wedding itself so that we don't have to see the faces of people like us I come to people like me only when they are unhappy, I say that brother don't come so that everyone remains happy, now it will be better for me if I give you the opposite advice that spend your money and your shoes will be worn out and this will happen  Our business will grow further, okay our business will run in any way, whether you get married or not, maintain a good marriage or a bad one, run it however you want, our template business model, consultations, quotes and everything, but still with a lot of affection, I am telling and guiding every person that  Please follow the advice is given and if you will follow, please write it in the comment section, it will boost the moral of people like us that yes, we have benefited someone because there is definitely a benefit, money saved is money, it is a simple thing, there is benefit  It is just that, there is no need to get too emotional about it. All the old weddings that happened during Covid, where we could not spend even if we wanted to, it is going very well. It is going very well. It is not as if there was no expenditure for five people.  If there is something wrong in the marriage, please spread it to the society, thank you, very much, subscribe to the channel, if you have not done it yet, write in the comment section, you can also take the membership of the channel, you can also take platinum membership, thank you, very much
