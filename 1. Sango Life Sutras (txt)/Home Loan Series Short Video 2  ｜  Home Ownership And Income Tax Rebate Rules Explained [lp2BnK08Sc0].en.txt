Hello friends, Home Loan Series Hot Video Video Number, I will discuss Home Loan in two small videos, today my topic will be that what to do if you want to take Income Tax Rebate, many are raising questions on me about affordable housing for my son.  I have moved out and he is not earning. I want to become an applicant for a loan. Will I get income tax rebate? The answer is yes. No income tax rebate. If you want to take a home loan then you will have ownership rights in the property.  You will have to take it, without it you cannot take his income tax rebate, so you can diet at this time, but the second thing is that assume that your name is not in the property and the one whose name is there is your wife, son, mother, even if you do not earn money.  You can take a loan by becoming an applicant. If you are an applicant for a loan, it is not necessary to own a property. But if you want to take income tax rebate, then it is necessary for you to own a property. This is a basic thing, a very basic thing. You understand this thing and if two people have names in the property then the one who is giving name to the property will get income tax rebate in the same relationship in which the name is in the property. The limit for getting income tax rebate is â‚¹ 2 in section 24. If there is interest in your loan then he will say, I have taken 50 lakhs, my interest is going to him only Rs. 3.5 lakhs, so what if you add 1.5 lakhs, your limit is 2 lakhs, you can rollover it for eight years.  You can do it and when you are not showing that much interest then you can take his report later. So this was the problem, so I thought it best to tell you in short. How is this shot series looking?
