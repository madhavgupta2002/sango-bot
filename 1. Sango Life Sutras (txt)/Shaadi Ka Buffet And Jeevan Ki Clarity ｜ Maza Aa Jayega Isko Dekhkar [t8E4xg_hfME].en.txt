Hello friends, this is a very interesting topic, wedding buffet and clarity of fun, we all have eaten food in weddings, if there is a 2 year old child then I don't know whether you people have eaten food in weddings and now again the wedding season is starting, so you can also eat in that  What I am saying, you should see whether you make the mistake or not, when you go to weddings, it is white, you know, especially in North India, you have seen Indian food, there will be Indian Bharti's stalls here, starters, snacks, then some Indian, some Puri type system.  There are all kinds of rotis, there are golgappas, there is chat papdi, somewhere there is a dosa type, somewhere there is a chilla type, I am also a foodie, so you keep mentioning a lot of things to me, somewhere there is dal baati churma, somewhere there are some exotics.  If you want to eat, there is a pasta system, nowadays the catering etc. is very good and then if you go for sweet dishes, then they will be done in different ways like ice cream and you have some Robert Rabri and in that there is some Rasgulla, some Gulab Jamun, some Carrot Halwa, then  They give you hot milk, like this you know what I  I'm trying you means even 56 offerings are less, means there is more variety than that, so what do we get to learn in life from this, when am I linking to that, I bring original content, it is not cut, copy and paste from anywhere, I have a request if you want to download this  If you like this kind of content then give a like here and write below, I enjoy it and it also gives me peace, I am a foodie, I also observe a lot of people, I also used to make these mistakes earlier which people make and one Not the product type, but linking it up with like lessons is an original, I see many people picking up something and eating it, sometimes they ate this, did not like it, left it, then ate that, then left it, ate this, ate that, well, everyone's stomach is so full  I am sitting with it, no one's size is this much, everyone's size is big, if you are there then you must not have had lunch, whatever is fine, so you are eating this much, now you are trying to eat a lot of food, try voting sometime Sometimes he is trying to vote, sometimes he is eating nodal, sometimes he is eating, he will come to us in a little while and tell us.  Hey, my heart is bad, what does it mean to be bad, please those who understand the language a little, write it in the comment section, others will also do it because as soon as you say it like this, friend, my heart is bad, okay, my heart is bad, basically you are not feeling nice, okay. Video against diet, what is diet against diet, if this is curd then don't eat this, if you are eating this then don't eat this, you understand that same foods which can be consumed together and there is an order and then there is a quantity also.  I ate so much, I felt like going everywhere, then after that these people do this as if notes are exchanged, yes also it was not so, what did you eat, what did you eat, without doing this and it was 10:00 o'clock 10  :30 I am about to go to the fair and I am unable to sit because brother it has become like this, friend, tasakiye, get out, okay, now that relationship is close, I can't run away like this, okay then any person can do it comfortably  He must be sitting and smiling, it's okay to do this and taste some half thing  You must have been eating it as well and it was not only yours that got spoilt because the person is new, what exactly you have, it was already clear to him that I want to take one piece of Daal Baati Churma, I want to take that piece, I want to take that, this thing happens in real life  Today we have so much stress in our life because we want to visit all the stalls like those wedding bosses, we want to look beautiful, we want nice clothes, our wife should be sexy, our kids should be ultra cute, our photos should be too.  We should cut flags at the Leaning Tower of Pizza or at our job there, our parents should love us, our in-laws should shower their love on us or whoever should make us proud or give us love or shower money or whatever, to whomever  Which is right to put that basically you are popular, okay brother this is that marriage buzz, you will get spoiled when you will run after all these things, you have to make your choice, I see that the youngsters or even the middle class have such attachment You will have to think like a man in marriage and in that  You have to see whether all the hot things are cold things or not, because if you want to do very well in your job, there is so much competition, it is a man's world, there are so many men in this world who are ready to sacrifice their families, now your competition  If you are with those men and you too sacrifice your family life then there is no guarantee that you will win the competition with them. They are already less in number and people with this type of behavior are more in number. So you should check yourself whether they are  I have to eat that dish which is in such a long line and if I eat that then I have a time limit in my life just like there was a limit on the stomach in the wedding buffet, in real life there is a time limit when  If you put in more effort in one thing, you cannot put in more effort in the other thing. This is the truth of life. Every person wants to do well in his job, in business, in money, in anything and his children praise him.  And you say to my child, Papa Ji, oh it's great, son, do it like this but he gets disconnected from them. So when you got success there, got something, silently reached there, then this program itself has been left, the wife has been mentally switched off, the wife spends time with her relatives, in her friend circle, in kitty parties. Your children are busy with some program and you are busy here, so in your life, eat your buffet with a very very specific taste, clearly tell your wife and children that you don't have time for dog-like people's career.  I will be able to give it to her but brother I will get it from her and we all will enjoy ourselves, then she knows that brother something will happen because there is no certainty of getting something there, you cannot even say it, it seems as if you do not even want to say that I will tell you to Ka's wife  No friend I will not give you time, I will not give you time in between this time, it like this by saying that I am not eating that, I am not eating high chart papdi, the big man is trying to eat it but I am not eating it because I have this goal  okay i am fine i want to stand in the line for pani puri I like to drink sweet water. Be very very clear about yourself and make it very clear all around yourself and tell others as well. Only then many times what happens is that by living together with clarity in life, you can enjoy life more and the formula that I follow is  yes, don't oppose it because there are many things which cannot be eaten, this and that cannot be eaten, don't do this in life and eat the rest little by little, friend and eat it slowly and eat it consciously, when I repeatedly say consciously  I am talking about food, if you are going to visit somewhere then do not go with anxiety, do not go for 3 days, go for 8 days, stay relaxed, do not go there everyday and break your body because there is a bus outside at 6:00 in the morning and you have to go out  At 10:00, you reach a place where you feel like you are in heaven, you can stay there for two hours and your tour and travel person and your group go ahead, take photos, next next next and you have to see everything and all  After seeing the place in the evening at hotel  I am broken, my body is broken, tell me friend you go, I will take a taxi and go, this is the taste I am enjoying, learn to taste it, whether it is life consciously, what is the movement and when you slow down things then  It is also a fact that you cannot eat too many things because the food slows down at the right time, so suck your pleasure, suck your food, if you are enjoying your food then brother, eat only that and be satisfied or else ask again and again How was the pasta because someone is eating puri there, someone is eating pasta, someone is eating something, everyone is eating their own food, everyone has their own hobbies but the person who is not satisfied with whatever you have, he is unhappy in his life, most of his life  I've seen people spoil their mood It's okay [music] His Christmas party doesn't go on forever Sometimes something goes well, then something else goes well, then something does n't go well All right, so keep your own system and you should know how to enjoy yourself I'll announce  I want to launch a very happy course okay till now no one has taught the happiness course those of you who  If you also want to join, you can WhatsApp me, there is a route for platinum membership and if I do another app, then you have a

be a glass of hot milk, a little turmeric, a little jaggery and wife  There is a husband with the wife, there are seven elements getting added in this, I will teach that too, if you do this and then there is the warmth of the quilt, then all the right elements are getting added in it, okay, and then you will get to hear things from that It will be a lot of fun but I have also told you the setting, now those who are married or not, it does not matter who has partners  If you are not there for any reason or you live far away, it does not matter, you can come alone also, it is fine, you
