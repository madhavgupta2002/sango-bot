Hello friends, today's topic is the same gold. This God's Mani Gold is called Goddess Mani. I will cover another thing in this and it will look a little different to the people and will also give a little belief system but you see, I will bring a contra thing and will give people a  Then later it strikes that how should one buy gold, the best way is not what you are thinking, it is just the opposite, you will get the answer, you should know that what you think might be the best and why what you think is the best is not the best  At the end of buying, whether gold is an investment or not, there is something else, we will discuss that as well because I also don't think that the financial influencer has understood it correctly, okay normally I bring this content on my channel Clarity for Youth, if you have watched this channel then  I did not subscribe to that channel, but I had to bring this one on here because I want to spread a little more awareness about it. Adar Vice is my specialty channel for all these things. Clarity for youth, there is a stock of mental models of decision making there.  Market's playlist has 12, 14, 15 videos and yours  There are 18 best videos of mental models and you will find a lot of things in them, still sometimes it gets a little scary, okay, like this you will find there the same thing as you normally would on that YouTube channel, so if there is a little difference, then start it  It is ok if you look at the basic thing then the man prints it fine and a good video will give you a surprise in the end and whether it should be done or not will also be a topic of discussion but I will tell you what is People's Mani and what is the game which is the current banking system 100  There is not much for it, fractional banking came into existence in England which said that what used to happen earlier, there used to be accounting of gold standard, we would keep this much, we would change the notes according to that, then it happened that there is no need to keep all the money, fractional banking  I will become very technical about it because it is very important to learn every thing, it is necessary every year, that's why on master channel live, the same audience is attracted there, here there is a big audience, so here it is that brother, there is a need to keep all the money to give it.  It is not fractional, meaning take ₹10  You can also play the game of 100. You know how banks play the game. So when the government started printing currency notes, then in 1970 the President then Nixon said at that time that we are going out of the gold standard.  Long ago there used to be petrol, things used to be available according to petrol as well, so the gold standard was abolished by these people, okay they abolished the gold standard and then they also banned the Americans from keeping gold, I did not even have gold  They also issued it and what happened after its issue was that inflation increased. If you must have noticed in India also, inflation had increased a lot in the late seventeens. There used to be a gold bar. Governments could not print notes on their own. What happened after that, notes were printed on printing machines.  Even till today, their system is running the same way, even today, their entire system is running the same way, print as many as you want and this system is going on which will have to be paid for the future books, but now everyone has done that like this  That is the shatrug approach, he has given the soil, is n't it all on our time  It will not burst, it will not burst I am talking about gold because of this, of late you must have seen that gold has crossed the rate of 56000 in my opinion, if there is a rise then how to approach gold, how to buy, why to buy, what are the calculations, what are the misconceptions, what is wrong  There are methods, all of which will be discussed and you should think that the quantity of gold cannot be increased suddenly, the rate at which gold is being extracted from the earth is decreasing and the cost of extracting it is increasing.  So when the cost of extracting gold from the mines increases, the amount of gold to be extracted then stops, you also have to understand this, so if you look at the gold production in the last 4-5 years, I would come and see a similar graph and  I am explaining this in points that in 7, 8, 10 years South Africa is shrinking a lot, it was a waste, it should not be taken as an investment, here I will tell you that there was a lot of discussion about investment, years ago there was a group which could buy services 500 years ago if we lived in India now then what would happen  The time would be 1523, okay it would be the time of 1523, the battle of Panipat has not happened yet, the first one is being ruled by Ibrahim Lodi, okay it happened in 1526, so take 500 years or 400 years, who would have been Jahangir in 400 years, he was in 1623, note hmm, okay he came in 165, Jahangir came in 1623, okay so during his time also one tola of gold could buy the same amount of goods today, if you look at the respect then talk about desi ghee, desi ghee must have been there for some time also  If it 's buffalo's, it's fine, you can try it, you can see anytime what the rate of ghee is, what is the rate of one tola, this thing has always beaten inflation for so many years, that means gold never loses value, now we'll talk a little  I will do something very technical, not much, you know dew is on, gold is traded in dollars, now if it is in dollars, now look at the currency, look at the game of this international dollar, if you check the rate of gold, then you will know it in dollars.  After converting it from dollar, I will get today's rate, let me take 56000, okay, but brother, if the rupee is going down against dollar, then in a way I am also getting to play the game of proxy dollar, for example, if I take  The dollar was ₹70, okay, and the rate of gold in dollar was something at that time, so even if it remained in dollar but became 7083, then I have to convert that and take that, right? You are understanding this thing, this was  This is a thing of van thing so now what is the way to buy it, let's talk about the way to buy gold, our women are the most category which seems to be our culture, everyone is told that gold should not be bought like this, how to buy it, I  I will give my advice, okay how to do it, you tell me whether you liked it or not, three to four ways of buying gold are explained, there are long videos but this is probably the only video in which this thing is explained, it is a guarantee, okay now it is your wish, you can do it  How many people have to tell all this to their friends? Okay, there is digital gold and there is something else as well.  I will tell you that it is digital gold, so this is MMTC or there are two companies, you can google them and tell them, from there you can go to their app and buy one gram of gold, now this is not SEBI regulated, now it gives you one gram of gold This item does not keep gold at all, there is no check on it, they must be keeping it but can you keep gold in it, you have to take delivery, what is the problem in this is that whenever you take gold, 3% GST is charged on you, then you get ₹100  If you buy gold then you have to pay 103 rupees and if you sell it at the same time then that gold bought for ₹ 100 will be sold for 197 this is also a rule so 6% is done thank you, remember this and you will have to take its physical delivery or sell it in this  This is the drawback, at one stage they have time, either they will say and physically deliveryless gold or you sell it, now it also costs capital to sell it, if you do not want to sell it, then there is one thing in it and it is not SEBI regulated etc., so that is why  It's not very popular but Han would take some  There is a possibility but it is less popular. The second thing comes for which you need a demat account and different companies have opened gold accounts in it along with the rate of gold and against them you buy gold back from the company.  It is also regulated, you can buy even one unit in it, there are different rates of it, 4:30 hundred, all have different systems and it is linked to the rate of gold, it costs you money in this, okay, but if you trade it, then it  If you trade on a platform, then its fees are charged, its brokerage is also charged, if you buy on any platform, then those expenses are incurred and it is called back by date cold, so people consider it quite popular, then I will also tell you what my opinion is Ok and then there comes the Gold Mutual Fund, Gold Mutual Fund is also almost the same but you don't need a demat account in it because it is a mutual fund, like to buy a mutual fund, you can buy a mutual fund through demat account also, you know ok but come buy the app  For this it is necessary to have demat but for having gold mutual fund you can not have it, okay and you can also buy this, this is also a matter of SEBI etc, it is a good thing, okay and many people think it is popular and do it.  Okay and then those who become very shindy say that we know the best, we already know because I will also tell you which one is the best according to me, okay because it is very important for people to open their eyes a little by getting this kind of information. Because many people have closed it, okay, the most popular one would say brother, you get 2.5%, there is a locking for 8 years, you buy it and you don't have to pay any tax on it in 8 years, it looks very good on the ball, okay, so this  It is very correct, you do n't even have to pay tax, you have to keep it for 8 years and I am getting 2.5 percent on it, although 2.5 percent is taxable, so if you are in 30% slap then you are getting only 1.6%, you should also remember this, 2.5 percent is taxable, okay and You can exit in 5 years also You can exit in 5 years and though it is for 8 years, you can exit in 5 years also and if you have bought it in demat then you can exit it even earlier, it will be written in it  Some code will be like this sgpv 28, which means it is maturing in 28, friend, the one which you bought for 20, you will get 23, then there are 30 different codes, you can send that first, but then you will have to pay capital generation tax on it, okay, you should send that first  And what happens many times is that if you suddenly place an order, many people place an order by mistake, now look, these are things that take advantage of someone, but if someone is fooling you, then if you don't take advantage, then someone else will. Many people send it to the market whereas it should be sold at the limit and if you talk about the rate of gold, then if you sit every morning and see that there is very little trading, there is very little information, as soon as you wake up in the morning, you invest ₹300, meaning 5-7% less.  took it you said it I will buy it at 4700 and if some brother knows the rate, his rate is ₹5000, then he should have invested at ₹5000, at 4990 less or at the current rate and he has marketed it, then if any brother in the market will find this thing  Many people do this too, I have a lot of information about it, it is okay, there is nothing wrong in it, it is a bit good, this is the same thing which does not happen in your normal shares because in normal shares the trading volume is so high, now the share of Reliance is less than that of HDFC, TCS and their cities.  No, the rate of TCS is going to be 3400 and you bought it for ₹ 3200, no brother, it is going for 3400, so there are people willing to buy it for ₹ 2 ₹ 1.5 less, so if you hit the market there, there is no loss and  People's habit of keeping stocks often goes wrong here because there are very few buyers here and very little training, so this was an insider's matter. Okay, now that we have discussed all this, then which one of these  It is the best because everyone opposes buying physical gold, it is stupid, it is stupid, I want to tell something, it has become a long video but now those who are connected will take it away, it is the government of banking, I want to invest my money in gold before the apocalypse.  There will be a catastrophe, you define it, what is it, the catastrophe will be less, it is less in every country, you know Zimbabwe, you know Pakistan, what is happening in Sri Lanka, where, whether Pakistan is somewhere else, I don't know, it takes insurance in its hand  It is taken because if someone dies or an accident happens then the family's money is reduced. Does anyone want to die? No one goes. Does the family want me to get it? No, even the family doesn't want it, but still it is taken.  So this is the thing in Sovereign Gold Bond, the inherent risk of gold is of the sovereign only, if you understand this thing carefully, this is the equity market, my money is invested in it, this bank has money lying in my savings account and  If you read my HD then I have exposure to trust for sovereign, isn't it brother one  Sovereign, nothing will sink, economy, country, money, rupee, dollar, the universe, nothing will sink, so I have already played this, now I want to play this game here as well, then I do not have anything of my own, you should understand my words carefully. Do not consider this as an investment, first of all, what should be the investment, what is the investment, when everything is done then it is the real thing about the investment, what is in hand, there are making charges, these are the benefits, 17%, these 20%, all this is shown by the chart here actually.  It was 9% but got 2.5% so the return is 11% in the last 6 years here it is 7% in ATF there is this much and here you have paid the making charges like this, paid that, if you buy gold coin then the gold coin is so expensive  He gives only, this is it, yes, yes, listen to me because whatever everyone says, they come and repeat the same thing, then why should I come and call myself a hero, hero Hiralal's, listen to me, I am very knowledgeable, okay, so a little  Let's talk about practical matters. Okay, first you must understand that basically there is nothing against Sovereign Gold Bond. It is a paper note. I say yes, I give you the right to it. When that right is lost, you can ask in Zimbabwe what happens in Pakistan.  Look at Infinity, what happened in Sri Lanka, and this is a 100- year-old banking system, the way notes are being printed, the government does not know which People's Mani will be in future, I will tell you that too, so you have to stay connected, right now we will tell you a little about it.  This should be there, everything else is already invested, my stock market, demat, my mutual fund, my HD HD savings in the bank, brother, keep physical gold as well, this is not efficient, well tell me one thing, if you want to buy some gold coin, use your brain by paying money.  If you find any making charges then some relative, friend or acquaintance of yours says that GST is applicable, 10% is applicable and when you go to sell it then it gets sold at the rate of gold, okay so the person who wants to buy it sends it to you  who will he send back  He sends it to the goldsmith, how does he send it, why can't you buy it, it seems like a hobby, there is a little more thought process, why can't you tell this to all your circle that I am a gold collector, just like there are coin collectors, there are paintings, brother, give it to me, whoever you want to give it to Make a website, do whatever you want to do, you don't want to buy from it, wherever there are making charges, don't buy it, hey, demat charges are being levied everywhere, expensory charges are being levied everywhere, even the mutual fund people are deducting them everywhere Two-three, four-five-six questions are being cut, okay, it is from everywhere and I don't know whether when you took the mutual fund, you kept gold or not, SEBI is there, the scandal happened, they said in a minute that it is a scam.  Brother, it should be in my hand, otherwise there are security risks involved, you keep your car everywhere, it is parked outside your house, there is a risk of theft in that too, you carry your phone, it opens like this, this is also a risk, you  Look at this, listen carefully to those who text in India  In 20-203, today as per law and order, are we the best in the last 1000 years historically or not. You tell me, when all the kings, Maharajas, Emperors, Sultans and I don't know what other emperors came, their coins were in circulation but this also  Let me keep telling you because it happens with coins as well, thank you, the sultanate went away, so who was that person who was making leather coins, he was also doing it, take the leather coin then use it, okay brother if it works then it is gold only, gold is gold  So it will remain on the earth even after thousand years, whatever has gone out, it has gone out and if it does not go out then it will be regulated, brother, but to that extent, if your physical gold will be stolen from you, then your ATM card can also be stolen from you, your ATM PIN can also be stolen from you  It will take your Jamtara too, so why don't you open the account on the phone sir, I have come to give you the OTP, I have received an award, this happens every day, all the Jamtara people get dirty, you know this, this cannot be a reason, friend, take mine.  In this way, he will take away your house as well as other things and everything.  To know what are the limitations of gold and how they are, I am giving a link of infobe winner, explaining how it should be done, how is the practical, I will give you the link, you can join it, there is a limit to keep gold at home, without any thing for women  That this slip is nothing, married woman and I think married male, I think you should check it, this is the limit for everyone, rest whoever you buy from, buy it properly, friend, give him another account, give him the cheque and keep complete account, I took it from this  And if he has the original receipt, it is called receipt but while speaking many people correct my English, okay my English is good but when I say receipt then did you understand that it should be called receipt or not, then understand  I came here, then what is the reason for this discussion, I understood what to say, okay, receipt, receipt, if you want to say anything then I also know the receipt, so listen, whatever gold medal has been given to you from here, whoever has its original,  hold on its value is very high  And these coins which come in the field, they are field bound, it is written on them that 916 etc., the rest of the people will put it in the brother and this is that purity, oh all of them are bill bills, there is 916 written on them, there is a lot of hole mark.  If it is happening there then go and check your machine friend, go there and check the team, ba gold collector, gold collector should be found somewhere, you use your mind that friend, the person who wants to buy gold coin for investment or if there is a need sometime or by doing something like this or  For gifting any thing, he can also sell it sometimes, not that suppose someone gives you a 10 gram gold coin as a gift, it is okay and he gave that gift, like nowadays if you buy a house, the builder gives you some  Someone gave it to you, you gave it to him, you went and sold it, you never went and sold it, you sold it to someone, someone is selling those gold coins, it is not as if they are not circulating once these are printed in a minute You went to the shop, paid the making charges and now all these people took it  If they have taken it, they go and give it to someone, it's not like they are sitting locked under the bed, so now I am saying that instead of taking it from them and doing something like this for 10-15%, then why did you give them enough money, you should use your system  I want to buy gold every day 2 kg, 1 kg, 3 kg, 4 kg, 5 kg, it is not like that, whatever is the provision for it in the legal system, rest of the information you people should also write properly, you tell him brother I bought so much gold from him on such and such date  I have bought this one at this rate, if I sell it then its capital gain will be this much, next time you do not have to sell it because you do not have to see what is the current rate of gold, the gold collector sees how many grams my 30 grams are  It has become 50 grams, 100 grams, 500 grams, 600 grams, 700 grams because the value of that 700 grams is becoming anything, either by playing the game of printing gold, push the vote bank politics forward, all the governments, all the central banks are registering these.  are doing and all  We are managing it, whenever there is a crisis, it falls on the next generation, I am saying that everything is the same, there is a digital lock chain, what is its system, no one controls it, everyone accepts it, if  If he wants then someday he can become one of the bitcoiners too. Look, I am getting excited about these 50 other types of coins that will come. I am talking about bitcoin. Survive with this, take the photo at 12:30 I think it's okay, but I  I am not promoting it, I am not telling you anything about myself, I am not telling you to buy it from here, buy it from there, it is there, I will benefit from it, I am not telling you like that, I am just telling you one thing in your mind, you have to give it water.  What comes out, what happens, you should research this friend, tell me this thing, I do n't know what is happening to whose economy, Ukraine, no one had thought that this oil would go away like this, now they are moving towards electricity, so is this petrol  People will sell their petrol at this price, what will happen to them, we do n't know exactly, economists are so knowledgeable  No one can predict anything, everyone has declared astrologers as idiots, it is alright that some of these things are beyond the prediction of astrologers, anyway I do n't know if someone says anything, it is alright, what do they say about money, there is no energy  Nothing happens, what effect will it have on it, that is fine, but economics is very successful and the same thing, 100 economics people are saying 100 things, both of which will come true, this also happens in the game of prediction, this is fine  So, nobody knows much about this, but I want to say that if you are buying gold, then brother, while giving it physically, I will tell you a little bit about astrology as well, Jupiter is here, it is Guru element.  It's okay, wearing a little bit is not harmful, it's okay, you have worn a ring, you have worn something small, I am not doing this, instead of the goat and the edge, I should not be like our dear Bakhti Lahri ji, I too would like to tell everyone if he has worn any  It is okay to wear too much gold, but only in moderation  You can do a lot, within the family, there is a daughter's wedding, Bhau, this is happening, this has been happening, and we always do something, it is fine, Tridan says, there is no tax on that too, it also has its own implications, tax  That we will have to get a little more information about this, it becomes a very long video if we cover all the things, all the acts, everything, but there is one thing I have told you, keep it physical, don't panic, don't panic, okay, what is that thing, every  There could be a factor of the thing, okay you have done it for 50 lakhs, even Rs.50 lakhs can be stolen and if it can be insured in theft, then this can also be insured, you have the slip, you have the gold, you have the proof  Its valuation has been done and shown, you can get it insured, you can keep it inside a locker also, you keep it in bank lockers, there is provision there also, there is provision for everything, there is provision for all these things because many people take one aspect of it and mislead people  Dara gives me oh my god this will take it away if it takes it away brother everything will go away one day anyway something will go away  It is possible, okay, so it is a matter of diversifying it, according to me, 5 to 10% exposure of the total network portfolio can be taken, I do not do it because I have uploaded a good video of the portfolio on the Clarity channel, you can go and watch that as well  Thank you
