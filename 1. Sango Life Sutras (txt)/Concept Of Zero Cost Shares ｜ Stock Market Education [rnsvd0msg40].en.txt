Hello friends, there is turmoil in the share market, I am feeling nervous for some weekends, I have brought an opportunity for you all in this video course series to give peace to the mind, there is a mental model to give peace, zero questions, so what are zero questions? You can approach this concept in the following way: Have you ever bought a share late? I got it late for Rs 1 lakh and he got it for Rs 1.5 lakh, he got it for Rs 2 lakh. Okay, you are ahead in profit. If you sell the shares of your initial capital and go out, the lion's share of the profit will remain but your cost will be 0.2%. This is a very easy concept of zero cost affair. Now why is this concept necessary in this? Its revision one is this.  That in practice an average inverter can extract power from the maximum, you are not talking about a normal gift full time investor, he is doing it from morning to evening.  He may be able to press forty-fifty but even a normal Musaddilal office person can press 25. So many times what happens is that we buy such a share that we make profit in it and then we book that entire profit.  And then you buy some other share and that share also goes to puberty, then in order to do mental accounting, we come to know how much is the profit because all the time we are investing, buying, it is increasing and putting money in.  If you are buying the seeds with money and if you sell the shares which have increased and buy something with that money, then this is a great way for the retail investor. There are two or three conditions in this that the company should be in good condition and its Gurjars are in good condition.  You are also keeping the shares because if the model itself is bad and it is your profit, say â‚¹ 100 will go to the web radio and the company's investment will be in the middle, hence its team, then adopt honey, but like I have done in some cases, it is fine and  Who  Also in this video, I will take the names of the remaining people, this is for educational purpose and not meant for advice and something like Hindustan Sugar Company, their blouse was selling some hair worth four rupees and at that time the sugar cycle was now on cycle. Go and do media research etc. then it was known that if the market is in a bullish market then it is okay to buy like shares, if four news items had like shares, then something worth Rs 4.25 lakh has been written, which will increase by Rs 10.  1115 Till 20 Visheshgya Abhishad I do n't know, 15 16 is going on since that match, my initial amount was Rs. 4.25 lakhs at the time of that match, I took out what was left, tell me who is my hero, then when those zero cost people are moving in the market.  If we fall then some fatigue is reduced. Another way is to take it at zero cost. New Delhi. Now I have many shares which have been giving dividend for many years like this for 12 years, 15 years.  I got as many shares as I had bought, that is, if I had bought shares in shoes, it is like the example of NHPC from late. Okay people, then you see how much dominant has I got in 12-13 years, so I did not sit down and calculate it, but I have so much noise that as many as  If you have got the details of the city in which you bought the city and more than that, then in that way also your zero can be considered as shares.

Sometimes he runs and it becomes 250. You know he plays between 220 to 6065. Okay, but look ahead to him because my purchase is very high.  If the earlier rate is very low then come then 19 Look Forward to the Great Dividend Switch I Keep Getting Not Another Share Series in the World and this is fine NMDC also has such a plant where different types are available in large numbers and  The share definitely runs towards the court, if you have given it a lot to the company which was very fond of Holi for many years, that school India don't no brainer, the vote of the Ukrainian class brother will get it, then if there is a problem, then your  So one is Coal India, so if at that time the people who have won many, many situations, are Nobel winners, at that time, it means there is no need to use much brain, it will not be explained further, I am making an edition video of this as examples.

Bar List Video Dividend Yield is ok so you are getting Dividend Lakshmi so in some more DVDs if you want to play games then also invest in infrastructure bonds Power Grid is also doing well that is also good ok then I had bought a share and told that it is better to buy it than buying a commercial property because it invests money in ready to move in and not under construction. 50% of the money is the amount of money earned, is it listener rent, is it to give acid, then you can do research on that too, there are three, okay, this is from Brick Field - the third is from, write in the comment section, which one is okay?
