Hello friends, today we will discuss a study and see what learnings can be made from it. This is a study of a real estate sector. This is the study of a young man working in a multinational company. His age is around 30 years and his wife is also working. His budget is 1.2 cr to buy a premium good multistory apartment which is under construction where he takes a payment plan of 4 years and his plan to buy it further is also 1.2 cr related to the unit this is very happy and I want to go  Ahead but of course in India, our friends are also asked, their parents are from a town in Haryana, you can take them like this, you can take them from Bhiwani, Hisar, Rohtak, they are from a town, now if they were asked, then father would say  He said, brother why don't you do one useless thing, you are taking 1.2 crore rupees so do it this way, I will give you 30 lakh rupees, you can take the plot, there is profit in the plate, now the diet portion is the same, if you do n't get any plot in 1.5 crore rupees then yourself  the living of For a person where he can live comfortably, who lives in a two tier AC because his wife is working in a multi-national, then for him it will take 50 years to come here and if Nifty plot or President plot is not available then that would be told now.  If it is not possible to get 1.5 lakhs, then now father is told that father is a subscriber, brother is a friend, so some relative or the other says that I will invest the money, we will buy a plot, I will take my share of 50, 60, 70 lakhs and then We will make 22 crores on that, we will buy one and send one on rent, meaning all the hobbies will be fulfilled, meaning the desire of not living together will also be fulfilled, but I don't, we will also become a builder by constructing floors, meaning everything will be done now  The biggest problem in studying this is that when it comes to the mission, our brother works in a multinational company, he has 1.2% share in it, if he doesn't have 1.2% share in this story, he will be jointly asked to invest it in four years, he has to leave this much money  Slowly, the down payment that he had to make started to fall.  20 - 25 lakhs, in that too the father had deposited 10 - 12 lakhs in his account, the 25 lakhs that father had offered, the son had already taken that, he is sitting with 10 - 12 lakhs with himself, only the second plot  Go and buy it, whatever price you get, you know at what rate the registry will be done, at what cents will the registry be, at what price the loan will be given and when you take a property on loan, you cannot comment to a relative, otherwise the plan will not be united.  We have to learn this I have a lot of discussion on that plant, was this plan good or not, if the plan was good then it can be said to be good only when we can unite, if the uncle is with the nephew or the father's front is with the nephew and then that  How to get a loan on piece of land, loan is not available, money cannot be given to anyone without name, you also know this, quote this cannot be executed but it is not understood even after explaining, so an option came in it that was the plan of 20125 or your 2030  had any such plan that plant was exempted that unit was exempted interest was exempted  When I went, I came as a humble person and I was able to take my practicality because you were looking for a house and a home for your quality of life, this couple was newly married, they were newly married, so it will take some more time for the child to be born  Even if it takes four-five years for the child to be four-five years old, till then his position would have been in a very good environment, he would have been able to learn cycling, he would have been able to learn swimming, his grandparents would have taken him for walks, the quality of life which could have been there because  These couples have to remain busy in their jobs, physically who will build the house, these people think on their own, from its study this is a lu plan that who will build the house, today in the construction of the house you have to understand everyone like plumber, carpenter, painter, electrician, tiler, false ceiling, so many things  The person who does the POP work, the one who binds the rods, the contractor who brings sleep, the one who takes the crush, the one standing there to increase the head of all of them, is not just any man and if you do all this thing like a brother confectioner, like you prepare it and we  If they come to party then all the money will be spent on that Whatever model of business you have, that person will earn money and you will not be left with anything. So, there is a saving of 300 to 400 square feet in building the house yourself and the same builder will take only â‚¹ 200-300 more from you and solve the savings of 708. Kot Jha takes it and will bring the goods from Chawri Bazaar, whatever will be his supply chain, his margins will come out much better, so he will also say that he will make a profit of 200-300 rupees more, you could have saved Rs 300 of yours by standing at the end, what is the problem that if you  If you unite then your project will be completed with a delay of seven to eight months compared to all the persons from whom you are getting the construction done because he has all the ad fixed plumber, carpenter but if the department has hired any contractor on labour rate saying that I will build this house then  I will give it on contract to the Amber one, I will give it to him, it is a big problem to manage all the flavours with force, these are tips, people say this, I have heard this, you can write in the comment section.  Brother, in 2 years of building a house, the age will be five years less. This is a common saying that the stress of dealing with every body hugging me is not in this much, that in this much, look at this much, while making multi next multistory apartment, you keep roaming around, from here loan your soul  It doesn't happen every day that such notes are going around, it seems it is okay there but in making it yourself, then in making it yourself, decision-making that when we are going to lay the tiles then a good white would be liked while doing everything  The rate goes above a limit, there may not even be any need for that wood, I had said that I will bring it, okay brother, then I will polish it, I will get the graph done, I will get the locks done, when the structure of the house is built,  Sugar also has to be made strong, after that it becomes so high and pricey that then a person takes salvation also, takes improvement from relatives, takes it from them also, then what kind of thing brother, the house had to be built only once, now such houses which are built  If these ever have to be sold, the soul would feel pained because the market which will value them again will be called the market of the market.  It will be done according to the wood, you keep saying something about yourself because the lamp is on the wall, no one can find out what has been put inside, once the marks are put or the review is done, no one can tell, I click on it, I don't know what is mixed inside it, okay  If it is there to achieve this, then the old generation also has the courage to stand up for their children and build four floors, it is most welcome, there is money, there is cash element, if there is passion, then brother it is fine, it is not taken out from the end.  I will take it but I have to keep the practical thing just somewhere you are a father your father is not doing it just for himself that whatever thing he was taking your child now if he does not take that thing then he will take XUV500 he will take this Fortuner right here  But it will be started because he was jumping on the money, now he thought of taking a multi-storey building but you did not let him take it, thinking that there will be no profit in it, there will be no profit in it, he is not even discussing it, if he had taken it then both husband and wife would have  The money starts roaming around in the world after a new marriage  The couple takes a joint loan and buys a house, this is also a fact, the marriage also happens like this, joint loan, joint property, if a new marriage is taken then the marriage also happens like this, even the wife does not say this, in 6 months this is heart- wrenching  Please get me the diya because you know that the man is getting ready, five installments will be given by me, I will save two big installments from my salary and give the rest as loan, I will take 50-60 per cent draw because the income tax benefit will be taken accordingly, it will be taken like this  So don't stop your kid, if your child is 30 years old or in his 30s, then when you have to earn a lot of money, then to get 10-12 lakhs from your father, do n't tell him that you are the producer of the movie, who would be the hero, who would be the heroine, or that you are the producer.  15 lakhs should be taken from father and 10-15 lakhs should be taken from beauty also. This is the advice from this case study. 10 Even if you take property worth 130 to 140 from 1 crore  You are openly asking for money from your father-in-law, salvation from the officials, it does not mean that I will take it and say that I will return it, then there will be opposition in four-five years, I will give it and after that you will see who are you asking for it, it is okay to say thank you But take the thing, it is okay if taking something is better than not taking it, you will keep comparing these two, specially those who are coming from center line, Hisar, Bhiwani, Rohtak, their inclination is also towards that side whereas the capability of not releasing the ticket price of these people is that which  If there is a young couple, they will be in a tight spot by taking more loans because when the lady goes into the family and gets pregnant, they may have to take a break from their job. I am seeing many kids getting into such plots because of the advice of their parents. It is not getting completed, it is not getting made somehow and then there is no one to make it, those leaves and only deep or, this was a new item of mine, by giving examples in this way, real life situations, if you  If you understand some of this tech web then please  You should write in the comment section, like and share the channel and I will start requesting you a little, I have not done this for a long time to increase the subscriber base, between you are not friend circle because if the subscriber base increases a little more then I will add more new things  things and better things for you guys but I will take that thank you
