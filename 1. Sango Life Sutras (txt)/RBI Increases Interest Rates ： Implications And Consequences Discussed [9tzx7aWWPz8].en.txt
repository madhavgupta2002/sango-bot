Hello friends, RBI has increased the interest rates. I think the loan interest will go up to 1.5, so by increasing the basis points, it had reached 1627, if you could set it at 40, it could be 51 or even more, so we will discuss that in real estate  What difference will it make to other things? Let's put it in perspective. Let's talk a little about maths. If the total increase is even 1% due to the delay, then first we have to see that if we take a loan for 15 years, then what if it increases by 1%? It will not be limited to 15 years or it will increase a little more in the coming time, it will decrease further and go down and why is it big, it is big because there is an impression, why is there inflation, one of the month is one reason in it  Due to the Ukraine Eurasia crisis, there will be a surge in the oil prices on the logistics channel, all these regions are known to you, this was the case throughout the year, inflation will remain the same, Yog Re Russia war will end in a month, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, whatever happens, this is it  It will be arranged in 4 6 7 minutes something will happen with the account continue for oo ever ok so one should happen next service is inflation this year because whatever percentage of the question is calculated it is done on the rates of the previous month which  That there is talk of items, okay, so next year, if there are some more political scandals, God willing, and the infections reduce, then next year we will most likely to go to the levels from which he is and the appointment of others, okay, if one percent interest  If the rate increases then for 10 years it will be 10 per cent. So if I had not taken all my property on loan, 80 per cent of us, 70 per cent fans, would not have taken it, but in that calculation of women sale, you have made all your property worth one crore.  If you have property, I don't know if you will get it on loan, but in UIE, you will have to pay 10% more, the property will become expensive in 10 years, in the March quarter of this year, the average property rates have increased in Delhi-NCR, so  13 inches includes Delhi as well as Noida, Comba, Ghaziabad, Gurgaon and if it grows, you will see that we are growing 12% in a quarter, so this 10 per cent and the significance of 10 shares will be so humiliating that decision will be made. A plus when this cost of funds increases then the customer's borrowings increase only for the developers because they also take loans, some take loans by selling their equity, some take loans, you all know, so if their cost of funds increases then the end  The product will also increase, you have to see this thing as well, so according to me it will not make any difference in the next six months in shot colour, if it has increased to 7.45 only, if you round off 1.5 from now then you will get 7 and a half also for history.  The interest rate is very low, even 7.5 interest rate is not much, I expect further increase of 3.4 point in it, current speed is not going to increase in property market right now, people are not going to get any negative effect from bank property, so right now there is no negative effect seen on this sentiment  This verse and  You can make some headline news and share this notification, he has to take it home, he has to take it and he is seeing that friend it has increased by 5% in A quarter, so it has increased at a faster rate in A quarter i.e. 3 months, you know what now  The rates are going to increase. They will be very low in the months of July, August and September. There is the rainy season in the market, after that it will happen in October-November. The liner prices and their trends start increasing. It is right to tell you what will happen.  Subscribe a lot, okay brother, Deendayal's floor 1.4 1.5 to 13 liquor shops are increasing like this, so when the rate of Swift increases, will the design be saved, will the legislature also increase, the university's rate will also increase, then he should launch an app to remove Domino's, Binda Market B  Be careful and BDO should also stop and watch, what can the rates be, it is endlessly half percent, what would be the product, people would regret, reduce circle rate, increase circle rate, in this portal there is not even one percent difference in the cost of property and take good news  I have so much power  Isn't it true that there is more weightage given to the difference because nobody does the calculation sitting down. For example, if the registration rate in hair increases to -21 per cent, then it will be something very great, meaning, in those cases, one crore rupees will be given to the person who pays Rs. 6 lakhs.  Now if you were to give me 5 lakhs, then that 1 lakh would be such a big thing that if it did not sell, a lot of properties would start appearing on it or if it was increased by one percent, then a lot of sales would stop because of one percent situation  The rate of has increased, it is as much as it is, if you put things in perspective, the rates of plots have increased by hundred percent in two-three years, so how will you analyse them from the mine, so 50,000 road got jammed, the last one became 1.78 something Okay, look at the valve in section 6 pro 11 and go down, then see the plan to make there, how much will you give, then where in it the registry rate is increasing, decreasing, interest rate is increasing, it has nothing to do with the incident and a lot of money is in the market Slotting in  The interest rate has nothing to do with this and the second thing you have to do is one more second after thinking that what is happening in your real interest rate which I will tell you, if my interest rate is 7.5% and inflation is at the center, then Yasmin said Even if there is no central interested scenario and if someone is getting it then he is getting the benefit of points even today this is so basic you guys understand real estate if you and I am 6 - 2% late you know that I am really interested  If we talk about what to do when there is a loan in school, can parents take their child along? You can see that the child can take more interest and if you are sitting with money in a family group, then whatever is going on in the market  Now people are getting excited, who are investors of the stock, who are long term investors, who are educated investors, who work very hard and have an idea about everything, in which I have seen 24 cycles, I have not seen the 90 one, I have not seen the 2000 one, I have seen the 2008 one, in practice I have seen the 2008 one.  it is from 2016 Look at demonetization, the shock in the middle has been seen, the March necklace, these people should take a look at it and the old ones should also take a look at it, they are individual people, they will take advantage and the rest of the people are going to look for it on one side, so there is peace in the off market.  will suffer loss and there are many people, these are many Abhimanyus who entered this Chakravyuh, who have opened demat accounts, 500 crore people have opened them since then because they had to pass their time sitting at home, now those are the weekends and that  The money will come out, I see it going into real estate, the rest are asset class responses, I don't think people will invest in crypto, there is so much interest, the stock market is connected, it will go into real estate, according to me it is fine, while Nifty  I will not go and if he does not get the money in this talk, then he will be ruined, the hotspot turn will say friend, I will buy everything, okay hey friend, if I get something like this, then this is the reading in June  Forward interest rates are not getting any better  Hive sentiment breaker and will increase even more abs telling about this last three four alligator will watch my video that this has to be filled but inflation will come down automatically next year due to high base effect in inflation you have to see that today you have an alternative Where have the sources been done, if today a person is investing in it, then there he is getting less money from the impression, there is less pressure from inflation in HD, the loan that he is getting is also less than the question, so if from the net  Dimple you have the capacity of 100 crores, for example just and arguments that if you are getting loan at 7.5% and there is no inflation at 8 %, then you have the direct benefit of 0.5% that the value of money is developing that much because if next year I will have to pay you Rs 100 crore, I have taken a loan of Rs 100 crore for 7.5 percent, you do something from somewhere, you give your money, you take decisions on that, then the loan that you have to pay, sometimes Rs 110 crore  You don't have to pay crores, so its value is going down, the government is printing notes everywhere, the quantity is also decreasing, the Singh system that is in place is very little but it happens, but you are understanding this thing so much, I believe this  There is inflation and to reduce this inflation, it has been increased, so the liquidity on this account but the alternative choices of the people have reduced a lot.
