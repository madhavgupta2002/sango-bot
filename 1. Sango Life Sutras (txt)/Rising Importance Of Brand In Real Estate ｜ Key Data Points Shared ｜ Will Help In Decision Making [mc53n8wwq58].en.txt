Hello friends, on the topic rising importance of brand in real estate, many questions come up, which one to buy, how to buy, I am giving you the clarity on the same in this video, it will be very easy for you decision-making in different parts of India  If you look at the sector, a lot of consolidation is happening. If you look at the airlines sector, the number and line that were there 10-15 years ago have now become smaller and the leader in that is Indigo and the rest are three-four airlines. That's all. If you look at the telecom sector,  So see how many players were there 10-15 years back, now there will be one Reliance Jio and one Airtel, you know what is happening in Vodafone, so during the time there used to be multiple plays, after that look at tech education, I mean this Baaj ji which is coming  Yes, they have taken everything, Akash Teliya, now everything, if anyone wants to study something like this, then they have the platform of do only, so consolidation is happening very big, same thing displaying shooting, real estate, look at the share market things also in this. People are getting to know about this, so I am a figure  I will tell you that in this fort of real estate, one will have to take the help of paper which is not in the data, Karan Singh has taken it out so that he does not get involved in saying some numbers, so I am telling you, you should listen to this carefully, these are the top seven cities out of 517.  Those who forget the metros of India, the top seven cities had 2.03 lakh unit certificates, all kinds of growth take place in it, you know what all things are sold in real estate, the top 7 cities in residential which have the on-list players, the top 8 mystery players  His share was 6%, there were 2.03 lakh units in SMT, Vicky was at least a player in this, his city was well listed on the remaining 50%, Godrej, DLF, Shobha are listed in the stock market like this and the top leading unlimited were also thankfully his name  If the share was eleven percent then how can it be a leading shareholder, like the rapper share of Signature Low Building is not listed on the market, for example, Gurgaon's M3M is not listed but it is a leading player, so its share  It was 11 percent and the remaining 83 percent were cities. If I am talking about the top cities of the unorganized market because maximum growth of real estate is witnessed here, the story of Amazon, the story of migration, all this has been the Play Store, so here the builder floor  It was a work because this three percent is unorganized that I built my four floors and sell it to you so this was the story of fs17 fast-forward for graphite 2fa goodbye to Zor the year from 1 April 2016 to 31 March 2019 the total in the year  The total units sold are 1.5 lakh 800 thousand, out of which the share of top one listed has increased to 8 percent which was 6% and now it has increased to 22%, the share of top 8 listed has increased to 22 percent and the leading unlimited which was at 11 percent earlier  He also moved ahead on 18 per cent and hey organized players are on ST 36 this train is out going Forward will list a lot of consolidation attacks in this and the under-19 will come down rapidly. Look at the government's portion, it is allowing illegal colonies to be built. A lot of things are being demolished. Extra has not been built but Pluto Great has grown a lot. So make directions as to which direction people will go.  If you are denying, then there will be takeaways from this, you have to stay connected till the end of the video, so what is there for you guys, listen carefully, decision makers are saying that you have heard this story, now this trend has started and it will increase further  It will go away, okay, so you have to buy a branded one, but to buy this branded one, you first have to ask yourself the question, am I the brand? Are you buying any property, am I the brand? First of all, you will buy it for yourself now and what has happened with this, I am the brand. Listen carefully to which brand, now again you are a government employee, you are going to retire in the year, your wife never had a job, you are folding this in the first category, then you do not have a brand because now you have to pay the famous maintenance  You have to put in effort to make a living by playing your edifice, maybe  Is there any pension if it was a government company and if it was a non-government company then your hand toe can be destroyed because you may have to live till 1948 and if you keep doing some work then in such cases do not get involved in expensive places, posts and brands  Read your pull Chutku builder, take the floor and please live according to your maintenance, sit on the balcony and see the Kabaddi players coming from outside, this is too much, keep stopping them, okay keep passing your time, old age will keep doing this to someone  To tell you here this, I want to do my own work, it is absolutely perfect and I do not have to deal with the government, I am saying this with full confidence, okay, if you will not be able to take it, then do not ask the builders because it will cost you Rs. with internet  It is going to Rs 4000, in 20 years it will reach Rs 25000 and in 30 years it will reach even more, you don't know, so don't people, I have made the answer clear, if you yourself are not a brand and you are dealing with it, you don't have to do anything, but now the question arises  Seconds  Category: If you are a friend, if you are a chartered accountant, if you are a lawyer, if you are a doctor, if you are an event teacher, if you are a brand, if you have a service, then you should be a space in place where you can sell your services  It is not necessary that you have to go to a shop or an office or do a job because inside the society you get readymade complete sets and if you live in a good branded society, the entry is good which does not cry, then typing is done by paying three and a half, four or five rupees depending and  Their status, those people will also pay for your service, you should not stay in the neighbourhood of a person who does not pay â‚¹40 for garbage because you will also become like that and you will also not get any benefit from it, tomorrow there will be work from home and another  There is a brand system which will be an individual brand that so and so Sharmaji's son knows how to make a very good website so he is getting the contract of the website from within the society, his so and so's wife knows how to cook very well so how  Cooking classes are being taught to your builders and  I will not be taught that go to that house number plot number one four people live there it is not like this system you will get a readymade talent pool and you will get an opportunity to give readymade service because in the rest of the series I am running about job opportunities for remedies  Which I am running and ladies will earn money from it, from where will they do it, they will pick it up and go to eat, I did not do any work for 20-30 years, if you feel like doing something in 50 years then you will do it in your images at 100, 200, 300, 500, 600 meters, then this  Expect no one is judging before buying every person wants to go to some garbage society garbage place because there 3BHK is available, slightly bigger, bigger, smaller is available in this online the mind is if you throw away all your stuff and buy a brand new model  Take the girl as per your requirement and make your limit minimalistic. You can save 40 to 60 lakh rupees in property. 2200 shoes or clean clothes cost so much that they have become tight for us.  If the pack inspector is there then paste the brand, even if the office is far away then also you have purchased the brand, the office will change, job will change, many things will change but I have not said anything, if the office is in one area, that office can also be shifted to another green chilli area. And it is not necessary that you take up the thing immediately, it will be made in four-five years, you will get it in three-four-five years by then many things will change and you may not stay there even then, your thing is going to last a hundred-one hundred and twenty decisions  Wherever you like the open space, you are enjoying it, take it on rent because after sixteen years, after the 65th, things cannot be given on rent, for that I will make a video on Kabir Quote from and have you ever seen when you go to the present etc.  Yes, you go to very rich places where you feel very spicy, a certain man comes and ladies go, have you ever asked them what do they do today, are all the businessmen, are they all running factories, I am not of doom networking today  It is not limited to just real estate, I have given this slogan to the liquor networking through WhatsApp Go and see the groups who live in these and other societies, now I am not saying that you and Alia should go to Mongolia 1820, there is not that much budget for that but whatever your budget is, buy good brands in this budget because at least that  If good people come to you, if your status is 19, then do not cry for 19 or 20 or 19-50, but get a good brand between 19, this painting looks good there, some Gujarati bandhani saree looks good from somewhere upwards.  And he is sending suits to Ajabpur, it is taking time for Live India, there is a lot of time to earn money, but a lower middle class, ninth class is just told to do bar, pass competitive exam, do this, there are many women who are rich in the family  Zakir by doing all this, in jail making more money and also stays relaxed and all Venus like Gautam says winner Venus best Venus keep doing good work, the main work is clean, air conditioned and rich place and people are becoming rich and then they start talking to each other  to whom  I don't know the syllabus, which I have released a little bit today for the first time for you people to open their eyes, those who don't know the celebs, don't know what it is, they think that they have to go to some RAW, they will get Rs 40,000 there, then I will give two tuitions and then I will go to school.  This is it, nothing else can happen, the place where you live, with which people do you live, who does you bump into in the list, who gives you knowledge while coming and going, who does networking while coming and going, who sets you up somewhere while coming and going  It is very important, there can be brothers in relation, marriage can happen, a lot of things can happen in a good society, so the society which you are taking, the project which you are taking, it is very important because that thing has become branded and non-branded  There is no other, I will tell you with an example, it used to happen on good cars after doing serials and martial arts, at one time I don't know, you people saw it, there was nothing wrong with the blood, but that company went away, then the cream worth two lakh rupees was worthless, this brand  Dhola's has come out at the new showroom, that means me  It was bought by acquaintances, meaning the rate falls so much that if you buy a player who did not come to Delhi state in future, then that gap in the player's salary can never be filled. If you see that I am a good brand and I am real  I want to stay in the state for the next 100, 150, 200 or 300 years. If there is any problem with my listed players, then my intention will be to correct the problem because it will cost me a lot if my name gets defamed.  All the people are going to infamous names without even knowing why how many infamous names are there just 999 people put on Magicbricks, it gives result of 80 lakh 3BHK sitting and then go and take the leaves also which shop brand this Guddu this Indians we have given it to us people  have thought in their mind that no, we will manage with less, even the shirts are non-branded, wear this also, what is the use of such expensive ones, it is not like that, this is a very good way to become rich, ask these  Place now many people said that we are worth 30, 40, 50 lakhs, this is ours  Which story is this, hey bhaiya you also have a job in dal, whatever paste is possible according to your status, you can go by putting 5 10 cents on it, so like you are buying dish, you are buying swift swift, then the money is for leela  Take the design in the same way, just make a little more so that you get stuck at that level, now you will bump into the same people, you people, Sushant people who live in all the HUDA sectors, and that means in different places, in the old areas, look at your neighbors  Are people becoming rich or the existing ones who are becoming a little rich are leaving and in Delhi I want to ask everyone to put in the comment section that wherever you were living, be it Shalimar Bagh, Punjabi Bagh and all those Vikaspuri, Janakpuri etc.  But in the area where you have lived, have you done AB work and seen where the pattern of last 15 to 20 years is going, who are your colleagues leaving, who are coming, who are you, then this is very important and going  Forward to all the bread is of networking  The bread is of networking, you know four things, one knows three things, one knows distance, by typing among themselves with other people, this way you will earn money through networking and where you stay will be very very important because you stay there all the time, so think about this  Place it in obscene place, if you understood this video, if you did not understand it at all then please post it, if you understood it then please post it, thank you very much oo
