Hello friends, I have covered this topic a bit in different videos but I had not made a video in its name till now. So, some latest interesting thing has come up and I am making this video on its basis and the topic is size of apartment size. of flats is okay by India we are talking about some examples of particular cities the size of flats is decreasing all over India now a classic case has come from Mumbai where 10 BHK 10 BHK 225 carpet has become the development area  Now the unit that jewellers will get will be of 300 carpet area and the middle class will buy apartments of 22500 sq ft. These sizes have become extreme. Simply 400 sq ft BHKs are available. You can check their prices once.  When it comes to prices, till now 80 lakh is available in Mumbai for 80 lakhs or a van BHK is available for 60-65 lakhs, so brother the carpet is only 225, we will see the rate of carpet  It is 35000, so after seeing it once it seems that you are experiencing that phenomenon, of course, balconies are not built in Mumbai, and they are not built in other cities either. You will see balconies disappearing in big cities, look at Singapore, you will not see any balconies.  It is available in New York, you cannot find it, you do not find it there, I mean the ones that are being built there now and the ones that have been built in the last 10-15 years, all the chaos happens like this and increase the education, but if you look at the square feet area, then there has not been such an increase, hence the headlines.  But when you see that 21% in the just ended 6 months, April to September quarter pan India launches and sales have grown by around 30-40% in number of units and if you look at it size wise, compared to last year  For example, if the 6 feet tall building was sold, then it would have probably sold for Rs 1 crore 4 lakhs. So, the size of Malavika in square feet might be only 5% of that, but the size of their units would be smaller. So you are seeing a lot of numbers, so this is a phenomenon, it has to be interpreted, I am not telling it as good or bad because what do the numbers say, what do the statistics say, it is very important to analyze the numbers Deepali, brother, the area is like this, the area is sold this much, total six In a month and in this 6 months what is there so much that is not data that is data number of minutes so what is nine happening this phenomenon speaking place and in Gujarat he is without playing out for very long and I was making that saas bahu and Everything that I tell you in the video is that families should live in separate units, they should stay close to each other please and very beautiful in Gujarat [Music] sadanasionally you have to reduce your terms and conditions and new launches which will be less in square footage  If you say that the size is small then that size will become the order of the day for Maggi, I call it the syndrome, in 2014, it was ₹10 for 100 grams, and after going into 16, it became 90 grams  The 18 gram packet has been made 80 grams, the 20 gram packet has been made 70 grams for ₹10, now maybe the rate will be made ₹12, the size has become smaller so the 100 gram packet has become 70 grams, size shrinkhalation is also called in everything, this is right So this is nine playing out and going forward it will play out so nine when you do your selection you should be very clear as to how much do I have to pay according to the size of the people so you should see what is your utility in multiple units I cannot afford it, I should buy anything international, it should be aspirational, but this is a phenomenon from the investment point of view, so even if it is a small thing, its rate will be relatively higher per square foot, you people have to see this also in the coming days.  In Times we tell you the numbers by super area, in North India you see that four digital square feet, that means 1000 square feet is four digital 1200 is four digital 990 is three digital 900 is  3 digital so carpet area, all three digital are running fat okay carpet area in north India also it has come in three digital but super area Australia is three digit in time because the builder who is looking, he sees the demand in which ticket size  If it comes in more then it comes out in ticket size and science inflation has increased, there is profit also, there is inflation also, so now whatever you get in it, brother, he gives only that much, it is something like first I give you rajma rice for ₹100  I used to get this many somewhere, like I used to get one chilli and two onions as well, I used to get it in papad, some chutney was also available, so then I bought a ticket for ₹100, I bought papad worth 100 rupees, my pickle was sold after a few days Later I gave them five rupees each saying if they want to take this much extra then take this much, then gradually I reduced the quantity of rice, then I reduced the quantity of rajma, then it moves slowly and these eyes cannot catch Suddanali so quickly reduce the size immediately ok suddanli  If the rate is too high then that customer goes away, the customer is very concerned about the price, the budget is ₹1 crore, so one crore, one punch, 98 lakh, 1 10, you keep on making rounds for many days, the payment plan will change, some immunity will be removed, I was applying this earlier  He will remove it, then he will do something in the model kitchen, then sometimes he will put it here, sometimes he will put it there, so these smart people of yours are window shoppers, I call them whenever you note down anything else, then note down the complete exclusive, position plant along with the payment plant  How much is the money, how much is it going, how fast is it going, what is cisees and cisees has balkudi and its fiber size, I have taught platinum members in a separate class these things which I am telling you in great detail, learn them well  If you want you can also take platinum membership adervice, this will give you a lot of understanding, but they say that you have to become the topper of the class, right, if you want to join that coaching academy, join private tuition, then you can also become a platinum member  By pressing the joint button, you are  Let me know then I will post it to you on the platinum telegram group.
