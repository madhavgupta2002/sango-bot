Hello friends, today's topic is Ban Ja Meri Rani Tenu Mahal Dawa Dunga, you must have heard our song, it is a very interesting topic, you will enjoy the channel, everything is there in one video, relationship, marriage, real estate investment, economy, needs, everything and everything.  Stand up comedy is fine so there is a message for men but ladies also want to see it, if ladies watch it then show it to their husbands, if the husband is watching it then he can show it to his wife also because firstly there is a conversation between these two, the message will initially seem that it is for husbands  But in the end, Manmohan Desai is a potboiler for wives. It will be fun. Let's start. In the Indian society, in our country, specially in North India, a lady comes after getting married and she is given less encouragement to do a job. If she gets married, she is given less encouragement to do a job.  If it has happened then it is a different matter, otherwise initially the man enjoys the financial independence of his wife because it is through money that the power is leveraged, men have power, women come into the house and the husband has to obey them.  Any lady who works Neither without your husband or father, before marriage, without the consent of father, husband or brother, these three males, you cannot take any decision in this area, this is the truth of life, or it is good, we will not get into the hassle of bra, but the status is that of a man, father and  The husband should also take the wife's help, it is not that he should not take it, but the wife cannot do it, so you move forward as soon as the husband and wife have that part of relationship, then the wives work in the house like they do all the work.  Because of that she slowly starts handing over the control of her mind and decision-making to her husband, so in the beginning the husband enjoys it a lot, he decides which car to buy, where to make relationships, where to go, what to do  And the wife is subservient, if the wife has to buy a gift for her parents and she does not earn any money, then she also has to ask the husband that today is my sister's children 's birthday, I want to buy a gift, then this is the expectation, if Rekha does not  If you ask and if you have received any money, then there will be a discussion somewhere about giving an account of it, so in the beginning it is  It seems like leverage that the wife is here and the husband is here, the husband is enjoying the pain, all this is fine and then the husband says go and look after the children, look after the house, look after the food and drink at home and what happens gradually  The wife starts hanging on and as life goes on, then I, the husband also, have no energy, no, live and all that, so as life goes on, the wife starts hanging on for every decision-making, after thinking about it.  And as the marriage gets old and a strong bond of Fevicol is formed that now it will feel right, then the wife or the woman must have detested all these things over a period of time, so now she starts feeling less jealous of the husband Judgment starts being made in decisions, whereas the wife who was very helpful used to agree to everything, vows and promises and all that, slowly slowly her level starts increasing and then what were the vows, we in India did another one of extreme male patriotic geometry  we live in a fantasy world that I will make you a queen and get you a palace, then when  That marriage gets old and the husband goes and shows the light, then she says that he will get me room 11 and 12 and this palace of 10 and 12, so I face a lot of problem with the wives, now when the husbands are roaming around, they show the house with their wives because in all the details  That she has those, you keep an eye on her husband's activities, when that flat gets finalised, Ambedkar will take it, now this lady has become powerful, both the parties have been defeated, hair might also turn a little white, children will also grow up completely  When I was enjoying the time to start this decision-making, then the heart, accountability, from this point on, the plate does not remain here, do not drink, where there will be power, accountability and responsibility, on sir, that too will be the fault of whoever is in the country, so you know that  The most powerful person is either given credit or discredited and is told that now you tell me what to do, then the same thing happens inside the house, if they are seizing power then the message is to invite your wife and take five minutes to learn the power. keep doing it, you will enjoy it a lot in the beginning but Tell me and I want to give you an example because wives are completely cut off from what is happening outside in their lives. What is the situation in Navami, what has happened to the rates, what is the home loan, how much is the monthly increment, how much will the inflation be? What is the account of salary, what is the account of expenses, now it has become like this, she says make me your queen now, you have kept me like your maid for so many years and you had promised me a queen and you would give me a palace, so tell me now  Tera Mahal Mahal I have not read, if you can use it then it is for husbands to play with their wives in a roundabout way, he is like the dangerous Bhalos of the Bhils, Haryanvi award is okay and Haryanvi which is what is it to be understandable, please okay, write and comment section Adarsh ​​Cantt land support okay  what is the meaning of this keep them in the beginning it will be good for you we will do this place left sometime jam power will strike pack and will last for you it is my time tell me what did you say your whole thing has been going on for years whatever you said you did as you said  now tell me do you want you be happy and code  So please reduce the power and increase democracy, keep your wife with you and take her along with everything. Such a case happened with me where a man with a concentration camp was very worried and was looking for a property in Gurgaon. I had seen one, you should see it.  You know everything, all these are sample plants, they all cry or if you want something very interesting then you know the rates of all of them, what all to keep in AC two tier, 2BHK comes above one crore, you all know the size of the rooms, which is fine for me.  What should be the size of the rooms and the density? Saurabh used to go to show the place to his husband. Every time his wife used to say that the room is small, the bathroom is small, the kitchen is small, the balcony is small, he did not like it, he roamed around the whole of Gurgaon.  I took it brother, I don't like it anywhere, madam is fine and husband was very upset, okay, this live example puts me to sleep, I get connected in real life, that's why you people also enjoy it, right now I am enjoying, so please increase the likes, I asked for life, I reduced it  So people have reduced their donations on this movement, it is going to be very good, people like it  So he was worried and said, how should I explain to my wife, how should I explain that I know the rates are increasing, the things that are going to come are going to be smaller, denser and more expensive, and even if the so-called things come very big, then that too You know its rates, I will come and the ticket size itself will be 3 CR and 3 and a half, if you go for 1 point 1.6 in CR of one and a quarter or one and a half, then this is available, everyone knows how they are studying in AC three tier Deendayal rates and what  I also know the size, so how do I explain it to my wife, so I also gave her training, like there is a movie by Ashok Kumar ji, tell me which movie, I agree with that, in which Amol Palekar ji was there, he used to give me training, so I also used to give training like this I train many men as well as women who sit in the front, I train them in such a situation, so I told him that today you will eat alone for dinner and tell your wife to have a Maggi, are you okay with that, then he said  Then what will happen, okay so what, I used to train them in their house  What happened what I said, he said what happened look he tells the husband and wife to bring it too so I would also come so I would also bring it, the wife brings it okay so she brings the prepared Maggi so Maggi is made in one packet he says Why is the ban on taking packets so low, how did this worry become small, when I used to eat Maggi in childhood then how could the size of the big one be small and how did its rate increase and now it is so, after eating two Maggi, the stomach gets filled with one Maggi, me and mine  Brother, I used to eat it in childhood when mother used to make it, even your rotis were of 100 grams and I used to make that in grams. Now I also have all the faculties, all of them small size in my hand, so she says, do you know what should be the size of Maggi What did it do from 100 grams to 90 now did you contact SST then do you have some sense do you have some idea about food and drinks and the rates are increasing you have knowledge this point couple set god this flat and you are getting it in the property  If you do n't have knowledge then say that my childhood friend was so  The bathroom of my childhood was so big, it was this much at that time and this much would cost this much or by the time I too am getting discharged, your Vim bar is getting smaller, the size of your shampoo is getting smaller, everything of yours  Do you know what is happening in marketing, ten percent reduction in size, six percent increase in price, sixteen percent increase, even the logistics cost gets reduced, but if you look at it from here, this is happening in the market, it is applied in different cities, inflation  They say no terminologies regression happens in relationship so this is relationship and here earnings every where you have to decide this now his lady's eyes opened a little and I guided her like before I was in marriage and Elviro time Don't keep your wife sitting at home, why do I say she should work, this is not only about money, it is WhatsApp, if she goes out, she will sit among the people, she will get to know what is happening in the system, where are the jobs going, where are the salaries going, where is inflation going  what are the issues  These are the issues of the new generation. A woman who works for 45 years, will have 25-year-olds, 28-year-olds, 30-year-olds in her job who will be in college for 15 years, 50-year-olds who will be 20 years younger than her, so she will have an idea about the next generation. That now out of them his daughter in law will come and son in law will come then it will be known that if you become my queen palace inside the house then I will give you medicine then suppose someone has made a small palace Tiwari and she became the queen of the house now she  I do n't know anything, in my life she will come and say Sita, what do you say, who went to the road, Chak Road, you watch that mother-in-law-daughter-in-law serial, okay, set up a Mata ki Chowki, now do it like this, now do it like this because mother-in-law was also once a daughter-in-law, there is a recording video in it  It is going to be very interesting and good. Please write whatever you want because after doing it, write it down and I will understand that you people want that no one makes such videos. No one talks about mother-in-law and daughter-in-law in India on record and on YouTube.  Leave it, no one talks like that, okay, he doesn't even talk in private, then what kind of video is this?  I thought, tell me, take your wife along, don't promise her that you will build a palace, because if you find the palace guilti, then don't do that, yes our great will be bigger, the size of Maggi is getting smaller, it is a pawn of many things, and don't take power  Share the power, share the decision-making, otherwise the women get hung up on their husbands and if anything goes wrong then I will only be responsible for the children. If you want to work then decide, if you don't, it's your fault, the marriage will take place here, you decide.  The work did not go well, it is your fault, it is okay, if the house is not well, it has not grown, I am not enjoying it, it is getting better, I will not be happy, just imagine up the light of my husband, the husband is 1.5 senior's flat and the one who does white, it is not good at all. So tell me, if you buy a toy worth Rs. 1500 and the child says that it is not good for me then what will you buy? The solution is that you will not feel like buying it, the thing is not good, I am not enjoying it, the thing would be worth Rs. 1.25 crore to 1.5 crore  18000000 of 1.5 crore because it will end later  It will happen and neither will the girl go nor will the brother's girl come, you will be left without a home, then keep roaming in your small towns, there is a fire burning in the small towns, you do not have this product, there are only plots in all the small towns and mother is in the plots  If there is a fire burning in it then please tell your women and everybody that you have to find faults in so many of their things and this product time is now their time and they will find it out in your big things, they will find it out in big decisions and  If you are not happy, if you are not happy then next time any medication for you is very clear that you will appreciate where the paratha is made well, it is made very well, like she used to make it before, even better than that, you will have to say something below every time you don't  The meaning should be genuine because whatever the wife is doing because of the vice versa tension and the husband feels very easily so even praising her without any reason will be beneficial but genuinely our women do at least 5 such things in a day  Talk 15 things he can be praised for  Yes, okay, it can be done generally, if you don't do it then you will rely on the bitterness of frustration in the notes and relationship, it will melt, when it melts, then the man who is upset with you will go away, he is the yagya master of the zero percent room  It is that what should we keep in the stomach now, the kind of factories that used to be there earlier, what used to happen before, I will explain it to you, funny, very important, if you understand this thing, then it is very important, what used to happen before 1617 098 in this also, in the next videos also, the man  He used to take any decision at home and some wrong interpretation was there and it was not even known and there was something different in the system, the man is doing something, he is wasting money, he is not doing any good, it is ours, the woman is doing her own  Have a child and struggle with that. Today the age of internet is such that a woman is connected to many people in default setting.
