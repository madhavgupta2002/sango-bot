So Hello friends, the time has come for Noida and Gurgaon word. I will conclude with the last video. Just like Navratri, it is a feminine thing, so after 9 days, it concludes after a certain time. So, there are many things to discuss at the time.  There will be a lot of issues, I have spread them, first of all I did it in Noida and Gurgaon versus I did not do it in Delhi Bareilly, so that from my side there does not get the feeling that one thing is tempting, okay so today we will talk about cost of living and finally we will discuss it, take care of this  The cost of living in Noida is much less than Gurgaon, now friends learn that the thing on which China has placed, I can go to the big city, it does not cost much, Naresh Tapeshwari says that there is not much money in Gurgaon, only money is expensive in Gurgaon.  This is a city in Gurgaon which says, kids, you earn and think, I will tell you the expenses, if you think, you can earn 5 lakh rupees per month, see, you can buy this, that is a city which is more aspirational Noida is not expressed as there are many retired people living in it and the demography is mostly middle class  There is a lot of class room inch loss, the rich will be in the extreme rich class, but top celebrities, you know some names like Virat ji, most of the people live in Noida, oh madam, if any celebrity stays, he will be from UP only, so Suresh Raina ji will be there Android is also available at that level which even their celebrities can use at that level, you will see it at that level, there is Greater Noida and there is also the supply market of Noida, 38,000 minutes of Greater Noida residential area is coming in that area.  The embassy which is being built within the next one year, JP's Amrapali's school project, a lot of things, all of this infrastructure of yours looks like powder batter, but when it has to be shed, there is garbage everywhere, there is no affordable housing and water in Gurgaon.  So in Noida Greater Noida, see, this is normal, this has been going on here since a long time, so there is a ceiling there, the taste of open paneer richness, money cannot be used at the feeling, it is available in Noida, Gurgaon, Rich people here who have Rs 10 crore to Rs 20 crore should go. This no data is not able to attract ultra high net-worth individuals in 9th Noida. If the people who are getting attracted are getting attracted to something outside.  They are trying to do it, now they will go there and declare themselves as the winner, I am not denying it, they should do it because this is an enhancing video, so if your first point is simple, people of UP please come to Noida, why don't you understand  The matter will come here, it will seem very expensive to you, a text message will be very expensive, med to school fees, vegetables are expensive here, how much shabb, people do not care, then the seller also increases the rate, right, youngsters, that brother, in buying these vegetables  Here, here it means that if that girl, girl, boy, then in this manner, I am taking it up to the people, what about these, I tell you exactly what it is, this is ah hello, how much, how much in everything, so that  It 's money brother, it's money, you understand, if there is money, then that money is there, then the growth of that city  It is different I am here in Delhi Brett Lee as I told you in the last video that there is not much fuss about the metro and all these things in New York when I was doing research you will also do research on job list this audit year's free interesting thing came out  They did that in that when the people of New York at that time, not now, but a hundred years ago, when they were building their regions, they made bridges in such places, low rise ones, in which trucks, buses and things like that could go.  not only can't you, only the car can go research on the other side of the only want people to bend down and ask specifically about the classification, find out I these are some deep things, very open nouns can be understood, can be understood if you are truthful about this  What can I say, in explaining, a person goes a little detailed in development then your friends rich and poor are full of such things right now but we are investors and I am investing, I am pressing this button here Jai Narayan is sitting  Whether to press or not, certain things are there in it, you are the cat's owner, what do you have to do with it, you have to invest money  You have to keep these subtle things in mind in the entire series that I have not told you about b c, people can write in the comment section, I know that it is wasteful, you know I am telling you the subtle things, the things  Eyes cannot notice it immediately, which is very important to discuss because there is energy of the city and brother, you have a playlist to watch, there are movie stars, still there are list movie stars, then they are like this, if you have to talk about acting then You will find Manoj Bajpayee very good, you will like Pankaj Tripathi, but you also know that a movie worth Rs. 300 crores does not work, you also know that you will not be seen in Bhoomidhari, Dhoom-3 starring Pankaj Tripathi and Manoj Bajpayee, how great the actors are  She is big, there is no national award track, who is stopping it but it is a matter of money, so if the budget of the movie was made accordingly and all those things were done then I hope you are understanding the cool Menaka Bugs mega show, arrival of big people ultra  No rickshaw, no money required, wire then that city can be like Gurgaon, if the parking is here  If the tickets were for â‚¹1, people would start wishing for public transport. But they don't do it brothers and there are n't that many vehicles yet, Delhi does n't have any choice other than taking public transport. 75 campaigners of these fill all the roads of Delhi.  All the updates are there, the transport is full, the metro is full because there are so many people, so there will be a need for hands, in Gurgaon, the service for the gym was not taken out, the bus service is eaten up, how many buses to take out, oh dear, they keep on saying, there is no public transport, public press, everyone has to do it  Leaving home and reaching here the car, Pintu car is fit, inside them you do n't even have to dirty your shoes like them, directly and on top of that taxis, so many people like it very much, whatever Uderolal type system you have, different activities and  I am not saying that it does not work in our Noida or Greater Noida, but the density of the youth, like ordering goods from Flipkart, ordering from Sui, ordering from Zomato, it reacts there as well and the buttons here are kept by Radha, then how many population has  319 It is said that not everything is three times as much  All this is six times more than the Chinese, seven times more than that, because not only is the population three times more, but the population is very young. You have come to explain this, in Noida the original maximum government service is there, there are many different departments for those who retire.  And it seems to be matching a lot with Panchkula and Mohali and I am putting in a lot of effort to do the rest of the ITR, may God bless it, it is very good, may God make Noida of 8 lakhs become 80 lakhs, okay, but that would have happened especially in hot  Since test, tell me further that it is not able to attract the way you would be among your friends, the simple thing is that it is the eco system of Noida, that interior is from Gurgaon, the price difference of Garbha Reddy brand is going to be multiple in the coming time.  It will keep growing, Noida will also progress, Samastipur will also progress, Astar will also progress, Ballia will also progress, the whole country will progress, it is not that progress will not happen, the question is that that paste of progress, for example, I would like to tell you people about this  You will not be surprised that UP is 10 times bigger than Haryana, it is a 10 times bigger state, with a population of 25-26 crores, the dry population of every village in Haryana is around 2.6 crores, so the source is 10 times bigger, look at the GST collections of Haryana and UP, any data of the year today Look at the month, it is almost the same or almost the same, that means Haryana's maximum revenue from Gurgaon is known to everyone, maximum revenue of Haryana from Gurgaon is fine and Haryana is competing with it, if there is a delay in the implementation of GST, then 13 hundred Much of money which I will give now like these small things should not be told to a person, it gets spoilt, Akshar used to do a job in Gurgaon, I used to seduce people by saying that they should drink alcohol and I will not leave them here  But availability is another factor, Cosmopolitan is different down here, the local people here, the old time locals, the news of them which used to be there in the early twenties and the bullying that used to happen, that has become soft in Gurgaon. In 2022, Greater Noida has not yet happened in Noida and Greater Noida. The locals type that you see in Noida are you with distinctions, you can also see them. What scenes did you see in those societies, if they would have happened then that  The reason is local politics, it used to happen every now and then here in Gurgaon also, there was a fight in the whole mall, the speed limit was stopped, Sarman had gone there, now the Bharti population is over, the population here is very high, he was a local man, he was local from Gurgaon.  He says that there is no confusion in earning money from this, now what do those people say quietly, they have built 100 rooms in every urban village for Rs. 100-150 and have given them on rent for Rs. 500-1000, they do not show any dominance while collecting their rent quietly, they do not do anything about this economics Those who could take advantage of it, either those who had sold their forts earlier and had received money in Gurgaon for Rs 320, had fooled them, now that money has either been wasted, those people have become cool or those among them who were wise  He was intelligent, not all of them are like this, you cannot corrupt it like Sakun, but there were some 1520 incidents of that kind of people who seemed to do something here that people were a little hesitant about, that system has ended in Gurgaon. It has reduced a lot, look, nothing ever ends but you don't get to hear much relative to Noida Greater Noida and the thing that is pasted on the Greater Noida side, there also probably Noida Greater will start.  A lot of people from Noida will come, but I don't see them coming right now, so I am pressing the law and order here, I will not talk about law and order, whose is very good, whose is very bad, I will not go into that chapter that  Where there are more reported cases, then someone will say that reports are not written, in other places now in Kerala, in India, the maximum number of reports are written but the reports are the least and we know that Mirwaiz, everyone knows that there are no reports, so in this way you appoint in such a place, so much  not only that you know and you also know in which direction it is going then that paste is slow in those  The thing is that the government of Greater Noida, Haryana, UP is looted on the pitch of top politicians, to run UP, their energy is consumed by the population of Pakistan, they cannot go to Noida, but in Haryana, Sindh province is very small, the Chief Minister of Haryana who  He has selected Grade Gurgaon as his karmabhoomi, his official, all the mini stadiums divided into districts, all the ministers in the Haryana cabinet including the chief minister, should keep their points, District Shanti Devi look after, if he personally goes here then the Chief Minister Sahab  He comes every week or 15 days and listens to things. Now you cannot make it that clear to those who have a population of 25 crore and cannot do anything. Earlier, if you knew there was zinc in Noida, the Chief Minister should have come.  He was not there ever in the old times, you know about Riya, well he is the chief minister now, he comes and takes a lot of interest that I don't even want to see whatever it is, but you have to see that it is just such a big syllabus, friend  play sitam 10 times which  Chapter 2 Read Read Read No matter how much you know, I should first start the video, if you want to invest in your property, I will invite you and others to invest, you cannot be so angry, now we Indians are fine, so I thank you for liking and subscribing  Almost 770 spirits standing with you 3BHK 28 but if you do super area for them less than your youth then it does 11 workouts so I have given green investment the villagers will throw garbage at me friend why do you give them knowledge although they do it anyway friend as per my saying But no, we are doing it anyway, but you are invited to go, some projects of affordable housing will be left in the coming days, one, two, three.

You can appoint BDO and CO here and tell all the villagers brother, you should not do commercial in the village and the people who are crazy about commercial in Gurgaon, then I am very fond of commercial, so Noida is a good city, well there commercial P has not come to Noida  I would say look at the rates of the shops in the whole society, how much are they, they have a lot of choice in their village, I mean daily wage is already there and the way career is being taken out, if you cannot do it at all, then it's okay I will go to these shops from the office.
