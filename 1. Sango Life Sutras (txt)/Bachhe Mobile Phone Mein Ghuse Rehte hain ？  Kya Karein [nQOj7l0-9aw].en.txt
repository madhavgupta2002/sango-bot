Hello friends, today's topic is a very current topic. People and parents have a problem that their children are busy on social media and are engrossed in their mobile phones. What should one do if this topic is ok, so I will tell you from a different perspective.  Okay and I will explain in a practical way, you tell me how much you understood, how you understood, what you understood, what happened, okay so let's talk about big cities, we will not talk about villages, we who live in big cities, my core audience is middle class, okay so  What everybody actually wants to do is that han he gets very angry just stop it don't do it do something else read it so I want to put some purse video okay first see for yourself that han it should not happen that your agenda and I am saying something that is contrary to that and then children, in your eyes I have spoiled it, you should watch this, it will be a 10-12 minute video, you will understand it, then share it with your children so that they will do it, first of all let us talk about today  They leave their kids behind and go away 30-25 years ago, mobile was not in working condition What did the kids do then? Kids used to read comics. If you remember, kids used to read a lot of comics. You might have read a lot of them, but you didn't. You read Chacha Chaudhary's one or any other Hindi or English comic. What did the kids do before reading that?  When the country was poor, when the children were uneducated, they used to read comics because comics used to come and this was not the case, okay, what would we do before that, we used to play gilli-danda, okay, we used to play outside in the streets, we used to keep running around, some-something  do it, okay, at that time also the parents used to have trouble, earlier they used to say that he keeps reading comics as well, before that they used to say that he keeps playing, girls also like this type of push and do they play such things, okay now they used to say that  That was good, this was bad, this was look, kids of every generation do something or the other now and parents face problem in it every time, okay, first let's read this, the second thing I will catch hold of is this, today if you are reading about today  Any 60 year old plus 75 years old person who knows how to use a mobile phone, be it the upper middle class, middle class etc., everyone knows it, it's the elders  They too remain busy in their phones with these good morning WhatsApp forwards to the kids, like the ones who guilt trip them, that is, the parents themselves are sending WhatsApp saying that parents are very great, it is okay, and they should be worshipped, respected, and He can also say the same of all the old forwarders, they are fondly called in Haryana, so they also have a group in which they keep on forwarding and they remain busy the whole day and anyone who comes forwards them  You should eat these five remedies to clean your stomach, if you eat this then this disease will go away, if you do this then there is poison inside it and there are such videos also, so you, right now we are talking about children, the topic will remain on children but I will learn.  I want to tell you that this social media is available to everybody, today, if you have a 2 year old child, he is probably not using the mobile phone yet, although that too is given to him, he too remains busy, but  When that child comes to bother you, the parent is also busy in some thing or the other, so the first thing is that we should think about it for some time, we should do this thing for some time  The time is fine, don't consider it bad, okay, and let's see that it is not bad that your child is engaged, don't consider it bad, okay, so now our question comes, let's example, that your child should not do this because according to you this is bad  What I am saying was probably not there, so he should study, what will he do after studying, then what will he do, he will study and study more, then he will prepare for the competition, then something will come out somewhere, then he will become something, now if he becomes something then what will he do, he will go to office, office Even if he goes, this mobile will be in his hand, all the 24, 25, 26, 28 year olds are also doing mobile work, business, email, sitting on laptop, doing screen time, now like I am wearing these glasses, right now, my God  Like if you are not wearing glasses, then these are not glasses for eyes, I am not talking about the brand promoting these glasses but they come with good technology in which they do not let you get glare when your screen time is more, so these  It is a very good thing, if you buy these glasses then look at them carefully, look at them closely, then these are not good for your eyes, if you  You can see it is clear, okay it is clear, it protects a lot, whatever radiation is there in it, whatever comes, blue right and all, good, so first of all if you buy this, then at least you will not worry about the eyes of the children  It will reduce because now that this thing has come, there will be less worry about the eyes. You have to monitor what you are watching, control it and you can tell the kids a trick to sync whatever they are watching in front of the TV so that  While you are moving around we should be able to see what you are doing because what is your concern, he can see anything on the big screen, useless things, time pass things, bad things but when he will see it on the big screen then even he will not know  You will also see mom and dad coming on TV, tell them that nowadays everyone can sing, you all know that, okay, you also have to work by studying, you have to watch YouTube, you have to find it informative, I presume that you do all the good things.  Or is he playing games, whatever he is doing, chatting, girlfriend- boyfriend, whatever he does, if he does it on this then it is your call  If he doesn't do it, then he will open the door and do it, tell the children and you can also forward this video to them that children, you have to do something that consciously adds value, something related to your subject, you want to learn a skill set or something like that  Very good videos of children also come, like I have a channel called Clarity for Youth in which I teach mental modeling, of course it is not for 7, 8 or 10 year old kids, but definitely kids above 12 years can consume all that content.  You can consume it and when you get into the habit of consuming good content, it is like eating good food, then you will not eat bad food at all and it will not come to your field either. You have seen that instead of telling endlessly, children are told to stop doing something.  You should not use this mobile, do not use social media, do not do anything, tell them brother do not go on Instagram, do not bother about your photos, do not look at these rules, the one who watches a 60 second release again and again becomes so addicted to dopamine and  Let's make you crazy for 60 seconds in 60 seconds  Nothing less can be conveyed, only your senses can be stimulated, your eyes can be tickled or the emotions and hormones inside you, you think it is okay and then the person gets edited on that First make some rules, first make some rules that brother you will not watch the real thing, you will not watch obscene things, you will watch less things, brother if you watch less things then that child will be good and will not be able to watch too much or less, if his mind gets confused then he will reduce watching.  You are understanding, okay, you should see for yourself how much OTP content you are consuming, you yourself are busy watching Netflix, watching Amazon Prime, watching web series one after the other, with what moral authority will you stop the children, can't you do any such thing  Kam's videos and Kam's content which is there today, consume it with family, I will also do it for the children, I will do it for job, I will do it for education, I will do it for investment as well, I will do it for clarity, I will put them on  I will do it on Saturday and Sunday, I will be free, I will do it on trees  Whatever I do, it is fine, but consume quality content in it. Once the kids get addicted to quality content, then they will realise that this good content that we are doing will help me get ahead of other kids.  It's done, what are the rest of the kids doing, they're playing games, mindlessly, because what happens is, all the kids, they also talk, they socialize, then they also ask, ok did you see that, ok did you see that, Virat Kohli hit a six  There is a huge market for attracting children's time to cricket. Children also make a lot of decisions. A lot of [ __ ] is sold through children. Once you convince the children about something, they can get their parents to buy that thing.  Let us buy it, you have to see that someone has to take away your child's focus, do not have this doubt in it, the child will sleep for seven to eight hours, after that in the 15 hours, there is laundry, so 14 hours and in 14 hours, take his focus  many people are ready for it okay his friends are spoiled  Friends, his friends who may spoil him or he himself may be in the same category or something like this from the society, then check this, check that, make contact, make edits to children, games 24 25 years old and brother, what name did he give me, I think  She comes and requests him to do something and see, her abusive language is dirty and very nice, she is cool and she has fallen in love with him, your child after seeing her is feeling that yes she is very beautiful and many such people because today you say  You are 50 years old or 45 years old, you don't have time to create content, you have to go to work, you have to go in the bus, you have to go to the office, they have all the time, so kids will consume content anyway, you stop eating and drinking  Do it, this is today's oxygen, they tell me friend, come on, are you consuming it here, are you not doing drugs, are you not going out in bad company, are you just lying in the house, come on, take out some time for exercise kid go with him and set a timer on him tell me brother son you  7 hours of social media a day, 12, 15, 24 hours or 3 hours or 4 hours, there is no limit, but there is one condition, we will keep a track of whatever he consumes, he will automatically feel ashamed and you will also get an idea.  You will be surprised how much he is doing, yes, you should remember any of these things, tell me something very deep, any thing which we do not measure, we cannot fix it, I have to lose weight, I will have to stand every day 369 79 k 89 good 88  It's done 80 7.5, in the same way you should first check your social media, all your apps also have timers, and you can also put it on YouTube, after an hour if you check YouTube then it will start ringing an alarm for you.  You will get an idea, it's been an hour since I've done all this, there's a lot of technology, I won't tell you guys will know more than me, so when we consume less content, then our thought process will improve, see, now we have to do it either through knowledge  You give that thing to the child or to his teacher  Now do it Master ji, how many are left, what do you study from that, rest of your subject there are many things that you need to study in advance, Mani works, okay, what are investments, what happens in a relationship, what is the problem between boy and girl, what are the hormones  What is the thought process? All these things are good things. I am a content creator and I also believe in myself. I am also doing all these things and people are also good. Keep yourself away from these motivational people, they take you towards depression. These are the motivational people, definitely keep yourself away from these motivational people, this content is very bad because what does this motivational thing mean, like suppose I am giving you motivation then it means that you have gone through a lot in your life, I am helping you to elevate yourself  I am doing it and you will get addicted to it and for daily motivation, I mean not actually but should there be beatings or what is the need of motivation, a child is born, motivation is needed to live life, yes friend I know something  there is something I do n't know tell me something Show me the way forward which will seem right to me. Three things seem right to me. Comment a little on these. I am getting stuck here. Get me out of here. What is this motivation that you get up, get up from the bed, work and go? Is it not okay?  So show good content, the way you show the content, the more you understand, the more will be its thought process, any rapidly changing thing that is coming on your screen, it spoils your mind, like if you watch my video, nothing is found in my video, nothing comes  You people feel as if one of your well-wishers is sitting in the drawing room and talking to you, it is not just the child but we are talking to each other, Nagpur is good in this kind of content, it should be seen that some music should come, something like this should come  Let the screen change, if this happens, I will move my hands more, you will get irritated, why don't you consume such content comfortably, after watching it you feel peace, you enjoy it, suck the jokes of the face, the words, the thought process, consume the content  You will have to do it, it is something like this, you should stop eating food, stop eating roti  Do it, just stop eating bread, if there is flour in bread or you feel like eating bread then get a good multigrain bread, yes it may not be as good as roti, but still if you want to eat it then it is available in the market. You can't close and that thing what I am telling you apply to you also you should do it consciously, take time for it and I would say do such family content together, I would tell you another thing about it if you want to do it separately where then your drawing  Go and sit in the room, with your legs like this, no one is talking to anyone, everyone has put something in their ears, like this, what is this, you guys put it in your ears like this, okay, they are not even talking  You can see the face in front of you, so sit and enjoy, and when the kids will consume content in front of you by relaxing with their legs up, they will never get bored, and this is the one that says, don't close the door, open the door, I will do it separately, I will go to my friend  Should I go upstairs to my room? Do this, tell me, we will do it all.  We tell each other that no, we should talk among ourselves, it is not family time, leave it friends, all of you sit down, you can see each other's faces and we can talk in between, what are you looking at right now, okay  I saw this thing very well, children, come and see this but see something good yourself, first of all to impress them and then tell me child, what did you see today, what did you learn, whatever is your daughter's name, the daughter's name is, okay, whatever, Neha son  Rohit son, Mohit son, whatever you saw son, what did you learn today, your children are doing this misdeed, you have to stop them, tell them, forward the video, if children, you are listening to me, I am a very intelligent uncle, don't do this and make photos, there is no relationship with this. Nothing can be done if you are a boy and you are a teenager and you are also becoming a man, you will get best girl friends for 18-20 paise if you have the intelligence and the power to earn money, only two things are needed and  It is not going to come by doing this and I am also telling the girls that do not go into emptiness thinking that today I will look beautiful by doing this  I am looking beautiful because you do n't always look this beautiful. Kids, add value inside yourself, add value to less, it will come with time, like one studies in 12 years, so there is so much knowledge, to live a good life in the world, a lot of knowledge is required. We will not get that knowledge in 22 years, then no one is going to give us time for that job, there is school, after school there is college, after college there are exams, then job, then marriage, then children, you are not going to get much time, if you live in this age of 35-40 How much time did Sundar of the year get, did you ever get time for a year in between, now we will learn the knowledge of living life brother, we have to steal our life in the same two years of life, which song is it, you just have to do that, so don't waste your time content  Consuming it is like drinking water, drink good water, therefore if you eat good food then you should not do this at all. I am not saying that if you eat too much food then you will become fat and heavy and will get sick, you are told to eat a diet of 2000 calories.  If the girl wants 1800 and the boy wants 2000 then don't  I consume 4000 calories for what time years this is learning this is entertainment this is like now if you learn only for entertainment then it is like you are eating only fat you are eating only your protein son neither you are getting meat nor you are getting minerals  You do not have any balance, you are only into entertainment and in a few days you stop getting entertained, it's like alcohol, you had 1 or 2 pegs and you got intoxicated, then you did not get intoxicated, so now you are having three pegs  You are taking four and now you are becoming an alcoholic, so for this content and fun, live life in such a way that you start enjoying life with clarity. It is more fun to learn new things than listening to a stand up comedian for 24 hours because they  Even standard comedy becomes funny if watched within limits because if you are listening to stand up comedy again and again throughout the day then your senses of laughter will not be there, it is like this  If you are going to put too much of the same test on the tongue then it becomes immune If you eat too much sweets, take out the rasgulla and after that you will be seen drinking tea, any kind of tea you drink, it will seem bland to you, so I hope I was able to understand this in the larger, please share it with your children, don't panic too much  Don't test it too much and don't stop it. Every generation, every 10 or 15 years, sees one thing going on which cannot be stopped. That was the method of comics secretly, people, doing everything like this was the method, before that Gilli.  Let's play stick, now you buy this, further something else will come, now all the money, all the jobs, all the work, all the business, everything happens through these fonts, turn off your phone for two days and then see, if you get likes, then utilize it, don't be its slave  Bano don't take stress from this, no, I have told you one more important thing, please make your time limit, in my opinion an hour is enough in a day, according to me it is fine, now if I say it like this then even an hour or two will seem like too much to people, but when If you note your time, you will know Even if you are doing it for five-five-six hours, you will come to know about it when you do it and then what I am saying about an hour and two, then on an hour and two you will experience withdrawal symptoms if you rest yourself on an hour don't waste time which I  What I am saying is okay, even if you rest for two hours, I am telling you everyone, you will still get withdrawal symptoms, so whatever you are doing, see that it is working, the network is increasing, the brain is expanding, it is fun.  Or something like this is happening, you have to reduce Udta Punjab, Udta Punjab is happening, then me and Han and Instagram, then I realized that two hours passed, then you had to reduce it, but it was not done at all, okay utilize the technology, adopt it.  make a rose out of it don't make it a rose thank you
