Hello friends, taking the job series forward, today's topic is we will crush a belief system, first we will question it and then I will reveal a secret or is it a belief system to be dedicated to your work, this is always taught and understood, you people will think  What is he teaching, what is he going to tell, so stay connected till the end, you should also share this thing with many people, first I will tell about the corporate exam, in between I will also give some relief to the government people, in a pack of private banks  One year ago, due to some voice embroiled in terms of controversy over loan, the employees of that bank were made to work very strictly, the work culture was quite toxic but in the end, the situation was such that Shivhar shift hold something, due to which its share price suffered, the brand image suffered.  Cars and that controversy went on for many days, then there was a change in the President of Management, but what did they care about it, they were always told that it is dedicated to you, bank DB dedicated, full time dedicated and what do the people at the top do, I tell you about three-four  from the example  I want to explain, I want to explain and then I will tell you what you have to do. The second example is that the pimples of Kingfisher Airlines must also have been tightened and given jobs, they knew that what would happen to their loan of 9000 crore 10,000 crore So what is the top management doing? The company for which you are working is as dedicated as you are. This is the biggest question for that company and it is marching very fast. Toss this tomato on the unicorn business which started as many unicorns as you have.  These are the people who get excited and die after sucking your blood and then the management does not say anything, Bigg Boss comes and a new voice comes, you give me blood, I will give you freedom, those of you who till now do not get freedom And if you are feeling stressed then I want to tell you that a video on freedom from job is being made and that is the series. If you think that a 10 to 12 minute video will be made which will give you freedom by listening to it, then it is not like that.  Series Ghee Process  So you have to see that a dedicated job, character till the minute, to go to this, is dedicated, I will definitely tell you, the boss, the owner of the company, the company has set them up, so how dedicated you can be, you have to see at this point that  You subscribe and dedication behind this no amount of work and education will subscribe in some such situations you will be fired from the job if you do this Ajay how hard working woman is also defensive on the issue you do not have any school st johns cannot be acquired easily  If you can, you will go out on this indefensible day only if you will stay then what you have to do we will discuss that further, the third thing is as you are watching the video then it is clear that growth is happening, I will slowly bring you on the mindset of indefensible  I will take it which is called doing job like a tiger, the third thing which is wrong and is taught a lot is that you tell me, that is why agree or not, a lot of focus is given on being a team man, team members in many organizations and it is considered very good to be a team man  It goes and  A clean person is not a part of the team, he is considered a little complete, that the truthfulness of a team man and secret marriage together are nothing but a party man, yes you have to develop this principal quality so that you can give your team your skill set, your mind, your work, your hard work  Whatever juice you have extracted, share it with them, one day your own team below will replace you, remember right now many people will feel the symbol, friend, this is not the last type of thing you are saying or if you want to add something then I  I will also clear that in the end that how it is very good that time telling how it is very good for country bahut vote and teaching is very good for the economy to also and observe every bird it's very good habit and out in and out it will attract slowly  -Slowly charity will help, then you have to see that a woman says to Mrs. Sharma, you make very good cakes, teach me too, so firstly Mishry Sharma also learns to make cake with great difficulty, do n't know from where she learnt, how to learn, nothing  Know their journey, how many thousands of cakes they have to make and how to learn, Mrs. Sharma does not tell but the ladies are behind This happens with the team, in the team everyone will follow you and say namaste and Mrs. Sharma, women are very intelligent, she will tell you the whole recipe but how much baking powder should be added for the exam so that it can be prepared in one shot  It is sex and it is a joke, she will not tell you everything. You will definitely become one with that woman, but you will have to be around that Sharma, so whatever is their society set up, and this happens in it, even the mother-in-law will tell the daughter-in-law everything mostly.  I tell you everything but it is a simple masala because this is the truth of life, learn from the ladies, learn from the Radhey Sach team that you all the Gujjars had learnt everything, taught everything, look you are in a job, if you are in teaching then I am a businessman  Now the Guru element is awakened like if I tell this on YouTube, I don't have to tell end to end everything, so you always have to keep this thing in mind that the noise that happens, it falls prey to sharing and in the team and in that  There is respect for you, even if the gull walks or flies, it flies for you, not like a bird  We do not fly in pairs. Okay, so these 3 boiled. Whatever success is there in this, and whatever it is, that team will not get. I have created a team. The team is replaceable. Today you are there, tomorrow you are there. Whatever this team is working on,  So ultimately remember that there is only one person at the top who is going ahead, there is Learn Math, then below there is his team, okay, so the whole world's team, all the teams, ultimately taught you all, business in the team is okay and you teach statement business And if you have to become a big team leader or a team man, then you should detoxify yourself from inside and move forward, then this thing comes next, the point is incentives not allowed, that is the biggest problem and leadership problem, you have to carefully see that  When something starts, the big people do their own work and get this offer, right now the listing of Paytm's setup is going on, many new ones will be released, 360, 300 original uncles will become millionaires, if routine gets justice then now they have to do this  of  If they got him, then they had to work for seven to eight years with their blood, then there is a sense of ownership act and interest line, so whoever Shekhar Sharma ji is, whoever he is, he made his own system and gave freedom to the people as per his wish, so he started hitting the backstreet  If you try hard, a new employer will come and he will not get that much opportunity, he will work only for his job, so that is why you will see and feel that your top boxers, who are the hair management, who are senior people or  Senior officers are also there in the government setup, you must have seen that they have a sense of motivation and their energy levels and why they are like that, Tuku knows the whole game, he knows what is in the form and the returns he gets.  What they are getting is spoon peel, you will be told that in some government sector, he will come with the boss and see how much work I do, okay and how much are you doing, whatever facilities he is getting, he has taken it in the box, okay  Now many people will say that don't have this milk, it will be available with time but he laughs  To be very clear, please the person downstairs has to go and get the vegetables as well, he has small children also, drop them to school and bring them back, he has an exam or the child is sick or the wife or the parents' advertisements, if they were 60 years old, then your parents' as well  The program would have most likely been over and your kids would have also grown up, so an employee who is 15-20 years younger than you has everything going on in his life, now my next point comes to him about work for Bigg Boss  The point is that these college people become bosses in their lives, they put their Swarupini Medico and all these things in their work, I also in your life that the patient and dry ginger and she has not come yet, it is fine, I am simple for people  Let me tell you one thing, you get disillusioned with relationships, no one can keep their mouth shut about the job, cherish the relationships, get disillusioned with the job, keep the job under control at a normal length, do n't get emotional in it because your imploring is not national  About You Message Status Note Release  So now we will not go into what you should be dedicated to and if not dedicated to the job, then you have to be dedicated to your mental health, your physical health, your emotional health, your own well-being, now which cement channel health do you need for these things You have to be dedicated so that if you grow, if you grow personally, then also you will have the capability to give so much value that you will become an indispensable person. You have to become indispensable in your system. If you can give whatever you know to someone,  It can be taught in one month or 15 days, then there is no use of your dedication, you have to learn such things, you have to learn so many things in such a way that you cannot be replaced easily and you have to call and bother that you You can change the fan race, however, I will give you an example, an IT company sleeps, the solution given by other companies is so complicated that this company always becomes dependent on the solutions of these companies  They create a mess that any new company which will come cannot be explained to it completely, its process cannot be replaced and arts earn recurring income because I study these companies as a shareholder, then in which company will I make money  If you want to invest, then which is the company that institutes this thing very well that they do not earn a job because once they earn a client, then they have earned the client for life and now the client leaves them and leaves that company  If I cannot do this then I have to put it on individual level, coal and there is no pimples to teach and father and mother do not know these things, normal boss, you are not going to tell me these things at all, so these things which I bring on topics, turn on no this is it, now if anybody questions its tips then I am going to tell you a simple thing, you understand that you work in a job and you make your life happy, it could be that company is a multi-national company and taking all its profits  You take me to the country immediately. Okay, he gave you salary and he gave you incentives.  Some promotions etc were given but ultimately it is a multi-national only because of the profit, whatever it has earned, it has given jobs from its plant here but it takes the profit outside and spends it, so you have to see that India is nothing but 36 crore small families  There is a population of 140 crores. If we divide it by four, there are roughly thirty to thirty five condom families. If every individual does it himself, then his family will grow and family is the smallest unit of society. Country is nothing. Country and land are also spread all over the world. But countries are nothing but total people worshiping dad. If our 35 crore chiefs who are at home, if there is planned growth and they are happy, most importantly, then the happiness of the country will increase, the wealth of the country will increase, but the head will be crushed in his job.  They do not have any clarity, they themselves are very sad, so they will become a cause of sadness in the family too, the family will be sad, if I see many families, then the country will also be sad, check the remedy of India, Khan is fixed inside the patient, Veer Willow Pakistan and very surprising Thing British means they will feel bad but the fifth front in this is dedicated to research and lottery take away all the dirt from tomorrow subscribe so this is only New York read this creative Veervrat company balance in month balance dr how much data in you or full age for the whole life  All that gets spent in doing it, have you ever measured how much your growth is taking place, how much your network is growing, if you do not measure it then you will come to know that if you know something special, you will remain dedicated and in being dedicated the companies have made their own  A system has been made, a mechanism has been made, they will issue appreciation letter, what happens after a fast, they cannot give you incentives in Mohan style and model monitoring of your work, a limited one, after that they will start giving things on emotional level, employee of the month employee  Of the year, they will put your photo somewhere, they will give you a letter of appreciation and all the worries of all the job holders remain confined to these things, whoever has broken it, a good day to him knows that this is the job most likely in  Dispensable am and  I have to be dedicated to increase my value. You don't need to tell all this to your boss tomorrow morning. You need to think in your mind today that yes, this is one thing. Companies will come and go, organizations will remain, you all will remain.
