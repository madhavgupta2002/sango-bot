Hello friends, today's topic is that applying for affordable housing is a moral issue because I have seen in many comments that the investor in this is going to get rid of the addiction of many poor people, this is absolutely wrong, leave something after buying  So what is this, is there any morality in this, your Akshay Investments is very good and pulling Mr. is a good song, today we will discuss the show on morality because Sangola is this Uttara channel, I give full balance to everything even if I have to do it  You should know that like this also you have to see that who is poor, what is middle class, what is rich and who is what, according to 20 crores, they are making people yearn for it, not in field option, investors are also coming in it, that is a very big grated ginger  He is not rich and that too a party worth more than 23 crores per plate is not rich and a party worth 2 crores per plate is not rich even in the worst location in Delhi builder floor is more expensive than this so man networks is above this and  His children are also not working and they consider themselves very poor Even then give reservation to the poor, in EWS you get only the knowledge of the poor who are poor themselves, then the poor in your shoulder are also getting reservation in jobs, so the middle class should go and invest there.  He and his children also need to invest, if his children do not get a job, that too a poor person who is earning a salary of â‚¹3 in India, then government officials and a little higher officer with 30 years of service, no one will give him any job  The poor will not say anything, he will not say anything, but he has two children and they do not work and he has retired, now what has happened to him, hey brother, he must have done so much, it is not accurate, not everyone does it, not everyone is the same now  One percent are very normal people whose number is two to two and half lakhs. Their income tax of Rs. 30-40000 is deducted and they are barely able to survive because the next generation will do jobs and even a poor child can get a job of Rs. 30000.  and the middle class is upper middle  It seems to be the case of a class kid and there is no difference so my request is that they should stop crying about poverty, okay if they are from the middle class then someone's heart also beats anyway, right, neither the upper class people nor the middle class people are unbroken  The song below is neither of the vote bank people nor of anyone else, so press at least in affordable housing and apply, apply all and all the luck try government is a priority gentleman and if it is said in this then the poor rich Khan remains on the ancient top of priority three who is the priority then the one who doesn't have a house then what is the problem, I am not taking it for him, it is not with his father, he doesn't have it and even if it is not there, he will get it this way etc. then those who today so called consider themselves poor, there are 67 people in their house too, give your inch in the name of all of them, this forceful pushing of class everywhere is not right in my opinion, that they agree with me, that they want to fulfill my dreams  You come because today is the day, speaking against some sections means talking about horses  We have to eat food, we cannot speak about these attacks, we cannot speak about the gas of the poor, it does not matter to the rich, call them their guest, politicians do not care if you call them English, then it means you can say anything to the middle class or gas to increase the capital gain of the bank.  Increase their stock market, reduce their income tax rebate, earlier it used to be given to their homes, reduce it, now set an alarm on its limit, now whatever the soft middle class will not do, Jai will do it like this, okay and the rest of the empty middle class will do its own  She wants to invest wisely that I should go from middle class to low class. Okay, then many people from below class, hey, why are you taking it? Here, even the people living in affordable housing are not rich, nor are the people buying double housing rich. Affordable housing  There are still many projects in it where if you apply, you will get eleven projects, five subscriptions are given as it is sung directly, before this Contact Fever had come, before that Marg 106 had come, such super block busters are considered superior to others.  There is a vacancy in this place, please tell me  I do n't have to apply, I am actually poor, I want only the good ones and no one else should apply, real life doesn't work like this, real life doesn't work, if you also want to buy a house and do something then invest money in the stock market Don't go against a normal middle class person who is putting money in the bank, he is very rich and the middle class has a big enemy among themselves, this is the middle class's business, but they are fighting among themselves to get a loan like Milk of Magnesia  Actually he is the poor ultra power Jain Anil Kapoor, okay he doesn't open his mouth like this, who is listening to him, even EWS people do n't get flats, he has left right ideology, okay but this is blurred in him  In this, this man who thinks that I am very poor and this one is very rich, so take this, let us do 2 minutes below, 2 minutes means one child's exam took 214 times of 1821, how did you go wrong and your child's  That's right, you are out, you are directly from lower class to middle class and this is from middle class  He has become lower class, okay, if he does not get a job, if he goes away like this twice in a row, then what is this class, what is the middle class definition, I will make videos on this as well and I have no fear or shame in saying such things that  One should speak about such incidents in the society. I am not speaking against anyone. I am not against anyone at all. I am just an astrologer of God who shows, gives clarity, shines a torch that this is the truth, this is the torch and see this  Okay, so that mirror shower, in this, now where do you belong in the class, I will make a video on this as well if you want, if you give this video 200 likes please, then I want to make a video on that first  I had made it, its take has changed a bit, so do you want a video in which you can find out that you belong here, what is Market Minute Active Begum because the government brings out such things that it is politically incorrect to say such things the day after tomorrow But what is the market? Who does the marriage market consider poor and rich? Which is the vulgar middle class?  Which one is available here and which one is coriander, so if you want a video on this then please write M in the comment section, it means you want a video of the definition of middle class, thank you to
