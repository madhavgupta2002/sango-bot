Hello friends, it is a very interesting topic, there was a lot of demand and it is very relevant and needed today, it is not a long distance relationship, I will only talk about marriage here in my India that brother if you have to stay away, then for how many years should you stay away  But should one stay away or not and if one is in such a situation then what should one do, this will be discussed, that is, it is very important because this great pain is emerging in my consultation and it is increasing a lot these days and I am losing my existence  I want to make it, a man does a job and some business, so due to that what is happening is happening within the specific government service, no location is being found, that location means we are not living together and it is happening within the private sector as well  I will do both the things, there are rules and regulations in the government, this is being seen more in government services where one of the sports is in government service or both are in government service and there the compulsion becomes very much that one cannot leave the government service, then one can go for private  also you  You can leave it and go left right so I will tell you some templates here and some things which are called as it is not a matter of discussion, a man should discuss it because what will a relative do, what will the parents do, you are posted at one place, wife is posted at another place  If there is, then someone please tell me something. First of all I would like to tell about the immunity thing of marriage, if one has to stay away for 1, 2, 3 years, this is a matter of great worry and pain, this should be taken very seriously, if one has to live separately after a few years of marriage  It is a matter of less pain, second thing I am telling you about some cut years, 2 years, you should stay here on a continuous basis, if it increases beyond that then the delay will be permanent, I will not call it D word damage but give permanent effects in your marriage  The figure can be together for more than a year, you stayed away for one and a half years, then stayed close for three years, then stayed together for two years, stayed away for a fed up year, if this is happening then it is okay, we can somehow manage to live in a healthy situation are okay so most  First of all, when you are not getting married consciously, you are just doing it, one of them will have to leave the job, you will see the long term result, I am telling you that staying away and anything is not worth it, what happens is that the man is staying away, most of the families, the husband is staying away  So there are kids with the wife, the wife may be living with her parents or may be living alone with the kids or some elderly person may be coming and going, there is a pressure on the bike as well, in terms of it, she may have to go  It seems as if I am running the whole house, all the burden is on my love and the husband is enjoying himself, the husband is doing his job, he did not go by making men, he is earning money and with that the program runs, okay but if the woman is also earning money  If yes, then he feels that I am earning money, I am earning money, I am also looking after the kids, when the kids fall sick, it is not like that the father will take leave for 3 days from somewhere.  Okay, so that pressure is also coming on the woman, well my husband is feeling like this while sitting in his place I will be Neeraj in life, I am not even getting to play anything, I am nothing in it, there is no fun in life, let it reach that level, I cannot live at that level of comfort because the house is with a woman, where there are kids, I too  His house is more proper than your parents', it has a TV, fridge, bedding in it, your bed quality, bed quality, mattress, curtain, cleanliness, dining table, all that work is of good quality or whatever you can have, it can be the best of food When the husband is living alone somewhere, no matter how much money he has, he does not live with much pomp and show, it is a fact that he lives a little above his means and he feels that there is a difference in his life.  or no I will go back after one and half year, I don't want to buy a TV, I will watch it on my mobile, okay I wo n't do it, if I do it like this then its comparison extends to everything, you will also see the quality of its screens, that too will be available in half the time, so I mean I have kept it in my  I have seen people sticking newspapers in my experience, even the rich people stick newspapers to me, I will not tolerate that much  The word will look a bit similar but I have seen people do it like this, okay you tell me, this is your experience, you are living like this, it means that the tea pot and the utensils whose quality is also inferior, I don't go to buy them because what is the matter brother  Even if the husband is living alone, then the household will have to be set up again. The gas stove should be made for four stoves, one with butter smooth, nice and one with small stove. There is a compromise in everything and that compromise of everything is done in the morning.  As soon as he picks it up, he is there, everything is proper, he will find a sieve there, you will easily find all the stuff in a good glass case, here you are doing it like this, I will take it in this time, oh absolutely everything is there, I need that friend, even the spice box is proper  I need complete utensils, tomorrow the family should go for a 4-10 day trip, you are doing a job, Chitra always buys fifth quality thing, well then that man says no, buy good quality thing then we will stay away  if you are there then what is the benefit of it, it will eat up the money  This is the biggest thing, the moment you start earning, okay your 50% salary goes in staying, only the rest if you keep the accounts of tax and take care of your accounts, then brother there is no saving, if a man takes a wife  If your wife's salary is 10 lakh rupees and her husband's salary is 15 lakh rupees and you are living separately then that is a different matter, but if I had followed the normal salary system in India, I don't save anything and many times even after saving nothing, I spend one and a half years  If one has to stay then one has to stay because which job should one leave, if the wife says that I should leave the job, I will not be able to do it, why should I leave it, what should I do, so if you are in the government setup, then you will have to leave one person and because of him the stable  The person who has a career in one city should keep the job and the other one who is roaming from here to there should leave it. In many places mistakes are happening that men are not leaving and the women are being made to leave while if the women are working in one place  If it is set and you are getting a good salary then  You should not leave him, after leaving her she cannot do anything, then she becomes nothing but a dog, it also becomes the reason for depression that hey I left her because no matter how great and good a husband is he cannot be that good That his wife should leave her job, meaning that he should turn out to be so good and later this treatment should be done in such a way that it can be made worth it fully. This can never happen because then what will happen when that thing is not there with you, then there was pain.  If you are not together and are living together then you face the problem of money that women have to ask for money, sort of independence, good, if you are okay with staying away for many years, then I am telling you specifically according to the woman, then her husband  There is not much habit of not eating because when the husband comes, there is a sense of discipline in the house when the husband is missing, what is the discipline of eating and drinking and this routine that dinner will be cooked at this time, dinner will also be proper  This will be done from behind, you also feed fast food to the women, the more it is done from outside, the more it is done, the more she does not have any feeling from inside that she is a judge She is not being judged, she is the boss and the worry always justifies also that I am alone so how can I manage alone, brother, I can only do this much, okay, then that woman's 2-4-5-6  Monthly his mother goes to his relatives, if his set up is of his parental house, what they call his mother's house, then the husband becomes totally useless, okay then he will become totally useless, then he will become just like an ATM, yes  If you come, you will come for 15-20 days, one or two months and then those kids of yours, they too become like you, they never feel good in your house without a father because in the end he will interrupt and say something, if he cannot read it then I will tell him  what do you do, you don't listen to me, it is even said that you will leave, why are you imposing your rules and regulations, why don't you know, you don't know anything, if I am doing it and you don't have the courage to leave and sit on my head, then never do it  Worth it if you audit this life then who will accept this long distance relationship  She is going to go, where are you running, nothing is happening, Neerajta remains out of sight from other's life [Music] It is not there 2% 3% if there is a chance of something 1% 2% if you do it out of 100 then you will do it  Don't make it a topic of discussion, everything remains normal, but it is not good to remain sad normally, because life is passing by, there is a prime of life, what happens to you, 30, 35, 40, 50 years of age, after that you spend all your time in that.  It will take 5 years, 10 years, 12 years, then someone did not get married for this reason, then that is why we decided and the woman left her job and this is also not right, this is also not a solution, the solution is in trying to leave multiple times  It requires a lot of courage to leave everyone wants to leave I will do something for myself yes for Gujarat I am stuck in innocence date they want to leave they want to job they want to take a year but they are not able to take it blind people are living very far in private  are service people  Brother, you don't have any gun on your temple, you can easily leave your job any day, you can take drop off and go to any city, there is no logical reason for you to stay away for long which is the case in a private job.  Because you can always face problems in big cities, difficulties, why do you have to stay away from the government because when you are posted in small accounts and there are no schooling facilities there, then the women do not want to go there with their children. For schooling in small towns, the education system is set up in one area and the person himself roams around and it is called Colonial Health and Mental Peace. You go out on Fridays to a small town, like if we talk about Haryana, you are posted in Karnal and your family lives there.  If it is in Gurgaon then let's go on the weekend, I am in Chandigarh, it's a small city, small state, pay 36400 rupees for one way travel of four-five-six hours on Friday, then you will go on Sunday night or early morning.  break something like this and then he  Your job starts again from Monday, your boss doesn't know that you travelled on the weekend and when you are at home on Sunday, your family members will say, yes, so something happened, in this way, 2 months, 4 months, 6 months pass by under compulsion.  It gets cut, it never works in a government job, in the times to come, any woman will start doing the opposite, in the times to come, girls with government jobs will refrain from getting married, it is not happening now, it may not be happening today, but this People will get caught up in these trends for 1 year or 2 years and then you will not need a job. Then those of you who are preparing today, I am giving you a hint because you have not got it yet, you will get it, then by the time you get married, everything would have changed.  The syllabus is being prepared, as the thought process of women changes, the thought process of marriage market will change, similarly the thought process of jobs will also change, so it is not necessary that after falling into a pit, this realization of yours will make big people like those in government service do this.  It seems to be a matter of great pain to them, hey you are like this, I am so popular right now  I am not going to make you angry so much, yes it is possible that tomorrow my subscriber base increases so much that I tell people not to marry people from the government service and they should not do that, it is possible, so if you are afraid from now on  If you feel so, you can also create your own platform to make a counter, you can do it from now on, you too work hard, okay, whether anyone else does it or not, I will try my best to do it alone, get hold of long distance relationship in every government job today  Catch a government servant, a long distance relationship of 70, 60, 70, 80 is going on, catch a random person, why do you want to become one, I am saying that if someone will do it, then you have taken the contract, when the argumentative becomes very moralistic, don't give it brother.  Someone will have to do it, yes, someone will do it, someone will do it, you want to become someone, the problem is just that I will say a simple thing, let someone do it, he will do it, he will be very quiet, then how will he enjoy it, not his wife Gentry and Joe in Jobs Staying Away  The place from where people are coming is also changing, if people of this level are coming to this level of job, people with economic status in the society, now they were not enjoying coming to this level, so when a person of this level comes,  So it will come, now that level will change, it's been a year since I've been away friend, no no, there's nothing to be done, something has to be done, you are the one, jaani, I am the one, I'm not leaving you, you temperature will do something, this should happen, this helplessness will not cut  It will happen, we will stay away, we will talk, we don't happen, sometimes it happens in two months, it happens in three months [Music] I have told you the cut off, it's two years, two years, it sounds like 2 years is a very long period. Also, when you cut it alone, it is not cutting it, so I have not said 2 months, I have said 2 years, but two years is too much, you have done more than 2 years, then I will also not do it, then this will also not go, also remember this, then this should reduce  It will be said that yes friend this is right and that is not right Kabir, it is neither right for the children nor for the society.  It would have been good for the relationship, indifference increases a lot and there is no growth and money is the most important thing, will there be no money left for the thing for which you are doing it, always remember the biggest thing in a long distance relationship is to audit the money  Keep in mind that whatever you are doing, it is worth it, how much is being saved, how much is being saved, how much is being saved, people do not do this, they take themselves in isolation, my wife thinks that I am thinking 1 lakh committee, I am thinking I am one and a half lakh less.  I am mine, hey, look at the total, one is our date, so our total is two and a half, how much is left if we were living together, how much was left if we are living separately, how much is left if one leaves the other, then is it so less?  It will cover so much that this much should be done this calculation should always be done you should have it in excel only, if you have come then you people will be interested in this if you want freedom from this if you are stuck in a situation then brother one and half two hours of 3 hours of force okay you have to try to understand if it happens then I will plan it within my schedule and then you guys  You can add this. I feel that a lot of people need help in this because my man doesn't do individual consultation, so I am a very highly paid consultant, so I think why should I tell one person, I am putting so much effort in the topic  It is so let's join hundred and I will reduce debt amount by debt much, okay and I will also get personal benefit from it, there will be no financial loss and it will be fun as well, you are understanding this, it will be fun for me, one person can sit  Please add that in the trailer I want to see this in these 23 which is the year of Gyan also I have decided this for myself I am reducing my platform in a bigger way to the audience I hope you guys will appreciate and like it ok  yes because I have solutions for all these things, they have come over a predicament, it is not that it is not practical, I know and understand the problem extremely very well, all such problems I have Understand them extremely well and I have very good solutions which have time for so in your people so it will work for you also and he is a little wiser a little bigger open he can tweet his template below whatever template is given the thick template is like this  If it is for money then you are living separately and for whom else are you living, okay if we do something about that, it is not the case with people who live together also, but friend it is a taste, one gets to live a life, otherwise long distance relationship  Just like in a cricket match, a child is sitting outside and does n't get a chance to play, he is unable to understand anything, neither is he bowling nor is he feeling, a wife who is playing the match inside because she is doing all the work, she is saying I am getting hurt, my clothes are getting dirty, so I am sitting beside him and the one who is sitting outside is telling me not to bat, she is telling me that I will not be able to come because  You can't do this in the game, you are long distance, there you will only see what I have seen with my own eyes, now this is over  Chutki must be sick, now her teeth are coming out, she is crying, now she is walking for the first time, she just had her exam today, her annual dues were there today, he will sit from a distance and watch everything from a distance, he will not play, you will play and I will play and  I will stay, it's okay I will stay, it's definitely there is pain in society and to address such real pain, making a video or dressing it up, okay this is also a factor, it's like this because these are real issues, I get the real content, please tell  Me whether I get the real content or not I am not talking about any very high moralistic thing or about religion or politics, friend this is not a waste of time, these are real issues, so high full very happy bringing all this to the audience, okay there are solutions  For first of all identify the problem, long distance relationship is a problem, if it is for a few days then it's okay, but if it becomes permanent then it will take the form of a disease, you all should remember this in your life, thank you
