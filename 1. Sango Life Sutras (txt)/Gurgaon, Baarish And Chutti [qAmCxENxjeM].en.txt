Hello friends, we enjoyed the rain in Gurgaon, the government has declared a holiday, okay, so how many people are angry with this thing, what happened, we suffered a loss, please write in the comment section, we had to go out, the government has done a good thing by taking an initiative for the first time.  I told him that brother, I am unable to do anything outside, so stay at home and explained it to everyone in writing, the kids are very happy, the office people, you tell me about your happiness, since morning today I have been doing at least 30 to 40 minutes because it is my hobby  So I go out and search for people from rickshaw pullers to labourers and people who do such work that if they don't go out, they wo n't get money in the evening. Those of you who are my audience, they got their salary in the evening today.  that you will get it whether you have gone to the office or not but there are so many of our brothers who would not have earned anything today because they earn only when they step out of the house and there very happy and I ask him I ask him very happy friend why are you others getting happy So I am happy, I understand that you will not earn, sir, which of ours  When it is a holiday we also keep ourselves busy in this, our body also gets rest, sitting comfortably and playing cards, good tea was being made, he said, okay sir, will you eat pakodas, it means I wanted some direct happiness because this video, I just want  You share it, it's not only about Gurgaon and rain, it's about d they are living light, what do you call me, you want to steal life from Pal's life, all those songs are mine, like that, this life is nothing else, it's your and my story type  This is life, we have to live it. The weather is so nice, this weather is great. Drinking tea and pakodas with wife at home, talking, gossiping, learning something new, doing some research, seeing something deep, thinking and understanding, it is very good. So how did you guys like it?  I would request the government that such holidays will come for 5-6 days in a year and two of those days will automatically be holidays as per the default setting, Saturday and Sunday, so you will have to do it for a maximum of three or four days, you can declare code red or code R.  tell me code r  It means rain, you just have to say this, Gurgaon code R, then the whole of Gurgaon will understand that I am at home and working from home, there will be no hassle of letters or else you have to take them out again and again, now if it rains, tomorrow is also a holiday.  Is it happening or not, write in the comment section, friend, Rainy Day used to happen in schools, it used to happen a lot earlier, I do n't know which old schools you guys have gone to, but there was a time this time when I remember because I studied from various Schools were in different places and if it rained then it used to be a rainy day, nothing happened in rainy day, that means you can relax, eat pakodas and parents used to be in a good mood, generally that life was a little relaxed, unfortunately of the middle class  That life does not exist anymore, I see it, I can see that peace, I go to the lower class, I meet people, I see that there is peace, I mean wherever they are living, they are enjoying comfortably there too, are you okay?  enjoying ho me  Enjoy today and be me of your frustrated date all my god I want you to do date presentation and that did not happen and what is this stress why doesn't the government make this water disappear, okay like this water, hey bhaiya Hero Honda is running less at the square, friend  no they are doing it they have to do repair maintenance it happens in buildings also they are doing it for our safety okay they have a separate program of five-six days going on because of that they are spreading it further  There should not be bad publicity, otherwise there are a lot of you people, what will we do in the f, everyone will make photos, till now no photos were made, if this much is spent then we will make photos, look at Millennium City, the brand image should not be spoiled, I have to declare holiday  I felt very good. Okay, I don't go just like that but many people feel happy in the happiness of those who go. What do you audience want to say? You guys are happy that by doing this today we will have a little holiday. How did you like doing it today?  Give the children, if there is any, ask them how the children are feeling, okay and the women go home  How is the woman feeling, maybe she had to do something more or less, are you making pakodas or not, okay then who all ate the pakodas, please write, whoever is happy, write that, let's have lots of PK in the comment.  Section is okay, the ones who eat pakodas write P, the ones who are happy write PK, those who became happy after eating pakodas, write PK, okay so there are same times where we just feel sorry and be happy about life, okay, last 2 years you know, okay you guys  They will say that friends, we stay at home, working in court was also a problem, that was also a problem, but if you get such a break, then how did you people feel about this break, please write in the comment section, should we praise the government a bit in this, at least friend  It was issued by them and they became pro-active because look, the government, the authorities, the citizens also do a lot of things, they should do that, it is a democracy, it is okay, but sometimes, if they are proactive and issue the letter on time, then the letter is very important.  Because without him there is no authority, because now you all will have peace, all the schools will have peace, all the offices will have peace that brother, if no one is calling you then we will also not call you, even now no one is your bastard, many people have said so please write about that also.
