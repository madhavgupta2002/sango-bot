Hello friends, I will tell you a method of investment in Rs 25252. If you invest Rs 15000 for 15 years, you will get a net interest of 50%, then you will have a corpus of wealth. It sounds very easy, people also tell this.  It is very easy to write, it will be done but it is not easy to do it practically because it is about the next 15 years and that is not being discussed in between.  I was included in the past years because the base effect was less so it will be very difficult for the upcoming ones to do the same but in B.Ed tate how to achieve this goal by using both real estate and share market and putting the benefits of one in the other.  I tell and show what is done. Please subscribe the channel, like it, thank you.
