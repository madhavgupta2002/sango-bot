All the private employees who were there are not trapped to death. So many government employees are trapped in Greater Noida that 2,000 nine ten eleven twelve. Ricardo syndrome appears in thirteen. Properties with missing out suit come in third degree. Neither you have to live in those properties. I have received a notification regarding boat investment that rental yield is a souvenir vital is loop 450 and 4%. You should not be knowing that.  The properties that were in the stock market are Pharmacist, I am also a College Dividend Chair and this complex is Resorts Paris, so if you think of a property, then a property is in yours.  If it is worth Rs 50 lakh, then the rate of purchase in 20 years should be the same today. That property should be exactly the opposite. For the sauce of shiftiness, I should get clean current. 2.5 likes in any month around 2008. 150 140. If your any â‚¹ 5000000  The ad for the property at Rs 21,000 is not coming. You should send it to her because she will not appreciate the property due to the validations done in the market.  If any property is speculative and the seller will say a great thing, if the home buyer considers the rate then he is late for the property because transactions are not done daily but what is the pinpoint feedback is the real thing you bittu hai society that he is a society of four or five people.  If you ask then the friend fields plus minus 230 and the same kind of apartment is real because people are giving it to the front every month. You can call your property as a bread. You are not talking about Rs 1 Crore 10 Lakhs, you are not talking about it, there is no rate which a buyer gets in the market, it is read, it is a bit difficult to point NDA rake, but it is very easy to point rank, so if you want to sell a property.  If you want to buy a cheque, then it is nutritious and what else will you take with you? You should buy this money plant from the middle. If you are a seller then you can say up to 23. If you have improved your house a lot then it can be up to 34 for the buyer.  Should be taken till 31 512 Buy Property Credit Mobile Property Mine should be as much as its existing rent of the property which I can find out in half an hour yes by any stumble or people in the society you me  Twenty-20 should be given, if I give more than that then it means I am the owner, because no, if you get it for 18 years or 19 years, it will be fine, even if you get it at the rate of 18-19 years, but it is not available.  If I do n't get that much then it's okay, now what is Mr. Opposite Properties that if I take a loan on a property and take the entire property and it earns me more from the property than the interest I am paying for the year, then for example if the loan is now at every interest rates. Due to the hit of 6.7 600 800, we talk about small property, it is in affordable housing like in Gurgaon, they sell properties worth 22-23 lakhs late.  But the calculations are that if we can set up 125 parks, then if a property worth Rs. 25 lakhs will give me 8 cents per year, then how much rate will I get? Rs. 2 lakhs, if I divide the rent of Rs. 200000 by 12, then approximately Rs. 17,000 patents will come. If I get a rent of Rs. 17 thousand, I will get it.  I am coming by flight with 25 lakhs from 2BHK but don't vote then I am in Mumbai. It is okay if my loan is eight percent.  60.72 and I am getting eight percent rent, 1.3 percent will be positive property and if I take income tax rebate on it, if there is about one percent more down on that loan, then 5.7 percent is going to me and it will be eight percent.  On what can I spend my whole life? If at 6 cents I will come, my six percent also comes, then six percent of 25 lakhs is 1.5 blood on a little paper.  Keep it, I am doing Muslim calculation, a little bit is good, you guys do it with your paper, otherwise it is not good, tell me all the songs, then six percent, if you got Rs 25 lakh, six percent, yes, the date has been crossed, Rs 1.5 lakh, if your property.  If it is coming from a property worth Rs 25 lakh, then that is the rate of Rs 12,000 per month. Is the rate of Rs 12,500 from a property worth Rs 25 lakh or greater?  It is not coming in Noida, it is not coming in Ali, it is not coming in Hindi, it is not coming in Hindi, if you man, the girl said, I am not coming in Bangalore, I am not getting it, it is not coming even in Chennai, in Mumbai, it is 25 lakhs.

If it is made with old technology, the location is not central, you do not want to live there, that property was taken because ma'am had said that there should be a roof, everyone took it, so you thank you for your understanding  You have taken it but it is not very well in this you have to explore opportunities so if you do not want to live in a house and the rental is three percent dry coconut or it is coming at two and a quarter then remove the properties on it and maybe  If you want to know about the search operation, if you want to buy a flat worth Rs 50-60 lakh, you can buy two-two and a half feet more and put a Castro sweater on it.
