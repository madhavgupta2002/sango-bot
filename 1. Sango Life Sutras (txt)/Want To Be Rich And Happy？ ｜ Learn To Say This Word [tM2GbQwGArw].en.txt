Hello friends, money mind-set series video number 0 from the topic Importance of Time and Learning Tool, what will be the benefits of these two things in life, what to do, I will make a video on that, it is going to be very interesting, I will not leave it till the end, I will tell you this.  I would like to ask, when do you feel most happy with the passage of time in your life? Just think for 5 to 10 seconds about the passing of time, when do you feel from within that the time has gone. Take photos of each and every time to know which one it is.  There is a situation and what can we do with that situation and if we apply that experience to other places, then how can our life be improved by that experience? So I will give you 5 seconds to think. If we make a match, then you say that we have done this.  Thought of it and if you enjoy hearing this situation then you can write in the team comment section. If the thing I am going to tell you is that we realize the time the most when we are driving or  We are sitting in the front of the car and the traffic light is green and 10981 Rawat and I are behind. There is a slight feeling from within that I should get out, that is a complete excitement. There is a natural reaction in the body that at that time.  Is the feeling of being launched that you will turn sixty, you will turn completely red and when you turn sixty, people become very sick during this process, do you know how happy you people are due to this experience and  How many of you are related to this, please write, can we put this kind of feeling in other things in our life also? When we are wasting time in life, we are wasting time for hours.  We watch Netflix web series one after the other, then we don't realize why sixty seconds will last on our Facebook, sometimes we spend 6 minutes chatting on Facebook, sometimes we spend 6 minutes on something, we don't even realize that this one is about time.  You have to note it down with a feeling and do not spend your life at such a panic level, but there should be a feeling that my time is going, I am getting it together, so this was about the time, now I will talk about the learning tools, no. This is very important, if you are saying things a lot then you are more like the western people because the special thing of time is hidden in you in saying this or this or not, so I will explain this thing in 500 index with these points you How much  Let's relate, tell and apply it in your life.
