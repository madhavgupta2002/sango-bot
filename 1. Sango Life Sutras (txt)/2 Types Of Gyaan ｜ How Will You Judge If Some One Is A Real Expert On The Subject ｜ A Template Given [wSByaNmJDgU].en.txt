And what is that knowledge that gives pain which you have acquired but it has no practical use in life and it is used only for arguments, it is like saying that you have a lot of knowledge, the indifference capital is slow, the capital of the face  Sophia, I have 204 countries 206, how many in the country are 203  200 This keeps going up and down in the country, everything is fine, I know, tell everyone clearly, Indian students are giving so much pleasure, to stop it, it's okay, all the Indian kids in America are the ones who top this year  You can type the thing in 5 seconds and find out on Google that knowledge, you can get it from there, you did not know it, I knew it, you found out in 5 seconds, then that knowledge has to be there which can find out about paan-cigarette That thinking process is knowledge that how to think about a thing and the second most important thing is what should I check on Google, it unites me for that, I have got some pins and some time, that thing is knowledge, it will be a little deep but you will get this  There was a great need to tell you this thing, so you got to know this basic thing that there are two ways of knowledge which will work in your life, what is the benefit of forming a Hindu Undivided Family, how to get income tax rebate under section 24, starting to become a Chartered Accountant You must know that something like this can happen, that is why you should study to become a Chartered Accountant So you will keep paying your tax.

A teacher can also become a Guru, but the teacher's syllabus is defined, there is a small syllabus, there is no big syllabus, the totality of this is not known to us, so when I use the word Guru Tatva on every fourth video of mine, Guru Tatva, take this.  Guru is the Guru element in life, you must awaken yourself and be aware of all the possibilities, life will always exist, gray wants to be black and white, in anger itself we have to find out the shades of grey and check that Despite this, can we still move ahead because mercury is not the best, this is all I have knowledge of chilli, 95 percent of people are not taking knowledge of this symbol, I know its capital, I know about it, I know about Panipat in 1526  The first shift happened e63 2016 was of Buxar, the second shift happened 17641 Plassey 1757 Haldighati shift instead I know that my exam will be cleared, then what will you do in life, still I am not rich, a man became rich, I do n't know the update about when the Khilafat movement happened  When India got its independence, it was also found out that there are many such women who do not know the name of the pregnant woman, you know that they have reached a very high level, I do n't know what difference it made in their life and you know So where have you reached, that's why, they know everything about comedy, those who know the password, they know their work very well, so you know very well about something which works in real life history, nothing can be done by just remembering that Yes, I know all the facts of history but I don't take pride in that.
