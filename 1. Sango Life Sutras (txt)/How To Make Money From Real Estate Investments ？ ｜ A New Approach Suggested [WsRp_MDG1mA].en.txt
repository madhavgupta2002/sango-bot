Hello friends, today's topic is very interesting, how to make money from real estate investment and how to make money from real estate, how do you create wealth and make money, in this we will discuss what is the approach of the people, I will approach should be  We will discuss why the ideal approach is not being done, we will discuss it in today's times, we will discuss the disadvantages of wrong approach, I will tell you things according to some calculations, this is going to be very interesting, you all have to stay connected in it first of all That this device is going to be launched in 2022, it is ahead of the sewing machine, what has happened till date, it depends upon what was happening in the past, now it is a forward-looking device, those who are taking a long approach, how do they relate I want Tow by property and foot diameter on Dwarka Express and what is it well will leave after digit and you want something on golf course extension road village examples written I am telling you this is for all the cities first PK what will you do after that bhai sahab  If we go somewhere else then there are many such people who think of investing money in real estate and its growth as if they have increased it or have done some work for them and then they will do the same work further, these people have invested in real estate Money is not lost, you are not stuck because those who are stuck do this kind of thing, a timeless property should be going for what this time which cannot be created easily if it is in your budget, it is expensive due to the location  Because of the brand, because of the concept, because of the site loot, because of the price point, now there are many research super, I will make my video, please watch it, if I like it, give me a mansion in Chandni Chowk, if I have money, you have time  I cannot come back from there, people that still not realizing the importance of this, everybody wants to play and what will happen by paying 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 lakhs, brother, approaching Bigg Boss again like that I will tell you, they think that  If I earn profit like this then I will buy a car. I will reach old age. Many people do not have jobs, they do not have any work, so they do this and end this capital may be from father's side or inheritance. So it is like this.  No, life can be lived, let me tell you, in real estate, no one gets lucky the third time by turning again and again, I took it once, the money increased, I took it again the second time, the money increased again, I took it again for the third time, this does not happen once  Someone is lucky, it happens once or twice, it does not happen the third time in a row. I will come again and tell you openly about this. A lot of money is made in real estate, it is on the uncertainty, it is on the education trust, it is on the lack of clarity that whatever this thing looks like today  Tomorrow it will not look like this. It is like when we buy flour, the rate of flour is ₹40. Suppose many rotis can be made with it, but if we go to a big restaurant, then one roti from that restaurant will be available in as many as 100 rupees.  If the item is for forty or fifty rupees, then when it is ready, its rate is different.  If you are understanding then when the whole thing does n't look so right, the road will come, the expressway will be built, Karan Arjun will come, it will happen this way, it will happen that way, then there is money in that, if everything is done there then she will get angry, now the good place which would have been built  And you have ridden that growth and there is no good place to compete with it, then it's not the point, if I give this as an example, then take the example of HDFC Bank, this or that app of irrigated area, HDFC, whatever  I am telling you to take this motor recommendation as an example, so if the stock share is growing for the last 20 years, such friend Domingarh readers and editors of twenty twenty percent, then I sell it and go away saying that I had bought it for 50, it became friends'  And I will send it and I will take this mental torn and friend I want to play something new, this will not increase further brother, taking it from friends, who has become of HDFC not the bank HDFC war bank giver good returns this point note that great  Returns to three four is CCR and last 1528 beats deputy returns also and going forward for the features bag then 10 B coming and so in the true portfolio if you take any wrong thing then it is understandable to take the wrong city  and worth every work out i have not done it i have to get out of it 234 dorio dorio i have to get out of it but if you are coming in the real estate for secretary small holes in the right appears that you make money but long term no wealth creation will happen diet money  The one thing which you had drunk so much would have become worth so much and if you had sold it and used that little money then you would not have earned that much money what is this reason of your flash light again and again all the influencers who are all in the newspapers  Now the big players in the market should depend on Charan Singh and Bhai Saheb should not do entry, exit, entry, united entry, united setting, open Singh, yes only the share market should be observed by this target, this, by subscribe  Target of 125 was 25 that war and then they used to take it out from above just by doing this you don't earn money you regret money every time and UP in a video subscribe government is making money money money but you are doing everything I have happened I  You have to be professional in this thing, there are some people who are in real estate market and it is a risk for them as well, Ruby said it is not safe for payments, those players also get trapped when the market comes back because they are highly losing their money  If you plant them, they will grow highly, so don't be highly waste oil, real estate, Gond, Bhil and be highly impressed, as much as you buy one cup for your home, just buy it, then if the children are growing up, you can buy it for them, buy it, okay because the children need it. Give it to a friend somewhere, he will give it to you, do n't hesitate in taking rent from him, you can give him part of ownership, okay and on paper to PM, then you have to do that, see, any money that you want to earn, you can earn it by doing something  earn money from this money that will be earned  The advisory is very high development, through this one has to make a written application that money can be earned, it can be earned only by reaching a stage, the recipe is quite high, this dot small want to retail notes of youngsters starting from 800 Android device, I have taken  Then I gave it to you for the British tourist and you will have to make your base backstage, many people think that by doing such a thing I will get rid of my job or my life will become something like this and I will not have to hold you back whenever  When we buy mutual funds, we say that they were long term, why in real estate, after doing all the calculations, the public tells that for 3 years, 5 years, your EMI will go this much, the interest is this much, the maintenance is this much and there is no proof without using any exaggeration.  You have nothing left, no one has heard the story of Samudra Mahal of Mumbai, you people want to hear that he has a property called Samudra Mahal, an iconic property in Mumbai, built in 1973, what is the story of his real estate, his growth story, no one hears about it  It is also not told that its earning  It was not taken, the monthly net comes three times that, no one told this, 12345 times the rate per month, whatever your property was, it was property worth lakhs of rupees in 1975 and it was a very expensive thing, big things were made with the first invitation  People had come, only big people live there and the rent for today is whatever it was in 123, but the monthly rent for the next month is six times more than what was approved for today, no one will tell them love like this Actually definitely the returns at that time out to be just a red person daily and how to show the clerk to the people my brother I will invest that rent in your share market then the returns will be so simplistic you have taken only the returns of capital for the returns see a very good example  I am explaining to you people how much simplistic returns people have taken, even if it is worth one lakh rupees, even if it is worth two hundred crores, they will say that this is a 40-50 year return, so 14, oh 14 per cent sixteen.  It is also a lot to get percentage, now he said that in 1983, this Bombay Stock Exchange, give that number clearly, from how much did the Bombay Stock Exchange start, what happened, okay, so if we had started with this feature, it had started from somewhere else And its widths are told but brother the property gives rent, I will invest your rent in Bombay Stock Exchange so now tell the returns if someone had bought Samudra Mahal and from the first day onwards whenever Mumbai Stock Exchange opened its every month because of yours that in Bombay Stock Exchange  Diner Dash is the number two respect and and verses I will always take now and this is the 25th and both of real estate will earn money only if you trade real estate like equity then it will be possible to earn small money in real estate every month You cannot invest, leverage is used in real estate, you cannot use my device in equity, as soon as you invest with your money, if you use it in Vraj, then you will have to switch off the position and that 0 some profit loss profit loss of profit in that chapter  You will not go into real estate like that  If you have taken it, then there is no time limit next month, you are not required to pay on this, there is no such compulsion, many people are approaching real estate wrongly, do not want to sit on the loan, do not want to take rent, do not want to invest the rent in stock market, want to become a response  So real people have made it like this, we are real estate people and we are stock people, so you just play your game, you will do the same, from the principal we apply both the methods of investment that bye good bye good bye Patti  Virus talk about companies which will throw Kushwaha property which will sit on cost certificate that rent have different companies have a good rental properties in most of them you can also use valuation matrix you can calculate the book value of its property from the sea this is my teacher  Of real estate subscribe explain to the listeners that both have to do the whole system is divided subscribe that we have to visit it that's good we tell both good and evil use that cycle to my advantage and have knowledge of both and will  Do it well in this amazing country, even the big companies in which the owners of share holders companies also buy property with their dividends and sometimes buy property by selling their shares, it is a mixed bag because if the share market was this great and you could buy it  If you can tell the journey, then someone invests all the stock by selling the property he has acquired as mortgage. The 100% reason is that you know where the speculation is too much and where it is in the short term. Everywhere the long-term is invoked.  If it is so then approach real estate also like that is the message boy good property people trying to buy that like potatoes 99% allergic reaction goes they say it is island 3BHK Gurgaon so many listings come then it does not come next to it that it is not written  The address will come, the number will come or go, then you feel that a 3BHK is available in Gurgaon for just ₹5, then you should ask the person how is it, how is it, how is it, so today I am telling everyone that 3BHK default tax in gurgaon  I don't know where to mount the RL, if you are taking a big size, even inside your Deendayal the language envelope is not coming proper, if it is in Gurgaon then with realistic it is not a new thing, no technology, now like your car charging point is there  In these old societies, the recycling that happens, the water that they use or the renewable energy, all this is in the form of formalities, when the biggest thing in a property is the education beat, even big players can mess it up, add them and the big players get caught in the middle.  So when you have earned money by taking a big risk, then do not exit from that property and the best time to buy a property is 1 minute, I am telling people what is the best time and that is the one who used to take a reset later but my videos After the arrival of the resale on Dwarka Expressway has almost come to zero that the snake has come and repeating for the benefit of people from water property in Dwarka Expressway you are not supposed to sell the lift tennis device that why sell it to someone who has not got the education trust your disciple  the pit was dug  When water was being poured, basement was being made in it, then poured like this, then stopped, then it was withdrawn or the number ran away, then again or it was made, you endured all that time and now you are settling for 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 lakhs and small 2BHK, big 2BHK, 3BHK  It was big and it was getting so much profit then why not do it so soon with so much profit, good night, I have to do it now because the time for registration has come, otherwise my oh brother, chair person will be appointed and five percent will be charged for this and on this issue, this  In the middle of Germany, you will see such boom, you will see such a time, take it, respect it, it tells about rental targets, I will also make a separate video on how to choose targets, you have to look at the target real estate in the long term, nominal  Should we beat the GDP or if the country is growing at seven percent or eight percent, our GDP will grow at seven to eight percent and our inflation will remain at five to six percent but it will reduce a little more now. Okay, so your nominal GDP sits near the square. So how will the real estate give you 14%, now we will give it, okay, when we enter into the under construction, then the money does not go in one go, it's not like that you get two crores and one and a half crores directly on the first day, it's not like that and the 20125 plan  125 to 125 rupees this phone will be constructed in 1.5 phases from ten percent so money is wasted furious 9 - application is there but appreciation happens thirty per cent over and yes while right now in the market there will be many places in Jyoti month also if you know  Otherwise I will cover it on the video, let's take a good one as well, so if we take it that every year you have 40% depression in four years, then it will say that ten percent happened to Das resident, your money slowed down, when you do it in Excel, it will give you 1820  He remains happy, after that the position is complete, now his capital value will not appreciate as fast because the uncertainty will end, that is over, the game is over, now everything is visible, now its appreciation will be organized around your inflation  It seemed a little more if it is a good project plus you will get 4-4.5 crores in rental from the original investment you made. I am talking about the Gurgaon market, you can do the same in other markets as well. Now what people do is that the rental in this is calculated in the calculation. What will you do, if you do it according to the price of the property on that day, then it will be 3 percent, but if fifty, sixty, seventy percent people do not conduct missile tests every year, then the equivalent work out at this price will be 4.5, as you had put Because if I look at the history of 50 years, if in 50 years the property is increasing 1020 times Sadhna, then on whichever day its validation is done, if I check its rent element then it will come as percentage, but brother, for how much did I buy it, if Ajay of Janakpuri is just a flight like that beautiful palace was built for one lakh rupees that now it is fixed at one and a half lakh rupees per square feet, that is fine, the rate which is total deadlock, from one lakh rupees sugar to ₹2000, that thing is now one and a half lakh rupees.  If it is square feet, then if it is lakh and I earn six lakhs per month, then if you intimidate six people with that, then this monthly rental yield will be six hundred percent, any early this, make it from 12 to 7200 per cent later, no one will tell you that this Who talks about 40 years, who talks about 50 years, all these people do that too for 25 years, every person will be settled, every person understands today's returns, 25 per cent, 5 years, six years, brother, in between, he would never think about it in 6363  of 35 years and I want to get long term returns, this Amazon will take time, the property will become a family property, some property will be created that you will also be responsible for building for your future generation, if you have got something, the one who did not get anything  It should also be made because maybe you will tell one or two judges that there will be something about it that you will say that my son was a very intelligent police station officer or he will leave behind some legacy, what about the place of work, brother, the place of opportunity  He will write at such a place and ask if you want to buy the property, that is why all this is a game, yes sir, this used to be ours, there are many stories in India, see all this, for how much was it available, I did not buy it, it used to be ours for me, we sent it Nobody tells this, everyone tells the story, if you have heard the story from the point of view of Wipro's shares, there was a guy, despite his size, he bought for this much, he had a principle of buying and not doing it in demand and then the shares became so much  Or the child opened the box kept inside it, we listen to ours but no one told us that it did not happen, why does it not happen that you do not do it today, if every person thinks before planting a mango tree, friend, I do not know whether I will get it tomorrow or not  no I will take it after 12 years why does it take so much time for the trees to bear fruits or if we will not be able to enjoy the fruits of any other tree then how will you with anybody will ever planted any thing in this regard planted for you late then give your duty don't  Want to buy wedding bells and use them as long as you understand their value?  She is replying to your fat book, she is telling your network that how will you survive after selling all the things, there is no telling about inflation, in this socio-economic condition, according to security, it is not known how life will go on in future, then you  If there is acid and it is causing trouble, then you can earn a lot of money in the long term. This is the mindset people have. In the really short term, the long term with real estate is longer than the long term with the stock market.  The cycle is 8 9 10 years old now the cycle attention cycle day time correction so you give two-three cycles when in a good place in a good city then first of all gather the city right get Dussehra is win win dushat get different location amway product and you  Ca n't go wrong and hold on for long friends, you youngsters from real estate who want to earn their bread by investing, just buy this, buy electricity, then I will take my wife out, I don't do any work, it's my father's money, and I will show it off like this every time  Like I'm doing too much  I am investing, I have increased the money, I am not doing anything, he should keep it for a cycle, you will take out your I will give you Friday people are real but if you don't have a real job and are not earning real money then you will run after this,  So many people, that after seeing them, those who have real money and both are working, they also understand their compulsion that they have to earn their bread through profit, so that is not your program for them, so you can buy such properties which are timeless.  If you use leverage by using loan then please you have to look at it holistically that you should not do it for short term, the world will tell me, it becomes difficult for me to say that look there is a customer sitting ahead who wants to take loan and his entire situation and precision  It is a complete slot, if you want to come then it is difficult to tell the stupid thing that how much is he doing, how can you send this user, a rich person will be able to do products from Tuesday asking and consultation, okay and with what right can you say that he is your nephew, your younger brother  If you are my brother or my son then I will listen to you  of maror loan and said this is how it is done, it happens so today on the day of Guru Purnima by awakening the guru element learn, I want to give this device to you people with great impurity that whoever comes to me on demand, asks me, I create like this  I do that if I had told my relative then who would have known the rest it is his phone, Destroyer is my brand value, this is my dead body, this is my newspaper, this is my group, please Devil's advocate hi dad, the shopkeeper of the sweet shop used to say brother  Sir, let it be the fig barfi and cashew katli, it has become old, I have kept it, you can take it from my shop also, but if you get stomach ache then you will tell me, I know this Deep, it becomes more difficult, it is very difficult, some time I have to decide that this one  I want and what happens sometimes winter concentration is not happening with concentration improve and nurses higher fees but while walking I can ask this rock is like this then a man doesn't even say it's not good then every man wants this plain mark why doesn't he  It is good, why, why not, it is good then it is the greatest, that is why I say buy such a thing which works very well, they have stopped making gadgets, what used to be the time earlier, 20-30 years ago, if you used to buy electronic items, it used to be most popular then  Nowadays the system used to run for years, like its low pressure warranty ends, all of that is made for that much time, the cars were also made like this, the TVs were made like this, the mobiles were also made like this and if by mistake any product is made so good then it is a great  If it is long lasting then if its interior is made like that then who will buy it otherwise that is happening in the form it was ready want to know get into thin otherwise all the depreciating acid people want to buy the product which will not have sent a classic example will  want to buy 168 war products now fear video minutes ok it's not good products but people with 0 want to be built now they take concentration hour flow listen to the whole thing but the person who is taking the thing below that, he will get it in short time  in the time of The orientation of the people is moving towards that and many times in the circle of that you people get stuck at one place that if the youth sells the property then this money can be spent on another product now with the money of this phone he can buy this product so that is a problem.  If you do it here then you will see this here you know that I am seeing one more thing for ₹ 100 secondly you are saving my money and yes you are investing the same amount this and your but you are feeling that I have got my way  He looks like I am lying about cold coffee because I get the values ​​on Pricewaterhouseco I am giving the recipe but the values ​​that you get and you will get date consultations zinc drops people don't know whether it is valuable or not  The whole game day is about many things like cement, square feet, edge, location, the value of all these can be told but the brand will tell it, now a player is going to be listed, suppose his size increases, then how will she respect the property inside Late at night I made a video on intangibles who will be your neighbor Who will be your neighbour, date will decide your property, how are you, how is the entry, what kind of people will be attracted there, everything will be decided, it is not just simple, I have done 3BHK, he will show you anything, you put any price in it  Search engine you will get hum result, if the global property rates have increased then it will go up a lot but if the properties are subscribed while selling but what are the issues in the sewerage treatment plant, where is the plaster being attached, what are the issues of the builder, are the people there ready  All those things will not be seen by the admin, that is the sub, he is very very careful with those things, he has passion for real estate because Azhar, life of an average man, I would say that it is from 22, 23, 24 years to if he becomes 80-85 years old, then 60 years  I am every person in middle class in today's rate gets to see transactions of hundred crore plus in his own circle with this property now there is Harold there property is being bought and sold you understand You are talking about trading volume, like in a stock, you have bought ₹ 5000, sometimes sold it, sometimes bought it, then you can take the volume to 50,000 and in the same way in 50 to 60 years you will get the capital of the properties.  You will buy it, you will sell the property of your children's parents, then it will be bought, your children will buy, your brothers and sisters will buy, meaning you have a direct opportunity to give influence in the property worth Rs 100 crore and to gain from knowledge, so if you are an intelligent uncle or paternal uncle in your relatives  Yes uncle, maternal uncle, uncle, maternal uncle, whoever wants to become a member, you can also become a platinum member because there I explain things by taking them on the board, there are also webinars, you can add them to the list and make it a part of your life.
