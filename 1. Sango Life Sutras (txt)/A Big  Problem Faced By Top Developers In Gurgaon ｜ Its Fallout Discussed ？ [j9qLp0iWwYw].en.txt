Hello friends, the topic is Gurgaon developers' latest problem zone mark list, big pleasure in problem hand, this is why a list was released for the meeting on minute, if it is possible, I will put it in the description in my subscriber telegram group home, whoever wants it That is the list of deposit builders, so the top ten Delhi builders in it, whose patrons are the old ones who used to live in Gurgaon market, you must have heard their names, out of which Unitech is the topper in the deposit list and the rest also have their names, now taking the names of all  I don't like to insult anyone but the government has to give Rs 900 crore and Rs 700 crore as deposits. These are the people who are sitting with land parcels. Here, their money will go directly to the government and those developers who are listed players, do not have any line. So, there is a huge shortage of land parcels and the Chutku people from Jaipur New Line Hotel, the old farmers who say that it has been 25 years since they stopped farming, those farmers who are sitting with their land, right?  those ones  Whatever it is, he himself is thinking of building it on withdrawal, why was that garbage given to them in Deendayal, we will also cut the road and we will lay the sewerage, they have to do big architecture and put up smart so this is the problem and now the latest and what kind of plot so you have business because  Bhai sahib the land is ours so when on returning the shaukeen will tell the whole world these people will cut it off saying that this is also a latest disease and problem, the replacement cost of the project will become very expensive by reducing it, if you understand what is replacement post  There is a project at a place where there is flat tax and this land was purchased 6, 7, 8 years ago, so the price of the land has increased, we have seen in the form of Ashok Samrat, two, two and a half to three times, the full click is not there.  So if tomorrow any builder buys land in the vicinity at today's prices, he will not be able to sell it at this cost. His cost will be minimum more than 60 per cent and this is going to be witnessed by Gurgaon people and all others. Who want to invest in Gurgaon in three to four months time  At the time of Diwali you will realize that whatever was there happened all of a sudden, will any rate rate go directly to the file digit in the spirit, this Rs.10000 digit is not 9004 digit, so the file digit Smith is detecting it.  yes, we are doing it inside Deendayal but what will be the surprise, people will get a surprise in a month or two, in the place of 1968 in New Gurgaon, AC three tire will come for nine thousand rupees, set service GST tax at 9000 and you will have to eat position charge  So when these rates will come in the market, hey Deendayal Dham Village has 96,98 thousand tweets, then it will not be ten times oversubscribed, it will be a few eighty percent, the remaining 20 per cent of the experts will be there, so anyway the formula for frozen points is 1720, so it will go right away  Later, he will get it for selling at 10 cents, so if any IPO gets subscribed 10 times, it makes some difference, if it happens even once, it works, right?  Those who are mostly subscribers, it was started with just a penny, a few days ago, what buffalo did the people get in it, so you people have to see that the price is going to be shocked in this, in the beginning, the person is turning on that pressure press for like  If you say it was connected then if such a ship was happening somewhere, okay then send typing acid, that is the work, hello hello check also I have told you that the existing ones cannot increase it because the rates of the future ones will increase a lot because People are following their rates, so friends, ₹ 400-₹500 increases, it gradually increases to a thousand, at 04:15, if the company dies, it directly costs ₹4000-3000, then this replacement cost is the big issue which something which you want to tell you to subscribe  if it is there then type it and if you do n't understand then I will insert it okay from the beginning it is the only thing that I could not understand this is the thing so if you do it then do it once and if you don't understand then thank you
