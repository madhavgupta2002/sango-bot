Hello friends, today's topic is buy a shop in affordable housing or buy 400 lions, affordable housing vs flying jatt vs shop in affordable housing. Many questions are coming, so I will answer them well. Have I been able to explain to you? Please do write affordable housing.  Don't buy in this shop even by mistake, she is trying to sell nose ring and this video is a request, don't share it to many people, this is just for me.  I will also tell that region for the subscribers because what is the dilemma in that because there can be confusion from both the sides, I will tell it in a more interesting way, so those of you who are my subscribers and are watching this, then brother, do not print out this information because  Whoever wants to buy, let him buy it, but you guys don't buy it, why is this advance being given, a little complicated wise, okay then you will understand, listen carefully, affordable.  Scientist in housing, a thing is sold on carpet area of ​​₹ 100, its profit goes to the builder and he does not earn. You know where the cement bars are and who knows his rate. The correction cost is on fire. Okay, so the builder's idea will be used in the actual. Call him too childish. Earns money: Earlier, before the advent of commercial business, the government used to give it four percent allowance for selling commercial goods, then all the builders started becoming very big and the rate increased so much that it  When that was done, they added eight percent to the builders to sell the commercial of the project and I will tell you what happened to it, okay, then these people got their balance ready for that also, in this they lost a little bit whatever the rate was increasing.  Didn't earn profit but did n't go into loss. Okay, this is the rate through fax. You know how big it is. If you know about cement, then understand the commercial carefully. All the shops are there inside affordable housing. 183 shops are open, 106 means flight, five or six lakhs, Ajay shop, now there is someone coming in 90, whose rough one, I had seen the mathematics, it is okay, there are five shops, one on Play Store, 196 and now another one is also open, brother, okay.  It's a good project, I made a video of it yesterday, the day before yesterday, it's fine, end and subscribe, people feel absent and two and a half thousand applications on the first day and this on the second day, Patti Sokar Oscar's 67 thousand people taking the flat.  If you want then you can buy a shop here because you have to eat before the flight, so I can buy a shop by giving my money and for 60 lakhs, 50 lakhs, 80 lakhs, it would not be more foolish than this, if you pack money in the helicopter, then good karma.  So you will get some return on investment. If you keep such fabric in a poor colony then maybe you will get sugar. Don't do this work here. There are people who do any work anyway, they have no money.  No person is taking this thing by taking the salary less, mixing it with your loan and withdrawing money from PF, there are some people who have retired from government service, Rohtak Hisar embryo is told to buy a shop with the retirement money, not me.  Understand, if you have five or six shops, sorry, if you buy one shop, then a relationship is being formed with the bullet, then brother, the shop will be run manually. Now it is told that no, people from outside raise slogans, there is no shop in every society.  The place is full of shops and anyway, nothing is being bought from the shops. Anyway, this area of ​​New Gurgaon is the logistics hub. Whatever is available in our homes, Flipkart, Amazon, etc., this is mine, it is 20 from the original warehouse on the same day. Whatever you need was available within minutes, now people will talk about everyday things, so you have to understand that if there are 5 flights at one shop, then a person will spend Rs 10,000 at that shop. If you start e-rickshaws, you will have sales of Rs. 50,000-7000. He will earn twenty-five percent profit on the monthly salary of Rs. 50,000. He will pay Rs. 10 to 15,000. So, from where will he pay the rent? How much will he give you? I am telling you a basic thing which is affordable housing. It is worth Rs. 25 lakhs. If you have bought milk in a shop next to yours, then there are four of them, otherwise it will be sold. Even after paying 60 lakh 70 lakh rupees, the rent of the shop will be less than the rent of your affordable housing. You can check this with Ganesh. Do not read the rate of ₹ 1. You can also position yourself at a rate twenty-five percent less than the rate at which a shop in affordable housing will be charged.  Now you ca n't send it later, why did it say in the video that don't tell other people because the shop is also adding its subscribers who have money and religion.  I felt like promoting people, okay then I am taking it, I did not want to accept that if the builder gets kicked in the stomach, he will stop building, then your choice is a loss, my loss is our loss. Everyone, I also applied for the article in my protection, one will become better because brother, if there is profit, then from where will he make it, but the message was that we should kneel in the country for his profit, this thing, I was able to understand that his shop has no lovers to sell it.  If you won't win, there is an army of sellers standing there, there is no dearth of shops or double housing in Gurgaon, they will make stories and send them that brother, this one is good, will it be crowded here, whether it is big here or the one from outside, you can do business and tell me.  Sometimes it will happen in life that you will wake up in the morning on a Sunday and your husband will say to his wife, Darling, today is Sunday, today we have to go for a shooting, I will buy something in the affordable housing shop number 18 of this chapter.  Will come after eating food and will ask for shopping at home, he will say something like this, tell me, think for yourself, only that Rafi Lal Singh, even if Bhai Saheb will come, how many eggs will he take, how much bread will he take, okay, how many barber shops will there be, try the formula and see.  The rough formula is that you choose the proportions, which are my calculations and whoever has knowledge of real estate, I can tell you, have you ever heard of these calculations? Look, 80 residential units.  But one shop runs well, 80 residential units. Well, this is the show, only then you will see that the older the differential society is and this formula is applied, then if there is a flight on 80, then there is a 10:00 shop, it is just fine here, it is of Ray Khusro 521.  The supply here is 16 times that of Radha which is not ideal, so here there is no point of debate whether it will work or not, brother, will it be okay to leave this much.  Hey brother, the one who has 60 shops will eat the bread, the spiritual one, the ratio of 80 is good, 60 is fine, this like is fine, 50 also becomes 40, 25 becomes 25 laptops, one shop, I have one shop five flights away from here, no brother.  We will run the office, this will run, hey brother, you and other commercials are also coming, so many are coming, that is well supplied, you want full clarity on commercial with data, please comment.  Write on the section that the government itself is coming in such a big commercial space, Global City is one thousand and one boys, brother, the supply is commercial and it is coming more than residential, it is okay and then the basement is being sold by doing work from home only after doing office work.  Do you know that the entire basement in Deendayal is being sold as an office, whether you want an office or someone else in the office, will you play office office? Is all of them fine, then there is a limit to it, I am the voice of the rest.  So made it affordable housing and the other one too, if you want it is very commercial then it is ok then you are commercial is nothing but future and options, the stock market adjusts the product, do people earn money from it, even from future and options.  What money do people earn? Right now they earn some, one two three percent, it is okay, those brokerage houses where there is a lot of Christian prayer options trading, they earn at least.  Earn money, but some cunning mind or algorithm, this software, superior or lucky, can handle half a percent, but they eat 99% of the money, so the commercial is also similar, here also the commercial of Gurgaon is on the ad, so you should not touch it with anyone.  Don't do this type of thing and a series was made on this earlier, now I want to make a series on it again. If you want, please give minimum likes to this video friends. 200 likes.  If you get it, then what are the products of a commercial, how are they lined up, what are their stories that will be told, which will make holes in the studio, rationalize us and in this affordable one, I do n't want to do much, if there is no need for it, then above.  We can do that on the normal one, we will send it to the world, so please tell how did you like this video, please share it, friends, I am asking only from my subscribers and it will be shared to many people.  Don't send it, it's okay to gift a lot of people, you are the only one who means whatever number of subscribers I have in my account, 24000 plus something is going on. Right now, while the video is being made, it is for you people who are watching such videos ahead. If anyone has seen then  If you have done this then please subscribe the channel. If you want a commercial series in the upcoming topics, then type me in the comment section again. Fresh Latest with Senior. A light event will be shared.  What is the supply or supply, what is the demand, I will tell you clearly about that. Thank you very much.
