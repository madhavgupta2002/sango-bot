That Hello friends, I am going to tell you some information on multi-level marketing, normally on social media YouTube it is painted in black or white, those people with motivation are actually doing multi-level marketing, in which basically what happens is two under the partridge  Partridge on top of the partridge 273 partridge in front partridge behind partridge on top seater subject teachers how many partridges behind partridges are made in this it is a way to straighten out the unemployment in India it is legal to some extent some prince on which hello we are going to tell you today about its  I want to tell you an open thing that in multi-level marketing there will always be products, some will be genuine products, some will be ridiculous products, some will be fake, okay these are three different varieties but you have to see that there are a lot of things, there are a lot of products  It is plastic, now your cosmetics and other ladies items are basically a product which gets sold, now people add various things to it, it does not go through direct distributor so there are incentives and many people when  They do training in this and you have also seen on YouTube that many people have joined that you will earn so much, you have to invest so much, 10,000, only 20,000 in the beginning, then make three or four under you, then the malls also take it in pieces in these  Some people take things too seriously, I will tell you what is the middle thing, actually if we assume that this is not a Ponzi scheme, it is not like that, it is a judgement company, it is a registered company, the product is correct, everything is correct, go with that only  Still I want to tell you that this is a jokes industry, it will grow that product by ten-fifteen-twenty percent on hair which even they themselves say is growing a lot, then in that those who are promoting that Your waist should be as small as you want, today I am going to explain its mathematics to you that if lately there are 1 lakh people in China or 10,000 or 25000, or 2 lakh, that pi is what is called 1  That's Limited  It is only there and it is increasing at the same rate so you have to get a share in it. If you make a lot of tax below you then you will get benefit but the people below you will not be able to use it that much because  You have got that much money, then the same people will come and tell you that you did not put in effort, you had no money, so like all these people do not reach the top post due to digestion, similarly this person is also in the same way, but it is to show that every person can reach there. Not everyone can understand mathematics, so this can end up being a waste of time for many people. Is this the right way to earn money? Is this a very profitable way? According to me, how much energy does the bribe-taker have? Does it add value?  How much energy do you people get as soon as you go, I will tell you about a plant or I don't have to do anything with it brother, something will come out, three people have to make it, I will just make three, make three, make three, see, the company's basically 25 rupees for 20 thousand  That initial investment is of Rs. 30, that product is being sold basically that you made three, he made it, he made it  Those who are top notch are the ones who are eating dry fruits and maximum of them, if you do research in this also then it is of maximum morning seminars and training, maximum morning one training and Montreal cheese screening, fool them, make three, make two, that means ultimate That Divya ads are not being made that much that we cannot say anything about it, okay we cannot say anything about it, there is nothing like this on integrity but you have to see what is your nature that you go and do these three reasons, two minds where there is five storey house of mine  Go down and make it, ultimately it is a product and mostly I have seen that it is just the product and the price, it is not as much value for money as it is shown to be because ultimately no one pays attention to the product, all the attention is on you  If you want to drive a Mercedes, then it is difficult, if you want a ticket, then it is membership in a difficult situation, then basically these six become relatives, friend circle, who take something in shyness and no matter how many pink you leave  I am going to tell you guys that you are fat and tasty 90% I will device you guys don't get into it This Prakash it will withdraw your self-esteem ultimate is also a thing means there is also a concept will not say is illegal but one goes to yours because when you are being served to someone again and again and the thing is ultimate  The thing is not right, the product is not that much value, so there are very few companies and products which are of that person, so you have to see this thing that everybody has not want to make money in these very few people want to make and they are as much into boasting as they are  Now I would say that the more the number of chickens is added, the more it benefits the top person, so that is why those passionate speeches and some sparks coming out from behind, Narayan is the star and everything is fun, all this is done so that people get attracted.  Go ahead, unemployment is there and in India, people are being fooled and instigated to be fooled and when there is a need to explain that your product, your industry is growing at 10-15-20 percent, so if I invest 10-20 thousand rupees, then yours will be 10  20 thousand  Do it only on those trees or else what type of thing will you become in it, so maths and science maths very few people will explain this, if you understand it then if you don't know how to write then I will explain it properly to you by doing some maths on the board  I want to explain it but if you get confused please avoid getting into it, you cannot subscribe to my channel by doing it below, thank you.
