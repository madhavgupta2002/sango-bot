Hello friends many people are waiting for Gurgaon versus Noida, I will do Gurgaon and Noida, I will not do Gurgaon and Noida versus, doing versus then it is a matter of fight and quarrel, now he will say you did versus and you have done it, then you still have to do the same thing, such people will also say han  I said okay but I will do it with more effort, I will not do it by doing versus, okay and I cannot make it in one video, I will develop it as a series like I did Delhi vs Gurgaon, he gave 12-14 videos because he did it in one  It's okay to make it, let's start the first one Gurgaon Gurugram vs Noida The first important thing that I check is the energy item right now, what is this friend, if it were a household item then the name in the cities would have been energy Gurugram escort culture Gurgaon hey go life it is what history nobody belongs to noida greater you can't belong to an artificial hair it was created in 1976 much before tak gurgaon story picture and come date it date it something energy second thing i will tell you is whose aspirations are there to come to gurgaon  Or to come to Noida, if I am telling you in the beginning of this series that those of you who are from Haryana, brothers, yours is Gurgaon and you people, yours is Noida in the beginning because they will all say Jai Ho Jai Ho, it is understood, who am I to them I am in the series, anyone else will understand where to go, I always know that you want to climb Gurgaon like this, look at this pregnancy, the biggest difference is that there are many people who want to climb Gurgaon, there are many desires  There is no one to climb up Noida, this is also a big problem of Noida, there are many people who fight and argue to excuse Noida and Gurgaon and there is a physical fashion to defend it, that is why I am saying that life is Gurgaon, Noida is North Okhla.  Industrial Development Authority and within it, North Okhla, Okhla itself is the acronym Old Canal Housing Authority, so it is the child of one authority, on the other hand, the authority district is also some other place. Now in this, this photo, this discussion, this road information, there will be clear direction, there will be nothing round like we used to.  Our country looks so beautiful, how lovely it is  It should seem so, but does it mean that our country has become the best country just because it is our country and we feel very happy that there is no further improvement here, do our businessmen not invest in India, have we bought Jaguar from abroad Do we not acquire assets from outside? Here we are talking about investment. I will also talk about own accommodation and there can be a gap between the two. You can stay in a place of your choice and invest in another place.  You can place what you don't like, I will also explain that you like it, it can be anything, now to make money, people have become a bit commercial, do not buy in one at all, you can buy in the other, try to balance it from your side  I will do it somewhere, you think, in the end I will say this, done brother, this is also good, this is also a good joke, Chandigarh was the first, in 1952 there was no city in Chandigarh, but Naroji told him that the recovery has to be settled here, okay, Naya Raipur, Gandhinagar, Gandhinagar, in 1976 also, Noida.  After settling down, his story is as much  The play out could not happen because of them the key had more inclination towards blue collar workers and across the Yamuna it was not a very big great area of ​​East Delhi also South Delhi is very strong and Gurgaon is below South so from there the people from South Delhi  A connection was made between DLF Phase 1 and Phase 2 and now people will say that the planning of Noida is good, of course the planning is good, the authority has been there since a long time, the Noida authority is there since 1976, GMD has taken this important thing in the last two-three years, this is not  I do n't know so that the population is in Noida, Gurgaon with a population of 2.5 crore, Haryana with a population of 22-23 lakh, do only people from Haryana live in Gurgaon or only people from UP live in Noida, but it is a feeder, not a leader  There must be people coming from outside as well, the population will be known now, we will get an idea, okay, but we could not attract them, what is the reason, we will also know whose aspirations are there, in Noida, the money of the government employees is also invested from left and right, as we have heard, a lot of money is spent  is like her  There is a different kind of money in Gurgaon, there is a lot of corporate money, there is a lot of investment money. I am not saying that corruption is more in which area or not, there is equality in all of them. If I believe this then I am not in that.  I am here but UP wants to invest more in Noida. If 100 people want to buy something in Noida and are buying then it is possible that UP may be 9095 in it. If NRIs are also buying in Noida then that NRI belongs to UP.  No matter how much you go, if you go to the airport of your pocket, then if I was in Gurgaon, Gujarat, I used to like seeing every 26 cc car there, I am not even talking about 4 26 cc, but it seems so What is 426 doing here in Gujarat, everything is going on here, so wherever Gaj 12 is going on, there 426 comes up, so this is psychology, now we have to see how much that desire is and its paint capacity and How rich and how much money do you have because  The city will be affected only as much as the money there is in the pockets of the people coming to the city. Many people are caught up in the discussion of good and bad. This is good and bad, brother, what is good for you is not good for others, what is good for others is not good for you.  Who are you, tell me? For example, for a labourer's child, whose school cannot upload his/her name anywhere or is keeping the child completely illiterate, for him, government school is very good, he/she will get some books, some government incentives, he/she will get a good position than remaining illiterate. And God helped him and he developed a sharp mind, if he gets a good teacher then maybe he will be able to achieve something in life, it is good for him, but maybe if you are from a middle class family or a rich family then that school is not good for you, so this is it  The thing I want to tell you is that for whom Gurgaon is good, for whom Noida is good and for whom it is good, only those will contribute the growth factor, for that you have to understand that there is crowd at the dhaba, there is crowd at the ready, you can even book a five star hotel Where should you invest your money, which one should you get and where you will get more returns, it feels good but I am also not from the page industry Well there is another lion, now I don't take its name otherwise people will say that you are naming more lions but they will come in other companies so we cannot mix our personal choices, better ones are available in Noida.  If it seems logical then I will put it there and if it rains then you have to keep both the things and emotions separate because if you get emotional we have to have a relationship and want money, Noida startup's G for Gurgaon was almost 1 in the month of September last year Years have passed and the share price of that project has reduced by 20-25%, the sales were so good that it was sold out 15-20 days before but it left on the first day itself, you have to understand this, I will link up the video like this further  I will try to start from where I leave off, Energy Aryan Fever of Gurgaon Not Noida, there must be something old, there is nothing of Old Noida there, so further I will explain in this way, I will explain and the series will proceed according to what kind of reaction comes. very much if there are people in it like this  If it happens then it is spoiling our thing, what happens if I spoil it, and Vichitra who is getting disturbed means that something is wrong, if you say that something is very good and no one is telling it to be a little good  Okay, it 's a 1.5 crore company, there are ₹1.5 crore deficiencies in Gurgaon, out of those, I will show 10-15 deficiencies, out of those 1.5 crore, I will tell you, right now, from where will I count 1.5 crore, otherwise how many videos will I make, then I will show 10-15 deficiencies  I will tell you and despite those workers, how much sense do you make, when will the deficiencies be removed, how much is happening, I will try to explain it in the best possible way, I could not make it in one go, that is why I decided to start the series, how are you feeling  I have to tell you that further we will do it in different parameters, there is no need to irritate me, depending on where I kept the money, I don't want things from Gurgaon people, I don't want gears from Noida people, okay then don't do it like this otherwise that will not happen fell jokingly  It happens means I am going to tell because the sentiment is not like that, I mean if the sentiment was like this then why was I requesting, I know what my sentiment is, I know what the result will be and quietly make it yours, okay because I have not contested the election in Gurgaon  I will fight in Noida, I don't need Pappu elite, I do n't need votes, so this is just to understand and also to make the larger audience understand what is happening, okay and who is what, will decide where you should buy and this  Video by saying, if you are from UP then no one is stopping you from crying and clinging to each other and if you are from Haryana then of course you are a game for the rest of the people because where will you go, okay then we will address them, thank you
