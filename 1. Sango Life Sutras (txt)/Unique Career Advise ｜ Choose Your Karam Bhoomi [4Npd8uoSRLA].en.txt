Normally if you are a North Indian or a South Indian, you go with your head down, you have a brother or a job, if I am looking for a package of 50 lakhs, then go to Biology, I cannot refuse. Because when the money becomes so long then it is not necessary that much but the system which is running in the beginning, hot land is very important because your comfort level with the city defines your productivity, even if you choose a small city and you think that Here I have to type 10, 15 less because I have planted winners and all that on it, you guys can join, earlier also a video of mine must have come, people must have seen it, this is advice on career, brother, find a place for yourself, catch Chandigarh Take Chandigarh, take Delhi, take Gurgaon, if you have any inherent advantage that you live in Udaipur, if your parents have property there, I want to play some kind of homework resort home stay, then take it because that will help you in your next 5-10 years  There is growth in it, you have an ecosystem there  The people there, driver, bank, shop, system, road, your comfort level, people think that they will google these things and go away, it does not make any difference, one is our ease of living and secondly everybody knows us and up, every time in shifting, like I am going to start my first happiness course which I have taught called Constant of Unlife if you guys haven't taken the happiness course you can get my platinum membership of sign up through likes or you can get it through yours whatever choice you have it cost  D is almost fine, so I have taught everything in it, okay, how will you do it, you can do any job, you can do anything, I mean everything, I am a traveler friends, I keep roaming, I mean you have to get the same constant and be very clear  It is possible that when you initially do something, there may be some problem in your Karmabhoomi, you may have to make changes once, but much changing is not going to help you in connection with your business, in connection with expanding your business, or sometimes for 6 months or 8 months. can't go anywhere else for 12 months  Nobody sings but keeps date constantly, have you seen these film stars, okay, they shoot all kinds of movies, go to award functions, do some business, go for tours but do business, they roam around everywhere and if they have never seen Bombay, then Mumbai  You have chosen your land of work, now pick it up and tell me what is so special about it, fighting is so expensive in Mumbai, property is so expensive there, all this you can have anywhere in Rajasthan, people can open a place somewhere else- Why don't you shift the place from here to there? All of them have been running for so many years. It is not like there is a manufacturing plant which can be picked up and taken away. You open a factory like Maruti and then all the supply is also there.  There is an assembly line and it will be made from there and where should we go now, it is not like this, the film industry is not like this, this phone-won does not mean phone, it means camera, there are 10, 15, 20, 50 people, they go somewhere, they shoot and half the shooting is done  You keep coming here and there to edit pictures, to edit songs  You can go anywhere for songs, you can record them anywhere, but you have made them your ecosystem, so if you want to become a hero in a Bollywood Hindi movie, then you will have to go to Mumbai, no matter how much shooting happens in Delhi, but you have to go there.  If you have to buy a van BHK, then the people who have chosen your work place, it never changes again, it has its own benefits, sometimes you should think about it like this, why is it like this, why can't you shift, many people cannot shift once it company gets settled in Bengaluru  Now, whether there is any growth there, when there is some infrastructure, or there is traffic jam, it seems this way or that, brother, they have taken advantage of it, only then there is growth, I am telling you, only then there is growth, Warren Buffett is such a rich man, he can live anywhere, he lives there only  This is their office, they haven't changed anything in the past 50 years, everything is the same. Whatever we do, we get a lot of peace in life. I am telling you how this is, you don't know what the traffic is like, you do n't know who will collide with you, it is just in your hands  There is nothing in your hand, if you do that variable then your question will never be solved in your entire life  This message, I want to give, is a very big message, you will select your karmabhoomi, now in that karmabhoomi, I also have this place and this thing, when you become a sir and you tell the girl with whom you are going to get married, to the girl's family  You will tell them that this is my thought process, you will become a very desirable groom, the girl's family and the girl who is there, they also don't want this, every girl wants that now it should become like a home, it should become Saharsa, father and mother live at my place This is my relative, there should be some clarity in life now, there are not many people, we enjoy travelling a lot, so every year for 2 years we pack our bags, take our children out of school, then get them admitted again, it's a pain in the ass, brother  No, it is possible but it is not economically possible.

You people know about all those admission fees, this fee, that fee.  It is the greatest blessing that is given in the first place at once.  The child stays in the same school till 12th standard, rest just the monthly fee is given, rest you have extracted all the juice, if not this, it means you are going every one and a half years, then his/her school dress is changing, the pattern of the child's school is changing  Friends are changing, okay, teachers are changing, the child has to go and prove it again.
