Hello friends, Seven belief systems which Indian middle class needs to break and question and change. This 2024 new year is coming, I have brought seven things for you guys. You tell me how many you agree with, how many you don't agree with, and how many you will change.  How many will you break, how many will you question, this video may cause pain to some people, by getting pain, you can become free from that pain, emotions of crying may arise inside you, of anger may also come, of happiness may come, of liberation as well  You can come depending on who you are, so who you are, you will decide how you react to what is being told. My job is that of a social reformer. I get lashes, I get love, I get respect, I get anger as well, so I am a part of all those things.  I am fully ready for it, I will throw my ball, you have seven balls now, you explain it to me properly, tell me whether you enjoyed it or not, the first belief system is respect your elders, it is right, respect your elders is one  The system of a very big middle class, one should respect the elders, it is incomplete, yes it is incomplete, one should not only respect the elders, one should definitely respect the elders, but what about respecting the younger ones, respecting the youngsters because there will be many people in your life who will always  They will be elders to you because they were born before you, so you should always respect them. I did not say you should not, but you will never be respected again, otherwise your younger brother will never be respected, your younger sister will never be respected, children will not be respected  It will not be for the children of the children, it will not be for the younger ones, it will not be for the employees, it will only be for the senior ones, it will never be for the juniors, so it cannot be one-sided, this system of might is right has been created with great force.  It should not be just respect your elders but respect your teachers and respect your gurus. No, why not respect students? Why only respect teachers? Why the respect should only be to teachers? Why not to students? So, this 2024 let's  Respect everyone why should we only be the elders have the right because this is the default setting, the right to spread rumours about anything, elders can spread rumours anywhere respect elders don't talk to like this, don't do this what about their emotions so this is the first thing I should do and the second thing  He is also asking to change the thing 'always speak the truth', yes I am telling this, always speak the truth, truth should be spoken, ok but who should speak, everyone should speak, can you hear the truth, can some people hear the truth, it is very easy to say  Is it so, children are told to speak the truth or should tell the truth to their parents. Many a times they even get beaten up, then the next time they think whether to tell or not. They are also judged on the basis of their truth. Where are the elders, parents?  Some times people tell the truth very selectively about their family and themselves, in order to hide these addictions they don't tell the truth, so this is a two way traffic, it should work both ways and when sometimes the children tell the truth then Don't behave rudely because there is a belief system that one should speak the truth and that is linked to the previous belief system, so this belief system is that in 2024, I am speaking as a social reformer to the Indian middle class, brother, why am I choosing Indian Middle class because the rest who are of very lower class and rich have different funds, this is our entanglement, there is something inside the middle class, so this question has to be asked, the third thing, the third important thing is parents, after God, parents r  Next to God friend, what are you doing, are you spoiling the people or are you doing this because there will be many people of all types, some will look at me with curiosity, some will listen to me right now, some will want to run away, some will want to listen, some will want to look at me with hatred, you just tell me ahead  If you listen to the whole thing then I will tell you that you are getting to know what you are doing, I can feel these things before, I am feeling this only on the recording, but still I muster up the courage to try and tell you how this God complex will take you to the next level of God. could have had sex  Like all animals do, and they produce another offspring, just like animals do, so this gives them godly status, what's the problem with this, whatever I'm telling you about this system, there is pain in my consultation, I 'm a doctor of pain of the soul  I try to remove the pain of the soul, if there is pain in the soul then the parents thought of this from somewhere because their parents told them, he told them, this tradition has been going on that parents are like God, so now  There can't be any mistake in him, there ca n't be any mistake in his thought process, there ca n't be any mistake in his motivation, he cannot manipulate, he cannot be selfish, he cannot be selfish, nothing can happen to him because he is like God, he has such a God complex.  Beings are normal like brother we too have made mistakes our thinking was like this at that time we were helpless eco system was like this yes now it is like this when the country was poor so some theories were implemented now it is not that poor so the theories should be changed people say  What is theta? Theta is a Greek word meaning  Whatever your reasoning, visioning, whatever your thought process is, it should change, so by God knows, because other cultures have not done this much, I do n't know why we glorify it so much and do it in the name of culture. 2 24 Brother, some belief system is coming, if it is causing pain, trouble, not helping the mind, just because it is being run in some history, tweak it a little friend, some Englishman had said this, who said that  If you write it, your GK will be checked, father is the child is the father of man, brother that curiosity is there in the child, right? The parents have a one-sided work going on, one-sided love, first, second, third, belief system, if You look at mine, all three of these are interlinked, a one-sided program is going on and it causes a lot of pain, let's move on to the fourth one, now it will start to become a little different, it's not that I am the only one holding on, it's not only my parents who are holding on to the fourth  I am different, this is the believe system, the fourth one is your care for others Selflessness is a good thing, should n't one care for others, there should not be selflessness, you are going to teach us to be selfish, listen, listen a little, what is there in this, it gets hung up on most of the women as well, these things affect women more Also taught are suppress your feelings, suppress your requirements, suppress your emotions and sacrifice, these were the big movies of Nutan ji, Meena Kumari ji, on which the elder generation grew up and said that yes, now you have come to know, Munna, and at the end of the movie it was revealed that This was a mother, the lady of the house, she made a big sacrifice and everybody used to come and go, this is going into everybody's subconscious and causing a lot of pain, and what is happening because of this, what pain is being caused by this, what problem is occurring, I will tell you.  This has penetrated very much in one generation, specially among women, and what is going to happen among those who link it is a very important point, out of the seven points, you have to focus a lot on this, because  I have fulfilled so many responsibilities, I have fulfilled so many responsibilities that I felt that if I do it now, then what is my responsibility brother and suddenly the program of the next generation is different, so because of that auto immune diseases are getting triggered in the body in one generation, you me  I am listening, if there is any woman in your family from 1950 or 1960, then check with them how many of them have arthritis, osteoarthritis, joint pain, bone pain, autoimmune disease and if not, if the men have also evolved in this way  And those who feel like this that your father has done so much for the family, for the younger brothers, for the elder brothers, what did he get, he got this, he got that, these kinds of things are going on, then brother, there is blood pressure, heart problem.  So I am not talking about teaching selfishness, what am I talking about teaching, all the people who travel in an airplane and 99% of my audience do it because it is a very normal thing in India, so the aero hostess tells  This is so that if there is some emergency, first of all the oxygen mass will come down, before helping others apply your own oxygen first, do not jump to help others, if someone gets injured, the ship shakes here and there, if there is some emergency, first apply oxygen to yourself  That only when oxygen arrives will you be able to help someone. You have to take care of yourself first. If you are suppressing your own emotions, doing things compulsorily, not living your own life, then there is so much irritability, so much bitterness, so much frustration in life.  You will be in so much pain that you will not be able to do anything to anyone and the sin will enter your body and that will come out brother, if I hold an orange and squeeze it, only orange juice will come out, not pomegranate juice, that means the one inside  Whatever is there will come out, now if only that will come out, then if people do this over a period of time, then be self-conscious, love yourself, first make yourself a little happy, after that do as much as you can, as much as you have, as much faith, as much mood, as much energy do it as much as you wish and as much as the situation requires  It is the same thing, do not expect any result like I did this and then this will do it for me, do only that much which does not give you any expectation of getting anything in return, if you are doing every work with the expectation of getting anything in return then please do not do it.  Do that is the message this believe system we have to ask questions let's go next four are done seventh is very amazing and you have to listen to the fifth sixth now the fifth is coming for you it is very interesting if you guys can laugh a bit then  Tell me whether you enjoyed the fifth one or not, do you agree or not, and I have to give you this report card, okay now let's move ahead, work hard, hard work is great, now you will say, I understood, you understood, smart work, smart work.  This is also nonsense, listen, I am telling you even more than that, I will not tell you anything that you have already read, I bring those things which will be written, heard, told for the first time, only then I am the number one clarity giver, not just like that  Now listen, this life of ours has not progressed ahead of hardworking people. People don't take it anywhere, listen carefully these lazy people, lazy people take the world forward, hey, do you want something cooked, yes, you want something cooked, only then the fire came, otherwise hard working people don't keep chewing, someone lazy comes to whom I told him to work so hard, friend  There is a program for fire and fur, some goods had to be taken from here to there, things were going haywire, then someone thought of the wheel, the hardworking man thought, he was already working like a donkey, some lazy person thought of a halt  There is a need to take something new in life. Crores of people have seen some fruit or apple falling from above, but Newton sahib was sitting at a standstill. He derived G from it. G for gravitational force. When Archimedes was sitting at a standstill in the bath tub, then that theorem was derived.  And then he ran to tell the world that it is very important for the flour mill to grind, in our India everyone's grandmothers who are listening, if not grandmother, then if you are a very youngster then read grandmother, okay that mill was grinding and that lazy man was lying down,  He set up a flour mill somewhere for his wife. This is a  It is a fact that if you link all these things with women who work hard, the women who keep talking and keep working hard, then a lazy man brings something out from somewhere, he washes clothes like this, pat pat pat pat and then goes and comes somewhere.  There is an automatic washing machine, if not hard work then it would have been better, it would have washed, it would have been better to do hard work, man has made remotes for everything, who would go and change the channel, and earlier the channel used to be Doordarshan, it could not be changed, so the remote had no value, then that Delhi  The people got the Metro channel, there would be two channels, so they had to go and do it like this, then go and do it like this, friend, how many times should I do it like this, so many channels, how many times should I go and do the volume like this, when should I do it like this, then the remote came, the lazy man told me, if you are working hard, then go and do it hard  I should keep on working, it should be hard work, you cannot even lift this much, they will break, now you have got remotes of fans also, ACs are also in front of you, so what else is there to do, this is hard work only  A lazy man does this. Now when AI will come, who knows what irrelevant things it will make him do. I want to tell women also that this is the meaning of everything.  Whenever he is a man or something, you will make him a sexist, a woman is not a scientist, hey I am saying this as an example, there is so much of sit down comedy, you should enjoy it too, every time the woman will speak, she will bring a problem to that lazy man, that lazy man  The man will make one thing and then the woman will say, okay, let two-three more things be made better; the clothes are drying somehow, they are getting washed, now they should somehow get ironed and reach the cupboard on their own; this is the trouble of another man.  This is happening in life, this will also happen while we are here, AI is coming now, that the clothes get pressed somehow and get put away automatically, that problem also means it gets dried and can be kept, then where will the woman go, so this was that hard  Don't glorify it so much on time, it is a pause, go to pause, there should be lot of time in your day when you can ideate and think, what I am trying to say is that you spend the whole day asking about productivity, holding on to your time, that means  something to do something in something do something do  do something do something why are you sitting so comfortably why are you sitting so comfortably these people are sitting so comfortably madams and sirs and children these are taking the world forward the ones who are sitting comfortably who are sitting under stress He is not doing anything like this all his time, like us, I will say like me, like us, these ideas come to me or what do you think, you can think, you run on the treadmill  Never run from 8 MPH to 10 MPH, no matter how much, think, try to think, your mouth will open as soon as you think about it, you will have to be in the moment, such ideas come to people like us, Laat Saheb, sit comfortably here on the sofa like this  Let us think comfortably that we are facing problems, we observe the problems of the people, what is happening, what belief systems need to be broken, what is going wrong, so in 2024, I will cover five things, which one is your favourite, which one do you like?  You will break it and question it, it will be fun  All five are liberating you, aren't they? There are still two more for you and then they will cause some pain to people and because I also bring embarrassment in society, it is my hobby to ask questions, people feel that the next sixth one is coming for you, parents what not to serve this also oh so hey listen listen listen enjoy enjoy listen I am bringing some aspects I am bringing two aspects in this I am bringing two aspects for the society which I want to end the questions  I am not saying this to ask a question, I am asking you to tell me two things, brothers and sisters, especially two things, did you enjoy telling me? Did you not enjoy it? Two aspects, a man also has parents, a woman also has parents, a boy also has parents, a girl also has parents  It happens to the son as well as the daughter-in-law, so this service is for the parents, who have one daughter or two daughters, if the daughter leaves the house then the syllabus is over, so now the service of those parents No, because the girl's parents were born after taking iron tablets specially  There is no pain in the delivery of a girl, no juice comes out, no calcium comes out, nor does the girl drink milk, there is more pain in the delivery of a boy, the boy drinks more milk, the soul of the boy's mother becomes very weak, then the boy's parents  There is a great need for service in the society and that boy has nothing to do, he wants to get it done, you have brought him here to serve their parents, parents also, yes, that is why there are conflicts going on in marriages, brother service  If parents should be served then society should say that every parent should be served, parents are worthy of service, I refused but if you are a parent then why shouldn't all parents be served? And if she has to be from the same set then why would she do bahu rani hey which sister should she do these days the parrot is talking nonsense brother everything is in bad condition girls should do it at least ask about their mothers these days they don't do anything about it  There comes a second point on this, I know this point too, it will be like this that hey you, there are you discussing this right now, nobody is going to do everybody  This is the second important point to convey to many people in the society, if this thing touches you, if it touches your heart, if this thing touches you then say wow, it was fun, like it, subscribe and You should have the courage, either a child or an old person, to post these videos on their family group. As soon as my videos are posted on the family group, the family members scatter and it seems as if the hunter fired the shot and the bird was sitting on the ball.  And the whole thing flew away, it happens like this, many people leave the group, the group becomes left the group, many people post it again and again or if there is some other mischievous kid, then instead of left the group, his message also gets removed from the group. But still if you want to become that badass kid then you can upload my videos to avoid people looking at them with hateful eyes, what nonsense are you talking about, Guruji, are you spoiling things, even if you post them like this people will see them and feel ashamed  Those who have a little bit of awareness and intelligence will understand the other thing which comes Now listen carefully brothers and sisters, the real problem is that parents repeatedly talk about service because even after 35, 40, 45 years of marriage, you still cannot tolerate so much bitterness and toxicity between husband and wife. Tell me how many parents do you have who fight with each other at the age of 60, 65, 70, 75, 80. They used to fight even in childhood. Married couples fight but a stage comes when they have to make peace.  or take a little be at peace with each other get used to each other if someone is married to a demon or even if someone is married to a witch then you can always be at peace because you know that demon for 35 40 years or  you know that chudal sorry for using such extreme words for anybody but then as an example I need to tell you that this is also the worst case scenario i am sure husband is not a demon and Females are not witches, they are less than witches and they are less than demons, if there were so many demons and witches, then the first thing that would have happened would have been eaten by the demon, the witch would have eaten it, something would have happened, it is not that bad, brother, you are not used to it yet  But also look at your mother, look at your father, you look at this, look at this, you don't ask us, you don't ask us, hey you are there to ask each other, the one or two who are there to ask are you and there is one in life  The time will come when one spouse will go away and one will remain, so there is a message for those elders too, you may be alone in life now, but you were not always alone, you have lived a full life, you have some pride and satisfaction when nothing is happening and parents do not want  To get evolved in the happy lives of the kids I hope my audience understands English enough that the parents are not able to achieve anything great in their lives, they wake up in the morning, do pranayam, go for a walk saying ha ha hoohoo, eat some almonds and  These walnuts are baked  They eat only once a day, at 11:00 am and sleep after that, they feel that the day has still not dawned, it is 1 o'clock, what should they do now because that day will continue at night, everyone has 24 hours, so now this is their life  In it they say that someone should come, whereas these parents have their own happening life, of their children and their grand kids, they should interfere in their lives, what happened, how many marks did you get, how are the exams going, how are your studies going and what are you doing, how much money are you earning  Are you earning, is there any shortage, is there any problem, is your food going well, what else is going on, are you going somewhere, take me along too, at least ask me sometimes, okay do something friend, show me the movie, don't you want to see it, come on  Bhaiya you will keep sitting here with your attitude, I will ask this one, two or four times, you will say yes or no, you will do something, day to day life will go on, I hope you understood this thing because the husband and wife are not getting along, the partner is that much because what have you done, age  You just passed some time but whatever bitter thing was there, it was not resolved  You did it in your 20s, you didn't do it in your 20s, you didn't do it at the age of 30, you kept going, that man kept going in his job and money, you kept going because of your children, you kept putting your bitters inside the carpet, kept putting it, kept putting dust and then when it all comes out  The children have gone to their places, old age has come, the marriage has happened, everything is done, you have got a house, everything is done, now you think that how should I deal with it, then you cannot bear the problem of toxins in your married life, this is the message and this society has  To question this thing, that more than service, you should be truthful to yourself, that was my point two, always speak the truth, that is the right thing, but first speak the truth to yourself, before sharing knowledge with others, speak the truth first to yourself. speak to others later speak to yourself don't speak to yourself because it will crush so many of your belief systems if you have heard the things that I am saying, many of you must have felt pain of being depending on  chach side you are many  They will get liberated after getting the pain, many will get so much pain that if they are my subscribers, they will leave me and run away or will write something inappropriate, which is ok but society still needs to discuss all these points and take your 192 a little up and down  It is possible that I have given a template, Guruji will come and give a template that yes brother these are the issues, these are the issues, you add a little of your own flavour to it, tweet it your own, do it a little less, do it a little more, somewhere I have expressed more anger, you felt that there is anger.  If you say a bit too much, reduce it there, if you feel it is less somewhere, increase it there, but the issue is important, the seventh point is a bit random, the point is too much, everyone says what is the point, it is not a believe system, there is a line which everyone is together  They leave us, no one stays with you forever, friends have gone away, it's okay, the relatives who were good and close have gone away, now no one asks about it, many people generally cry about it at a certain age, it's okay, youngsters also cry at times.  It's okay and the elders also cry together  If they will leave you, then I want to give a take in this, people will leave you physically, they will leave you mentally, they will leave you, whatever happens will definitely happen, what does it mean if you don't leave your side, people will also leave you  You leave your own side, which means the desires in your own life, do not leave yourself feelinglessly, tell about your dreams and your requirements, tell people that yes, they are mine, and if my dreams are not fulfilled then maybe someone will come and give you a reality check that  You had too many dreams, it was beyond your capacity anyway, you are just saying this, you are thinking that if it had not been like this then I would have done this, okay, it's okay, I am giving you a chance now, you can do it, maybe you will get a reality check.  Or it may be possible that someone helps you and your dream gets fulfilled or someone accepts your great sacrifice, but whichever of the three things happens, it will liberate you, it will give you peace, it will be better for you, but with your support  Don't leave them, people have left them alone, they want something, they don't want anything, it's okay, do  You want to do anything, you want to, no and then you will have dreams. Is life going on like this in 2024 that if someone tells you something openly that this is what I need, this is what I require, even then you will not be able to fulfill his wish? You have very less chance of that, but at least if he is the next generation, at least if he is a husband, at least if he is a friend, anyone, he will know about your requirement, if someone of yours is inaugurating the Ram temple on 22 January 2024, many elders will feel like doing it.  If we have to go then tell your children openly right now, so that they can plan their schedule in February or March for two-four days, tickets for Lucknow, taxi from there to Innova hotel shuttle, it is not easy, you can just go like this, that is your schedule.  Put it in, you will keep thinking in your mind that yes, he doesn't even ask, take the requirement and tell me that these are my seven-eight requirements, you will tell me seven-eight requirements, one will be the meat and second will be the practical approach, I am telling you and  If you have to cry then brother keep crying, the whole world is crying, why can't people be in their faces, why can't the middle class question all the seven eight things, seven things watch I have told, how did you guys like the video, do you think about this thing  We will share, don't leave yourself, the world will leave you, don't leave yourself, make yourself happy, learn something new about yourself, a new year is coming, always have to question the belief systems in life, try to crush those who dominate  The systems are good, they will survive, the ones that are causing pain will be broken, just because these were the things told at some time and that 2024 is coming, the new year is coming, even astrology teaches that in the country, the country's time and place  Kaal means time and the character which some body is there, things change according to that, you cannot apply some rules in blanket on anyone, this is what will happen, this is right, that is right, then it becomes a work of commandments, then in that  There is no stiffness and when there is no stiffness in life, but there is stiffness, then the stiffness causing diseases, auto immune diseases come which we call osteot arthritis and things like this, how many of them have it, you tell me we do not have to have stiffness in life because first the mind  That arrogance will get transferred to the body and we have to teach all the people with whom this is happening that they have understood this thing and try their best, people like me have started a campaign, are you with me, if you are with me then what You will share this video with only 10 people in this new year 2024 because wishing new year is Happy New Year Happy 2024 hey brother I want pomegranate juice, if you are putting sugarcane then you will get sugarcane juice only, you will not get pomegranate juice, so say Happy New Year and say something happy  It is not going to happen if you have to do the same things Happy New Year Actually if you want to say Happy New Year then you will have to do something okay so for pomegranate juice you will put pomegranate only brother if you add sugarcane then you will get sugarcane juice only so you need pomegranate juice  You are putting sugarcane in it and thinking that somehow someone will come and turn this sugarcane juice into pomegranate juice, no it's not going to happen, how many Happy New Year you can say, how many good wishes you can give, best wishes, may all your wishes come true, think about it a little  We should wish for this, many people are carrying many wishes, I don't know what all wishes they are carrying, so I hope this 2024, these seven things the middle class will at least discuss, you need to put that extra effort, I understand it takes effort to forward because the moment  If you forward something then it is considered that it is your ideology, no matter how much you liked the video, at what point if you don't have the courage, this thing has not been said by you myself, but you have to tell it to someone, hey that  What will he think, then that happy new year is not going to be yours because if you run the same belief system, then you are sitting with pain, then the pain will continue in 2024 as well and will continue in 2025 as well, we have to break those questions  So whoever you do, write 10 in the comment section, those who liked the video, write MG, out of the seven points, which one did you find the best, did you find it hard working or did you find it next to God, parents  Or if you feel it is about care for other self necessity then tell that, those who like all the seven tell that, those who don't like all the seven then brother there is no need to write bad, Jai Ram ji ki n
