If it is there then double it, I know you people, I have taken 50 lakhs and with the decision of Rs 1 lakh, PM is in it. You are a game of five percent and five and a quarter percent, I take it that the game is being played in the name of mummy ji, mummy things and she has zero tax liability, if it becomes a game of tax liability in father's name or if mother's pension would have come, then water and  It will go into the pit, which I am telling you, but even if I take it, they are not paying it tight, then mother gets 21 thousand rupees per month, mention of the year in T20 cricket, then okay this 50 lakh, so if mother had given 21 thousand rupees every month  I am taking them and using them or I have gifted them to my daughter, which ladies do with their suits and sarees, it's okay, basically I have taken care of my small household expenses, it's okay, which ladies get cleaned and I save from that as well  10,000 rupees, okay, so how much will your FD be next year, brother, brothers and sisters, confirm light, if mother takes this 30,000, eats it, enjoys it, then this felt tip, next year mother tells me to increase my FD, bhaiya  If you take the money then you will get the money for this month which is zero and SDO will go  How much 52.5 ok understand then it will be next year how much file is there if it was not there in the previous year means I am taking it out like this if I am taking it out from it then it will remain that much okay now what is the basic premise in real estate how when you complete with real estate civil  There are two things in the state, your add Samsung S8 delayed not only prostate your monthly something else this description will be read every day, we will discuss it but if I assume that you will get four percent which is very easily in today's day, live check Acharya calculation everything is good Those who explain, it is okay on the invested price, now many people say that someone bought it in Janakpuri for three lakh rupees in 1996, okay ji now if his rent for the year was Rs 10,000, i.e. how much is Rs 30,303 per month, this foot ask the image of the flat, okay  This rental yield fund was pin locked in front of brother 31 but if today these calculations were explained, Rent vs Buy are everywhere on YouTube these days that rental yield  So brother, three percent is 2.7 so what will they do that its value in the market today is 1.5 CR, this one brother who said 3 lakhs has become one and a half crores, Janakpuri Friday is okay, so if he is giving four lakh rupees then  If you divide four lakhs by 1.5 CR then it will come to your 2.5 per cent so it will lose on this now I am Sangwan Deep Bhai Sahib this is a party of three lakhs, its coming to some 133 yes the one who has taken 1.5, it is a purchase for him  For me this 2.5 is fine, so real estate is considered to be of thirty years' duration, brother life seems to end in dust, I have patience, if you are 25-30 years old and I talk to you about your fifty-fifty-five years, then you will be shocked  You will become everybody wants to be a millionaire in three years 4 years is all right so this is how you have to watch this video then you have seen one thing that if you are a senior citizen today then if you tell me today  you are fine soon please why are you serious that your happy birthday is late 2017 happy birthday did you understand one happy birthday answer zero has one p takes shy p birthday then 27 years child will have a happy birthday  A good looking person feels that he will be 1765 in 5 years, then he becomes 1765, well he feels that if he is 65th then he will go till 70, he becomes 70th and then it seems that whatever is left is ending. Direction till 375 ji has given us 75th, 8 has been done, your tasty is enough, now any time 85b has come, program has been done in 2787, copper zinc, when papa ji is 80 then mummy ji, by the way, this year Vishal is younger in age, also like this  Who is mummy GST and only average and if she would have won more than three to four then if mummy ji went nine to two then this program was this 2017 plus 6 500 gadrai  We have to play a game of 30 years, what will happen in that Africa in 30 years, do you know, four people will not be able to eat food due to cyber attack, on top of that, I am full of passion for the coast, so mother will actually need money that 292 s Major, I need an attendant to take care of me. Someone is this bowl, don't say namaste, no son should say namaste because brother, he will also get into trouble. If you are an ATM, then your child is 25 years old, your child is also 5560 rupees old.  There is pain inside the scam, he can give money and if he has to pay more then his wife will be there so you have to make your own arrangements, the parents who smoke cigarettes then what do you have to do these elders who are listening to you will buy the elements and the more beautiful the children, the more beautiful we will get  What they have to do is to divide their parents' 50 lakhs into 25 lakhs each. 258 pension BFs and get them to invest money in property worth 1.25 CR which is in their name. This is 20%.  Because I gave them 20% and 80% in your name, I gave the next topic in whose name it would be, it goes on between the sons so that you give 20% to them, what is there in it, the capital appreciation will never be old  he cannot enjoy it because his ticket to go up can be taken up by selling the no provision chapter on taga ninety by making a draft and taking it up, so all the elders say that we will leave our properties, don't make our chief's safety measures, no provision, if you are a person who can't buy your property  After selling it, he takes the draft and goes somewhere up and in the new world, there is a drop, that provision should be there and everybody knows and then he should exercise for 24 hours, not 24 hours, son, I can go that, but I was not taking it, so like this, oh brother, it gets left behind, if anyone sees  There is no God, I should not give this also but no one gives, it breaks, what is the spelling of breaks, it breaks in English, the song does not break, whether it is heart or anything else, if it breaks, it breaks, it gets released sometimes  Don't put the onus on your children by leaving us  You have it and has anyone else got such a big amount that they can take a poor person's child and if the kids are so dirty then they are leaving something for them but because I will leave 5 crores for you and 2 crores for you  I will go and I don't know how to do it. Today we are living in it. Now the value of the house of my parents is 30%. You are also living together, we cannot take rent from you. That's fine. We cannot sell it because the house itself is worth three crore rupees and  If you are in need of 20, 30, 40 thousand rupees then how do you get rid of that need that you will do acid current to someone else and he is taking leave and coming 21 times from FD now what I am saying is that end the game of shift FD, make it real  Put it in the estate along with the children and take the rate of your share. So if the property is giving full 4% rental, then you will get 4% on your 25 lakhs. Now you have to see this. Listen very carefully to the calculation that I am telling you.  hmm you put the property today as per my saying, if you understand then you will be fine in 2022  I put the property in the advertisement, it's ready, PA good, you put your share in the property worth 25 lakhs and when the property is sold, you get four percent internet, four percent not Alia, on this you get one lakh rupees i.e. 8250 OK per month and  How much did he get on that one too? ₹2500000. There was another one on that too. How much did he get without 1600. Okay, now you were getting 21000. This is a little less but this 21000 interest rate is going on the download cycle. 10 After a year, what do you think, there will be eight percent, three percent, two percent, the where moving top deserving government is the biggest equal, it is okay anyway, but you have to see that your moon is four percent, brother, listen carefully, all of them are very good  It is going to get punctured very soon, after all how long will it take to open, you don't even see how much your car rent increases by 10% every year, if I tell the person  yes it will not fall by 10 percent because if it increases from the base then write k will increase so I am saying that it increases, yours will increase by eight percent, it will increase by 8 per cent, if it increases by eight percent then your rent will double in nine years, so if you had invested earlier  Before 2014, if you start this year with 4%, then after nine years it will become 8%, after 18 years it will become 16%, after 27 years it will become 32% and when Happy Birthday happens in 36 years, then it will give 65% returns.  You will be getting the original management and this original investment. When you are moving towards Happy Birthday, 64052 will start at all people's front, then now it will increase, interest rates will go to zero, now it will go to zero like the investments went negative in Japan. I am a poor person from villages, I will also go to India, I don't know when I will go or not, but there is a download trend on it, all these points and increased qualification because of the greeting card issued, download cycle only to download  There is a cycle, any day, any acid, any system, I will show you by metrology, any thing goes up or down, I will show it by making a default diagram, I will explain it to you, it is okay to understand this according to 20 years, because  What I told you about Mummy ji, father, if you check, friend Mummy is on leave, then I will tell you the calculation, when any thing goes down, it doesn't go like this, it goes like that and when any thing goes up, it doesn't go like this, it also goes like this  It is that you can see the Parliament, see anything, it goes like this so now someone from this truck, but this line friend, like this towards it, the people below are going down like this but this is generally true Sudhir Vashishtha writing on the wall when they were talking here which I  I am telling you something, I am telling you in terms of Twenty-20, so what is learning, please I am in the shift loop, parents cannot buy anything with the children, they are buying ownership for them and what will be the benefit, if they get ₹ 2500000 for 20 But  If Mala has two kids then they have to play a game with both of them, somewhere they get 20 per cent ownership or maybe they get 30 per cent depending on it, so they have to understand carefully that this 25 lakh has increased  2 crores, it was the share of 1st June, it will go to you in inheritance, only then you have to pay attention, why should you give this knowledge to your business because it is beneficial for them and you are also benefited, parents are getting money and mother-  Father is not asking for money from you, that is for your benefit and whatever the parents are leaving behind, they are leaving behind two crores instead of 25 lakhs because in 30 years the property will grow that much, till the property is under construction it costs more, after that 45  But if the cent information link comes on the rising quintal then the cent of clans is rising from 8 to 10, it can also rise on 12, 14 cents because in a bullish market, the raid falls even more in a bullish market but on average you get the nominal GDP which  it's India's, it's India's GDP growth is six point right now 10.57 point five inflation is 6572 nominal GDP growth is play store 14% country 14 is revolting if you don't get angry on your fourth you will be left behind if you are playing the game of 5.25 then you are below 8.75  I want WhatsApp, I have understood that people, right now I will take questions, request of the recording, I will take that how many people enjoyed it, how many understood it, so give it and how many because there is nothing to agree or disagree in this
