Becoming Neighbours of Death  And people of your status are leaving or the ones free from it are staying there or people with big status were coming, the realization is that Delhi is so big, if you cover only Delhi then 500 videos can be made and even then there will be some mohalla, lane or something or the other  There will be no such area left. You are a party shifting from Raja Garden to Narayana. Your friends have a huge house in Narayana, say worth 80 crores, then your status is off.

It is possible. I want to do so, that is, every year, one% of the population of Delhi will shift to Gurgaon. So, it is not that the family will be free from this division.  If it is okay to do so, then 4% will shift to Delhi or Gurgaon in 4 years. One or both of them wanted to wait not three but four times for the election results of Punjab, but Delhi's future is also politically important. Insurance is on which side the camel will come  It will be available but my subscribers could not wait this long and I also had a lot of requests, so I am making it so that you know which direction the politics here is going to take and what politics is being played, for how many days it is free  Free electricity and water are also necessary  I would say that they also need to be taken care of, but what is happening because of that, in Rohini, sector 34 side 33 and I will not take any more bad name for the Jha plots, what kind of entry will the people have, and instead of going out in the evening, problems will arise, picture gentry  I don't get into this law and order, if some incident happens then the police is so good, but it's okay brother, do you want that this should happen to you in life, people don't even want this to happen to you, some do n't want to go home, you will write it in the comment section  The example given is wrong, because if I send it with the name then the thing gets spoiled, I don't want it, I just give examples because I will give examples that brother, today in Delhi no outsider is buying property there  This smell is normal. The amount of money that people have put into popular startups, properties worth Rs. 60 crore, 100 crore, 100 crore are being bought. Amitabh Bachchan ji has also left Delhi and sent his family home. Okay, he also got the post of Awara Boy.  He must have taken it, this neighbor, any one will buy it, good and expensive  At the rate and those time settings, any normal man who works in Gurgaon, whose salary is ₹3, 2 lakh, 4 lakh, 5 lakh and whose salary is even ₹1000000, cannot buy a house in Delhi, cannot buy a house in Delhi  The one who is selling his in Raja Garden, you sold something of yours, then this business in Narayana, there is a cardboard factory in Narayana, local politics, local things are also playing a lot of muted and its friends in Narayana are ringing  I was inside whose job is 8 crore and plot is worth 10 crore, he says that when I am not there all the builder floor people check my parking space everyday, my entry looks different, I am worth 9 crore so I feel the same  There should be no feeling, neither the people of Delhi, sitting in the houses you get the feeling that for how many years I have lived in Delhi that you will eat rotis, but ultimately the Delhi cannot be the same as outer Delhi nor your Jorbagh of Delhi  Your area is your home tips  The area giving the cigarette is the south Delhi area which is the posh colonies, there is also one last such place, Riya, you do not want to take the names of many different illegal colonies, you know everything, it cannot be there, yours which is in Rajouri  The people from the garden, their masters come here for shopping, the model there is an open plane in Rajouri Garden, you can see who was on it, which ones are roaming around, they want to buy, some sit back and some go away  Malviya did such a good job of his, you are thinking that this is Richie Rich's work far away, Papa, now the feeling of Delhi will not come there, now those who have business in Delhi, they cannot stick to it, this is our business, our shop, how can we go from below  She is doing a job, she doesn't want to sit around his neck, she wants to go there, papa will make an entry, this matter will be like this, I am not enjoying it, you tell me, your locality, your street has the status of people and a pro time is big, the camera is less  These people are coming out, coming out, coming out, those who are coming out, you have to see who is the eye opinion, if  Your status in your street has not decreased, those who are your comments, who were there 2030 years ago or even the meter is returning from you, then it means you live in the right place and continue disease, do not change the place, continue stain Delhi, if this is the case, but if  It is not like that, you live in such a place that even people who were less wealthy than you would leave you there, those with lower status also left and you are just hanging on because of some hesitation, then I think the time has come because the voltage You also have a plot of Rs. 67 crores and there is garbage outside, so even in this era, in this age, difficulty should be welcomed and not fit, even if you have made the songs with hundred percent effort, then also  No, you will not get more than 6.5 feet carpet area no matter how much you build, so do you want to live in a cement building or do you want to go to a better place, I will leave that to Delhiites. Do you want that Gurgaon Canal List should be included in this?  I am asking those who will do it this way or  I am asking the people who want to buy Gurgaon or those who have already bought it in Gurgaon and want to buy it, that if this 4% impact is on Delhi, then how many numbers does Gurgaon have for getting jobs, how much flour does it have and how much  People who eat rotis will come, you want a video on that because I had to enter the Delhi people, hi rises in Delhi there are voices of extreme less, whoever comes, the laptop goes, gets sold and those who are counted can be counted on the fingers of this hand  But you can count the people who are living in it properly, the rest you know is Delhi friends, it will just be a hundred and fifty yards, it will become 5025 yards, two-three floors will also be cut, all that is yours. It has happened and it will keep happening and no outsider will buy it. One person rolls his puri, then adds something to it and then buys the tadka. If someone buys it, then he will keep the circle rate of this chakli low.  They will keep running out of the sack and whatever it is that they carry around in their life  There is no value for it in our society, here from here to here, people are absolutely together, hanging on the metro of Delhi, no one got it, August 7, 8, 9 crores are there in your life, even then there is hatred in living there.
