One of my questions is how can a middle class guy become rich class, I mean if someone has to graduate from being a middle class to a rich guy, what are the tips for that, I mean of course a broader level answer can be to earn more money but that  Is it more of an outcome from the input perspective, what are the tips for that, hello Shamsher ji, my hello to your viewers as well, I try to answer this question in two parts that how can the middle class become rich, one is that in the same generation  Do you want to be rich or do you want to get rich gradually? I divide this into two parts. Suppose you belong to a middle class family and you are middle class today, then you should become rich or your next generation should move towards richness. Let's go to the next thing, this is the middle class one, you can think that I will use a few trap words, I am not able to remember many other words, so what's the big deal in this, this is a quick job, it is not possible because the middle class He gets involved in all kinds of historical work  He gets into a job and you cannot become rich by getting into a job, you go from lower middle class to middle middle class, from middle middle class to upper middle class and that touching the thrash hold of the rich and then your children cannot pick up many decent good jobs from there  You fall into the middle class, for example, you worked hard and became a top VP, got a good package in some corporate, got a salary of 5-6 lakh rupees per month, and your annual package also reached 80-90 lakh rupees, then you  It is very good, you are feeling comfortable but you have two kids and they are not doing so well now and I am guessing that you have turned 50 late and your kids are now 22, 30, 24 years old then  Suddenly you are still middle class only. Well, you have touched that thrush hold of the rich but the kids are not doing anything and suddenly you again fall into the middle class. As soon as you lose your job, you close your mutual fund. Investments, you have given one or two houses on rent and are living on that and you have spent it on children's education, coaching or their marriage, after that your money comes down to the same level, the biggest thing in this is  It is that the work you did for 30 years, there is no direct benefit transfer of it to the children, they are told to reinvent the wheel again, they have to do the English language teaching, so this is the biggest limitation, then you cannot become one, you cannot become one If you keep doing the same thing again and again, if somebody has become a lawyer, someone has become a chartered accountant and he is doing his practice and he has reached a certain level and his children have also taken up the same work and they are starting from where the father started.  They are still stuck, meaning that wherever they have reached, then they should become rich soon. If the father is in a government job, then his children cannot become rich. This is the message immediately that the family cannot become rich. And what is the biggest problem of the middle class? They want comfort.  So when you need comfort, you need that much  So if it happens then you have to remain at that level, this is also the biggest problem. So sir, if I understand correctly, one of your inputs is that instead of focusing on the job, focus on the business, so that whatever you do  The wealth that you generate can be passed on to the next generation rather than trading your time in doing a job which no matter how well you do it, it cannot be passed on to the next generation. As soon as we say about the job I used it and if I say apart from job, everyone goes into business, this is wrong, middle class cannot do business, this business is overrated, it is not within everyone's reach, there is neither so much business nor is there a need for so many, every man is a businessman and entrepreneur class  If it is not within your capacity then I am not asking you to do business, if you can do business then do it, I am not refusing but I am saying that there are some different businesses which will come under which category, if you assume you are Utter and I am Utter then this  Is it business, self employment or employment, what is this  The question is to do something that can be transferred further, for example someone's parents are doctors, they are running a small nursing home where babies are delivered, the mother is a gynecologist, the father is a pediatrician, they have established a good practice and  This is a good business, people feel bad about such things, if there is a hospital then call it a service, then the service is going on, now this kid goes from anywhere and gets a stamp and comes back saying that the doctor is not a grade doctor, they just go to Russia like this  He will not do the operation, he is not even that capable, but he will sit there, the administration will see to it, his name is doctor and he is very normal, now middle class doctors will come and work here, then he has an attitude of becoming rich that the thing which he has got  There was husband and wife, they were normal doctors, they worked for 30 years at other places and five years ago they opened their own nursing home by purchasing a plot and gradually they made a son, they made a son, they became a doctor, now they have brought a sister  A pathologist or radiologist or someone like that can also come and evaluate the value.  The addition has been made, now this family is on the path of becoming rich, this is as I told you, now you can relate this to any profession, make a change in law, make him an architect, make him a chartered accountant, but if he does a job in the government system  If the person is in a job in a bank or in a corporate sector, then the system of that thing cannot be such that he cannot go rich because he will be left out because the work that you cannot do till 70-80 years of age, then that work cannot be done at the age of 60 and at the age of 70.  There is a huge gap of 10 years in me. Doctor, if his hands are working then he is working and if he is not doing an operation, if his mind is working fine then he is issuing slips. Even the lawyer, now look at the top lawyers like our Manu Singhvi. Yes, or our Kapil Sibal ji who practices in the Supreme Court, he is a renowned lawyer, look at his age, before that there was our Ram Jeth Melani ji, he will keep on practicing, he will keep on practicing and his children, I do n't know  What is the status of their children? Inheritance is an Inherent  There is an advantage for Ram Jethmalani ji's son Mahesh Jeth, Mahesh Jethmalani definitely has it Sir Ji, correct, so this is the advantage, so in this thought process, the middle class is not thinking ahead, there is no planning [Music]
