Hello friends, the market is moving away from pricing and this normal conventional thing and I want to make my audience, the viewers, aware of this thing. Many people are already aware of this but I have not covered it properly as a topic.  As of now, that has to be covered and what is that confusion, what is the problem, rest of it happens in cities, how has the historical real estate been seen for money, the price of Dwarka Expressway is this, the price of Golf Course Extension is this, the price of New Gurgaon is this This is the price of Sona Road, the price of Sona is growing like Gurgaon, in which there is a lot of different kind of difference, I will just explain to you, now there is going to be a very good video, it is going to be in Mumbai, so you do not have to catch any price here.  That is, the rate of new Gurgaon has gone upto ₹9000, whose rate has gone upto ₹9000, my brother, whose fresh launch, high rise, lorise, premium project, there are so many different products, old products in Gurgaon market  Look, if I take the example of New Gurgaon, I am going to understand it in a very good way by taking different examples of the whole, watch it till the end if you want total clarity, if it has become 400-5000, then is there gold here, now I am going to answer those things because I  When I tell myself that India is number one in real estate clarity, yes, I give examples of Gurgaon, but this thing is applicable anywhere. If you are a teacher, you pick up one example, but that formula works.  Manipulation and that thing is going to play out and I am going to tell you one thing have you ever wondered that friend these prices in some projects are so much, the ones next to it are so much, what is it that is kept there, this is a question that arises  No, take everyone to CGHS society for ₹9000. You are the same Golf Course Road. People of Golf Course Road say 18000. What thing's price is 18000?  Brother what does average price have any meaning, only average has some meaning, Okay dear was there a 6 feet bed who go round in nala vivas running and stream of water, do n't bother about average because now affordable housing has also come, so its  The average area of ​​pakadoge is somewhere around 4200 carpet area, so its average is equal to the average of all but it will be below, so what you have, now we have increased the money for that thing so that people of that level can come from it.  And it is the same brand and if low level people sell it in the city then its price will increase a lot, it is not like that there are diamonds and pearls, diamonds and pearls are the people there, those who understand themselves have the capability to earn money  I am telling him that now in telling this thing without being classed, starting from the diplomatic end also, but the clarity is being given through the classes, our country does not have so many classes, now there should be a separate discussion. and in every country it is like this you are a  When we sit in the plane, the business class SIM card has diamonds and pearls studded in it, its cost is so high or I do n't know what you get in the first class seat, brother, they give some juice for food and drink  But does that ticket price become 6 times, why has it been made so that if Shahrukh Khan ji does not want to sit there, then maybe I am not taking an example, even Shahrukh Khan ji does not have any problem with you sitting there but for example Basically, I am sitting here, I give my example, it is very difficult, I do n't want to sit, I want to sit in economy class so that I can network there or feel good about myself, whatever the reason is, money is the reason for which something is made  di so this project also does n't fit in that thing so tell me this in your mental back is a Rolls-Royce, does it have a lot of diamonds and pearls these three and what is this, oh brother it is a brand so it is a car because if you Tell me, what is a phone, it is a thing for talking, what is a car, it is a place to go from one place to another, what is a house  It is a gold thing, if you do it this way then everything should have a price, the price of one thing is related to shoes, if you want to become Hussain Bolt then if you want to win the gold medal then brother you cannot wear expensive shoes, buy sports shoes for Rs. 18,000 Shoes for 12 rupees for 2000, hold the shoes, hold the clothes, hold the glasses, this is the frame, I do n't know what the rates are, as it gets expensive, it will become lighter, if you don't feel it, then who will say now, otherwise it will be 500  You can take it for Rs. 500 also, it comes for Rs.5000 also, it comes for Rs.15000 also, it also comes for Rs.30 also, it is for 50 years even, the one worth Rs.50000, there is no gold or diamond in it also but it is ours, just like that watch shows time, so it is Rs.500  A watch worth Rs 10 lakh shows the time and a watch worth Rs 10 lakh shows the time of the person wearing it. So, this difference in rates is showing the time and status of the people living there. You go in one go, how much have I defined it?  What will people get is one van, one three sleeper class and general bogie and the pricing will be like this, this project will exist for Rs 20,000, Rs 10,000 or Rs 5,000 at one place, within 500 meters as per your wish, it will also appreciate it and it can also do this Yes, do this more because there are less such ones and people want to go to such ones more, this can also be a reason, there is a Godrej project in RKS Chembur where earlier there used to be RK studio of Raj Kapoor ji, you should rate there according to the carpet  It is sold in Mumbai and the rate is told accordingly and touching that, the old CGHS Society of that time, they trade for 25 thousand, 28 thousand, less than half of that, I tell you what's the big deal in this, this is the rate, so that the 28000 ones  People are coming there and taking bath, so in the cities with 60000 population, whatever kind of system is there, the market has to accept that and where this  There are ₹9000 square feet societies, these too will break one day and it may be the demand of that time, if India grows then they will be launching there at ₹50000 per square feet, for the old investor it will be like that, he will cap himself.  Yes, the rate of New Gurgaon will be lower than the Golf Course section. Yes, this is a true fact, but the average price of Golf Course Extension is different from the product, so it is going up to 14000, it is going up to 16, it is going up to 18.  There is also a small thing coming on 20, a big thing coming, an expensive thing coming, so every kind of thing is coming there, every kind of thing is coming there, so there is an advantage in talking project specific Which animal does it belong to, what kind of gents will it come with, what kind of specifications are there, as things become very expensive, even in five star hotels that coffee is available for Rs. 600, at home that  It costs ₹10 in a three star hotel sir, it costs ₹50 to ₹100 if you go to a normal place then it costs 150-200 and why is there a difference in the rate, does the coffee become four times more matter, it is support, I am coming here and what are you getting  There it is not only about date cup and that coffee is okay because they say that coffee will taste good but it also makes a difference whether it is date or not and the people who pay for this fillings will further divide it into segments  And if it does not get the supply of the segment, then its rate will go up even more. So it is not the case that the stock which is already trading at a P ratio of 65-70 and has always been trading, will not become more expensive. Look at The Mart, it has always been  It has been the same with Asian paints, if you look at it, this is always without a case. Okay, whenever my Konkan makes a video, it always rings a bell back and forth, you also become like that, okay.
