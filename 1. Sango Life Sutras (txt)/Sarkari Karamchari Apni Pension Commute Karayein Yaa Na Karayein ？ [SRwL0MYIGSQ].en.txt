Hello friends, today's topic is very important for government employees. If there is a government employee among your relatives, forward it to him and forward it to each other and forward it through the group because the clarity that I am bringing on this thing is like this  There is no clarity, it is a topic, whether you should comment your pension or you should not comment pension date is this question, I will explain it very well, no calculation will come to mind, no teacher will come from here because a lot has already been written and said on this  And generally it ends with differences, it depends on you, see a good consultant will never leave you aside, then what advice do you give, the question is should this be done or not, so do both, the answer is no, then what is the point of discussing, the answer is only one, so that  The answer will be the same and it will be fun to watch it, you will get clarity and what needs to be done will also be done because people get over this decision, I will tell you very simply, I will tell you well, let's start, first of all, this pension is being given to those employees by the government  In  Those who are from before 2004, the NPS system has started after that, but there are many old ones too and they are retiring. Now there will be two types of retirement in that too, one retirement will be when you retire after completing 60 years.  It is 58 years that many people in the state government retire a little early in different departments of the government system, 54 years, 56 years, if you make a separate retirement then we call it that person is 43, 44 years old so there are two kinds of things, both  I will answer only these questions. I will answer both the questions. First thing is that in this pension, I will take the example of an officer in group B and his group goes below A, but I will take the application. For example, if your basic salary is Rs. 2 lakh  If your basic salary is 2 lakhs, then your pension becomes 1 lakh. 50% of it and its 50000 coma is given by the government and its factor is between 89 and 90.  Very well defends on your future when are you retiring the earlier age you are retiring so you people know I do n't need to get education on this because the people in the government know about this thing but that is it Does it get completed in 15 years? If the person who is late in submitting his pension gets completed in a year, then it is said that we are given pension for 8-30 years and when it is completed, that pension is restored again as it is said in English.  I am 15 years old, so this can be tweeted like a loan. If you understand, then it can be tweeted like a loan. Many people do a lot of calculations on this and make their mind go crazy, but I am saying that I will do that.  Not only this, I will tell you in simple terms, the biggest thing you have to look at is that if a person is retiring early and has not committed, then his pension will be higher and if he takes up some small business or job of 4343, then that amount will become taxable which is committed.  The amount is up to Rs 1 crore at the latest  You get close to crores defending on which slab you belong to and how much pension is divided among you, whatever amount is from one to one hundred crores is not taxable, which the government gives in lump sum, so I leave out the non-taxable amount of one crore in lump sum and Instead of that I should take a permit to stop my pension and get tax done on it, this is a thing, the second thing is a very big thing, the biggest thing in life is that you don't even know how many years you will live, a 60 year old person cannot say 100% that he will live till 75 years.  If I want to live, then even a person can live till 95 and even a person who is 44 cannot say that, then why am I bringing this aspect or I am bringing it in this aspect because this money which you get, if something happens to someone then the government will not return the money  I have given you the virtue of 8:30 years and after something happens it becomes a family pension, so how can we take this in which a person has not committed his pension and its amount is deducted in two-four, six months or one, two, three years  the program is done ok so its  Wife will get family pension whose rate is low, now that pension will not be available, once I laughed at my acting, it is caste, okay many times it seems that we will take brick or that, take anything, when you are 60 years old  When I retire, then you should find out the rate of insurance, how much does it cost and will you get to know it automatically and for how many years do you have to do it. This question is being asked because people want complete liquidity after retirement. And give them you and one with date one see I just want you to tell everybody today you will have no status what will you say in English to a person who talks less than ₹1 crore what kind of atrocity am I doing okay when you  Government job is good, the expenses are very less, you think that if I go out then the expenses will be mine, no, it is okay, I am working 100% and the one with 44 will not reduce it, then he will starve, so this is just charity  The charity is that if you do something less then the biggest problem is this  There is a problem of how to dispose of one crore and I am going to give its solution. I am asking this because you do n't know what you can do with one crore. You are fooling me about my ₹1 crore. I don't know, the story will be drowned in it and the story will be gone.  Something will happen, either many people do not know that a relative will ask for it or the child will take it away or some people do not have control over themselves, they know that if I get one crore rupees then I will become a drunkard and will reduce my income. Why do you also know this that I do n't know what will happen to me or someone will take it away from me or I will make up a story, this happens with many people then they say brother someone please give me 1%  People who are in this category are in such extremes that it is a different matter that you do not have control over yourself. Advice, what should you do and what is it? First of all, let us understand the problem that you do not know what is going on with ₹1 crore  Someone wants to tell me to invest in debt mutual funds, buy some stocks, buy some gold  Take some like this, take some there, do some HD there, do this, do this, then put this in the post office, after doing this, even after that it is not completed, if even after that I do not understand what to do, then I say friend, who are you to talk to in this trouble  If you do not give me pension, I do not want to do it, you only have to comment, you don't know about economy, you don't know about inflation, you don't know anything about the Rs. 1 crore that I am getting today, what will be its value after 15 years, whatever I am getting today No, that is yours today, I bill suggest people you do this, I bill give you suggestion, very clear suggestion and you have to make some comment in it, non commitment will be absolutely foolish on your part, I will tell you that, if you live in a big city  Do you live in a category North India or you are from a small town, I am telling the story in small place control both bananas, if you are living in a big city or North India then you can get in touch with me small property 20-25-30- Can be comfortably purchased for less than Rs 40 lakh I have rental design 527% de bill appraisal capital appreciation they will get minimum 8 to 9 initially then it will gradually decrease and rent will keep increasing if you add both the compound capital appreciation and rental then you will get up to 12 there are such options  You can take that debt, there is liquidity in this, you can buy multiple search properties and if you do not live in a big city and are not from North India and you have to retire late in Jind or you have to retire late in Kaithal then  If you want to retire in Dehradun, then very few people retire there. So if you want to retire here or if you want to retire in a small town, then what you need is a unit or an educational institution nearby. also there is any small piece of land nearest to it you need to buy it in a recognised place called plot and you have to create a sort of system between the rental it is phenomenal again there Also see, you will not get 15% but look at ours, it is within minimum residential, it is two and a half to three, which I have heard, but whenever you go to a small house, you furnish it and do this, it is commercial, you do not want to take commercial  You should not take it at all because the landscape is going to change in the next 5 years and those people who shop change, it is speculated that over a country's story is also not worth taking, you should not take future option at all, we are not in the stock market. So I am a very good trader, I know everything about candlestick, handlestick and bowling. Those people are not my audience. My audience is down to earth, practical people, not show-offs, because when it comes to doing it, your money is not actual. So you can't do that style, it is done in party, cocktail party, party function etc, you know how to put your real show, then no one feels it, you are sitting there to show it off, that's fine, when those crores of rupees come, it won't be felt there. I am telling you about it wherever I can  The practical thing is to accept date because the rate of brick, rate of cement, rate of iron, rate of tile, rate of labour and everything else is increasing, all that is your inflation, what used to happen in structure earlier was that there was no appreciation in structure  Even if you start getting appreciation, they say make something, you do not deposit it, if it is made well then they do not do that either because if today ₹100 is being spent in making something, then it will cost 150 rupees to make it, that too will be your appreciation And you should make it in a proper way, make it well, what should be done on retirement, how should it be done in a better way, how the table is given in the middle of the I Bill Vikas video, so the whole thing cannot be understood in 12-13 minutes because Shakti  You must have many questions and those questions could not have been asked in one line nor could they have been answered in one line, but if you are interested in this video and want to attend government officials and wagons, then it's my ok  If yes then please type W.
