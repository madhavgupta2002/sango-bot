If you keep doing your program, you won't get anything to see, no one will get anything and suddenly it comes.  No, he is not being welcomed with such warmth, he is also showing his attitude, he is not behaving like this and here also in many weddings things go wrong like this, it is getting worse because of this very thing. This is a system of killing cats, the system of varmala was not made in many places because  They are putting it like this, they are putting it like this, I am doing it like this, someone is coming, the boy is doing it like this, he is wearing something on top, then the girl's brother or some relative comes and picks up the girl and says now let us see this  He will not be able to put the garland, why are you doing such things brother, these are just fun and jokes, look at their subconscious, there is competition from there, as to how far to go, how to go up, who knows, it is the union of relationships, it is the heart  It is the union of trust, hey brother, the marriage is taking place, quietly bow your head and get your garland placed, whatever it is, whether it is the boy or the girl, whatever is the system of varmala, I will tell you, if it is not the marriage, if the girl comes, then those mother-in-laws are also trying to tighten them these days So brother, we eat parathas at our place, like this, mom, I am allergic to parathas, I eat artisan bread, now I get panicky, boy, which daughter-in-law is this, which artisan bread is this, I had heard about this being white bread  I had heard of brown bread, we also eat multi green bread, brother, this artisan bread I don't live in Gurgaon, I am so fussy and talk about artisan bread, will come, will have with juice and avocado, so avocado and juice, I will have artisan and will make something superior, now my mother-in-law will say, friend, how will I take this in the pot now  She does not eat protein, if she does not eat it then from where will she prepare it, then there will be some shopping and this happens even at the time of wedding shopping, I am telling it in a very interesting way, even later whatever the mother-in-law likes, the sister will give a choice opposite to that and the mother-in-law will say  I want such sarees with swings, they will go to Chandni Chowk, I don't like this, I like this one, this one gives me allergy, my skin gets spoiled, I want to tell that in the society, I just want to just tell with  These are examples of why the cat has to die why can't the cat live why do you have to kill the cat who told who is killing whose cat today in 2024 why the cat has to be killed  The cat has to be sacrificed why can't we be just genuine why do we have to impress why do we have to control why do we have to speak like this that no brother, in our place it was a custom to pay for the food first but so and so who was Neha would take the name of Neha Rohiti  yes, I am there, please forgive me, I don't take names, you know, Neha had to give us tea, she made the tea in such a way that Rohit's father had to give us tea, something to eat, hey, tell me one thing Friend, a girl has come from outside to your house, when you go to someone's new house, do you know where the rice is, where is the salt, and where are the spice boxes, what is the gas system, where is the lighter, friend, let go of every breath, friend, like this  Why are you doing so much shagan vagans and why have you made a fuss, first meal Bhau's first Karva Chauth, first lodi, first this, first this, do it to her like this, then after that she will tell you again, an attempt is made to consider you like this, boy  by many times and then what happens because the mother in law is  She forgets that brother, she is also a woman, she is also a professional, why are you bringing her, why are you thinking like this about the daughter-in-law, what happens, listen carefully, it is a Delhi wedding, a Gurgaon wedding, you are living a joint family type of life  Nowadays you know girls also do jobs, mostly it is fine and the new crowd is there, new marriages are happening, so when they feel that they cannot go out with the boy, they directly get themselves posted in Bangalore and the boy too  He follows him, don't do this, do n't give him so much force, which is called in our local language, okay force means don't put pressure on him so that he leaves the city, in some cases they are even leaving the country, don't do this, you are trying to kill your cat Your boy will also go away because of the affair, the girl stays away anyway, don't do this competition, see through it, call it out, what are you, Tritronics, why do you require it, what will you be, because they are staying together, my iconic video son  bahu should not stay  With five reasons, it has got a lot of lakhs of views. Currently, some program of the Government of India is going on in which it has also been nominated for the impact on the society, I don't know whether it will get an award or not, but it has been nominated. Okay, so right now it is like this.  Things also happen nowadays who is making how much impact, okay brother, what do they say about you, she will wear a nighty, she will wake up late, she will wake up in the morning, she will wake up early, why do you have trouble in your life, because she is living with you, why is she staying with you half the time, you will end up mother-in-law  Yes, I am addressing everyone, you will end up making food for your sister because you do cook for your husband, you used to cook for your son, now the daughter-in-law has also gone to work, the son has also gone, now that your husband  Yes, I am addressing my mother-in-law, she has to eat at 7:00 or 7:30 because she has to sleep and this couple who have gone out, are coming back from work at that time, so the food will definitely be prepared before that. Now you will make it for your husband as well as for yourself and your son as well  If you make two rotis then you will feel that why should I be hostile towards my daughter-in-law that daughter-in-law, you make two rotis yourself and you will make two rotis for your sister too, then you will start crying that friend what has happened, I am serving you in reverse  Yes, if this feeling will also come, then brother, they can come and go as much as they want, we will live on rent next door, if you are not rich enough to afford two, then tell them to live next door, children, live on rent, whatever they want to eat, whatever they want to wear, whatever they want to get up,  If you want to do something, do it for me, don't do any favor for me, it's okay because the matter is that I do n't know what kind of service the new father-in-law wants you to do, nowadays kids do n't get service done themselves or from you, then that is a big achievement, smart  So parents who are following my advice but who feel that we will kill the cat because ours was killed and now we know how to do it and it will be done like this then brother no cat is no longer a cat that cat is not that cat From a distance, you look like a lioness, which means you look like a small girl  But she is a lioness, not a cat, and she will not be killed by you, a lioness, so be very very careful in the beginning of the relationship, I will give you a simple guideline, if you understand it, as soon as it is the marriage of any couple, whether it is the girl's family or the boy's family,  If it is the girl's family then no one should go to their house for the first year until some good news comes and even after that, eight months are required to go and see. Don't look at the girl's house in the beginning as you are living.  You are living in a situation where they feel that oh I am not able to breathe, I am not getting ragged, okay what is this, I have just said something, the moment you marry your child, the couple should go on roaming around, but what is the problem in Indian society  There are so many toxic marriages going on between the parents that all the entertainment of life is taken by the mother-in-law from the new couple or even then it comes that nowadays there is also competition between the girl's family and the boy's family that we too  you are coming yours and they are coming if you believe  Look, they are living in a different place, the boy's mother has come, if the boy 's parents come, the girl's parents will also come, where is the young couple getting that space, if the boy's parents come, the girl will get angry and if the girl's parents stay longer  Ladka chidga is the truth of life, if anyone feels pain after hearing this then take the pain, but this is the truth, so don't go, your daughter is not worthy of anything, she cannot cook food for her husband, you will go and sit there and then you will make noise  Or will you cook it yourself? You will think that if I cook the food then the son-in-law will be very happy. It is not going to happen. He wants it from his wife or he wants his own arrangement. And if you, the boy's mother, reach there by mistake, then hi hi hi, how are they living, hi hi Hey, you have to teach and tell by acting like this, then you will be in your own world, she doesn't get up at all, then she goes to the office because hers, who knows, they will eat something small, they will eat outside, your proper food should be there  The elderly need a proper diet and food and not just the elderly, even if they get married, they will be 50 years old.  She doesn't even have a mother-in-law, what should I say about the old one, the one who was born in 1973, is 74 years old, she is getting her children married, she had got married on time, had children on time, so her children are 30 years old  What has happened to him because he was born in 23, so he is older than him now but he needs proper food, he needs it, it is not getting prepared there, Tinda Lauki is not getting prepared, I don't know, he eats something, he eats food outside, we get food  No, we don't have food in their house. It seems as if even if I cook, even the vegetables don't come. I also don't think who will take responsibility of the vegetables, the boy will take it, the girl will take it, who will come, it is a big irritation, so I am saying this first  Don't go, you will learn something from them in a year, you will learn it by eating Sugi or Zomato or else you will learn it otherwise, don't go, don't ask, don't call, if the other person needs it then he will come like this for a year Get all the weddings done and India will have a great time for a year  He stops that interaction for 365 days, does n't call, doesn't ask, says if you need anything, if you need help, then take it from me, just tell me like this, then after a year he himself says that many boys and even more girls have a misunderstanding that he doesn't know.  If our parents were not in our life or lived far away, I don't know how happy we would have been. Let those misunderstandings go away. I am not here to create a ruckus in society. Here in families, practically, my aim is always to stay together and the families stay close. Even if you don't live in the same house, live nearby, keep your kitchen separate, live nearby in the same society, on the same floor, above and below in the same tower, if not a tower then a society, if not a society, then the same colony, sector, if not colony, sector, then the same city, this is my way of living  The thought is that there is distance and there is also our system, whoever wants to live in a certain way, then one should not try to kill the cat, this is the message because if an attempt is made to kill the cat then there will be a lot of sorrow and there will never be any happiness in someone's death.  It is possible that if someone literally looks at him negatively, he is not going to be able to control himself today and this is me  I am telling you what has happened in the society, whether it is a boy or a girl, when they go to work, he controls them a lot, one has to remain under his control, in the childhood of the employed people, the parents controlled the children, suddenly once you are married, you become very irritable  It comes to my mind that friend I will remain in control, I will always remain in control, now I will get married, even now I cannot wear clothes, earlier I could not wear clothes because my parents used to say hey you should not wear such clothes because now those covers  The girl is considered as what ever for the parents what ever you say to her son and the girls should always talk about marriage, if not now then go after the marriage, if she says so then the marriage will happen then not now even then, now this control has been handed over first  Parents used to keep the noose fitted tight, which in language is called 'yes', now if they have not come, then rebellion comes from there and it rocks the boat of marriage, such like this, even the boy does not understand, no mummy is right  You are not looking like that, don't look like that, hey, wear it friend, you are married, eat whatever you want, wear whatever you want  Wear it, these four-five days are for fun and enjoyment, take it for yourself, after that if it is fine then live happily, don't kill the cat, live comfortably as per the wish of the person and give him some space, if you ever feel like coming and going on the festival  If you have to do it then do it otherwise there is a lot of bankruptcies left to celebrate, avoid the first [ __ ], the first Diwali, the first New Year, the first Holi, start with the second one, in this affair of the first one my mother-in-law creates so much trouble that it feels like I do n't know what to do  Which are the royal families and the normal middle class Indian middle class run of the mill normal boy who thinks to himself friend what were these customs in our house, all the customs are coming out or like this  I did not see anything but okay mom is saying so and he is not able to say that he is not able to ask mom and the girl who has come is thinking that I do not know in which royal family I am married what are their traditions here, this is how it happens then you should have done it like this, leave it  Friend, first leave it, after that it will come on its own, you rag me, I did not enjoy it, and then the girl's mother also starts getting tension, well your mother-in-law did not say anything to you on Karva Chauth, what is that S word  It starts with what Punjabi people say, write in the comment section that that, that, that did not happen to you, well I did not do it like this, I did not give you anything, well not like this, then I told you, well like this, then he is in tension, change the syllabus, hey, mothers of boys.  The syllabus will have to be changed, you will have to be smart, otherwise you will have to cry a lot and everything will go haywire, you will have to tweak the syllabus a bit, things will come automatically, remember in life, if you ever go to a desert or a beach, the sand will rise up  Take it like this, when you tighten the sand in your fist, when you pick up the sand and tighten it in your fist, it will start coming out from here, it will start coming out from here, you will control it like this, the more you control it, the more it will run away and when you open your fist, it will do something like this  it will not fall, it will remain the same, not even a particle will fall, it will remain the same in life  Whatever parents, mother-in-law and father-in-law are sitting here, I am telling them, do it like this brother, they are not going anywhere, they are birds of the ship, the children will come back there only, they are not going anywhere, it seems they have gone, let them go, they will come back only, but you have given them the information  If he throws a stone then you will have to run away, he will have to drink water and then run away, then he will have money, after drinking water you will throw a stone again, then he will run away, let him go, tell him to live as he wants, do whatever you want, we don't need to tell him, did you get food?  I did not find your sister, she takes care of you well, she washes your underwear and vest, she gives you the tools to wash your clothes, I had told you earlier itself that we will have to teach the work to our boys and we will also have to tell the girls that brother listen, you should do what you can do.  So it is okay, then proper upbringing in the society is becoming competitive in the opposite way, it is happening with the feeling of killing the cat, it is not happening with the feeling of self-reliance, girls should also know how to earn money, boys should know how to do household chores  One should also know how to do household chores and both of them should know because neither of them has the capability to do so, this word is big  He hits that he gets all the work done by someone else in an auto. Further, the maids, cooks, drivers will become so expensive, the rent itself will become so costly, the real estate will become so expensive that the new generation will not be able to afford it and will not be able to afford it.  If they get it then who will do this work, if you keep them in your setup then you will feel that we should do it in our old age, we will not do this, what all will they do, it does not happen, we will do it in our own house, on rent somewhere, if you will not do it in yours then this was the message, please share  Like and subscribe to the channel.
