The gap between vegetarian and non-veg is increasing and there is a huge gap between vegetarian and non-veg  The gap between veg and non veg is increasing, it has reached unbelievable levels, can anyone tell me that in premium projects in Gurgaon, there is no ultra luxury in luxury etc. If I am saying such things, then a different system becomes a two- level job.  You know, in AC-2 level, in the same sector, there is this My One brand good place and this one next to it, can you write in the comment section how much difference has come, then I will tell you by giving an example how much difference has come  And it will not be of any use to discuss what is justified and what is justified because in India things are based on perception. Yes, in India things can be explained on the basis of some logic, at that level that logic always gets set in because when we understand the things  It comes to him, he understands it very quickly, every [ __ ] comes, it doesn't come for some time but when you do this then every difference comes sour like India Test 69 we were starting from People's Beach so some India  Stage-4 never came back, so people called them in July  I stopped growing up and thought that my luck was good, even today if I ask you in the audience what is the difference in technology and ask its terms and that zone which is possible, how many admissions are there and what is the difference in technology, how much money was spent in it to many people  You might not know, but people say gr8 even if it is a thing worth 10 lakhs then we wait for eight months, then when you come with a car worth â‚¹ 1000000, how much does it cost, there is an increase of 10 lakhs, though three, four or five lucky ones also come and 20 lakhs  Or the average comes and assuming 10 lakhs, the mail of my audience thinks about middle class products, so when you are ready to spend 8-10 months on a car worth 8-10 lakhs, then can't you update for a thing worth 2.5 crores That you have to think about it, okay, do you know the difference and those who know the difference of non-government, you can tell me in the comment section how much is the uprising in the market from the dark times when the infant tables and traditions were at par in the launch  Okay, now that difference has been increasing like this, now what is this difference in percentage in the condom market, if you can tell by looking at an example, then you are brilliant students, okay, and if you can explain it in the same way, then it is very good, I will explain this in the upcoming videos.
